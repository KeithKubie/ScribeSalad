Building Healthy Technology

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:45.101
your cell phones.  Our session 
will begin soon.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.866
   At this time, please find 
your seat.  Our session will 

00:25:03.867 --> 00:25:05.867
begin soon.

00:28:42.401 --> 00:28:44.401

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:49.025
   &gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Well, 
good 

00:28:51.133 --> 00:28:53.568
morning, and welcome to Building
Healthy Technology, an 

00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:55.569
inspiration session on digital 
well-being.

00:28:57.886 --> 00:29:00.545
I'm Maggie Jackson, I'm the 
author of "Distracted," a book 

00:29:00.546 --> 00:29:02.546
about the 

00:29:04.835 --> 00:29:06.540
fragmentation of focus and the 
ways we can recapture our 

00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:09.385
attention today.  I'm a 
journalist by background and a 

00:29:12.235 --> 00:29:14.235
former Boston Globe columnist.  

00:29:15.507 --> 00:29:17.357
Joining me on my left is Adam 
Alter, an NYU professor in 

00:29:17.358 --> 00:29:19.416
marketing and psychology, and 
writes widely for the 

00:29:22.457 --> 00:29:24.457
media and has written most 
recently a 

00:29:26.566 --> 00:29:29.215
book called "Irresistible" about
behavioral addiction in our 

00:29:29.216 --> 00:29:31.216
society and tech influences.  

00:29:32.472 --> 00:29:34.472
As well, joining me on the stage
is Glen Murphy.

00:29:37.146 --> 00:29:39.146
He is the director of UX Chrome,
and 

00:29:40.194 --> 00:29:42.194
he has been a creative force 
behind many 

00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:46.669
android products, from Android 
Auto and 

00:29:47.725 --> 00:29:49.599
TV, and behind a creative force 
in the digital well-being front 

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.239
of which you've heard quite a 
bit this week.  So we'll talk 

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.334
about that.  
   And I'd also like to thank 

00:29:56.335 --> 00:29:59.400
Helen Hutton and Nancy Baker for
putting this together so well.  

00:30:03.078 --> 00:30:05.518
Just for a minute, let's start 
by stepping back in history, 

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:07.519
stepping back in time.

00:30:11.062 --> 00:30:13.313
The year is 1905, and picture 
Freud.  Yes, Freud.

00:30:18.771 --> 00:30:23.194
Standing on the Piazza Colona in
Rome in a warm evening.  He's 

00:30:23.195 --> 00:30:26.047
watching a lantern slide show, a
medley of short films and still 

00:30:27.683 --> 00:30:29.921
photographs projected on the 
roofs of the houses in the 

00:30:29.922 --> 00:30:32.772
Piazza.  
   And as he writes later, every

00:30:32.773 --> 00:30:37.719
time he tries to turn away, a 
certain tension in the crowd 

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.720
keeps him riveted.

00:30:42.647 --> 00:30:44.277
This great thinker, far from 
home, was entranced by the 

00:30:44.278 --> 00:30:47.570
media, the precursors of the 
media that envelope us today.  

00:30:47.571 --> 00:30:49.571
He was conflicted.  And so are 
we.  

00:30:52.862 --> 00:30:55.558
Fast-forward to our century, and
we're wrestling still with the 

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:57.559
promise 

00:30:58.948 --> 00:31:00.948
and the draw-backs of 
technology.  

00:31:02.609 --> 00:31:03.833
So, today we're going to talk a 
little bit about some of the 

00:31:03.834 --> 00:31:08.371
challenges, some of the ways in 
which we can harness the 

00:31:08.372 --> 00:31:11.229
benefits, and also begin to take
more responsibility, all of us 

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.717
as makers, developers, citizens,
and parents for what we're 

00:31:15.718 --> 00:31:17.950
creating.  
   So to start, of course, it's 

00:31:17.951 --> 00:31:19.951
really 

00:31:22.662 --> 00:31:24.494
important to understand the 
landscape, understand what we're

00:31:24.495 --> 00:31:29.606
experiencing.  So, Adam, maybe 
we'll start with you to talk a 

00:31:29.607 --> 00:31:31.607
little bit about the history 

00:31:33.081 --> 00:31:35.081
of technology, and for 
millennia, people 

00:31:36.366 --> 00:31:38.614
have been associating new 
technologies with something 

00:31:38.615 --> 00:31:41.666
fearful, something challenging. 
You know, ever since Plato 

00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:43.667
complained 

00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:48.015
that, you know, the written word
would undermine our memories 

00:31:48.016 --> 00:31:50.016
that were so important in oral 
culture.  

00:31:51.903 --> 00:31:55.174
So, how serious are the problems
of our time?  Why should we be 

00:31:55.175 --> 00:31:56.595
paying attention?  
   &gt;&gt; ADAM ALTER:  Well, if you 

00:31:56.596 --> 00:32:00.287
think of that evolution, human 
evolution, things that are novel

00:32:00.288 --> 00:32:03.342
are obviously very scary because
we haven't yet tested them out. 

00:32:03.343 --> 00:32:04.964
We don't know if they're there 
to help us, hurt us, or if 

00:32:04.965 --> 00:32:08.863
they're neutral.  And so any 
time something new comes along, 

00:32:08.864 --> 00:32:10.287
there's an instinct of panic in 
some sense, and that's where we 

00:32:10.288 --> 00:32:12.576
are here again.  And we've had 
that all through a time.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.284
In the 20th century, it was TV 
and pinball machines and video 

00:32:17.285 --> 00:32:18.923
games.  
   One of the questions people 

00:32:18.924 --> 00:32:23.017
ask all the time, I think quite 
validly is, is this different?  

00:32:23.018 --> 00:32:24.444
Are we talking about something 
different now in the last ten or

00:32:24.445 --> 00:32:27.694
15 years, or is this just the 
latest moral panic that we're 

00:32:27.695 --> 00:32:29.762
all dealing with?  
   I think there are some things

00:32:29.763 --> 00:32:33.217
that make this different.  I 
think for sheer scope, we're 

00:32:33.218 --> 00:32:38.309
talking about experiences that 
billions of us enjoy, or 

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.310
sometimes don't enjoy.  You 
know, for hours and hours and 

00:32:40.801 --> 00:32:43.039
hours of the day.  So the 
average American spends -- the 

00:32:44.906 --> 00:32:46.331
average American adult spends 
four hours every day glued to a 

00:32:46.332 --> 00:32:49.001
phone screen.  So that's taking 
up a huge amount of the waking 

00:32:49.002 --> 00:32:51.848
day.  So we should understand 
that I think quite well.  

00:32:53.921 --> 00:32:56.171
Another thing that's different, 
I think, is that if you think 

00:32:56.172 --> 00:32:58.172
about these past technologies, 
we've left most of them at home.

00:33:00.656 --> 00:33:01.870
So even if you watched a lot of 
TV, that was bound to a 

00:33:01.871 --> 00:33:03.871
particular place.

00:33:04.952 --> 00:33:07.197
But now we wear our devices.  
And so, if you ask people -- if 

00:33:07.198 --> 00:33:10.452
you ask, again, adults in the 
developed world how much time do

00:33:10.453 --> 00:33:12.453
you spend with 

00:33:13.514 --> 00:33:15.147
your phone, 75% of adults will 
say that 24 hours a day, they 

00:33:15.148 --> 00:33:19.434
can reach their phones without 
having to move their feet, which

00:33:19.435 --> 00:33:21.889
is not hugely surprising, but it
suggests there's something a bit

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.813
different about what we're 
experience experiencing now.  

00:33:25.814 --> 00:33:27.450
It's not the pinball machine at 
the arcade.  It's the phone 

00:33:27.451 --> 00:33:29.451
that's almost a part of you, an 
extension of you.  

00:33:30.358 --> 00:33:31.181
So I think there are a number of
features that make this 

00:33:31.182 --> 00:33:35.047
different.  We're also much more
sophisticated in developing 

00:33:35.048 --> 00:33:36.466
technologies than we ever were. 
We understand human psychology 

00:33:36.467 --> 00:33:40.391
better.  As a psychologist who's
consulted on a number of these 

00:33:40.392 --> 00:33:42.392
projects, I know how much we 
know, how much we understand 

00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:45.909
about what drives humans.  So I 
think there are some features 

00:33:46.383 --> 00:33:48.005
that make this a bit different 
from what we've experienced in 

00:33:48.006 --> 00:33:51.116
the past.  
   &gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Right.  

00:33:51.117 --> 00:33:53.974
The degree of penetration, the 
fact that we're inhabiting this,

00:33:53.975 --> 00:33:57.877
it's total.  It's total.  As 
well as the rapid change.  I 

00:33:57.878 --> 00:33:59.878
think that's a really important 
point.  

00:34:01.996 --> 00:34:03.839
So, Glen, in order to, you know,
come out with all of the new 

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.507
changes, you have to keep your 
finger on the pulse.  Tell us a 

00:34:07.508 --> 00:34:09.744
little bit about the research 
that, for instance, has gone 

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.380
into the announcements this week
related to digital well-being.

00:34:17.691 --> 00:34:19.691
You know, are people feeling 
helpless 

00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:22.588
in their devices, or empowered, 
or both?  

00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:24.589
&gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  It's a really 
exciting time for us.

00:34:26.959 --> 00:34:28.180
You probably saw them talk about
fear of missing out and the joy 

00:34:28.181 --> 00:34:30.479
of missing out.  The joy of 
missing out, the title of 

00:34:33.558 --> 00:34:35.189
the research that we had done.  
It was really interesting, we 

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:39.065
went out, we saw how people 
engaged with technology in the 

00:34:39.066 --> 00:34:41.066
world, and we saw, you know, 
many of the things that we see, 

00:34:43.808 --> 00:34:45.225
which is sort of once your head 
is down in the phone, it's sort 

00:34:45.226 --> 00:34:47.679
of very easy to stay there.  
There are many things, many 

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.680
exciting things in there that 
keep you in there.  

00:34:50.549 --> 00:34:52.787
But I think the other part that 
we saw that was really 

00:34:52.788 --> 00:34:56.249
interesting was just how social 
factors became a large part of 

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.250
this.

00:35:02.374 --> 00:35:05.256
Unlike TV or even desktop 
computing, which were relatively

00:35:05.257 --> 00:35:09.717
solitary things, a phone is an 
inherently social object.  And 

00:35:09.718 --> 00:35:11.141
so one of the key things that we
saw was that even if there was 

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:14.818
nothing for you to do on your 
phone, you still kept it nearby 

00:35:14.819 --> 00:35:16.859
because there were other people 
who were trying to reach you, 

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.989
and so we all became part of 
this big mesh of humans 

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:23.852
contacting each other, and I 
think that was something that we

00:35:23.853 --> 00:35:25.853
had underestimated in all of 
this, the role 

00:35:29.178 --> 00:35:31.461
of each other in this area.  
   &gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  I think 

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:36.140
-- well, actually, when cell 
phones first came out, I used to

00:35:36.141 --> 00:35:38.197
joke that people should -- who 
are buying them, maybe you 

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.270
haven't heard of Radio Shack, 
but we 

00:35:44.333 --> 00:35:45.954
used to buy phones at Radio 
Shack.  The guy at the store 

00:35:45.955 --> 00:35:47.955
should take you 

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.691
in the back and give you 
counseling, just like the 

00:35:50.692 --> 00:35:52.777
minister might when you get 
married.  Here's what you need 

00:35:52.778 --> 00:35:55.048
to know.  
   So I think -- yeah, that's 

00:35:55.049 --> 00:35:57.049
really important then.  

00:35:59.163 --> 00:36:01.163
What about the emotional factors
related to these feedback loops?

00:36:02.439 --> 00:36:04.439
Can you just elaborate a little 
bit 

00:36:05.918 --> 00:36:07.568
about -- because it's really 
complex, and we are right in the

00:36:07.569 --> 00:36:11.661
middle of it, and it reminds me 
also of books.  You know, when 

00:36:11.662 --> 00:36:14.552
you're reading a book, the 
content is where your attention 

00:36:14.553 --> 00:36:21.100
lies.  But there is a technology
around it that affects you.  

00:36:21.101 --> 00:36:23.101
It's a lot less static than 
people think.  

00:36:23.952 --> 00:36:26.429
So, you know, what are we not 
aware of in terms of our 

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.430
emotional responses?

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.051
And were you surprised at the 
myriad of responses that people 

00:36:34.052 --> 00:36:36.497
had?  
   &gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  Yeah.  This 

00:36:36.498 --> 00:36:37.942
whole space is, like, really 
interesting, because there are 

00:36:37.943 --> 00:36:39.943
some deeply individual responses
in here.

00:36:43.433 --> 00:36:46.091
I think it's really hard to draw
broad generalizations.  But the 

00:36:46.092 --> 00:36:48.534
feedback thing I think is really
interesting.  Adam talks about 

00:36:48.535 --> 00:36:50.535
this a lot, actually, 

00:36:51.827 --> 00:36:53.658
in your book, about how we use 
these devices, and they're 

00:36:53.659 --> 00:36:57.318
immensely useful to us.  They've
replaced maps, they've replaced 

00:36:57.319 --> 00:36:59.319
clocks, they've replaced writing
letters, they've replaced all of

00:37:01.401 --> 00:37:03.401
these things, and you do those 
actions, 

00:37:05.266 --> 00:37:06.903
and you feel good, they're 
performing an essential utility 

00:37:06.904 --> 00:37:08.533
in your life.  
   But then it's sort of very 

00:37:08.534 --> 00:37:13.643
easy for those interactions to 
then bleed into other behaviors 

00:37:13.644 --> 00:37:15.644
that are maybe less useful.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.117
Or maybe they're entertaining, 
and you can kind of keep going 

00:37:18.118 --> 00:37:20.182
because there's this feedback 
loop of oh, just one more thing.

00:37:22.453 --> 00:37:24.453
And so that's why we think about
how a 

00:37:27.768 --> 00:37:30.611
lot of that is very invisible to
the user.  I think you've talked

00:37:30.612 --> 00:37:33.864
elsewhere about how sometimes 
our own use of technology can be

00:37:33.865 --> 00:37:36.118
very invisible to us.  
   And so a key thing for us is 

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:39.566
how we can provide awareness to 
people.  I don't think it's a 

00:37:39.567 --> 00:37:41.567
total number of 

00:37:43.664 --> 00:37:45.899
hours thing, or that's a good 
indicator.  It's how you felt 

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.982
about that time.  I think off we
find when we show people how 

00:37:49.983 --> 00:37:52.297
much they were actually 
engaging, that they're often 

00:37:52.298 --> 00:37:54.766
surprised, and I think that's a 
really interesting component.  

00:37:54.767 --> 00:37:56.785
   &gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Yeah.  
   &gt;&gt; ADAM ALTER:  It's also 

00:37:56.786 --> 00:37:58.846
interesting there are sort of 
scripts that different people 

00:37:58.847 --> 00:38:02.510
follow.  I know I have one, when
I open my phone, there's a 

00:38:02.511 --> 00:38:05.999
certain set of apps, and I'll go
in this loop back to the same 

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.827
one again, and then I'll start, 
I'll go through five or six of 

00:38:07.828 --> 00:38:11.960
them and go back.  You get into 
a sort of lulled sense of calm 

00:38:11.961 --> 00:38:15.874
when you do that.  And I think 
that's a really big part of 

00:38:15.875 --> 00:38:17.562
driving you to keep engaging you
over and over again.  

00:38:17.563 --> 00:38:19.563
&gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Yeah.

00:38:22.893 --> 00:38:24.114
Backstage, we were talking about
the auto maticity of the human 

00:38:24.115 --> 00:38:27.198
being in being a crucial factor 
in what we do.  It underlays 

00:38:27.199 --> 00:38:29.230
expertise.  We have to do things
without really thinking about 

00:38:29.231 --> 00:38:33.177
them.  On the other hand, we 
have to be aware.  You know, we 

00:38:33.178 --> 00:38:36.892
evolve to be as reflective as we
did to be automatic.  And that's

00:38:36.893 --> 00:38:38.893
really important.

00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:44.898
maticity of the human being in 
being a crucial factor in what 

00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:44.831
we do.  It underlays expertise. 
We have to do things without 

00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:44.898
really thinking about them.  On 
the other hand, we have to be 

00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:44.965
aware.  You know, we evolve to 
be as reflective as we did to be

00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:42.765
automatic.  And that's really 
important.  

00:38:43.008 --> 00:38:44.850
So, we're kind of learning as we
go and we have these conflicted 

00:38:44.851 --> 00:38:46.851
senses, and I think we don't 
have the option to get it wrong.

00:38:48.114 --> 00:38:49.928
Honestly, I think we need to 
have technology and humanity 

00:38:49.929 --> 00:38:54.864
come together in better ways to 
make us more compassionate, 

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:56.865
better discerning thinkers.  

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.330
So, let's turn to the crucial 
first steps.

00:39:02.223 --> 00:39:03.276
Again, Glen, maybe you can kick 
it off by talking about the 

00:39:03.277 --> 00:39:05.277
android 

00:39:06.287 --> 00:39:09.242
announcementAndroid 
announcements.  I thought it was

00:39:09.243 --> 00:39:11.714
interesting that some key words 
you mentioned in our preliminary

00:39:11.715 --> 00:39:13.353
talks were control and 
awareness.  You mentioned 

00:39:13.354 --> 00:39:15.354
awareness.

00:39:17.225 --> 00:39:19.867
But how are some of the, you 
know, wind-down and shush going 

00:39:19.868 --> 00:39:22.910
to give people more control?  
And do you have a sense that how

00:39:24.542 --> 00:39:26.173
effective will this be, or is it
a question mark?  

00:39:26.174 --> 00:39:28.174
&gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  Yeah.

00:39:31.662 --> 00:39:33.288
So, the announcements that we 
announced the other day were 

00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:37.210
around awareness and control, 
giving people visibility into 

00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:40.080
the -- what they're actually 
doing.  So they can be aware of 

00:39:40.081 --> 00:39:44.160
what's happening.  And then 
giving them the tools to be able

00:39:44.161 --> 00:39:46.597
to change that behavior if they 
so choose.  And I think it's 

00:39:46.598 --> 00:39:49.921
really been interesting for us 
as we've approached this space 

00:39:49.922 --> 00:39:52.583
and thinking about the right 
ways to handle the 

00:39:52.584 --> 00:39:56.263
responsibility that we have.  In
some ways, we've been thinking 

00:39:59.558 --> 00:40:01.588
about where should that 
regulation lie, should it be 

00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:03.589
technologically regulated?  And 
we sort of came down to many of 

00:40:04.659 --> 00:40:06.659
these things start with 
self-regulation.

00:40:07.958 --> 00:40:10.199
I think in many ways, that 
feeling of control is really 

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.900
important to people, and so we 
haven't provided that in the 

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.964
platform historically.  There 
are little bits here and there, 

00:40:18.388 --> 00:40:20.212
but we want to take that further
and give people that feeling of 

00:40:20.213 --> 00:40:23.676
awareness and control, so that 
as people are having these 

00:40:23.677 --> 00:40:25.324
feelings about using their 
phones, they have the ability to

00:40:25.325 --> 00:40:28.830
change how they're using it.  
   And to your question about 

00:40:28.831 --> 00:40:31.295
whether all of these things will
work, I think 

00:40:34.353 --> 00:40:36.385
this is an ongoing thing.  We 
were talking backstage about how

00:40:38.632 --> 00:40:41.272
many of the things that we all 
use in our life, like to-do 

00:40:41.273 --> 00:40:43.273
lists and other things, often 
they're effective for some 

00:40:44.548 --> 00:40:46.548
amount of time, and then we kind
of 

00:40:47.848 --> 00:40:50.535
adapt, and then we sort of find 
other ways to do things.  And so

00:40:50.536 --> 00:40:52.569
I expect this to be a 
long-running effort for us as we

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.570
learn.

00:40:56.451 --> 00:40:57.679
It might be that we encounter 
sort of different cultures that 

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.328
have different attitudes towards
the phone.  

00:41:01.143 --> 00:41:03.143
&gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Yes.

00:41:04.669 --> 00:41:05.480
.  
   &gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  And dealing 

00:41:05.481 --> 00:41:08.566
with that is really interesting.
Even going back to the 

00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:11.829
pre-smartphone era, there were 
many places where the attitude 

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.076
of dealing with a ringing phone 
was very different.  In some 

00:41:14.077 --> 00:41:16.077
places, you always had to answer
it regardless of what you were 

00:41:16.966 --> 00:41:18.966
doing, and others, it was okay 
to let it ring out.  

00:41:20.465 --> 00:41:22.292
And so that sort of 
responsibility of respecting the

00:41:22.293 --> 00:41:24.293
cultural norms and helping 
people think about those 

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:27.604
cultural norms is sort of where 
we're at.  

00:41:27.605 --> 00:41:29.442
&gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Yeah.  I 
used to think about attention, 

00:41:29.443 --> 00:41:31.443
which 

00:41:32.461 --> 00:41:35.361
is a multi-faceted -- scientists
used to ask 

00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:40.897
me a trick question of, what 
kind of attention do you mean?  

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:42.898
It's a messy, big thing.

00:41:44.179 --> 00:41:45.392
I think of it now as arrows and 
one's quiver.  You can use 

00:41:45.393 --> 00:41:48.902
focus.  You can use awareness.  
You can use executive attention.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.409
But there are tools, just as 
perhaps these tools.  And I 

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.410
think that your announcements 

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.860
are a very, very big deal.

00:42:00.702 --> 00:42:02.702
I do have to say that -- I mean,
the 

00:42:05.892 --> 00:42:08.739
mantra or the overarching 
societal push has been towards 

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.193
seamlessness.  I mean, it's been
an unbroken thing.

00:42:15.038 --> 00:42:17.038
You must engage

00:42:18.273 --> 00:42:20.701
, or it's beneficial to engage. 
   To break that at all is 

00:42:20.702 --> 00:42:26.818
really momentous, and I think 
that's a huge step forward.  As 

00:42:26.819 --> 00:42:28.876
a very critical person about 
technology, I think it's a big 

00:42:28.877 --> 00:42:31.518
step forward.  
   &gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  Sorry, just 

00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:35.499
on that, I think it is really 
something that's interesting for

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.532
everyone here who is a developer
to think about, is that we 

00:42:40.781 --> 00:42:41.807
have been focused on immediacy 
and seamlessness for a long 

00:42:41.808 --> 00:42:43.808
time.  Like, we clearly know 
that that's a 

00:42:47.139 --> 00:42:49.139
key aspect in sort of empowering
people.  

00:42:49.848 --> 00:42:52.094
But thinking about that in a 
social context, creating 

00:42:52.095 --> 00:42:56.176
something that is immediate for 
you as a sender also creates 

00:42:56.177 --> 00:43:01.306
something on the other side for 
the receiver.  And so as we've 

00:43:01.307 --> 00:43:03.307
developed all of these things 
that are very immediate, there's

00:43:03.786 --> 00:43:06.255
another side of the equation 
that we've got to think about.  

00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:08.939
   &gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  And I 
think that's important.  Go 

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.383
ahead.  
   &gt;&gt; ADAM ALTER:  Yeah, I 

00:43:10.384 --> 00:43:12.384
totally agree with that.  I 
think there's always going to be

00:43:14.452 --> 00:43:16.452
this sort of -- not the 
backlash, but 

00:43:17.706 --> 00:43:19.127
the other side of that, the 
quicker the transfer becomes in 

00:43:19.128 --> 00:43:21.773
the one direction, the quicker 
you'll expect to get the reply. 

00:43:21.774 --> 00:43:23.607
   &gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  That's 
right.  

00:43:23.608 --> 00:43:25.608
&gt;&gt; ADAM ALTER:  It's a really 
interesting idea.

00:43:27.496 --> 00:43:29.496
And also, this general idea of 
the 

00:43:31.782 --> 00:43:33.817
role of frictionlessness and the
absence of pain points.  We talk

00:43:33.818 --> 00:43:35.878
about this all the time in 
business.  I'm a professor at a 

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:38.537
business school.  One of the 
mantras in business is make 

00:43:39.354 --> 00:43:41.207
everything as simple as 
possible.  One of the best ways 

00:43:41.208 --> 00:43:45.490
to spend your money is to remove
pain points or friction points. 

00:43:45.491 --> 00:43:47.728
And that makes total sense, 
because that's the best way to 

00:43:47.729 --> 00:43:52.277
ensure not just engagement for 
five minutes, but for sometimes 

00:43:52.278 --> 00:43:54.921
weeks, years, even decades.  
   And I think we've now pushed 

00:43:54.922 --> 00:43:58.782
that to a point where we're 
starting to get the initial 

00:43:58.783 --> 00:44:00.783
backlash.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:03.876
It's great that these new 
introduced tools allow people to

00:44:03.877 --> 00:44:05.877
manage that a little bit.  To 
introduce frictions where they 

00:44:06.323 --> 00:44:07.539
might be valuable.  
   &gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  That's 

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.756
right.  
   &gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Yeah, and

00:44:08.757 --> 00:44:10.757
I also 

00:44:12.835 --> 00:44:14.835
think that it's really important
to 

00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:18.725
think about the idea of 
disconnection, which might be a 

00:44:18.726 --> 00:44:20.726
change in the tempo or 

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.475
the rhythm that allows you to 
gain friction, but to think 

00:44:24.476 --> 00:44:29.406
about that in a way that's not 
just in an on and off way.  So, 

00:44:29.407 --> 00:44:30.849
in other words, maybe we can 
open up the space for these 

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:32.850
questions.

00:44:34.643 --> 00:44:36.924
So, we're not just thinking 
about the little pause points as

00:44:36.925 --> 00:44:39.786
being away from technology, but 
importing that 

00:44:43.246 --> 00:44:45.246
discussion into the very digital
space.  

00:44:45.502 --> 00:44:47.502
And I think about that currently
in 

00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:51.253
relation to the idea of 
technology.  I'm sorry, in 

00:44:51.254 --> 00:44:53.254
relation to the idea of 

00:44:54.267 --> 00:44:57.018
uncertainty.  Uncertainty seems 
like a very 

00:45:01.116 --> 00:45:03.349
negative thing, but, you know, 
just consider one of the 

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:06.198
unintended consequences of 
having answers at your 

00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:10.251
friendships all the time.

00:45:13.208 --> 00:45:20.539
It actually came in the 17th, 
18th, 19th century.  Now there 

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.540
are studies showing hints here 
and there about what it means to

00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:28.549
have that instantanaity.  After 
briefly searching online, people

00:45:33.884 --> 00:45:36.730
seem to be less willing to 
tackle a complex problem later. 

00:45:36.731 --> 00:45:39.425
After briefly searching online, 
they become a little bit more 

00:45:39.426 --> 00:45:42.905
confident, overconfident, I 
mean, about what they know.  

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:44.906
They don't really know what they
know 

00:45:46.166 --> 00:45:49.878
and don't know.  I think these 
are really important hits.  

00:45:51.101 --> 00:45:52.525
And why does this matter?  I 
think it matters because there 

00:45:52.526 --> 00:45:54.958
is that side of ourselves that's
automatic.  The quick mind.

00:45:58.073 --> 00:46:00.073
You know, thrives in the 
routine.

00:46:02.975 --> 00:46:05.611
You know, needs instant answers.
Does really well in the 

00:46:05.612 --> 00:46:07.647
familiar.  
   But did we exist on the 

00:46:07.648 --> 00:46:10.701
steady diet of the neat and the 
packaged and the downloadable 

00:46:10.702 --> 00:46:13.374
and the instant all the time.  
We're beginning to possibly 

00:46:13.375 --> 00:46:17.237
forget to tap into the other 
side of ourselves, the 

00:46:17.238 --> 00:46:20.097
reflective, the questioning, the
skeptical, the so-called slow 

00:46:20.098 --> 00:46:22.787
mind.  
   And in fact, there's a really

00:46:25.442 --> 00:46:27.442
exciting new explosion of 
research into 

00:46:28.517 --> 00:46:30.551
various forms of uncertainty as 
actually connected to good 

00:46:30.552 --> 00:46:32.790
thinking.  
   For instance, and this really

00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:35.439
does, I think, connect to 
technology and well-being.

00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:41.328
But ambivalence in CEOs in a 
crisis is shown to induce them 

00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:43.329
to do deeper 

00:46:45.042 --> 00:46:46.885
research, to look at multiple 
perspectives to include more 

00:46:46.886 --> 00:46:52.380
voices, and to take bolder 
action.  Wow.  And then 

00:46:52.381 --> 00:46:54.818
confusion in students.  Again, 
people have always thought the 

00:46:57.678 --> 00:46:59.678
easy lesson, what's easy to 
digest is better for learning.

00:47:02.207 --> 00:47:04.207
But it's shown in complex 
situations, 

00:47:05.407 --> 00:47:07.407
that confusion

00:47:09.162 --> 00:47:11.162
leads to deeper processing in 
students.  

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.120
So these sort of factors fly 
against 

00:47:17.819 --> 00:47:19.819
a lot of what our society 
values, and I 

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.130
think that, why not develop a 
digital world where the human is

00:47:23.131 --> 00:47:25.571
more inspired to say, oh, I 
don't know.

00:47:28.892 --> 00:47:30.892
Or, you know, to pause and then 
jack 

00:47:32.399 --> 00:47:34.399
into that kind of discerning 
self that they have.  

00:47:35.306 --> 00:47:38.232
And I'll just leave this point 
with one other piece of 

00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:41.276
research, which is that when 
people in the United States are 

00:47:41.277 --> 00:47:43.517
surveyed and asked, what's 
positive about technology?

00:47:47.402 --> 00:47:51.661
60% say speed, instant access to
information, convenience.  But 

00:47:51.662 --> 00:47:53.662
just 10% say a positive about 

00:47:55.191 --> 00:47:57.191
technology is that it promotes 

00:47:59.047 --> 00:48:00.896
knowledge, understanding, and 
curiosity.  

00:48:00.897 --> 00:48:02.897
So, that's a really big 
disconnect.

00:48:04.537 --> 00:48:06.591
And if we could propel our other
side of ourselves into that 

00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:10.876
space with developers' help, I 
think that would be really 

00:48:10.877 --> 00:48:12.909
powerful, and it has everything 
to do with all the hardship, et 

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.910
cetera.  
   &gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  Right.  

00:48:15.407 --> 00:48:17.893
&gt;&gt; ADAM ALTER:  Yeah.  You know,
if you think about the way 

00:48:22.398 --> 00:48:24.398
we stored information, say, in 
the early 

00:48:27.046 --> 00:48:29.046
'80s when I was growing up,

00:48:31.227 --> 00:48:33.474
I probably knew 100 phone 
numbers by heart.  That seemed 

00:48:33.475 --> 00:48:36.969
straightforward.  You knew your 
family members' phone numbers, 

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:40.226
some other ones.  That meant 
certain memory faculties were 

00:48:40.227 --> 00:48:42.061
always being used and they were 
being trained without your even 

00:48:42.062 --> 00:48:44.062
realizing it.

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:46.967
And there's a lot of research 
now, extending what you're 

00:48:46.968 --> 00:48:50.825
suggesting into the concept 
known as hardship inoculation, 

00:48:50.826 --> 00:48:52.291
and it's the idea that if you 
use your mind in certain ways, 

00:48:52.292 --> 00:48:57.408
if you think about things in 
certain ways, in small doses, 

00:48:57.409 --> 00:48:59.447
you become much better prepared 
to deal with major tackles, 

00:49:03.102 --> 00:49:05.102
major problems, major creativity
hurdles, times where you've been

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:07.673
thinking about things in a 
traditional sense are not going 

00:49:07.674 --> 00:49:10.975
to work, how do you get around 
that?  Turns out, having those 

00:49:10.976 --> 00:49:14.230
100 numbers in your head, 
training your memory, that also 

00:49:14.231 --> 00:49:16.231
applies to how we use our minds 
in other ways.  

00:49:16.898 --> 00:49:18.540
So when everything is absolutely
seamless and we don't have to 

00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:21.794
memorize, we don't have to try 
to think about what we're going 

00:49:21.795 --> 00:49:23.795
to do next because we have a 
device that's going to deliver 

00:49:24.499 --> 00:49:26.738
entertainment in the next three 
seconds if that's what we want, 

00:49:26.739 --> 00:49:30.609
I think those faculties wither 
away a little bit, and so it's 

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:33.462
important to have occasions when
we do use them, even in a 

00:49:33.463 --> 00:49:37.526
low-grade sense, just so that 
they're kept alive.  It's like a

00:49:37.527 --> 00:49:39.368
muscle that's withering away.  
So you want to make sure that 

00:49:39.369 --> 00:49:43.441
life isn't so straightforward 
and seamless, that we're always 

00:49:43.442 --> 00:49:45.442
our automatic selves 

00:49:46.696 --> 00:49:48.120
and never our reflective selves.
   &gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  That reminds

00:49:48.121 --> 00:49:50.563
me of a conversation about 
discipline, and how that leads 

00:49:50.564 --> 00:49:53.224
to developments later in 
people's lives.  But I think a 

00:49:53.225 --> 00:49:55.225
key takeaway for me is thinking 
about how, you know, technology 

00:49:58.096 --> 00:49:59.971
in many ways can be used to -- I
think the ideal is, and in many 

00:49:59.972 --> 00:50:01.972
ways it's 

00:50:03.631 --> 00:50:06.698
true, it helps us become more 
active in low areas.  As we make

00:50:06.699 --> 00:50:08.699
some things easier, that allows 
us to devote time and attention 

00:50:09.554 --> 00:50:11.174
to things that matter.  
   I think the danger is that 

00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:15.683
where we don't elevate ourselves
in that way and we can end up 

00:50:15.684 --> 00:50:18.523
becoming purely passive.  There 
are times for that in people's 

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.200
lives.  Like, I was in hospital 
for a week once, and I was very 

00:50:22.201 --> 00:50:24.643
passive for the entire week.  
But I think finding ways that we

00:50:24.644 --> 00:50:29.124
can help people be more active 
in productive ways so they can 

00:50:29.125 --> 00:50:31.157
feel empowered is really key for
all of us.  

00:50:33.639 --> 00:50:36.298
&gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Now, 
mindfulness is a really messy 

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:38.299
word, and everybody and his 
brother has a new definition 

00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:43.671
about that.  But I came across a
definition recently that 

00:50:43.672 --> 00:50:48.407
mindfulness was not giving in to
simplifying things.  You know, 

00:50:48.408 --> 00:50:50.408
to actually dealing with the 

00:50:51.466 --> 00:50:53.466
complexity, and I like that 
idea.  

00:50:56.551 --> 00:50:58.551
So, I think we're exploring how 
to get a grip on this landscape.

00:51:00.417 --> 00:51:02.417
We're also talking about 
well-being, 

00:51:04.256 --> 00:51:05.916
which is a very also messy, 
ill-defined topic.  But we've 

00:51:05.917 --> 00:51:08.789
talked about control.  We're 
talking about awareness.  We're 

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:10.790
talking about hardship and 

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.810
uncertainty

00:51:15.056 --> 00:51:17.056
. 

00:51:18.545 --> 00:51:20.545
These notions plug into 
psychological 

00:51:22.176 --> 00:51:24.176
ideas about well-being.  You 
know, mastery, control, 

00:51:25.337 --> 00:51:27.337
accomplishment, as well as 
social 

00:51:28.798 --> 00:51:30.798
relationships and health.

00:51:33.052 --> 00:51:35.052
Those are really important 
components

00:51:36.144 --> 00:51:38.144
.  

00:51:40.502 --> 00:51:41.924
Digital well-being -- what would
it look like if the United 

00:51:41.925 --> 00:51:43.973
States in five years -- or the 
kingdom of Bhutan came 

00:51:48.408 --> 00:51:50.408
out with the new GDP for

00:51:53.213 --> 00:51:56.462
digital -- DWB.  We can all 
scale mountains there and see 

00:51:56.463 --> 00:51:58.744
what it feels like.  What do you
think it should look like, Glen?

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.043
&gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  That's a super 
deep question.

00:52:08.096 --> 00:52:10.096
I do think that there may not be
a global view.

00:52:13.134 --> 00:52:15.072
There may not be a countrywide 
view.  

00:52:15.073 --> 00:52:17.073
&gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  That's a 
good point.  

00:52:19.418 --> 00:52:21.291
&gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  I think that 
what we grapple with is, what 

00:52:21.292 --> 00:52:24.138
level is there a shared view?  
Is it at the friends level?  Is 

00:52:24.139 --> 00:52:26.139
at the family level?  Is it 
different within different 

00:52:26.823 --> 00:52:29.705
social contexts?  We talk about 
use of technology, and 

00:52:33.157 --> 00:52:34.985
it can meet the exact -- the 
exact same usage can mean 

00:52:34.986 --> 00:52:36.821
different things to different 
people.  It can lead to a 

00:52:36.822 --> 00:52:41.738
different sense of satisfaction.
I think there are key metrics 

00:52:41.739 --> 00:52:43.739
about, 

00:52:45.192 --> 00:52:47.464
like, whether people feel that 
their use of technology was 

00:52:47.465 --> 00:52:49.465
overall beneficial to 

00:52:50.976 --> 00:52:52.409
them, whether they derived value
from it.  And I think it's -- 

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:54.410
you know, there's a lot of 
debate about what that value 

00:52:54.648 --> 00:52:56.695
should be.  
   I think we all impose our own

00:52:56.696 --> 00:53:00.355
values upon the world as we 
think through these things, and 

00:53:00.356 --> 00:53:03.224
I think it is -- you know, for 
some people, the value is you 

00:53:03.664 --> 00:53:06.305
produced something.  For others,
it's you developed social 

00:53:06.506 --> 00:53:08.744
relations.  
   For others, the value can be 

00:53:08.745 --> 00:53:12.825
just pure entertainment, and I 
think that's okay.

00:53:15.897 --> 00:53:18.388
But as long as you are artful 
and intentional about it, and 

00:53:18.389 --> 00:53:21.025
you feel that you're in control 
of it, I think that's what 

00:53:21.026 --> 00:53:22.864
well-being looks like.  
   &gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  That's 

00:53:22.865 --> 00:53:24.865
great.

00:53:26.564 --> 00:53:27.184
Flourishing, what does it look 
like?  

00:53:27.185 --> 00:53:29.441
&gt;&gt; ADAM ALTER:  I think it's 
interesting, because science 

00:53:29.442 --> 00:53:33.299
generally resists subjectivity. 
You want to test.  You can give 

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.740
people a test, there are 12 
items, you answer them, you add 

00:53:34.741 --> 00:53:38.408
up the score, and you can say 
your well-being level is 

00:53:38.409 --> 00:53:43.729
average.  4.2.  Yeah, exactly.  
I think what's interesting for 

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.730
me in studying this topic for a 
while is that 

00:53:48.434 --> 00:53:49.651
people have a really good sense 
when they introspect about how 

00:53:49.652 --> 00:53:52.293
they feel about their 
relationship to technology.  And

00:53:52.294 --> 00:53:54.294
they're all using very different
metrics, as Glen said.  

00:53:55.969 --> 00:53:57.800
So, for some it's about social 
relationships and facilitating 

00:53:57.801 --> 00:54:02.488
that.  That for me is a big 
part.  I live a long way from a 

00:54:02.489 --> 00:54:04.489
big part of 

00:54:05.554 --> 00:54:07.186
my family, and so technology has
allowed me to connect with them 

00:54:07.187 --> 00:54:10.450
in a way that is very, very 
enriching.  So that for me is a 

00:54:10.451 --> 00:54:12.478
key factor.  
   For other people, that might 

00:54:12.479 --> 00:54:15.531
not be a key factor at all.  
Either you live close to the 

00:54:15.532 --> 00:54:19.431
people who are important to you,
or it's more important for you 

00:54:19.432 --> 00:54:22.893
to create or automatize or 
whatever it may be.  So I think 

00:54:22.894 --> 00:54:24.513
there is no one definition, and 
I think it will be hard to find 

00:54:24.514 --> 00:54:28.207
just one definition.  I think 
the best thing we can all do is 

00:54:28.208 --> 00:54:29.422
have a list of questions to ask 
ourselves, and the answers to 

00:54:29.423 --> 00:54:31.423
that I 

00:54:32.713 --> 00:54:34.333
think will illuminate for each 
of us individually whether we've

00:54:34.334 --> 00:54:36.334
got a high or low level of 
digital well-being.  

00:54:38.414 --> 00:54:40.414
And off for me, digital 
well-being 

00:54:41.693 --> 00:54:43.117
comes from augmenting our real 
nondigital experiences.  That's 

00:54:43.118 --> 00:54:46.584
much of it for me.  So I like 
social connection.  I get more 

00:54:46.585 --> 00:54:48.002
of that social connection and 
better social connection with 

00:54:48.003 --> 00:54:53.330
people I couldn't have it with 
using digital tools.  I want to 

00:54:53.331 --> 00:54:55.974
know where I am, I can do it 
better with a map on a device.  

00:54:55.975 --> 00:54:57.975
All of that I think is a really 
big part of it.  

00:54:58.207 --> 00:55:00.851
&gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Right.  And 
there will be tradeoffs.  In New

00:55:00.852 --> 00:55:03.281
York City, it used to be that 
you turned to someone on the 

00:55:03.282 --> 00:55:07.986
street and say, where am I?  I'm
directionally challenged.  

00:55:07.987 --> 00:55:09.221
Sometimes I'm even map 
challenged.  So I turn to human 

00:55:09.222 --> 00:55:12.057
beings and they look at me as 
though I'm crazy.  Where's your 

00:55:12.058 --> 00:55:14.524
phone?  And they don't know 
where they are.  They have no 

00:55:14.525 --> 00:55:16.525
idea where they are.

00:55:17.979 --> 00:55:19.599
So they're really good -- there 
are so many tradeoffs, it will 

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.600
keep us guessing for a long, 
long time.  

00:55:22.448 --> 00:55:24.448
Well, I think that -- I had an 

00:55:25.934 --> 00:55:27.978
interesting situation with a 
friend that I'm still trying to 

00:55:27.979 --> 00:55:29.979
figure out where I send him an 
article, but instead of 

00:55:32.058 --> 00:55:34.721
answering that he had gotten it,
it was something very close to 

00:55:34.722 --> 00:55:37.607
my heart, an article I'd written
about tolerance in today's 

00:55:37.608 --> 00:55:39.608
culture.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.670
But he waited and waited and 
waited, 

00:55:44.997 --> 00:55:46.626
and he was naturally going to, 
you know, read it, and then get 

00:55:46.627 --> 00:55:52.316
back to me.  But I felt like, 
wow, can't you just say you got 

00:55:52.317 --> 00:55:54.771
it?  
   So it was -- I just throw 

00:55:54.772 --> 00:55:58.021
that out there.  There are no 
answers.  But I think that, you 

00:55:58.022 --> 00:56:02.775
know, acknowledgement 
communications -- maybe this 

00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:05.226
will keep us all -- it should 
keep us on our toes in a better 

00:56:05.227 --> 00:56:07.684
and better way.  
   &gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  I think that

00:56:07.685 --> 00:56:11.991
exact case was something that we
saw in our own research that 

00:56:11.992 --> 00:56:15.236
wuss deeply surprising, going 
back to the discussion of 

00:56:15.237 --> 00:56:18.100
technology being a social tool. 
I think one of the aspects of it

00:56:18.101 --> 00:56:20.101
that 

00:56:21.376 --> 00:56:24.263
we found really surprising was 
expectations of how we use it 

00:56:24.264 --> 00:56:26.903
with each other haven't really 
been set.  

00:56:28.736 --> 00:56:30.148
I think with telephones, we kind
of created a culture, like don't

00:56:30.149 --> 00:56:34.037
call after this time, because 
we're probably asleep, it's 

00:56:34.038 --> 00:56:36.674
going to ring in the house.  
   I feel that -- and we saw 

00:56:36.675 --> 00:56:38.675
this, we saw many of those 
situations where 

00:56:41.143 --> 00:56:43.143
someone would send a message and
they 

00:56:44.209 --> 00:56:47.457
would not get a reply, and they 
didn't know what that meant.  

00:56:47.458 --> 00:56:49.458
They didn't know if the other 
person 

00:56:51.561 --> 00:56:54.051
was hurt, or hated them.  We saw
someone who, it took her three 

00:56:58.142 --> 00:57:00.389
hours to get back to her friend,
some amount of time because she 

00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:05.085
was busy, and when they finally 
got in contact, they were -- the

00:57:05.086 --> 00:57:06.711
friend was very upset that it 
had taken three hours to get 

00:57:06.712 --> 00:57:08.947
back to someone.  And I feel 
like that is a sign that we 

00:57:11.028 --> 00:57:13.028
haven't developed quite the -- 
that 

00:57:14.288 --> 00:57:16.743
shared understanding of what our
use of these communication 

00:57:16.744 --> 00:57:19.003
technologies really means.  
   I feel that because we 

00:57:19.004 --> 00:57:21.004
haven't set 

00:57:22.315 --> 00:57:24.132
that, we often pressure 
ourselves into being polite 

00:57:24.133 --> 00:57:27.593
about it.  You know, oh, if 
someone sent me a message, I 

00:57:27.594 --> 00:57:30.069
have to respond right now, 
because otherwise they'll worry.

00:57:32.744 --> 00:57:34.367
And that social dynamic and that
cultural dynamic I think is 

00:57:34.368 --> 00:57:36.214
really interesting for us.  I 
think that's something that 

00:57:36.215 --> 00:57:39.663
we're going to spend a lot of 
time thinking about and how we 

00:57:39.664 --> 00:57:41.664
can help through technology 
nudge things in the right 

00:57:42.785 --> 00:57:44.842
direction.  
   &gt;&gt; ADAM ALTER:  I think with 

00:57:44.843 --> 00:57:48.901
letters and emails, letters you 
only got a certain number, but 

00:57:48.902 --> 00:57:52.177
emails, some people get hundreds
a day.  And so we've tried to 

00:57:52.178 --> 00:57:55.222
apply the grammar that we used 
to determine how to deal 

00:57:55.223 --> 00:57:57.500
socially with letters, which is 
you always reply.  It's the 

00:57:57.501 --> 00:58:01.351
polite thing to do.  To email or
to text.  And that doesn't work 

00:58:01.352 --> 00:58:03.352
if you get a 

00:58:05.785 --> 00:58:09.537
certain number, and you get unin
inundated.  I was having this 

00:58:09.538 --> 00:58:11.538
discussion with my wife.

00:58:13.036 --> 00:58:15.283
If I get 100 emails a day, and I
make an active decision not to 

00:58:15.284 --> 00:58:18.367
reply, that seems really rude, 
but I didn't invite conversation

00:58:18.368 --> 00:58:21.028
with everyone who's emailing, so
you just never know where to 

00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:23.029
draw the line.  It's really 
tricky.  

00:58:23.488 --> 00:58:26.350
I don't know if there is a set 
of rules you could draw up that 

00:58:26.351 --> 00:58:28.351
would allow you to deal with 
that.  

00:58:28.809 --> 00:58:32.083
&gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  Especially the 
different types of emails.  Work

00:58:32.084 --> 00:58:34.084
emails versus emails from your 
parents.

00:58:36.147 --> 00:58:38.147
Different expectation s.  
   &gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  Different

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:40.633
generations have different 
expectations, certainly.  I 

00:58:40.634 --> 00:58:43.492
think that maybe we have to 
welcome that type of 

00:58:43.493 --> 00:58:45.493
uncertainty, while keep working 
at itting because it took a 

00:58:46.998 --> 00:58:48.998
thousand years for the book to 
be 

00:58:51.092 --> 00:58:53.092
hammered out, as the technology 
we know.

00:58:56.162 --> 00:58:58.162
In Shakespeare's time, there was
150 

00:58:59.838 --> 00:59:01.838
different versions of 12 Night. 

00:59:02.916 --> 00:59:04.916
In our remaining minutes, let's 
try 

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:08.170
to look ahead, perhaps.  We've 
guessed a little bit about 

00:59:09.223 --> 00:59:11.459
perhaps what digital well-being 
might be, but what's exciting --

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.460
what's coming 

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:16.831
up in the pipeline, either as a 
sort of a throwing our minds 

00:59:16.832 --> 00:59:21.120
forward to the future in terms 
of technological well-being, 

00:59:21.121 --> 00:59:23.121
digital well-being, or 

00:59:27.211 --> 00:59:28.025
what's really exciting now for 
you, Adam?  

00:59:28.026 --> 00:59:29.258
&gt;&gt; ADAM ALTER:  I'm excited that
there's a conversation now at 

00:59:29.259 --> 00:59:31.532
this level.  The fact that I was
invited to speak 

00:59:35.814 --> 00:59:37.046
here is very exciteing for me, 
because I've been thinking about

00:59:37.047 --> 00:59:39.082
these issues for a while.  I 
used to spend the first ten 

00:59:39.083 --> 00:59:43.355
minutes of any conversation or 
talk convincing people that this

00:59:43.356 --> 00:59:45.408
is even something we should be 
discussing, and we don't have to

00:59:45.409 --> 00:59:47.669
do that anymore.  I think that's
a good first step.  When you 

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:49.089
look people in the eye, we all 
recognize that this is something

00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:51.734
we should be focusing on.  That 
goes all the way up to a big 

00:59:53.175 --> 00:59:54.389
company like Google and all the 
way down to individual people 

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.813
that you meet on the street.  So
I think that's very exciting.  

00:59:55.814 --> 00:59:58.895
   And then the question is, 
where we go from here.

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.599
I think we're really at the 
beginning.  I wish there was 

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.663
better scientific research out 
there that suggested this is 

01:00:06.664 --> 01:00:09.801
what the damage will be.  This 
is what we need to change.  If 

01:00:09.802 --> 01:00:11.014
we don't, this is what will 
happen and this is how we deal 

01:00:11.015 --> 01:00:14.816
with it.  And it turns out I'm 
at a very exciting point, 

01:00:14.817 --> 01:00:16.817
because I'm doing some of this 
research, but I think it's some 

01:00:17.266 --> 01:00:19.339
of the earliest research.  There
isn't a huge amount out there 

01:00:19.543 --> 01:00:21.588
now.  
   So at the bottom of a very 

01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:25.709
tall, steep mountain, and we 
will learn a lot along the way, 

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:27.543
but not much has been done.  
There's a huge amount of 

01:00:27.544 --> 01:00:30.836
low-hanging fruit, and that's 
what I'll be doing with the next

01:00:30.837 --> 01:00:33.099
few years, trying to work out 
what should we be really 

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.149
concerned about, what are we 
talking about, because there is 

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:38.150
some degree of panic, and then 
how do we deal with it, how do 

01:00:39.605 --> 01:00:41.686
we fix it, not just as 
individual consumers who are 

01:00:41.687 --> 01:00:44.364
managing our own use or our 
kids' use, but also how do 

01:00:46.413 --> 01:00:48.428
companies like Google introduce 
new options, new technologies, 

01:00:48.429 --> 01:00:51.695
and obviously that's already 
starting in a very I think 

01:00:51.696 --> 01:00:53.696
encouraging way.  

01:00:56.794 --> 01:00:58.794
&gt;&gt; GLEN MURPHY:  I think what 
I'm 

01:01:00.402 --> 01:01:03.334
sort of excited about is I and I
think many people here, 

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:08.450
like, the reason why we're 
working in this space, is that 

01:01:08.451 --> 01:01:12.310
we want to build experiences 
that people love.  I think just 

01:01:12.311 --> 01:01:15.158
delivering something to someone 
and seeing the joy on their 

01:01:15.159 --> 01:01:18.033
face.  I think that's a deeply 
motivating 

01:01:21.098 --> 01:01:23.098
factor for me, and I'm sure many
of you.

01:01:26.076 --> 01:01:28.946
And I feel like part of this 
discussion is an understanding 

01:01:28.947 --> 01:01:32.857
that we don't quite know yet 
what it means for people to love

01:01:32.858 --> 01:01:36.784
software.  I think historically,
we've sort of measured that very

01:01:36.785 --> 01:01:39.003
costly in terms of, oh, if 
people are spending more time 

01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:42.497
using the thing that I've built,
clearly, that must mean that 

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:46.796
they love it.  And I feel like 
this whole space is about 

01:01:46.797 --> 01:01:50.313
understanding that that's not 
necessarily true.  And so what 

01:01:50.314 --> 01:01:52.148
I'm really excited about is 
finding more of the evidence 

01:01:52.149 --> 01:01:55.868
that you talk about and more of 
those tools and means so that we

01:01:55.869 --> 01:01:57.869
can all go and build more 
lovable software.  

01:01:58.559 --> 01:02:01.195
&gt;&gt; MAGGIE JACKSON:  That's 
great.  And I too would second 

01:02:01.196 --> 01:02:03.196
the idea that 

01:02:05.059 --> 01:02:06.496
it's so exciting having been in 
the space of writing about 

01:02:06.497 --> 01:02:08.497
technology for 

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:11.233
nearly 20 years now as a 
humanist, you know, to see the 

01:02:11.234 --> 01:02:13.234
maturation of 

01:02:14.243 --> 01:02:16.243
discussion

01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:19.375
.  I think that's really 
important, too.  

01:02:20.419 --> 01:02:22.068
I would say that, just to throw 
out, I think that it's a little 

01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:25.572
bit different, but it's part of 
well-being, this issue of 

01:02:25.573 --> 01:02:27.573
tolerance.

01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:32.942
And I have seen some very early 
evidence that in the space of 

01:02:32.943 --> 01:02:34.943
the 

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:38.428
digital world, more can be done 
than one would think to kind of 

01:02:38.429 --> 01:02:40.429
push back on the 

01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:43.490
hatred that's out there online. 

01:02:44.759 --> 01:02:46.759
There's a professor at NYU, 
actually a Ph.D.

01:02:49.679 --> 01:02:52.173
student who's done some amazing 
work in the space of helping 

01:02:52.174 --> 01:02:54.207
people speak up.  And on 
Twitter, he's found that when 

01:02:58.067 --> 01:03:00.067
there's a hater, someone who's 
really 

01:03:01.939 --> 01:03:03.939
espousing horrific things 
online, and 

01:03:06.975 --> 01:03:09.404
then a person from their 
in-group -- so, you know, if 

01:03:09.405 --> 01:03:11.405
there's a white male 

01:03:13.281 --> 01:03:15.281
espousing hatred, and a white 
male who's 

01:03:16.558 --> 01:03:18.816
influential and has followers on
Twitter, makes one comment 

01:03:18.817 --> 01:03:22.488
about, hey, man, think again, or
these people are human, what are

01:03:22.489 --> 01:03:24.489
you doing?

01:03:26.186 --> 01:03:28.186
One comment lowers dramatically 
the 

01:03:29.284 --> 01:03:31.284
amount of hatred from that 
person for two months.  

01:03:33.174 --> 01:03:35.402
And that's really a remarkable 
thing.  So, it speaks to a lot 

01:03:35.403 --> 01:03:38.461
of research right now.  There's 
an exciting research on 

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.547
prejudice on and offline, on 
combatting prejudice that shows 

01:03:43.548 --> 01:03:46.599
that little points of speaking 
up are important.  So, 

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.600
technology that could help us 

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:51.884
learn that or help us speak up 
or understand when we're needed 

01:03:51.885 --> 01:03:55.352
to say something in the realm I 
think is really important.  

01:04:00.023 --> 01:04:02.023
Another study out of Europe 
showed 

01:04:04.576 --> 01:04:06.399
that if people are given kind of
an adventure game or perspective

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.694
taking, a day in the life of 
Roma, a person who's a Roma, and

01:04:10.695 --> 01:04:12.695
the kinds of troubles that 

01:04:13.835 --> 01:04:17.317
they go through, very short game
has extraordinary effects.  It 

01:04:17.318 --> 01:04:19.318
lowers their likelihood to vote 
for a far right party.

01:04:23.825 --> 01:04:25.825
It lowers their prejudice 
against the Roma.  

01:04:27.859 --> 01:04:30.734
It also, for up to a year, 
lowers their prejudice against 

01:04:30.735 --> 01:04:32.735
other minorities 

01:04:35.781 --> 01:04:39.722
or other pariah people, people 
with a lot of negative sentiment

01:04:39.723 --> 01:04:41.723
like refugees.

01:04:44.818 --> 01:04:46.882
So I think these ripple effects 
are really important to tap into

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.883
the virtual 

01:04:50.556 --> 01:04:52.556
world, these ripple effects that
are there.  

01:04:53.193 --> 01:04:55.021
So I think we've covered a lot 
of ground, but I hope we've 

01:04:55.022 --> 01:04:58.089
raised some good questions, 
something to take away, to think

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:02.820
about, to chew over.  And I'll 
just say to wrap up that we've 

01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:04.821
certainly come a long way from 
the 

01:05:06.699 --> 01:05:07.916
days of lantern slide shows and 
the telegraph as the state of 

01:05:07.917 --> 01:05:11.986
the art communications tool, and
yet we're still wrestling with 

01:05:11.987 --> 01:05:13.987
the tensions and promises of 
technology.  

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.513
All of what we're facing demands

01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:23.521
creative spirits, open minds, 
and a lot of questioning.

01:05:26.746 --> 01:05:28.746
And questioning is the opposite 
of complacency.

01:05:32.726 --> 01:05:33.584
And unease is really a central 
route to progress in society.  

01:05:33.585 --> 01:05:36.861
   So I think we have reason to 
be optimistic, that with your 

01:05:36.862 --> 01:05:40.567
help, we can create a more 
healthy digital world.  Thank 

01:05:40.568 --> 01:05:42.568
you very much.  

01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:45.789
[Applause]

01:20:32.664 --> 01:20:34.664
your seat.  Our session will 
begin soon.

01:22:44.690 --> 01:22:48.567
   At this time, please find 
your seat.  Our session will 

01:22:48.568 --> 01:22:50.568
begin soon.

01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:58.323
   &gt;&gt; Good morning.  Welcome to 
the third day of IO.  It's great

01:23:58.324 --> 01:24:01.568
to be here talking to you this 
morning.  My name is Tim Psiaki,

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:06.567
and I'm a software engineer on 
the AR and VR team.  Today, Tom 

01:24:06.568 --> 01:24:09.416
and I are going to talk to you 
about the tools that we've built

01:24:09.417 --> 01:24:13.845
to make AR development easy and 
fast for every Android 

01:24:13.846 --> 01:24:17.892
developer.  
   So did you hear that the 

01:24:17.893 --> 01:24:19.893
developer 

01:24:23.459 --> 01:24:24.684
keynote AR Core is Google's 
platform for building augmented 

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:26.685
reality experiences.

01:24:28.359 --> 01:24:29.987
You've been hearing a lot about 
ARcore the last couple of days, 

01:24:29.988 --> 01:24:32.427
and I hope you guys are excited 
about building for AR, I 

01:24:32.428 --> 01:24:35.090
certainly am.  
   Our goal is that at the end 

01:24:35.091 --> 01:24:39.040
of this session, every single 
one of you would feel like you 

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:41.041
can build an AR app.

01:24:46.812 --> 01:24:48.664
So what we're going to cover 
today is how you can get an 

01:24:48.665 --> 01:24:52.526
asset, how you can build an app 
using that asset, and finally, 

01:24:52.527 --> 01:24:54.961
how you can iterate and launch. 
   But before I get into the 

01:24:54.962 --> 01:24:56.962
details, I 

01:24:58.018 --> 01:24:59.250
want to tell you a little bit 
about something that I like to 

01:24:59.251 --> 01:25:01.251
do.

01:25:03.134 --> 01:25:05.355
So, I really like to time myself
doing ordinary things.

01:25:08.417 --> 01:25:10.417
I'll time myself doing things 
like 

01:25:13.988 --> 01:25:16.657
ironing a shirt, or even taking 
a shower or reading my kids a 

01:25:16.658 --> 01:25:21.956
book.  It's kind of quirky, I 
know, but I like to optimize my 

01:25:21.957 --> 01:25:25.008
time and do these things as fast
as possible.  Sometimes my kids 

01:25:25.009 --> 01:25:27.009
don't appreciate it that much.

01:25:29.055 --> 01:25:33.792
   So what I want to do today is
I wanted to do something in AR 

01:25:33.793 --> 01:25:40.783
as fast as I possibly can. , by 
doing something that I call AR 

01:25:40.784 --> 01:25:43.428
Done Fast.  That's right.  I'm 
going to do a speed run through 

01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:49.154
building an AR app.  Tom, I'm 
wondering if you can help time 

01:25:49.155 --> 01:25:53.659
this speed run and see just how 
fast I can build an app in AR.  

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:55.720
   Now, to make this happen as 
fast as 

01:25:59.185 --> 01:26:01.185
possible, I'm going to use the 
SDK, 

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:04.709
which is our new 3-D framework 
that we just announced and 

01:26:04.710 --> 01:26:06.951
launched, and this framework 
makes AR development easy in 

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.808
Java.  So that I can sort of 
narrate what's 

01:26:14.079 --> 01:26:16.079
going on, I did a one-take video

01:26:17.148 --> 01:26:18.763
recording of developing an AR 
app last night, and we'll see 

01:26:18.764 --> 01:26:22.669
how I did.  Let's jump to the 
next slide and, Tom, are you 

01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:25.723
ready?  
   &gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  Ready.  

01:26:27.147 --> 01:26:30.599
&gt;&gt; TIM PSIAKI:  We'll see.  All 
right.  So, let's go.  Start.  

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.600
All right.

01:26:35.925 --> 01:26:38.968
So I'm getting my asset from 
poly.google.com.  I'm going to 

01:26:38.969 --> 01:26:41.004
search for a lamp post.  We'll 
see what I find.

01:26:44.269 --> 01:26:45.487
Okay, so this first lamp post 
from Naomi Chen looks pretty 

01:26:45.488 --> 01:26:49.555
good.  Let's have a closer look 
and see if I like that.  This is

01:26:49.556 --> 01:26:52.624
pretty much exactly what I'm 
looking for.  So I'm going to 

01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:54.625
download the model 

01:26:56.922 --> 01:26:58.956
file, and as you can see here, 
I've got it downloaded and I've 

01:26:58.957 --> 01:27:00.957
got all the files 

01:27:03.504 --> 01:27:05.537
here in my downloads folder.  
   Now I'm going to open the 

01:27:05.538 --> 01:27:09.603
hello seam 4 sample app, and I'm
going to see if I can get this 

01:27:09.604 --> 01:27:12.245
lamp post being used instead of 
Andy.  I'm going to drag all of 

01:27:12.246 --> 01:27:14.246
the model 

01:27:16.225 --> 01:27:18.225
files into my sample data 
folder, and 

01:27:19.521 --> 01:27:22.403
then using our just-released 
seam forum tools android studio 

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:24.055
plug-in, I'm going to import 
that asset into my project.  

01:27:24.056 --> 01:27:28.530
   As you can see, as soon as I 
clicked finished, we've got a 

01:27:28.531 --> 01:27:30.768
build doing that's doing the 
import of our asset into our 

01:27:31.999 --> 01:27:33.831
project, and we're going to see 
it pop up in the viewer in just 

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:38.958
a second to see if we like what 
we got.  There it is.  So that's

01:27:38.959 --> 01:27:43.402
looking pretty much exactly like
it did on Poly.  And so let's 

01:27:43.403 --> 01:27:46.888
see if we can get that added in 
place of Andy.  So we're going 

01:27:46.889 --> 01:27:50.186
to jump into the code here.  
   And as you can see, Andy is 

01:27:50.187 --> 01:27:52.187
loaded using a resource ID.

01:27:54.452 --> 01:27:56.704
Now, you might have noticed I 
actually put this file into the 

01:27:56.705 --> 01:27:58.788
assets folder, so I'm going to 
change a little bit how I load 

01:27:58.789 --> 01:28:01.043
it.  I'm going to load the file 
from the assets folder.

01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:06.930
Going to drop that in, and I'm 
loading 

01:28:08.004 --> 01:28:10.872
the file now, and I press play 
almost.  Play.  Okay.  Done.  

01:28:10.873 --> 01:28:12.873
All right.  

01:28:14.537 --> 01:28:16.537
Hang on with the time.

01:28:19.837 --> 01:28:22.571
Let's see what this looks like 
back to.  Back to the slides.  

01:28:22.572 --> 01:28:29.803
There we go.  Okay.  So here's 
our app.  So we're done.  We 

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:32.505
have an app that's running in 
AR.  We've got a lamp post.  We 

01:28:32.506 --> 01:28:34.131
can place our lamp post, we can 
place a lot of lamp posts in our

01:28:34.132 --> 01:28:38.215
office and make our office, you 
know, as decorated with lamp 

01:28:38.216 --> 01:28:42.692
posts as we would like it to be.
It's looking great.  So that was

01:28:42.693 --> 01:28:45.332
our speed run.  
   And so let's see, Tom, how 

01:28:45.333 --> 01:28:47.560
did I do there?  
   &gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  One minute, 

01:28:47.561 --> 01:28:50.609
45 seconds.  
   &gt;&gt; TIM PSIAKI:  One minute, 

01:28:50.610 --> 01:28:52.660
45 seconds.  That's minutes, not
hours.  

01:28:54.493 --> 01:28:56.493
[Applause] 
   Okay.

01:28:58.395 --> 01:29:00.395
So that's how fast we can build 
with AR.

01:29:02.122 --> 01:29:03.378
But now we're going to slow 
down, and we're going to talk 

01:29:03.379 --> 01:29:07.452
through all the tools that we've
built that make this possible.  

01:29:07.453 --> 01:29:09.453
   So the first thing I'm going 
to do is 

01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:14.870
talk to you about assets.  You 
can get your assets that you'd 

01:29:14.871 --> 01:29:19.385
use in an AR app from many 
different places.  You can 

01:29:19.386 --> 01:29:21.386
source them online, you could 

01:29:23.251 --> 01:29:26.108
have an artist create custom 
assets for you.  But what I'm 

01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:28.109
going to do for this talk 

01:29:29.366 --> 01:29:32.410
is we're going to get our asset 
from Poly.  Poly is Google's 

01:29:32.411 --> 01:29:34.411
library for 3-D assets.

01:29:36.291 --> 01:29:38.731
On Poly, you'll find thousands 
of 3-D assets that you can use 

01:29:38.732 --> 01:29:40.357
in your apps.  
   As you saw, I was able to 

01:29:40.358 --> 01:29:42.358
easily 

01:29:43.418 --> 01:29:46.465
search for a lamp post and find 
exactly what I was looking for. 

01:29:46.466 --> 01:29:48.309
But if you want something else 
like a tree, you can search for 

01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:50.310
that, and there 

01:29:52.173 --> 01:29:53.643
are lots of trees available in 
all sorts of colors, shapes, 

01:29:53.644 --> 01:29:57.115
sizes.  Maybe some 
dangerous-looking ones.  

01:29:57.116 --> 01:29:59.116
Whatever you want, you'll find 
what you're looking for.  

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.189
But if you don't know exactly 
what you want and you just like 

01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:06.893
to be inspired, you can browse 
by category.  Maybe you'll find 

01:30:06.894 --> 01:30:09.551
an asset there that will inspire
you to create a whole new AR 

01:30:09.552 --> 01:30:13.004
app.  So have a look around and 
see if you can find something 

01:30:13.005 --> 01:30:15.005
that you like, and I think you 
will.  

01:30:16.865 --> 01:30:18.865
Most of these assets, or many of

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.940
these assets are licensed under 
the CCBY 

01:30:25.396 --> 01:30:27.321
license, and so that means that 
you can download model files for

01:30:27.322 --> 01:30:31.407
these and use them directly in 
your apps.  All you have to do 

01:30:31.408 --> 01:30:33.408
is credit the author, and then 
you can use them.  

01:30:34.877 --> 01:30:39.337
So here I'm downloading the 
model file.  And look at this, I

01:30:39.338 --> 01:30:41.988
have an asset.  As you saw in 
the speed run, here it is.  

01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:45.441
Now, if you look closely, you'll
see that this asset has three 

01:30:45.442 --> 01:30:50.985
different files.  Now, you want 
to make sure that you keep all 

01:30:50.986 --> 01:30:53.248
of these files together, because
each one of these files is 

01:30:56.504 --> 01:30:58.504
important to actually be able to
render 

01:30:59.550 --> 01:31:01.584
this asset the way we want to.  
   But what do we do with these 

01:31:01.585 --> 01:31:05.647
files now that we have them?  
Just for fun, let's crack one of

01:31:05.648 --> 01:31:11.001
them open in Android Studio and 
see what it looks like.  

01:31:12.457 --> 01:31:16.113
So, this doesn't really look 
that much like a lamp post.  

01:31:16.114 --> 01:31:19.764
Maybe a little bit.  But you 
probably were guessing that this

01:31:19.765 --> 01:31:22.258
wasn't going to look like a lamp
post if we just opened up the 

01:31:22.259 --> 01:31:24.259
raw files.  As you can see, 
we've got an image, 

01:31:27.166 --> 01:31:29.166
we've got some text which is 
showing 

01:31:30.591 --> 01:31:35.533
what all the vertices in this 
object.  You might love a file 

01:31:35.534 --> 01:31:37.534
like this if you're a graphics 
engining but if you're 

01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:43.923
using a game engine like Unity, 
you'd be able to render this, 

01:31:43.924 --> 01:31:45.961
tweak it, it would be great.  
And I actually want to stop for 

01:31:45.962 --> 01:31:50.072
a second and let you know that 
at 11:30 right here onstage 7, 

01:31:50.073 --> 01:31:52.929
or of course streaming on 
YouTube, there's another 

01:31:57.815 --> 01:31:59.815
session called build an AR app 
with the 

01:32:02.113 --> 01:32:04.959
Poly Toolkit For Unit, and you 
can learn more about Poly and 

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.409
using these assets in Unity.  
   But for now, we're going to 

01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:11.253
build a native java app.  We 
want to see how we can use these

01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:15.901
assets in Android Studio.

01:32:21.459 --> 01:32:23.459
So let me talk to you about 
Sceneform.

01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:27.110
We can work with 3-D models at 
Android 

01:32:29.734 --> 01:32:33.247
Studio using The Sceneform tools
plug-in.  We announced it at the

01:32:33.248 --> 01:32:35.248
keynote on Tuesday.  

01:32:37.108 --> 01:32:39.108
So, Sceneform is our high level 

01:32:41.446 --> 01:32:43.446
framework and helps building AR 
apps in java easy.

01:32:46.129 --> 01:32:48.981
It includes a run-time API, and 
that handles your rendering, 

01:32:48.982 --> 01:32:50.982
handles doing 

01:32:51.998 --> 01:32:53.998
things

01:32:55.843 --> 01:32:57.669
with ARCore, but it has a set of
tools that let you import, view,

01:32:57.670 --> 01:32:59.670
and tweak 

01:33:01.232 --> 01:33:03.689
your assets right in your IDE.  
   So where do you get this 

01:33:03.690 --> 01:33:08.412
plug-in?  Like most other 
android studio plug-ins, you can

01:33:08.413 --> 01:33:10.413
get your plug-in right 

01:33:11.675 --> 01:33:14.341
from the Android Studio 
preference place, you browse for

01:33:14.342 --> 01:33:16.782
plug-ins, search for Sceneform 
and you'll find it.

01:33:20.237 --> 01:33:23.693
   So once we have the plug-in, 
it's super easy to get your 

01:33:23.694 --> 01:33:28.170
assets imported.  The first 
thing we need to do is place our

01:33:28.171 --> 01:33:29.801
source files in our project.  
We're going to drop them in the 

01:33:29.802 --> 01:33:32.660
sample data folder.  Now, this 
is a little bit important, 

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.364
because the sample data folder 
is a folder that does not get 

01:33:39.365 --> 01:33:42.421
bundled into your APK.  Now, you
might wonder, why would I 

01:33:48.341 --> 01:33:50.984
want these files not bundled 
into my APK?  Well, as you can 

01:33:50.985 --> 01:33:53.447
see here -- well, actually, hang
on.  I missed one thing.

01:33:57.324 --> 01:34:00.785
As you can see, we support OBJ, 
FBX, and JLTF files.  So we're 

01:34:00.786 --> 01:34:02.786
going to focus more on OBJ files
right now, because that's what I

01:34:03.432 --> 01:34:05.432
got from Poly.

01:34:06.904 --> 01:34:08.904
But this exact same flow works 
with 

01:34:09.944 --> 01:34:11.944
FBX and GLTF, which you might 
find other 

01:34:13.029 --> 01:34:15.463
places online or source from 
artists, things like that.  

01:34:17.306 --> 01:34:19.306
But anyway, so we drop these 
files 

01:34:20.389 --> 01:34:21.640
into our sample data folder, 
like I said, because we don't 

01:34:21.641 --> 01:34:24.499
want them bundled into our app. 
Why do we want them bundled into

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.500
our app?

01:34:29.169 --> 01:34:32.025
It's because we build run time 
optimized binaries that 

01:34:32.026 --> 01:34:34.026
Sceneform will 

01:34:35.285 --> 01:34:38.125
be able to use to render your 
assets in android.  Now, these 

01:34:38.126 --> 01:34:43.036
binaries are optimized so they 
load fast and they look great.  

01:34:43.037 --> 01:34:45.272
They include all of the data 
that you need in order to render

01:34:45.273 --> 01:34:47.273
-- in order for Sceneform to 
render your models.

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.620
So that file -- actually, can 
you go back one slide?  

01:34:57.361 --> 01:34:59.592
So, that is the sfb file.  So 
you're going to hear a little 

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:04.267
bit more about sfb files later, 
but suffice it to say that sfb 

01:35:04.268 --> 01:35:07.139
files are the files that we want
bundled into our APK.  

01:35:07.758 --> 01:35:09.758
Okay.

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:14.076
So now that we have our file, or
our set of files in our sample 

01:35:14.077 --> 01:35:16.077
data folder, we're going to 
right-click, and using 

01:35:19.161 --> 01:35:20.811
the Sceneform tools plug-in, 
we'll click import Sceneform 

01:35:20.812 --> 01:35:22.812
asset.

01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:27.564
This will trigger our import 
wizard flow.  So this is the 

01:35:27.565 --> 01:35:31.684
import wizard.  As you can see, 
this is fairly simple.  We have 

01:35:31.685 --> 01:35:33.685
three fields to fill out.  The 
first is the file path to our 

01:35:35.143 --> 01:35:37.143
model, and that's already filled
out for us.  

01:35:37.784 --> 01:35:40.218
The second two are outputs.  And
both of these files are created 

01:35:40.219 --> 01:35:42.219
by the import wizard.

01:35:44.885 --> 01:35:47.551
The first file you'll see is an 
sfa file.  I'm going to go into 

01:35:47.552 --> 01:35:49.552
that in detail in 

01:35:51.850 --> 01:35:53.677
just a couple of minutes, but 
this -- for now, you just need 

01:35:53.678 --> 01:35:57.782
to know this should be placed 
right next to your model, 

01:35:57.783 --> 01:35:59.825
because this is going to become 
one of the source files that 

01:35:59.826 --> 01:36:01.826
will show how your model is 
rendered.  

01:36:05.369 --> 01:36:07.821
Your sfb file, this is what you 
want bundled into your APK.  So 

01:36:07.822 --> 01:36:10.674
you're going to want to put that
somewhere that gets bundled.  

01:36:10.675 --> 01:36:13.335
You kind of have two options 
here.  Your options are your 

01:36:13.336 --> 01:36:15.336
assets folder 

01:36:16.628 --> 01:36:19.881
and your Rex raw folder.  You 
can put in either of these.  The

01:36:19.882 --> 01:36:21.296
loading is slightly different 
when you get to the run time, 

01:36:21.297 --> 01:36:25.387
but other than that, they'll 
both get bundled, and it doesn't

01:36:25.388 --> 01:36:27.699
matter, you can pick whichever 
one you choose.  

01:36:29.924 --> 01:36:32.986
So, that's all we have to do in 
the import wizard.  We click 

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:37.070
finish, and we're done.  Let's 
see what happens next.  

01:36:39.095 --> 01:36:40.941
So as you can see, as soon as we
click finish, we'll have a 

01:36:40.942 --> 01:36:42.942
greater build kicking off.

01:36:45.474 --> 01:36:48.924
We're compiling here the sfb 
that we just imported.  Now, 

01:36:48.925 --> 01:36:50.925
what's going to happen is, we'll

01:36:52.014 --> 01:36:54.057
get these cradle tasks added.  
We're picking these defaults 

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:57.731
that we're going to fill in in 
the sfa that I'm going to tell 

01:36:57.732 --> 01:37:00.786
you about in a second, and we're
building this run time optimized

01:37:00.787 --> 01:37:02.787
binary.  

01:37:04.107 --> 01:37:05.808
But as soon as we finish this 
build -- sorry, as soon as we 

01:37:05.809 --> 01:37:07.809
finish this 

01:37:10.106 --> 01:37:10.925
build, we're going to see these 
sfa, sfb files added to our 

01:37:10.926 --> 01:37:16.029
project.  And so you can see, 
we've got our sfa next to our 

01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:18.030
model and our sfb here -- I 

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.920
think I have it

01:37:23.273 --> 01:37:27.431
in resra right here.  The viewer
is going to pop open as soon as 

01:37:27.432 --> 01:37:29.432
you get your asset fully 
imported.  

01:37:30.675 --> 01:37:32.927
As you can see, we see exactly 
what our model is going to look 

01:37:32.928 --> 01:37:38.466
like here.  Here it looks like 
it did on Poly, which makes 

01:37:38.467 --> 01:37:41.995
sense because that's what we 
imported.  And you don't have to

01:37:41.996 --> 01:37:45.697
deploy to your phone.  You can 
just see it right away.  You 

01:37:45.698 --> 01:37:47.128
don't even have to have an app 
built yet, you can just import 

01:37:47.129 --> 01:37:50.423
it right into our project in 
view files without having your 

01:37:50.424 --> 01:37:53.268
app built.  
   And this uses the exact same 

01:37:53.269 --> 01:37:57.946
render as our run time, and so 
what you see is what you get.  

01:37:57.947 --> 01:37:59.947
This is going to look just the 
same on your phone.

01:38:02.345 --> 01:38:07.029
   This looks just like it did 
in Poly.  I was thinking I 

01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:09.884
wanted it maybe a little bit 
different for my app.  In Poly, 

01:38:09.885 --> 01:38:11.885
it sort of looks maybe like 

01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:15.450
it's kind of rough plastic 
maybe, and I was hoping it would

01:38:15.451 --> 01:38:17.451
look maybe a little bit shinier.

01:38:20.336 --> 01:38:23.182
So let's see how we could do 
that.  So I talked about the sfa

01:38:23.183 --> 01:38:25.183
a couple of times.

01:38:28.497 --> 01:38:30.743
So there was a text file that 
you saw in the viewer, and so 

01:38:30.744 --> 01:38:32.744
that file is your sfa file.  

01:38:34.415 --> 01:38:36.699
The sfa file defines how 
Sceneform will render your 

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:41.989
asset.  You can see it has a 
bunch of different parameters.  

01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:44.846
And if you look closely, you'll 
see that these might affect the 

01:38:44.847 --> 01:38:46.847
way your 

01:38:48.536 --> 01:38:50.166
asset is going to look.  So 
we're going to look at a couple 

01:38:50.167 --> 01:38:55.253
of these.  One of them here is 
metallic, and one of them is 

01:38:55.254 --> 01:38:59.324
roughness.  And so by default, 
when we import from Poly, we get

01:38:59.325 --> 01:39:03.028
something where the roughness is
1 and the metallic is 0, and 

01:39:03.029 --> 01:39:04.827
that's going to make it look 
like it's sort of made out of 

01:39:04.828 --> 01:39:09.556
plastic.  And what I'd like to 
do is turn the metallic up, 

01:39:09.557 --> 01:39:12.216
maybe to 1 so it looks really 
metallic and turn the roughness 

01:39:12.418 --> 01:39:15.471
down.  Maybe not all the way to 
0.  I don't want it too shiny.

01:39:19.328 --> 01:39:20.348
But I'm going to turn it down, 
and then I'll see what happens. 

01:39:20.349 --> 01:39:25.265
   So as soon as I save the sfa 
file, we're going to rebuild the

01:39:25.266 --> 01:39:27.266
run time 

01:39:28.525 --> 01:39:30.384
bundle, and as soon as that is 
complete, we're going to see 

01:39:30.385 --> 01:39:32.385
that reflected in the viewer.

01:39:36.502 --> 01:39:37.311
So, here you can see, I guess 
this gif is sort of looping a 

01:39:37.312 --> 01:39:40.384
little bit.  But once it 
completes, the viewer is looking

01:39:40.385 --> 01:39:44.258
a little bit different.  It's 
looking pretty metallic.  And 

01:39:44.259 --> 01:39:46.493
this is basically what I'm going
for.  

01:39:48.966 --> 01:39:50.966
So, I want to point you to this 
documentation online.

01:39:54.265 --> 01:39:55.475
So I mentioned a couple of the 
parameters, and there are 

01:39:55.476 --> 01:39:58.786
actually a lot more parameters 
that you can edit in your sfa 

01:39:58.787 --> 01:40:02.661
file.  There are a lot of 
parameters that affect the look 

01:40:02.662 --> 01:40:04.662
and feel of your asset, but 
there are also parameters that 

01:40:06.739 --> 01:40:08.381
affect things, like its scale, 
or the way its collision works 

01:40:08.382 --> 01:40:11.044
for when you're tapping on your 
object.  

01:40:12.891 --> 01:40:15.359
If you check out this page, 
you'll see all of the details on

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.440
all of those parameters.  Now, 
one thing I'll mention, I 

01:40:21.299 --> 01:40:24.158
mentioned how we support gltf, 
fbx, and obj files.  When you 

01:40:24.159 --> 01:40:26.159
import each of these files, the 
parameters will be slightly 

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:30.460
different that you can edit in 
your sfa.

01:40:33.316 --> 01:40:35.122
And all of the details are on 
this the site, so I would 

01:40:35.123 --> 01:40:37.779
strongly recommend you see which
things you can tweak in each of 

01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:41.342
these types of files.  
   Okay.  So we've got our asset

01:40:41.343 --> 01:40:43.343
looking the way we want it to.

01:40:46.693 --> 01:40:48.924
Let's see what we need to do to 
get it in AR.  Now, you remember

01:40:48.925 --> 01:40:50.925
I talked about 

01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:54.379
placing the run time optimized 
binary, 

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:59.304
the sfb in the assets or resra 
folder.  Let's look at how we 

01:40:59.305 --> 01:41:01.305
would load that in our run time 
out of each of these.  

01:41:03.193 --> 01:41:04.820
So as you can see here, this is 
an activity that you guys are 

01:41:04.821 --> 01:41:06.821
all very familiar with.

01:41:11.097 --> 01:41:12.327
We have an onCreate method, and 
what we want to do is our model 

01:41:12.328 --> 01:41:16.220
renderable is an object that in 
the run time is going to 

01:41:16.221 --> 01:41:18.221
describe all the details of how 
to 

01:41:19.285 --> 01:41:21.955
render our lamp post.  You could
think of this as the run 

01:41:25.627 --> 01:41:28.064
time representation of our file 
that has our optimized model.  

01:41:28.065 --> 01:41:32.533
   And so what we need to do is 
we need to load our file into 

01:41:32.534 --> 01:41:34.534
the run time here, and we're 
using that using the model 

01:41:38.061 --> 01:41:40.061
renderable builder.  

01:41:41.711 --> 01:41:45.995
So it can take a while, and this
API is an asynchronous API.  All

01:41:45.996 --> 01:41:47.996
we need to do is create a 
builder, set its source.

01:41:50.128 --> 01:41:51.956
Here I'm setting it to a 
resource ID in resra, that 

01:41:51.957 --> 01:41:55.626
points to the lamp post in 
build.  Now, the model 

01:41:55.627 --> 01:41:59.080
renderable builder returns a 
completable future.  And so that

01:41:59.081 --> 01:42:01.081
completable future, we're using 
this then accept method, so that

01:42:04.996 --> 01:42:06.996
after that's complete, we can go
and 

01:42:08.472 --> 01:42:10.695
store the renderable that's 
loaded into our lamp post 

01:42:10.696 --> 01:42:12.696
renderable so that it can be 
used later.  

01:42:16.195 --> 01:42:18.639
So this was for loading out of 
resra.  If we were to load out 

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:20.900
of assets, it's just slightly 
different.  This code is almost 

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:22.901
exactly the same except for one 
line, when you set the 

01:42:27.041 --> 01:42:29.074
source ID, we just need to set 
it to a Uri and parse out the 

01:42:29.075 --> 01:42:33.188
actual file name instead of a 
resource ID.  You'll notice this

01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:35.189
is just the lamp post.

01:42:37.291 --> 01:42:38.511
fsb directly in the assets 
folder, this is how we would 

01:42:38.512 --> 01:42:40.512
load that.

01:42:42.272 --> 01:42:44.274
You can define a directory 
hierarchy however you please and

01:42:44.275 --> 01:42:49.029
just reference the path all the 
way from the assets folder to 

01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:53.284
your sfb right here.  
   So, there's a lot more to 

01:42:53.285 --> 01:42:55.285
learn about 

01:42:58.582 --> 01:42:59.448
Sceneform and about how to 
actually display these in your 

01:42:59.449 --> 01:43:02.508
app.  When I was doing my speed 
run, I used the sample, and so 

01:43:02.509 --> 01:43:06.175
that's a great way to just try 
this out and see how your assets

01:43:06.176 --> 01:43:07.996
will look.  
   But if you'd like to learn 

01:43:07.997 --> 01:43:13.287
more about how to do more things
with these assets and how to 

01:43:13.288 --> 01:43:15.729
display them in the run time, 
you should check out this 

01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:17.730
session.  It was yesterday, 
rendering for 

01:43:20.574 --> 01:43:23.455
AndroidYesterday, Rendering For 
Android AR Apps, and it's 

01:43:23.456 --> 01:43:25.456
available on YouTube, of course.
You can learn more there.  

01:43:26.921 --> 01:43:28.360
So I'm going to jump right in to
our actual app we built and take

01:43:28.361 --> 01:43:30.405
it for a spin.  See what it 
looks like now that we 

01:43:35.345 --> 01:43:35.748
tweaked the parameters in the 
sfa.  

01:43:35.749 --> 01:43:39.065
All right.  So there is our lamp
post.  It's lit nicely.  It's 

01:43:39.066 --> 01:43:40.924
got everything you would expect 
of a giant lamp post in the 

01:43:40.925 --> 01:43:42.925
middle of 

01:43:44.132 --> 01:43:48.321
your office.  It's looking 
great.  That's just what I was 

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:50.322
going for.

01:43:55.297 --> 01:43:56.916
So let's jump back to the slides
now.  So I want to talk about 

01:43:56.917 --> 01:43:59.566
one other thing, which is -- I'm
asking you to 

01:44:02.879 --> 01:44:04.714
install this androidAndroid 
Studio Plug-in, you might wonder

01:44:04.715 --> 01:44:08.011
what is this plug-in going to do
to my project build?  Do I want 

01:44:08.012 --> 01:44:09.455
to install this?  
   And so let me tell you a 

01:44:09.456 --> 01:44:11.504
little bit about what's going on
under the hood.

01:44:15.938 --> 01:44:17.938
So we built a Sceneform

01:44:19.128 --> 01:44:23.396
gradle plug-in.  This is what's 
doing the asset builds that I 

01:44:23.397 --> 01:44:25.397
showed you.  

01:44:26.486 --> 01:44:28.486
When you import, you're going to
add 

01:44:33.148 --> 01:44:36.928
the Sceneform gradle plug-in to 
your gradle build.  You'll know 

01:44:36.929 --> 01:44:38.943
that we load this from the 
Google repository, so you'll 

01:44:38.944 --> 01:44:41.978
want to make sure that's in your
project build file.  Of course, 

01:44:41.979 --> 01:44:44.415
this is the default for all-new 
Android apps, so this shouldn't 

01:44:44.824 --> 01:44:46.824
be a problem.

01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:56.276
In your app/build.gradle file, 
apply the program.  For every 

01:44:56.277 --> 01:44:58.313
asset that your import, you'll 
see one of these asset 

01:45:01.378 --> 01:45:03.378
definitions in your gradle file.
If you remember the import flow,

01:45:06.921 --> 01:45:08.743
you'll remember that those look 
very familiar, and in fact, 

01:45:08.744 --> 01:45:13.238
you're right, those are the 
exact same paths that we had in 

01:45:13.239 --> 01:45:16.919
the import wizard.  This is all 
it does, write these into 

01:45:17.124 --> 01:45:20.392
gradle.  Could you edit these 
gradle files manually if you 

01:45:20.393 --> 01:45:22.393
wanted?  Sure, that would be 
fine.  

01:45:23.841 --> 01:45:26.288
Now, we think that the Android 
Studio Plug-in is the quickest 

01:45:26.289 --> 01:45:28.357
and easiest way to get these in,
but of course, they can 

01:45:33.067 --> 01:45:35.067
be edited and changed here as 
well.  

01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.314
And finally, once you build and 
you've got these asset rules in 

01:45:37.315 --> 01:45:39.315
your 

01:45:40.402 --> 01:45:42.402
project, you'll see that here I 
am 

01:45:45.466 --> 01:45:47.466
building an APK using the 
assemble

01:45:48.772 --> 01:45:50.856
d ed debug rule in gradle, and 
we have this 

01:45:56.676 --> 01:45:57.081
compile asset task, and we have 
a compile asset task for each of

01:45:57.082 --> 01:45:59.093
the assets that we added to our 
gradle build, and these are 

01:45:59.094 --> 01:46:02.922
added to the dependency chain so
that they'll run before the 

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:06.388
tasks that merge in assets or 
resources into your APK.  So you

01:46:06.389 --> 01:46:08.389
can always be sure that these 

01:46:09.439 --> 01:46:11.115
bundles will be updated, or 
these optimized binaries will be

01:46:11.116 --> 01:46:15.406
updated and ready to go every 
time you build an APK, and 

01:46:15.407 --> 01:46:17.234
you'll always get the latest and
greatest version of the 

01:46:17.235 --> 01:46:19.235
optimized binary 

01:46:22.119 --> 01:46:24.119
that has all your updated 
parameters

01:46:25.867 --> 01:46:27.867
s, and that should be -- yes.  
Oh, sorry.  

01:46:29.136 --> 01:46:31.136
I forgot about Source Control.  

01:46:32.804 --> 01:46:35.034
So one thing you might ask, 
since we're building these files

01:46:35.035 --> 01:46:38.941
as part of gradle, and do we 
need to check them into Source 

01:46:38.942 --> 01:46:40.942
Control, where should they live?

01:46:42.246 --> 01:46:44.694
And the truth is, you could -- 
you don't have to check in the 

01:46:44.695 --> 01:46:47.539
optimized run time bundles.  
These could just be built as 

01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:50.197
part of your gradle build.  But 
we would actually highly 

01:46:50.198 --> 01:46:52.198
recommend 

01:46:54.471 --> 01:46:57.322
that you do check them in.  
Since these are tracked in 

01:46:57.323 --> 01:47:02.188
gradle and we understand all of 
the dependencies and the input 

01:47:02.189 --> 01:47:04.678
files that were used to generate
our optimized binary, we can 

01:47:06.911 --> 01:47:09.594
always understand when it needs 
to be rebuilt, and so if you 

01:47:09.595 --> 01:47:12.589
just check in your sfb

01:47:15.713 --> 01:47:16.767
's, check in your sfa's, pull 
down the latest source from your

01:47:16.768 --> 01:47:19.026
source control in build, we'll 
know which we have to 

01:47:23.371 --> 01:47:25.432
rebuild and which we can leave 
unchanged, and so you'll have 

01:47:25.433 --> 01:47:27.966
always have the latest stuff to 
run.  

01:47:25.433 --> 01:47:29.484
Okay.  So now we have our basic 
app.  And I'm going to turn it 

01:47:29.485 --> 01:47:31.319
over to Tom and he's going to 
tell us how after we've built an

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:34.609
app, we would test it, iterate, 
and launch that app.  So here 

01:47:34.610 --> 01:47:38.714
you go, Tom.  
   &gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  Cool.  

01:47:38.715 --> 01:47:40.715
Thanks, Tim.  
   Hi, everyone.  I'm Tom.

01:47:44.012 --> 01:47:45.657
I'm engineering manager on the 
AR and VR team.  I'm going to 

01:47:45.658 --> 01:47:47.907
talk about some of the tools 
that we've built to make 

01:47:47.908 --> 01:47:49.908
iterating 

01:47:51.966 --> 01:47:53.966
and building and debugging your 
AR apps even easier.  

01:47:54.864 --> 01:47:56.864
First of all, earlier this year,
we 

01:47:58.374 --> 01:48:01.018
released ARCore support to the 
android emulator.  So no matter 

01:48:01.019 --> 01:48:03.019
where you are, what devices 
you've got, you're always able 

01:48:04.269 --> 01:48:06.269
to build for ARCore.  So, if 
you'd like to develop your 

01:48:09.673 --> 01:48:11.538
ARCore app without having to 
deploy to your device, get up 

01:48:11.539 --> 01:48:14.814
and walk around your room, place
your objects, then you can do 

01:48:14.815 --> 01:48:16.815
that.  If you would like to 
develop in a 

01:48:19.697 --> 01:48:21.339
coffee shop or on a bus or on a 
plane, then we've got you 

01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:23.369
covered.  
   The virtual environment that 

01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:28.305
we let you walk around in, it's 
got multiple rooms, it's got 

01:48:28.306 --> 01:48:30.306
tables, it's got chairs, and if 
you also want to see what it 

01:48:31.765 --> 01:48:33.765
looks like with a cat in your 
room, then you can do that, too.

01:48:34.447 --> 01:48:37.354
   So, to get started, all you 
need to 

01:48:40.833 --> 01:48:42.833
do is use Android Studio 3.1 or 
above.

01:48:46.684 --> 01:48:48.684
Use the latest Android

01:48:50.627 --> 01:48:53.305
Oreo system image.  There are 
instructions on our website to 

01:48:53.306 --> 01:48:55.131
side load it if you'd like.  
   And then it should be the 

01:48:55.132 --> 01:48:59.422
default option, but make sure in
the advanced settings that 

01:48:59.423 --> 01:49:02.303
you're using the Virtual Scene 
for your camera as the back 

01:49:02.304 --> 01:49:05.974
facing camera.  Once you settle 
that all out, it's good to go.  

01:49:05.975 --> 01:49:10.052
   So, walking around your room,
it's not as easy as holding your

01:49:10.053 --> 01:49:11.881
phone up and looking around.  
But if you've played a lot of 

01:49:11.882 --> 01:49:14.317
video games like me, then you'll
find it really, really natural.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.453
So you use WASD on your 
keyboard, and the mouse or a 

01:49:20.454 --> 01:49:22.454
track pad, and you can 

01:49:24.938 --> 01:49:26.938
navigate like a first person 
video game.  

01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:29.205
So the really cool thing about 
the emulator support is we 

01:49:29.206 --> 01:49:33.891
actually run the entire ARCore 
tracking stack.  We don't fake 

01:49:33.892 --> 01:49:36.128
anything on that rendered image.
We just run the full tracking 

01:49:36.129 --> 01:49:39.586
stack, which is really cool, 
because as new features for 

01:49:39.587 --> 01:49:41.629
ARCore come online, then it will
just work magically within the 

01:49:42.031 --> 01:49:44.676
emulator.  
   So this week in the keynote, 

01:49:44.677 --> 01:49:48.732
we announced support for 
augmented images, and whilst all

01:49:48.733 --> 01:49:50.733
that stuff works, we don't 
actually have any images in that

01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:56.522
environment just now.  But, if 
you get the canary build of 

01:49:58.375 --> 01:50:01.220
Android Studio with the emulator
right now, then we added this 

01:50:01.221 --> 01:50:04.670
extra UI, which lets you place 
an image in your world, you can 

01:50:04.671 --> 01:50:06.671
change the size of it, you can 

01:50:09.196 --> 01:50:11.226
put it on horizontal surfaces, 
vertical surfaces.  As you can 

01:50:11.227 --> 01:50:13.870
see, we didn't have to do 
anything to make it work.  

01:50:13.871 --> 01:50:15.871
Augmented images works perfectly
in the emulator.  

01:50:18.577 --> 01:50:20.395
So, that helps you iterate.  One
thing we've worked really hard 

01:50:20.396 --> 01:50:23.464
on is helping you deplug your 
application.  I want to show you

01:50:23.465 --> 01:50:26.313
a tool that we've been working 
on that helps building and 

01:50:30.409 --> 01:50:32.886
debugging these complex 
immersive scenes really easy.

01:50:36.158 --> 01:50:37.809
With Sceneform and Unity, we 
made building your app really 

01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:40.667
easy, but sometimes you want to 
go under the hood and see what's

01:50:40.668 --> 01:50:42.668
happening.  

01:50:45.978 --> 01:50:50.088
So, we built GAPID, which is the
Graphics API Debugger.  It's a 

01:50:50.089 --> 01:50:52.089
powerful tool that lets you 
inspect all of the graphic's API

01:50:55.435 --> 01:50:57.054
commands that your application 
is calling and lets you replay 

01:50:57.055 --> 01:50:59.124
them later on.  If you want to 
see exactly how your 

01:51:04.021 --> 01:51:06.021
frame is being built, or see 
what 

01:51:07.492 --> 01:51:08.916
resources your app is being 
used, or investigate why your 

01:51:08.917 --> 01:51:12.788
app doesn't look quite as you 
expect, then GAPID can help.  

01:51:12.789 --> 01:51:15.220
And it also helps you understand
exactly what your GPU is being 

01:51:15.221 --> 01:51:18.526
asked to do as well.  
   So here's a really, really 

01:51:18.527 --> 01:51:22.818
quick example of GAPID.  We're 
just stepping through draw call 

01:51:23.255 --> 01:51:25.255
by draw call.

01:51:26.309 --> 01:51:27.321
You can see the Andy model, the 
raw resources that this is 

01:51:27.322 --> 01:51:31.422
using.  And you can see every 
single GL draw elements core, 

01:51:31.423 --> 01:51:33.423
which contributes to your 

01:51:34.532 --> 01:51:36.532
final image, and you can see it 
built up draw call by draw call.

01:51:37.179 --> 01:51:41.074
   So, we're going to go for a 
quick whirlwind tour through 

01:51:41.075 --> 01:51:44.784
GAPID.  There are two main 
stages.  The first stage is 

01:51:44.785 --> 01:51:46.785
tracing, which is 

01:51:48.397 --> 01:51:50.397
capturing every Single

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:53.789
single API call that your app is
making, and secondly, there's 

01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:58.484
replay which is on your desktop 
so that you can step through and

01:51:58.485 --> 01:52:00.485
reproduce those issues that your
app has.  

01:52:00.536 --> 01:52:02.965
First of all, to get going, you 
need to capture a trace of your 

01:52:02.966 --> 01:52:04.966
application.

01:52:06.832 --> 01:52:09.046
So, file, CaptureFile, Capture 
Trace.  You have to choose your 

01:52:09.047 --> 01:52:11.953
device.  Choose your package.  
Making sure your package is 

01:52:11.954 --> 01:52:16.054
debugable.  And then click okay,
and it will connect to your 

01:52:16.055 --> 01:52:19.146
device, start your package, and 
then it will start streaming 

01:52:19.147 --> 01:52:22.016
this information back.  
   So once you've captured an 

01:52:23.515 --> 01:52:27.181
interesting part of your scene, 
this is the UI that you get.  

01:52:27.182 --> 01:52:29.182
And you can replay each frame 
within 

01:52:30.473 --> 01:52:32.473
GAPID and step through it draw 
call by draw call.  

01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:36.401
For open GLES applications, 
which most of our ARCore 

01:52:36.402 --> 01:52:39.246
applications are right now, we 
capture from the start of the 

01:52:39.247 --> 01:52:43.527
application all the way through 
until you click stop.  Use the 

01:52:43.528 --> 01:52:45.799
film strip UI at the top to 
choose between the frame that 

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:47.800
you'd like 

01:52:49.090 --> 01:52:51.090
to take a deeper look at.  And 
then once you've found an 

01:52:51.937 --> 01:52:54.578
interesting frame, you can 
really dig into the details.  On

01:52:54.579 --> 01:52:57.223
the left, we've got the command 
view, so this shows every single

01:52:57.224 --> 01:53:01.927
command that contributed during 
your frame.  It's neatly 

01:53:01.928 --> 01:53:03.928
separated by frame and by 

01:53:08.361 --> 01:53:10.141
draw call, and any other 
parameters to those functions 

01:53:10.142 --> 01:53:14.008
can be changed and you can 
replay it just to see how that 

01:53:10.142 --> 01:53:12.142
might make a difference.  

01:53:14.333 --> 01:53:15.584
In the center, we've got our 
frame buffer pane.  So that 

01:53:15.585 --> 01:53:17.585
shows what the application 

01:53:20.239 --> 01:53:20.298
looks to up to the current 
command.  And that way you can 

01:53:20.299 --> 01:53:22.550
step through every single 
command.  We've added a bunch of

01:53:22.551 --> 01:53:24.282
options so you can visualize 
that frame buffer, but in a 

01:53:24.283 --> 01:53:26.283
different way, too.  You can 
edit the histogram, so if your 

01:53:27.338 --> 01:53:29.158
application is particularly 
dark, you can bring it more into

01:53:29.159 --> 01:53:31.159
the light and you can change 
those parameters.  

01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:34.229
And on the right, there are 
various tabs for your resources.

01:53:35.739 --> 01:53:37.974
So you can see the textures that
contribute to your application. 

01:53:37.975 --> 01:53:40.450
You can see every mesh.  Go and 
investigate the polygon count.

01:53:44.178 --> 01:53:46.178
You can see the number of 
vertices and triangles.  

01:53:48.903 --> 01:53:50.530
If you also want to, all the 
shades that go into building 

01:53:50.531 --> 01:53:52.966
your scene and the raw open GL 
state, you can go and look at 

01:53:52.967 --> 01:53:55.223
that, too.  
   So, let's take a look at the 

01:53:55.224 --> 01:53:58.936
concrete issue, the kind of 
thing you might see within 

01:53:58.937 --> 01:54:02.609
GAPID.  So, this is an example 
that I created from our Seattle 

01:54:02.610 --> 01:54:04.610
office.

01:54:06.108 --> 01:54:08.108
This is just an Andy hanging out
on a big chess set.

01:54:10.167 --> 01:54:12.167
It looks like just one or two 
androids just hanging out there.

01:54:13.482 --> 01:54:15.482
But a really common issue on 
mobile applications is overdraw.

01:54:18.017 --> 01:54:20.017
So, overdraw is when you shade a
pixel 

01:54:21.941 --> 01:54:23.970
multiple times, that can become 
a performance bottleneck on our 

01:54:23.971 --> 01:54:27.829
bandwidth limited mobile 
devices.  So you generally want 

01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:31.128
to shade your pixels only one, 
two, or three times.  

01:54:36.009 --> 01:54:38.871
So, how many times do we think 
-- those pixels of that front 

01:54:38.872 --> 01:54:43.382
Android actually get rendered?  
Well, it's kind of one, two, 

01:54:43.383 --> 01:54:45.383
three, 

01:54:46.438 --> 01:54:48.495
four, five, six, seven -- keeps 
going.  It actually goes all the

01:54:48.496 --> 01:54:50.496
way to 20.

01:54:53.325 --> 01:54:55.812
And that's really, really 
expensive on our mobile GP use. 

01:54:55.813 --> 01:54:57.657
So GAPID can let you see and 
check your assumptions on how 

01:54:57.658 --> 01:54:59.507
your frame is actually being 
built up.  It just lets you kind

01:54:59.508 --> 01:55:01.747
of go under the hood and see 
exactly with Sceneform and 

01:55:04.816 --> 01:55:06.816
with Unity exactly what they're 
doing.  

01:55:09.707 --> 01:55:11.126
You could render your objects 
front to back instead of back to

01:55:11.127 --> 01:55:13.775
front.  
   So I'm going to ask of you 

01:55:13.776 --> 01:55:15.776
all who 

01:55:18.263 --> 01:55:19.903
are building AR applications, 
take GAPID for a spin, go under 

01:55:19.904 --> 01:55:24.832
the hood, poke around, just 
check your assumptions.  I'm 

01:55:24.833 --> 01:55:26.833
always surprised every time I go
and take a capture.  

01:55:28.954 --> 01:55:30.976
So, if there are loadable 
features within GAPID, go ahead 

01:55:30.977 --> 01:55:32.977
and take a look at the GitHub.

01:55:36.286 --> 01:55:39.739
IO link, and we have tutorials 
on how you can do other things. 

01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:41.740
GAPID supports cardboard, 
daydream, 

01:55:44.781 --> 01:55:49.603
and vanilla android apps as well
as the Vulcan API.  

01:55:51.465 --> 01:55:52.890
Once you've debugged it and it's
looking exactly as you want, 

01:55:52.891 --> 01:55:54.891
your next step is to get it out 
into the world, so 

01:55:58.017 --> 01:56:00.017
we'll talk about that a little 
bit now.  

01:56:00.903 --> 01:56:02.114
So with AR, there are two types 
of applications you should think

01:56:02.115 --> 01:56:06.399
about when you're developing 
your AR app.  There's AR 

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:08.639
optional and AR required.  Your 
AR optional apps, they can be 

01:56:10.066 --> 01:56:12.066
installed and run on devices 
that don't 

01:56:13.336 --> 01:56:15.165
support ARCore, but you have to 
test for ARCore support if you 

01:56:15.166 --> 01:56:17.166
want to create an ARCore 
session.  

01:56:20.277 --> 01:56:22.324
On the other side, AR required 
means it can't be installed on 

01:56:22.325 --> 01:56:24.325
the device 

01:56:25.587 --> 01:56:27.587
unless that device supports 
ARCore.  

01:56:29.055 --> 01:56:31.307
So, for those devices, for AR 
optional device applications, 

01:56:31.308 --> 01:56:35.982
the onus is on you to write that
code, check to see if ARCore is 

01:56:35.983 --> 01:56:38.223
installed, and also check to see
if the device is ARCore 

01:56:38.432 --> 01:56:41.069
compatible.  So we'll go through
an example of what that code 

01:56:41.070 --> 01:56:44.151
looks like right now.  
   So, we have a very simple 

01:56:46.382 --> 01:56:48.382
availability API.

01:56:49.887 --> 01:56:51.887
You go in ARCore, check 
availability, 

01:56:54.008 --> 01:56:56.130
and you wait until that returns 
true.  If your device supports 

01:56:56.131 --> 01:56:58.564
ARCore, you can enable your UI 
widget that takes you 

01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:03.290
into your AR mode in your 
session.  

01:57:03.291 --> 01:57:06.158
But before you go and check if 
you have support, you should 

01:57:06.159 --> 01:57:10.031
check whether ARCore is actually
installed or not.  So we 

01:57:10.032 --> 01:57:12.032
basically have this simple API 

01:57:15.334 --> 01:57:16.984
that is ARCore APK request 
install.  That can tell you 

01:57:16.985 --> 01:57:20.327
whether it's installed.  If it's
not installed, it can install it

01:57:20.328 --> 01:57:22.240
in the background for you.  
   Once you've done all that, 

01:57:22.241 --> 01:57:24.241
you can 

01:57:25.363 --> 01:57:27.363
create your ARCore session as 
normal.  

01:57:30.056 --> 01:57:30.670
And so for AR required 
applications, they're really 

01:57:30.671 --> 01:57:33.545
simple.  There's really nothing 
to do.  We go and do the white 

01:57:33.546 --> 01:57:35.546
listing on the play store for 
you, so it will only be 

01:57:37.383 --> 01:57:40.029
available on devices that have 
ARCore support.  ARCore is also 

01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:42.285
installed when the app is 
installed in these cases, and 

01:57:42.286 --> 01:57:44.286
these 

01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:47.023
new devices are ARCore enabled, 
these devices will just be white

01:57:47.024 --> 01:57:49.270
listed automatically.  

01:57:52.755 --> 01:57:55.393
So, just before we finish up, we
would love to get feedback from 

01:57:55.394 --> 01:58:00.348
you on this session.  But just a
recap, we've shown you how 

01:58:04.006 --> 01:58:06.457
to build your AR applications 
really, really quickly with 

01:58:06.458 --> 01:58:09.122
Sceneform using assets from 
Poly.  We've shown you how to 

01:58:09.123 --> 01:58:11.123
iterate quickly 

01:58:12.579 --> 01:58:14.579
in the Android emulator.  

01:58:16.292 --> 01:58:18.548
We've shown you how to debug 
gnarly graphical issues in GAPID

01:58:18.549 --> 01:58:22.018
and understand what your scene 
is doing.  And we've shown you 

01:58:22.019 --> 01:58:24.019
how to ship them on the play 
store.  

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:27.220
So we probably have time for two
questions using the microphones 

01:58:27.221 --> 01:58:29.221
here, if anyone would like to 
ask any questions 

01:58:32.124 --> 01:58:34.124
about developing ARCore, to me 
and Tim.

01:58:38.265 --> 01:58:41.972
   Hi.  
   &gt;&gt; Hi.

01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:47.313
Sorry first for my awful English
.  

01:58:47.314 --> 01:58:49.314
&gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  That's okay.  

01:58:52.598 --> 01:58:54.598
&gt;&gt; I want to know if the update 
in AR 

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:57.695
apps can communicate with the 
environment.

01:59:04.465 --> 01:59:06.465
For example, if we can put the 
shadow

01:59:10.899 --> 01:59:12.899
s to correct direction, or turn 
the lamp 

01:59:16.002 --> 01:59:17.499
to -- like the furniture around.
   &gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  So there are 

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:21.560
ways to do that -- the only 
thing we support within the 

01:59:21.561 --> 01:59:25.079
Sceneform SDK is shadows being 
cast.  They will be cast onto 

01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:27.544
any plains.  We don't calculate 
where the light comes from, 

01:59:27.545 --> 01:59:31.436
though.  That would be on the 
application.  That's something 

01:59:31.437 --> 01:59:34.281
I'm very interested in, though. 

01:59:39.811 --> 01:59:41.811
&gt;&gt; Can we tell the lights in the
apps 

01:59:45.483 --> 01:59:46.802
to make the shadows around 
scenes?  

01:59:46.803 --> 01:59:49.277
&gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  That would be on
the application developer.  We 

01:59:49.278 --> 01:59:50.701
don't support it within the SDK.
But the application developer 

01:59:50.702 --> 01:59:54.818
should definitely experiment 
with that kind of stuff.  It 

01:59:54.819 --> 01:59:56.636
will make AR apps look great.  
   &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.  

01:59:56.637 --> 02:00:01.794
&gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  Thank you.  Hi. 
   &gt;&gt; Hi.  Is a plan that you 

02:00:01.795 --> 02:00:04.244
can download SFPs directly from 
Poly?  

02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:07.700
&gt;&gt; TIM PSIAKI:  So right now, 
Poly 

02:00:11.418 --> 02:00:13.686
doesn't have sfb's directly.  
You can host sfb's online 

02:00:13.687 --> 02:00:17.361
somewhere, and you can download 
them into your app, and then you

02:00:17.362 --> 02:00:19.195
can load them from there.  They 
don't have to be bundled into 

02:00:19.196 --> 02:00:21.227
your app.  But right now, 
they're not on Poly.

02:00:25.312 --> 02:00:27.312
You would have to pull down an 
fbx, a 

02:00:30.188 --> 02:00:32.254
glx, or an obj from somewhere.  
And you could host on fire base 

02:00:32.255 --> 02:00:35.938
or something like that, if you 
wanted to have an asset.  

02:00:36.549 --> 02:00:38.549
&gt;&gt; Okay.

02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:43.030
So I have to go through the 
import step -- 

02:00:44.453 --> 02:00:46.143
&gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  -- 
   &gt;&gt; TIM PSIAKI:  Right now, 

02:00:46.144 --> 02:00:48.989
you do have to go through the 
import step to turn it into an 

02:00:48.990 --> 02:00:50.990
sfb.

02:00:52.067 --> 02:00:53.314
You don't want your asset to 
just look the way it looks by 

02:00:53.315 --> 02:00:56.431
default.  You may want to tweak 
the material.  You may want to 

02:00:56.432 --> 02:01:01.959
tweak the scale.  These assets, 
when you put them into AR, the 

02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:04.024
scale is going to be the world 
scale, and so you want it to 

02:01:04.025 --> 02:01:06.091
look -- you want it to be scaled
to the size you want in AR.

02:01:11.211 --> 02:01:13.476
So if your asset says it's 
500-something-wide, that's going

02:01:13.477 --> 02:01:17.386
to be 500 meters wide, you might
need to scale it down.  So 

02:01:17.387 --> 02:01:19.828
that's why we think the viewer 
is really helpful in order to 

02:01:19.829 --> 02:01:23.934
set up your asset correctly.  
   &gt;&gt; Thank you.  

02:01:24.551 --> 02:01:26.986
&gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  One more.  
   &gt;&gt; Hi.

02:01:31.347 --> 02:01:33.347
I'm a developer for wayWayfair, 
and we 

02:01:36.499 --> 02:01:38.499
have all our models hosted as 
glpf's.

02:01:39.569 --> 02:01:40.996
So is there a way to make sfb 
run time, so as soon as a person

02:01:40.997 --> 02:01:43.839
chooses a product, I download 
the gltf, and then 

02:01:48.341 --> 02:01:50.341
generate the sfb or sfa's during
run time.  

02:01:51.054 --> 02:01:52.710
&gt;&gt; TIM PSIAKI:  So gltf isn't 
really an optimized run time 

02:01:52.711 --> 02:01:55.359
format, right?  So we want to 
optimize that so it can 

02:01:59.227 --> 02:02:02.929
load really fast, and so it can 
run well on your mobile app.  

02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:04.930
And so we don't currently 
support a 

02:02:09.511 --> 02:02:11.158
way of loading gltf's, fbx's in 
run time.  You would need to 

02:02:11.159 --> 02:02:13.159
convert those into 

02:02:15.225 --> 02:02:16.847
sfb's, and then you could load 
them.  They could still be 

02:02:16.848 --> 02:02:19.307
hosted online or something like 
that, but it would need to be 

02:02:19.308 --> 02:02:21.308
converted first.  
   &gt;&gt; Thank you.  

02:02:21.549 --> 02:02:23.549
&gt;&gt; TOM SALTER:  All right.  
Thanks, everyone.  

02:02:23.999 --> 02:02:29.113
&gt;&gt; TIM PSIAKI:  Thanks a lot.

   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Hello, 
everyone.  How are you all 

02:23:49.351 --> 02:23:51.351
today?  It's the last day.

02:23:55.048 --> 02:23:56.866
Sad it's the last day?  I am.  
It always goes so quick.  

02:23:56.867 --> 02:23:58.867
Good morning.  My name is Jenny 
Gove, and I'm a lead 

02:24:02.386 --> 02:24:03.199
researcher on the Google Pay 
team.  

02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:04.824
&gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  Hello, 
everyone.  I'm Brandon Herring, 

02:24:04.825 --> 02:24:07.111
the design lead for Google Pay. 
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  And today 

02:24:07.112 --> 02:24:10.779
we're going to look at how to 
design great payment experiences

02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:15.278
with Google Pay.  We're going to
cover what we've learned with 

02:24:15.279 --> 02:24:16.917
partner integrations, and 
integrating Google Pay into some

02:24:16.918 --> 02:24:18.959
of our own products, and we'll 
talk about how 

02:24:22.413 --> 02:24:23.655
you can easily create great 
checkout experiences to get 

02:24:23.656 --> 02:24:28.583
great results.  
   Through watching many 

02:24:28.584 --> 02:24:32.722
usability studies over the 
years, I'm well aware that 

02:24:32.723 --> 02:24:34.723
e-commerce experiences can be 
the 

02:24:35.841 --> 02:24:38.496
high point of frustration for 
users.  That's because they're 

02:24:38.497 --> 02:24:43.791
often a low point of the entire 
shopping experience.  There's 

02:24:43.792 --> 02:24:46.425
friction everywhere.  You start 
typing in information, but 

02:24:48.303 --> 02:24:52.367
something's wrong, right?  Red 
arrows appear in the forms.  

02:24:52.368 --> 02:24:55.255
Addresses don't match, so you 
try again.  You add your credit 

02:24:55.256 --> 02:25:01.392
card number, but it's wrong.  
And so you try that again.  You 

02:25:01.393 --> 02:25:03.225
need to create an account.  But 
the password isn't strong 

02:25:03.226 --> 02:25:07.725
enough, and you get told that, 
and you need to think again.  Or

02:25:07.726 --> 02:25:09.577
the two passwords don't match.  
Or you already have a password, 

02:25:09.578 --> 02:25:11.578
but 

02:25:12.668 --> 02:25:15.359
you can't remember it.  
   Every one of these 

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:20.051
experiences represents an 
opportunity for a user to decide

02:25:20.052 --> 02:25:22.295
it's not worth it.  At every red
arrow, at every point of 

02:25:24.539 --> 02:25:27.801
friction, users can abandon 
their purchase.  This results in

02:25:27.802 --> 02:25:32.476
lost sales for retailers and 
lots of irritation for users.  

02:25:32.477 --> 02:25:36.764
   In fact, we recently did an 
audit in Europe of more than 400

02:25:36.765 --> 02:25:38.765
top sites and 

02:25:40.457 --> 02:25:42.509
found that very many of the 
basic things that we should do 

02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:44.753
correctly for forms are not 
being implemented.  

02:25:50.703 --> 02:25:52.703
For example, we found that 46% 
of top 

02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:56.512
sites don't implement error 
messaging in realtime.  So, when

02:25:56.513 --> 02:25:58.358
users make an error, they don't 
know about it until they go to 

02:25:58.359 --> 02:26:02.025
hit that submit button, and then
they're told.  And then they 

02:26:02.026 --> 02:26:04.026
have to look for where that 
error is.  

02:26:06.733 --> 02:26:08.975
It means that almost half of the
top sites don't optimize their 

02:26:08.976 --> 02:26:10.976
error messaging for ease of 
years.

02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:16.145
And we found that 29% of sites 
don't allow users to navigate 

02:26:16.146 --> 02:26:18.146
back and forth 

02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:21.867
in the flow, perhaps in the 
checkout experience, without 

02:26:21.868 --> 02:26:23.939
losing information that they've 
already entered.  

02:26:26.572 --> 02:26:29.450
So these types of issues lead to
much frustration for users who 

02:26:29.451 --> 02:26:32.318
are trying to complete their 
transaction.

02:26:35.565 --> 02:26:38.223
So it's no wonder that 69% of 
digital carts are abandoned 

02:26:38.224 --> 02:26:41.892
before the purchase has been 
completed.  These numbers 

02:26:41.893 --> 02:26:43.328
represent a significant 
opportunity to improve the 

02:26:43.329 --> 02:26:45.329
experience 

02:26:46.376 --> 02:26:48.267
for consumers and to create 
checkout flows that bring 

02:26:48.268 --> 02:26:50.268
delight in their simplicity.  

02:26:52.979 --> 02:26:54.979
Earlier this year, we announced 
that 

02:26:56.675 --> 02:26:59.337
we'd unified our payment system 
and products under one brand, 

02:26:59.338 --> 02:27:01.562
Google Pay.  And today, we want 
to talk to you 

02:27:04.650 --> 02:27:06.650
about how Google Pay is changing
the way 

02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:10.140
people pay for things online and
in stores.

02:27:12.626 --> 02:27:15.511
   &gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  So 
Google Pay gives users one place

02:27:15.512 --> 02:27:17.512
to easily manage all their 
payment information.

02:27:20.016 --> 02:27:21.637
From seeing their latest cards 
and keeping sure that they're up

02:27:21.638 --> 02:27:25.737
to date, to seeing their latest 
transactions, Google Pay is 

02:27:25.738 --> 02:27:27.738
giving users a flexible and 

02:27:29.553 --> 02:27:33.737
comprehensive digital wallet.  
   Users, they can leverage this

02:27:33.738 --> 02:27:35.738
account information to speed 
through checkout.

02:27:39.497 --> 02:27:41.497
In apps, online, and in store.

02:27:42.606 --> 02:27:45.256
The app already has more than 
100 million installs, which is 

02:27:45.257 --> 02:27:48.132
incredible.  That's enabling top
merchants from 

02:27:51.611 --> 02:27:54.471
Door Dash, to Lyft, to Airbnb, 
and a lot more to enable 

02:27:54.472 --> 02:27:56.472
seamless checkouts for their 
users.  

02:27:56.938 --> 02:27:58.770
And, Google Pay is powering 
transactions across our first 

02:27:58.771 --> 02:28:02.719
party properties, from the 
Google Assistant to the Play 

02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:04.758
Store, Chrome, YouTube, and 
more.  

02:28:06.588 --> 02:28:08.224
When developers implement Google
Pay, they can create experiences

02:28:08.225 --> 02:28:12.129
without payment forms.  Super 
easy for users, really easy for 

02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:15.817
developers to implement.  And 
users, with a payment method 

02:28:17.478 --> 02:28:19.104
linked to their Google account, 
can check out instantly anywhere

02:28:19.105 --> 02:28:22.834
they see the Google Pay button. 
And because hundreds of millions

02:28:22.835 --> 02:28:26.313
of payment methods are already 
saved to Google accounts today, 

02:28:26.314 --> 02:28:28.314
developers can 

02:28:31.825 --> 02:28:32.387
start to implement this solution
across the globe immediately and

02:28:32.388 --> 02:28:34.388
deliver at 

02:28:43.330 --> 02:28:44.411
Google scale.  
   With Google Pay, users are 

02:28:44.412 --> 02:28:46.412
instantly ready to check out the
first time they 

02:28:50.346 --> 02:28:52.544
visit an app or site or even in 
guest checkout flow, they no 

02:28:52.545 --> 02:28:56.611
longer need to add a payment 
method to every single merchant 

02:28:52.545 --> 02:28:56.678
that they want to transact with.
They can zip through checkout 

02:28:52.545 --> 02:28:53.554
quickly and easily.  
   And with less friction, the 

02:28:53.555 --> 02:28:57.245
user experience is improved, 
users are happier, and 

02:28:57.246 --> 02:28:58.685
transactions increase, and we're
seeing this already validated 

02:28:58.686 --> 02:29:00.722
with a lot of our partners.  

02:29:04.384 --> 02:29:05.608
Hotel Tonight has found that 
customers who were enabled with 

02:29:05.609 --> 02:29:11.712
Google Pay were 65% more likely 
to complete a booking flow.  

02:29:11.713 --> 02:29:13.961
Airbnb has seen their traction 
volume jump 11 times since 

02:29:13.962 --> 02:29:18.054
implementing the latest version 
of Google Pay.  And Jenny is 

02:29:18.055 --> 02:29:20.055
going to tell us a little bit 
about how we got there.  

02:29:20.692 --> 02:29:23.179
&gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Thank you, 
Brandon.  So we're going to talk

02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:25.830
about some of the best 
principles that went into 

02:29:28.289 --> 02:29:30.304
creating Google Pay, the 
practices around how you can 

02:29:30.305 --> 02:29:32.558
develop great checkout 
experiences with the system 

02:29:34.596 --> 02:29:36.596
effectively, and a little bit 
about how 

02:29:37.629 --> 02:29:39.629
Google Pay is enabling assistive

02:29:41.082 --> 02:29:43.082
transactions with voice

02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:45.652
.  Because consumer products are
dependent on the user 

02:29:45.653 --> 02:29:48.132
experience, we started with a 
user-focused approach to meet 

02:29:48.133 --> 02:29:53.640
those needs. 
   Because consumer products are

02:29:53.641 --> 02:29:57.107
dependent on the user 
experience, we started with a 

02:29:53.641 --> 02:29:55.533
user-focused approach to meet 
those needs.  We began defining 

02:29:55.534 --> 02:29:57.534
an overall vision of what we 
wanted to do to create safe and 

02:29:58.801 --> 02:30:00.862
easy checkout experiences for 
everyone, everywhere.  

02:30:02.888 --> 02:30:05.735
We informed our vision through 
conducting foundational 

02:30:05.736 --> 02:30:10.429
research.  And then we carried 
our learnings from this into our

02:30:10.430 --> 02:30:12.430
design work.

02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:15.139
And then we iterated on the 
designs all informed through 

02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:18.417
user testing and usability 
testing.  And we published 

02:30:18.418 --> 02:30:23.331
developer guidelines for our 
community of developers.  We're 

02:30:23.332 --> 02:30:25.161
continuing to update and improve
and optimize our platform for 

02:30:25.162 --> 02:30:28.420
consumers and for developers.  
Let's look at this user-centered

02:30:30.251 --> 02:30:31.873
approach again with more 
specifics about the activities 

02:30:31.874 --> 02:30:33.874
that we took for each phase.  

02:30:36.383 --> 02:30:38.852
So our first step involved 
conducting research to 

02:30:38.853 --> 02:30:43.126
understand the broader picture, 
the user's needs around payments

02:30:43.127 --> 02:30:44.764
in their lives, and we visited 
different regions across the 

02:30:44.765 --> 02:30:46.765
globe.

02:30:48.028 --> 02:30:50.275
We went to Europe and North and 
South America and we visited 

02:30:50.276 --> 02:30:52.276
Asia, and we 

02:30:53.772 --> 02:30:55.441
explored users' payment methods 
and needs through conducting 

02:30:55.442 --> 02:31:00.135
research there.  We learned 
about the importance of speed 

02:31:00.136 --> 02:31:02.620
and efficiency, security and 
privacy, and these learnings 

02:31:02.621 --> 02:31:05.868
have really shaped the design 
work that we've done for Google 

02:31:05.869 --> 02:31:10.417
Pay.  
   Taking these learnings, we 

02:31:12.037 --> 02:31:14.071
established a set of principles 
and created a design system that

02:31:14.072 --> 02:31:18.997
would meet those needs, and we 
tested our designs with 

02:31:18.998 --> 02:31:21.252
usability studies.  
   In key phases of the product 

02:31:23.488 --> 02:31:25.942
development, we ran studies 
every two weeks, iterating as we

02:31:25.943 --> 02:31:27.943
uncovered issues, 

02:31:29.031 --> 02:31:31.487
and we could make improvements 
to the product.  We dedicated 

02:31:31.488 --> 02:31:33.488
ourselves to the details 

02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:36.540
and to getting it right with our
users.  

02:31:37.221 --> 02:31:39.221
We also iterated through 
conducting 

02:31:40.227 --> 02:31:44.969
liveing live experiments with 
our partners and used this to 

02:31:44.970 --> 02:31:47.222
inform our design decisions.  
Based on all our learnings 

02:31:47.223 --> 02:31:51.130
throughout this process, we 
published guidelines for 

02:31:51.131 --> 02:31:53.131
developers in order to take 
advantage of this work and make 

02:31:57.407 --> 02:31:58.723
implementation clear and easy.  
   &gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  So, 

02:31:58.724 --> 02:32:02.413
let's take a look at some of the
principles that we established 

02:32:02.414 --> 02:32:04.414
that guided us through the 

02:32:06.122 --> 02:32:07.362
process Jenny just talked about.
   First and foremost, Google 

02:32:07.363 --> 02:32:10.031
Pay has to be fast.  We know 
users want a quick and easy 

02:32:12.305 --> 02:32:14.210
checkout flow and experience 
online.  We want to remove that 

02:32:14.211 --> 02:32:16.473
friction with a lightweight UI 
that's super intuitive to 

02:32:20.583 --> 02:32:23.216
use and easy for users.  And 
we've seen this in practice, 

02:32:23.217 --> 02:32:28.387
with Gametime, which is an app 
that allows users to purchase 

02:32:28.388 --> 02:32:30.388
tickets for games and concerts 
they want to go to.

02:32:32.829 --> 02:32:35.145
Google Pay is front and center 
the moment they encounter an 

02:32:35.146 --> 02:32:37.146
event they want to attend.

02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:43.293
Even before they're signed in, 
they're already ready to pay.  

02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:41.194
   Because of this, users can 
check out and purchase their 

02:32:41.195 --> 02:32:43.051
tickets in only two taps.  
Google Pay loads a lightweight 

02:32:43.052 --> 02:32:46.127
UI, it shows them their account,
the payment method they're going

02:32:46.128 --> 02:32:50.624
to use, one more tap, they're 
done.  It's really fast, it's 

02:32:50.625 --> 02:32:52.625
super easy, and 

02:32:54.316 --> 02:32:55.345
that means for game time users, 
all they really need to worry 

02:32:55.346 --> 02:32:57.346
about is whether or not their 
favorite team is going to make 

02:32:58.036 --> 02:33:00.877
the playoffs this year.  And I'm
optimistic about mine.  So, 

02:33:00.878 --> 02:33:02.878
fingers crossed there.  

02:33:05.187 --> 02:33:07.024
This is obviously great for 
users, but this efficiency also 

02:33:07.025 --> 02:33:09.944
leads to results.  Gametime 
found that users who had 

02:33:13.033 --> 02:33:14.463
Google Pay were two times higher
to convert than users who just 

02:33:14.464 --> 02:33:19.566
had a payment card saved to 
Gametime.  So in other words, 

02:33:19.567 --> 02:33:24.075
even when a user already has a 
payment method saved with a 

02:33:24.076 --> 02:33:25.701
merchant, the seamlessness that 
Google Pay can offer leads to a 

02:33:25.702 --> 02:33:28.949
higher conversion rate.  
   The second principle was 

02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:32.871
around scale.  So, this meant a 
few things to us.  We needed to 

02:33:32.872 --> 02:33:34.872
address a global audience.  We 
needed to support a variety of 

02:33:35.363 --> 02:33:38.664
payment methods.  We also needed
to create a place where users 

02:33:38.665 --> 02:33:40.315
can update their payment 
information once and have it 

02:33:40.316 --> 02:33:43.595
available anywhere they sign in.
   And of course, we also need 

02:33:43.596 --> 02:33:45.596
to make sure we're supporting 
more than just the 

02:33:48.538 --> 02:33:50.779
android ecosystem, that we're 
cross-browser and across OS, 

02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:52.780
some of which we announced this 
week.  

02:33:54.249 --> 02:33:56.068
So we have to enable users to 
check out quickly and easily, no

02:33:56.069 --> 02:33:58.542
matter where they are.  With our
first party integrations, we 

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
already support a wide variety 
of 

02:34:03.958 --> 02:34:05.387
payment methods, and we're 
bringing the scaleability to 

02:34:05.388 --> 02:34:08.447
developers, letting users pick 
however they want to pay, from 

02:34:08.448 --> 02:34:10.884
leveraging all the payment 
methods they have on file with 

02:34:10.885 --> 02:34:13.123
Google, to new experiences like 
e-money for in-store in 

02:34:18.778 --> 02:34:22.347
Japan and Paypal for in-store.  
   We make it really easy to 

02:34:22.348 --> 02:34:26.291
implement buttons that lets 
developers reach a global 

02:34:26.292 --> 02:34:27.722
audience, and we've made it 
really easy to manage your 

02:34:27.723 --> 02:34:29.723
payment methods, too.  Now users
can update that information 

02:34:33.846 --> 02:34:35.892
in the Google Pay app, iOS or 
Android, or on the Google Pay 

02:34:35.893 --> 02:34:37.114
web and have that immediately 
available anywhere they're 

02:34:37.115 --> 02:34:40.820
signed in.  This is a huge win 
for users, but it's a really big

02:34:40.821 --> 02:34:43.465
win for developers because it 
ensures that a user's payment 

02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:46.956
information is going to be 
available and work any app or 

02:34:46.957 --> 02:34:48.957
site that they want to transact 
with.  

02:34:52.689 --> 02:34:54.325
And, of course, Google Pay needs
to work anywhere they can access

02:34:54.326 --> 02:34:59.425
their Google account.  So across
operating systems to Android, to

02:34:59.426 --> 02:35:01.712
OIS, which we just announced, 
and browsers, beyond just 

02:35:05.589 --> 02:35:07.227
Chrome, but into Safari, 
Firefox, and more.  This expands

02:35:07.228 --> 02:35:09.478
the reach that developers have 
and it increases the user 

02:35:09.479 --> 02:35:12.581
benefit. iOS, which we just 
announced, and browsers, beyond 

02:35:12.582 --> 02:35:16.715
just Chrome, but into Safari, 
Firefox, and more.  This expands

02:35:12.582 --> 02:35:16.382
the reach that developers have 
and it increases the user 

02:35:12.582 --> 02:35:14.838
benefit.  
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Now, we know 

02:35:14.839 --> 02:35:17.485
from conducting research that 
one of the 

02:35:20.538 --> 02:35:22.538
single biggest concerns that 
users have 

02:35:24.618 --> 02:35:26.504
with digital payments is around 
security.  And we've worked hard

02:35:26.505 --> 02:35:29.168
to give users the security, 
transparency, and control 

02:35:33.798 --> 02:35:37.450
they need to feel confident in 
each transaction.  The 

02:35:37.451 --> 02:35:39.365
importance of security, as I 
mentioned, comes up again and 

02:35:39.366 --> 02:35:42.404
again in user research.  We know
that it's both important to be 

02:35:45.088 --> 02:35:47.088
secure, but also to convey that 
security to users.  

02:35:48.427 --> 02:35:53.111
With Google Pay, we meet these 
needs from the base up.  From 

02:35:53.112 --> 02:35:55.112
secure storage infrastructure, 

02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:57.608
card tokenization, and 
authenticate, through 

02:35:57.609 --> 02:36:00.466
communications such as 
notification, and supplemental 

02:36:02.125 --> 02:36:03.955
technologies such as device 
security.  So let's take a 

02:36:03.956 --> 02:36:07.226
closer look.  
   As you'd expect, Google Pay 

02:36:07.227 --> 02:36:11.527
rests on Google's secure data 
storage infrastructure using 

02:36:11.528 --> 02:36:15.231
industry standard encryption to 
keep your payment details safe. 

02:36:18.330 --> 02:36:20.768
For transactions, we support and
encourage tokenization for 

02:36:20.769 --> 02:36:23.618
in-store and online use cases.  
Users transacting with cards 

02:36:23.619 --> 02:36:25.619
issued 

02:36:26.730 --> 02:36:29.382
from supporting banks can 
tokenize these in the Google Pay

02:36:29.383 --> 02:36:32.023
app, and then transmit a virtual
account number, the token, 

02:36:34.258 --> 02:36:35.891
instead of their real one when 
they pay at participating 

02:36:35.892 --> 02:36:38.523
merchants.  We've also worked 
with payment 

02:36:43.076 --> 02:36:43.682
gateways and processors to 
securely transmit payment 

02:36:43.683 --> 02:36:46.317
credentials online.  
   But beyond the actual 

02:36:46.318 --> 02:36:51.003
underlying technology, it's 
important to reinforce security 

02:36:51.004 --> 02:36:53.036
through conveying information 
about transactions 

02:36:53.037 --> 02:36:55.037
transparently.

02:36:56.345 --> 02:36:58.991
We provide transaction 
notifications for supported 

02:36:58.992 --> 02:37:04.353
cards, so consumers know if a 
transaction is being made.  

02:37:04.354 --> 02:37:06.420
Notifications is just one of the
ways that we're communicating 

02:37:06.421 --> 02:37:08.421
transactions to users.

02:37:11.132 --> 02:37:13.132
We're also combining the 
transaction 

02:37:14.756 --> 02:37:16.756
history akrosz

02:37:19.168 --> 02:37:21.003
kroszcross Google Pay 
properties, and this provides a 

02:37:21.004 --> 02:37:23.004
new destination for users to 
view their transactions.  

02:37:25.907 --> 02:37:28.337
Device security is also 
important to users when 

02:37:28.338 --> 02:37:31.214
considering payments.  Android 
users can use the find my 

02:37:34.303 --> 02:37:36.145
device service to remotely 
locate a remote device, and one 

02:37:36.146 --> 02:37:38.404
that's associated with a Google 
account, and then they can 

02:37:41.861 --> 02:37:44.515
secure that device immediately 
remotely from a distance.  

02:37:46.956 --> 02:37:48.789
And in terms of user 
authenticate, we're currently 

02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:50.790
exploring different practices.

02:37:52.274 --> 02:37:53.893
For example, in the Play Store, 
we've implemented user control 

02:37:53.894 --> 02:37:58.195
options for the scheduling of 
authentication, as you can see 

02:37:58.196 --> 02:38:02.120
here.  Users can choose to 
authenticate on purchases on 

02:38:02.121 --> 02:38:04.121
Google Pay on their device, 

02:38:07.162 --> 02:38:08.908
and set a schedule for when this
happens.  

02:38:08.909 --> 02:38:11.157
And there's the option to switch
from password to fingerprint 

02:38:11.158 --> 02:38:13.200
authentication as they purchase.
Here you can see this option in 

02:38:16.466 --> 02:38:18.548
settings, and the request for a 
password to confirm that, and 

02:38:18.549 --> 02:38:20.549
then in the third screen, the 
confirmation that the 

02:38:21.405 --> 02:38:23.405
fingerprint authentication has 
been selected.  

02:38:24.890 --> 02:38:26.527
The user now has their new 
fingerprint authentication 

02:38:26.528 --> 02:38:28.528
option as 

02:38:29.776 --> 02:38:31.000
they purchase, so we're giving 
users security, but also 

02:38:31.001 --> 02:38:33.001
convenience within 

02:38:34.602 --> 02:38:37.332
their checkout flow.  
   Google Pay is secured in 

02:38:37.333 --> 02:38:41.228
multiple ways and we're 
continually learning about and 

02:38:41.229 --> 02:38:43.229
improving the way we convey 

02:38:44.687 --> 02:38:46.357
that security to our consumers 
so that they can transact with 

02:38:46.358 --> 02:38:48.358
confidence, and all of this 
means that when users seek 

02:38:50.711 --> 02:38:52.711
Google Pay in your app or on 
your site, 

02:38:54.361 --> 02:38:56.608
they're more likely to choose it
as a way to pay because they 

02:38:56.609 --> 02:38:58.609
trust it to handle their 
transactions securely, as 

02:39:02.481 --> 02:39:04.236
well as quickly and easily.  
   The last principle that we're

02:39:04.237 --> 02:39:07.727
going to review here is about 
delivering an experience that's 

02:39:07.728 --> 02:39:09.960
unified.  We've unified our 
services, and we've 

02:39:13.393 --> 02:39:15.455
also made it simpler for users 
to get started and to pay 

02:39:15.456 --> 02:39:17.456
anywhere with their 

02:39:19.154 --> 02:39:21.843
Google account.  Specifically, 
we've created a singular 

02:39:23.466 --> 02:39:25.977
destination which brings 
together all of the payment 

02:39:25.978 --> 02:39:28.643
activity under this unified 
brand, and in addition, we've 

02:39:28.644 --> 02:39:35.372
added new payment use cases and 
functionality to our app.  

02:39:37.207 --> 02:39:39.510
When we talked about security 
just now, we talked about the 

02:39:39.511 --> 02:39:41.974
principle of transparency being 
important, and one way we're 

02:39:41.975 --> 02:39:43.975
achieving this through Google 

02:39:45.827 --> 02:39:47.470
Pay is with this unified 
destination, for users to see 

02:39:47.471 --> 02:39:53.190
and manage their payment 
information and activity.  

02:39:53.191 --> 02:39:55.873
Having an overview for 
transactions and payment methods

02:39:55.874 --> 02:39:58.736
gives users a lot of peace of 
mind, we found.  With the Google

02:39:58.737 --> 02:40:00.737
Pay app, we brought 

02:40:04.206 --> 02:40:06.210
together all the functionality 
relevant to people's broader 

02:40:06.211 --> 02:40:08.091
payment experiences.  
   The home screen of the Google

02:40:08.092 --> 02:40:10.092
Pay app 

02:40:11.141 --> 02:40:12.170
shows the user's in-store 
payment methods as well as 

02:40:12.171 --> 02:40:14.171
helpful information like their 
latest transactions that 

02:40:16.647 --> 02:40:19.114
they've made, and contextual 
information like nearby places 

02:40:19.115 --> 02:40:23.408
that they can use stored loyalty
cards or stored gift cards.  

02:40:23.409 --> 02:40:28.130
   With Google Pay, users now 
have the ability to see and 

02:40:28.131 --> 02:40:30.131
manage all of their 

02:40:32.018 --> 02:40:33.662
payment information, from tokens
for in-store payments, to 

02:40:33.663 --> 02:40:36.535
payment methods they've already 
stored in their Google account.

02:40:39.609 --> 02:40:41.248
This is also where users can fix
anything that requires their 

02:40:41.249 --> 02:40:43.249
attention, such as updating 
existing cards or 

02:40:47.158 --> 02:40:49.158
adding new cards to their 
account.  

02:40:49.255 --> 02:40:51.255
In addition to storing merchant 

02:40:53.157 --> 02:40:55.786
loyalty cards, Google Pay now 
stores tickets, so concert 

02:40:55.787 --> 02:40:57.787
tickets, sporting 

02:40:58.794 --> 02:41:00.794
tickets

02:41:02.411 --> 02:41:04.411
, train and plane tickets.  
These can all be kept in one 

02:41:05.687 --> 02:41:07.687
easy-to-find case, and they can 
be 

02:41:09.561 --> 02:41:11.204
redeemed through barcodes, or 
NFC.  Peer-to-peer payment 

02:41:11.205 --> 02:41:13.450
functionality will also be soon 
fully integrated into 

02:41:17.892 --> 02:41:20.175
Google Pay, making easier to pay
friends back or family back for 

02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:23.657
shared expenses.  
   And recently, we've launched 

02:41:23.658 --> 02:41:28.987
new experiences supporting 
mobile transit in cities like 

02:41:28.988 --> 02:41:30.988
London, Las Vegas, and 

02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:34.819
Portland, and additional transit
agencies are coming onboard, 

02:41:34.820 --> 02:41:37.680
such as tram, metro rail and bus
systems, in 

02:41:42.792 --> 02:41:43.402
Birmingham, and the entirety of 
the west midlands in the UK.  

02:41:43.403 --> 02:41:47.671
   And supporting transit, 
loyalty, and paying friends 

02:41:47.672 --> 02:41:50.512
means that Google Pay can be 
relied upon by hundreds of 

02:41:50.513 --> 02:41:52.513
millions 

02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:55.560
of users as a daily transaction 
tool.

02:41:57.464 --> 02:41:59.947
And in this, we're building 
invested users and a trusted 

02:41:59.948 --> 02:42:02.001
ecosystem for your businesses to
rely on.  

02:42:04.635 --> 02:42:07.283
And this adds up to a 
comprehensive payment solution 

02:42:07.284 --> 02:42:12.379
that keeps users engaged and 
they're ready to pay anywhere.  

02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:15.234
   &gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  Great.  
So, I want to do a quick demo, 

02:42:15.235 --> 02:42:19.370
just to show how quick you can 
actually check out with Google 

02:42:19.371 --> 02:42:21.602
Pay.  
   So, if you can switch to the 

02:42:21.603 --> 02:42:26.126
demo, please.  
   So, I'm going to use Door 

02:42:26.127 --> 02:42:28.948
Dash today.  Jenny, are you 
getting hungry yet?  It's a 

02:42:28.949 --> 02:42:31.413
little early.  
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Yeah, 

02:42:31.414 --> 02:42:33.888
something for lunch would be 
great.  

02:42:34.912 --> 02:42:36.340
&gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  So we'll 
get some Mexican food.  All 

02:42:36.341 --> 02:42:39.409
right.  I've never added a 
payment method to this app.

02:42:43.846 --> 02:42:45.846
I'm just going to get going here

02:42:47.223 --> 02:42:49.223
.  Do a quesadilla, maybe 
veggie.  Add that.  

02:42:49.502 --> 02:42:51.502
&gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  That sounds 
good.

02:42:54.403 --> 02:42:54.997
Can we have something with 
chicken?  

02:42:54.998 --> 02:42:56.998
&gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  Yes.

02:42:58.275 --> 02:43:01.173
How about, let's do a burrito 
with chicken.  Sounds good.  All

02:43:01.174 --> 02:43:03.174
right.

02:43:05.645 --> 02:43:07.974
I'm going to add that to my cart
.  And so now I'm going to go 

02:43:07.975 --> 02:43:09.975
check out my cart.

02:43:11.430 --> 02:43:13.714
And everything there looks 
great.  So, I'm going to check 

02:43:13.715 --> 02:43:17.408
out.  And this is the point 
where as a user, I start to 

02:43:17.409 --> 02:43:21.303
sweat.  My heart rate goes up, 
because I know there's a form 

02:43:21.304 --> 02:43:25.371
that's going to ask for all this
information.  But, when I look 

02:43:25.372 --> 02:43:28.248
here, I'm actually already ready
to pay, because I have Google 

02:43:28.249 --> 02:43:30.249
Pay on this phone.  

02:43:34.298 --> 02:43:35.732
So I'm going to just place the 
order, and that's it.  I'm 

02:43:35.733 --> 02:43:37.146
actually not going to continue 
because I don't think we'll get 

02:43:37.147 --> 02:43:40.655
to where this food is going to 
be delivered in time.  But if I 

02:43:40.656 --> 02:43:42.656
hit this button, the burritos 
are on the way.  

02:43:43.700 --> 02:43:48.243
So if we could switch back to 
the slides now.  Thank you.  

02:43:48.244 --> 02:43:50.244
   So, I just want to highlight 
a couple 

02:43:53.344 --> 02:43:56.603
of things that I think Door Dash
did pretty well in this flow.  

02:43:56.604 --> 02:43:58.604
First, when I was -- when I 
looked at 

02:43:59.713 --> 02:44:01.152
my cart, they surfaced all the 
relevant details and made it 

02:44:01.153 --> 02:44:03.198
really easy to review.  This is 
a really critical step to make 

02:44:04.631 --> 02:44:06.482
sure you're not surprising 
users, and I'm actually going to

02:44:06.483 --> 02:44:09.557
talk a little about this more 
later.  But they made it really 

02:44:09.558 --> 02:44:13.220
easy to see what I ordered, if I
had special orders, special 

02:44:13.221 --> 02:44:15.453
requests, fees associated with 
that, the tax, delivery, et 

02:44:15.454 --> 02:44:17.687
cetera.  
   And then when I got to check 

02:44:17.688 --> 02:44:21.208
out, they just defaulted me to 
Google Pay.  As a user, I didn't

02:44:21.209 --> 02:44:23.479
have to think about it.  I 
didn't have to say, oh, maybe 

02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:25.523
I'll try Google Pay.  It just 
was already there, and it 

02:44:25.726 --> 02:44:29.599
worked.  This is a huge benefit 
to having to avoid checkout, 

02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:32.460
having to make users think about
it, right?  It avoided forms, 

02:44:32.461 --> 02:44:36.992
and it kept the entire flow 
really, really smooth.  

02:44:38.829 --> 02:44:40.829
Of course, you can start to 
leverage 

02:44:42.079 --> 02:44:45.953
this immediately with the site 
g.co/pay/developers.  That's got

02:44:45.954 --> 02:44:47.954
all the API details for you 

02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:54.587
to check out.  
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  All right.  

02:44:54.588 --> 02:44:57.047
Now, unfortunately, we know, of 
course, that forms aren't going 

02:44:57.048 --> 02:45:01.393
away.  But when a user does 
encounter a payment form, we've 

02:45:01.394 --> 02:45:04.038
made lots of improvements to the
experience and made 

02:45:07.716 --> 02:45:09.716
Autofill an integral part of 
Google Pay.

02:45:11.197 --> 02:45:13.635
Users really appreciate it when 
websites save them time by 

02:45:13.636 --> 02:45:15.636
automatically 

02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:19.152
filling common form fill, things
like names, addresses, and 

02:45:19.153 --> 02:45:21.153
credit card information.  

02:45:22.654 --> 02:45:25.307
And so Autofill happens to 
bypass all those input errors we

02:45:25.308 --> 02:45:27.584
talked about before.  And these 
can be, as you know, 

02:45:29.228 --> 02:45:30.650
particularly prevalent on 
virtual keyboards and small 

02:45:30.651 --> 02:45:32.651
devices.  

02:45:38.019 --> 02:45:39.447
Chrome has billions of 30-day 
active devices around the world,

02:45:39.448 --> 02:45:44.536
and those users of those devices
are already checking out with 

02:45:44.537 --> 02:45:50.067
merchants online.  And so this 
is a significant pathway to 

02:45:50.068 --> 02:45:52.511
enabling seamless payments 
everywhere a user is signed in 

02:45:52.512 --> 02:45:54.512
to Google.  

02:45:59.030 --> 02:46:00.255
Our research found that by 
correctly using autocomplete 

02:46:00.256 --> 02:46:04.757
attributes on your forms, users 
complete them up to 30% faster. 

02:46:04.758 --> 02:46:06.584
So by ensuring the autocomplete 
process is working correctly, 

02:46:06.585 --> 02:46:10.961
you can improve the online 
experience for your users.  

02:46:12.807 --> 02:46:15.106
As developers, you can give 
hints to the browser by 

02:46:15.107 --> 02:46:17.107
providing both the name 

02:46:18.562 --> 02:46:20.562
attribute and the autocomplete 
attribute 

02:46:22.030 --> 02:46:24.030
on each input element to help 
data be autocompleted correctly.

02:46:27.387 --> 02:46:29.387
Autocomplete attribute values 
are 

02:46:30.799 --> 02:46:35.173
part of the current wghtml 
standard.  Commonly used 

02:46:35.174 --> 02:46:37.212
attributes are shown here, and 
you can find these at the link 

02:46:37.626 --> 02:46:39.626
provided here.  

02:46:42.516 --> 02:46:46.024
Now, here are the specific 
attributes for credit cards.  

02:46:46.025 --> 02:46:48.277
One thing to take note of is 
that the attribute for the 

02:46:48.278 --> 02:46:50.278
verification or 

02:46:53.601 --> 02:46:55.601
security code is cc-csc, 
standing for card security code.

02:46:58.312 --> 02:47:01.994
It's not cc-cvc or anything 
else.  We see that sometimes.  

02:47:01.995 --> 02:47:04.031
And that simple issue can cause 
Autofill not to work 

02:47:04.032 --> 02:47:06.086
appropriately.  
   So, let's make sure you get 

02:47:06.087 --> 02:47:08.541
that one right.  
   And let me also walk you 

02:47:08.542 --> 02:47:11.410
through another example of a 
common mistake we 

02:47:14.903 --> 02:47:16.903
see made with Autofill.  

02:47:17.953 --> 02:47:19.953
Now, a user experience best 
practice 

02:47:22.052 --> 02:47:23.884
is so label form fills outside 
of the fields, like you can see 

02:47:23.885 --> 02:47:26.992
here, and that's really good 
because it's permanent reference

02:47:26.993 --> 02:47:28.993
for the user of the type of 
information that's needed in 

02:47:29.426 --> 02:47:31.426
that field.

02:47:33.293 --> 02:47:34.913
Form fills also are place 
holders, text that's shown in 

02:47:34.914 --> 02:47:38.369
the field that typically give 
examples of the sorts of data 

02:47:38.370 --> 02:47:40.806
that would be placed there.  
   We've seen developers use 

02:47:40.807 --> 02:47:46.127
fake place holders instead of 
using placeholder attributes, 

02:47:46.128 --> 02:47:48.551
and then use java script to 
remove that value.  And this 

02:47:48.552 --> 02:47:51.407
makes it hard for Autofill to 
determine if the user has 

02:47:51.408 --> 02:47:53.853
inputted the values versus it 
being default text in 

02:47:57.163 --> 02:48:00.468
the field, and it results in the
fields not being Autofilled.  So

02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:02.469
that's another one to watch out 

02:48:03.774 --> 02:48:03.971
for, make sure you use that 
placeholder attribute 

02:48:03.972 --> 02:48:07.831
appropriately.  
   So by implementing these 

02:48:07.832 --> 02:48:10.275
attributes correctly, you can 
help ensure that 

02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:14.774
users don't experience errors as
their form information is filled

02:48:14.775 --> 02:48:19.481
in.  More information on 
autocomplete attributes and some

02:48:19.482 --> 02:48:21.787
of the errors that commonly 
occur, we've got a list of them 

02:48:22.678 --> 02:48:26.759
there.  Some best practices can 
be found at this link.  

02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:30.780
So now we've talked about users 
using 

02:48:31.850 --> 02:48:34.505
their cards from Google Pay, 
Autofill.  Let's talk about how 

02:48:34.506 --> 02:48:37.583
we get cards into Google Pay via
Autofill.  When a user fills out

02:48:37.584 --> 02:48:41.854
a form, their credit card 
information is saved to their 

02:48:41.855 --> 02:48:43.678
Google account, which ensures 
that next time, the user is 

02:48:43.679 --> 02:48:47.344
ready to pay without having to 
add any card information again. 

02:48:47.345 --> 02:48:51.233
   And this saves the user very 
much time and effort in checking

02:48:51.234 --> 02:48:53.234
out.

02:48:54.757 --> 02:48:56.381
It reduces the number of 
abandoned checkout experiencing 

02:48:56.382 --> 02:49:00.243
and it grows the ecosystem, of 
course, beyond the hundreds and 

02:49:00.244 --> 02:49:02.674
millions of cards already saved 
to Google accounts.  

02:49:06.203 --> 02:49:07.440
By aligning Autofill with Google
Pay, we're ensuring users know 

02:49:07.441 --> 02:49:12.153
that the Autofill payment 
information is coming from their

02:49:12.154 --> 02:49:14.595
Google account.  The end result 
is millions of more 

02:49:18.898 --> 02:49:20.509
people, our users who are ready 
to pay, enabling frictionless 

02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:24.215
checkout experiences for users 
and merchants globally, and 

02:49:24.216 --> 02:49:28.285
that's a win/win.  
   &gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  So, how 

02:49:28.286 --> 02:49:30.752
can you as developers take full 
advantage of Google Pay?

02:49:34.047 --> 02:49:35.468
Jenny just walked through some 
really great examples of how 

02:49:35.469 --> 02:49:38.949
Autofill can really improve the 
experience when you leverage it 

02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:40.792
right, and you fill it out 
correctly, and you set it up in 

02:49:40.793 --> 02:49:43.882
a way that's going to work for 
users.  Integrating the button 

02:49:43.883 --> 02:49:47.325
is going to make that more 
seamless, because even though 

02:49:47.326 --> 02:49:49.566
Autofill is awesome, it's still 
forms, and Google Pay bypasses 

02:49:49.567 --> 02:49:52.426
forms altogether.  
   And so to be effective, there

02:49:52.427 --> 02:49:55.497
are a couple of things that I 
want to talk through that you 

02:49:55.498 --> 02:49:57.498
guys can keep in mind 

02:49:58.538 --> 02:50:00.538
when you're designing with 
Google Pay.

02:50:02.878 --> 02:50:03.830
So, first, we covered this, it's
really worth reiterating, make 

02:50:03.831 --> 02:50:05.831
Google 

02:50:07.017 --> 02:50:08.474
Pay the default payment method 
for users when they're new to 

02:50:08.475 --> 02:50:10.301
your site our app.  
   By doing this, you're going 

02:50:10.302 --> 02:50:14.980
to really create that truly 
magical experience where payment

02:50:14.981 --> 02:50:16.981
just happens.

02:50:18.022 --> 02:50:19.651
And it's not just they had to do
it.  When they're done, they 

02:50:19.652 --> 02:50:21.907
say, that was awesome.  Right?  
Users don't have to do anything,

02:50:21.908 --> 02:50:26.693
and they're ready to pay before 
they even sign in.  Which leads 

02:50:26.694 --> 02:50:28.694
to my next point.  Another 
really easy way to streamline 

02:50:30.982 --> 02:50:32.797
the payment experience is to 
allow guest checkout option for 

02:50:32.798 --> 02:50:35.448
your customers.  Account 
creation slows down the process.

02:50:37.290 --> 02:50:39.290
It's another form to fill out.  
It leads to more frustration.

02:50:42.765 --> 02:50:44.765
And card cart abandonment.  

02:50:48.177 --> 02:50:50.009
There was a recent study from an
e-commerce organization.  They 

02:50:50.010 --> 02:50:51.641
found that forced account 
creation was the second biggest 

02:50:51.642 --> 02:50:57.173
reason for cart abandonment.  
The second biggest reason.  It's

02:50:57.174 --> 02:50:59.174
a very real threat to your 
transaction volume, and when you

02:51:00.887 --> 02:51:02.719
integrate Google Pay, you just 
make it really easy for users to

02:51:02.720 --> 02:51:04.941
get through and get on with it. 
They don't have to think about 

02:51:04.942 --> 02:51:06.942
it, and they can complete that 
transaction.  

02:51:08.433 --> 02:51:10.090
Once they have a successful 
transaction, then prompt them to

02:51:10.091 --> 02:51:12.140
create an account.  But if you 
can reduce that initial 

02:51:13.768 --> 02:51:14.999
friction, it's really going to 
significantly increase your 

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.866
conversions.  

02:51:21.351 --> 02:51:23.625
Make sure you display all 
relevant transaction details.  

02:51:23.626 --> 02:51:25.270
When a user sees the drawer for 
Google Pay, that's often the 

02:51:25.271 --> 02:51:28.963
last thing they see before the 
transaction, as we saw in the 

02:51:28.964 --> 02:51:33.042
demo.  So, before they do that, 
you really want to make sure 

02:51:33.043 --> 02:51:35.043
you're eliminating any 
surprises.

02:51:37.133 --> 02:51:39.133
Any tax that exists, fees, et 
cetera.

02:51:40.608 --> 02:51:42.431
In that same study from the 
Beymard institute that I 

02:51:42.432 --> 02:51:44.920
referenced, they found that 23% 
of users abandoned purchasers 

02:51:46.356 --> 02:51:48.404
because they didn't see the 
total cost up front.  So that's 

02:51:48.405 --> 02:51:52.282
one in four folks.  So, again, 
another really easy thing you 

02:51:52.283 --> 02:51:54.283
can do that's just -- it's going
to have an impact.  

02:51:57.086 --> 02:51:59.146
This example here is from fancy,
an online shopping site.  It 

02:51:59.147 --> 02:52:00.807
shows a really good example of 
them creating a really scannable

02:52:00.808 --> 02:52:04.734
-- I can see my shipping cost, 
and if there's tax in the total 

02:52:04.735 --> 02:52:06.363
and I can see the amount -- it's
all right there.  I don't have 

02:52:06.364 --> 02:52:10.479
to think too much.  It verifies 
what I know to be true.  And 

02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:12.556
they're also showing that I'm 
going to pay with Google, and in

02:52:12.557 --> 02:52:14.820
this case, they're even showing 
that I'm 

02:52:20.202 --> 02:52:22.446
going to use my AmeEx.  
   So it's another important 

02:52:22.447 --> 02:52:24.447
point that 

02:52:25.515 --> 02:52:27.159
you can minimize consumer 
confusion.  This is especially 

02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:31.068
important when users have more 
than one card on file.  There 

02:52:31.069 --> 02:52:33.069
are a lot of ways you can 
display this information.

02:52:35.146 --> 02:52:37.185
You can use the Google Pay mark 
with the card.  You can simply 

02:52:37.186 --> 02:52:39.424
have it in a text string.  
Whatever works for your site, 

02:52:39.425 --> 02:52:43.324
your app.  But it is a really 
important thing that you can do 

02:52:43.325 --> 02:52:45.325
to just give users -- again, 
we're trying to build trust 

02:52:46.596 --> 02:52:48.624
through this process and not 
make users have to think and 

02:52:48.625 --> 02:52:51.469
say, wait, which card did I use?
What was it?  These are ways you

02:52:51.470 --> 02:52:53.470
can streamline this experience 
and keep users moving.  

02:52:54.934 --> 02:52:57.401
And then once they have made the
purchase, it's not necessarily 

02:52:57.402 --> 02:53:00.044
over from a flow standpoint.  
They may want to go find that 

02:53:00.045 --> 02:53:03.533
receipt.  They may have things 
that they need to send it to 

02:53:03.534 --> 02:53:06.193
somebody.  There's some reason. 
When they go look for that 

02:53:06.194 --> 02:53:09.049
receipt or when that receipt 
comes in, at that point, also 

02:53:09.050 --> 02:53:10.276
make sure you're being 
consistent and you're displaying

02:53:10.277 --> 02:53:12.924
this stuff the exact same way 
you displayed it throughout the 

02:53:12.925 --> 02:53:14.925
process.

02:53:15.998 --> 02:53:17.824
So, again, build that trust, 
keep users moving, don't make 

02:53:17.825 --> 02:53:19.857
them think too much about it.  I
think in this case, you also 

02:53:21.705 --> 02:53:23.119
definitely want to show the 
payment method used because at 

02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:26.794
this point, the payment has been
done, and this is going to just 

02:53:26.795 --> 02:53:32.959
give them that full context.  
   The buttons.  The Google Pay 

02:53:32.960 --> 02:53:35.401
buttons come in two flavors.  
There's a dark button, there's a

02:53:35.402 --> 02:53:39.953
light button.  In most cases, we
really recommend that you use 

02:53:39.954 --> 02:53:41.999
the dark button, because most 
sites out there and apps out 

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
there 

02:53:45.049 --> 02:53:47.049
are white and modern apps and 
sites have a lot of white space.

02:53:49.780 --> 02:53:51.780
So use that dark button, it's 
really going to stand out more.

02:53:53.833 --> 02:53:55.493
It's going to give users a 
really strong CTA.  We've seen 

02:53:55.494 --> 02:53:57.494
implementations where there's 
the white button on the white 

02:53:58.372 --> 02:53:59.816
site, and you can imagine, it 
doesn't stand out that well and 

02:53:59.817 --> 02:54:02.270
users are going to miss it.  So 
this is just another easy one, 

02:54:02.271 --> 02:54:04.539
the keep users moving through 
it, let them get on with it.  

02:54:04.540 --> 02:54:07.995
   If you do have a dark site, 
then the white button is going 

02:54:07.996 --> 02:54:13.093
to work awesome.  
   And lastly, for really quick 

02:54:13.094 --> 02:54:16.972
and easy implementation, make 
sure you're using one of our 

02:54:16.973 --> 02:54:19.209
recommended payment processors. 
In the demo yesterday, they 

02:54:19.210 --> 02:54:22.524
showed how easy it was to set up
the button.  And part of that is

02:54:22.525 --> 02:54:24.800
because these processors have 
done a lot of the logistical 

02:54:24.801 --> 02:54:29.297
work for you.  They make it 
super easy to get started, and 

02:54:29.298 --> 02:54:38.254
you can get a full list of these
guys at g.co/pay/business.  

02:54:40.084 --> 02:54:41.710
Hopefully these details have 
given you some really concrete 

02:54:41.711 --> 02:54:44.769
things you can put into place 
right now to make sure that 

02:54:44.770 --> 02:54:46.402
you're enabling customers to 
check out really quickly, really

02:54:46.403 --> 02:54:48.634
easily.  If you want to know 
more, you can go to g.

02:54:52.081 --> 02:54:54.530
co/pay/brand, and that's going 
to give you all the assets and 

02:54:54.531 --> 02:54:56.531
how to use them and make sure 
you're implementing them 

02:54:56.767 --> 02:54:58.767
correctly.  And at g.

02:55:00.911 --> 02:55:04.590
co/pay/developers, you can get 
more details about the API.  

02:55:04.591 --> 02:55:07.431
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Thank you.  
So, now we're going to take a 

02:55:07.432 --> 02:55:09.669
look at some new experiences 
with Google Pay.

02:55:13.335 --> 02:55:15.776
But before we do so, let's just 
stop to consider that the first 

02:55:15.777 --> 02:55:19.235
online digital transactions 
happened in the mid 1990s.

02:55:25.834 --> 02:55:27.834
So it's taken 20 years of 
research, 

02:55:29.843 --> 02:55:32.826
design, and optimization to get 
people comfortable with online 

02:55:32.827 --> 02:55:34.827
purchases.  

02:55:35.829 --> 02:55:37.879
The e-commerce industry has come
a long way.  And as you've seen,

02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:39.880
we at Google are hard at work 
making that even easier for our 

02:55:41.868 --> 02:55:44.151
users across a variety of 
devices.  And as device 

02:55:44.152 --> 02:55:46.152
capabilities have expanded 
beyond traditional experiences, 

02:55:48.649 --> 02:55:50.649
we've worked hard to adopt the 
lessons 

02:55:52.133 --> 02:55:52.946
of the last two decades to new 
modalities devices support.  

02:55:52.947 --> 02:55:55.193
   While the same principles of 
fast and 

02:55:58.300 --> 02:56:00.336
efficient, scaleable, security, 
and unified are just as 

02:56:00.337 --> 02:56:03.195
applicable for different 
modalities, such as voice and 

02:56:05.233 --> 02:56:07.233
conversational transactions, how
these 

02:56:09.114 --> 02:56:11.114
principles are applied must 
change.  

02:56:13.989 --> 02:56:16.023
On phones, asking users to 
reverify their identity before 

02:56:16.024 --> 02:56:18.264
completing a purchase may add 
unnecessary friction.

02:56:21.588 --> 02:56:23.427
While on a Google home, if it's 
a communal device, shared with 

02:56:23.428 --> 02:56:27.767
family or perhaps friends living
together, verifying identity 

02:56:27.768 --> 02:56:29.768
could be very 

02:56:31.677 --> 02:56:33.696
appropriate, assuring the user 
they have control over the 

02:56:33.697 --> 02:56:39.319
purchases that are made.  
   We're working towards 

02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:41.320
providing people with the 
controls to make the 

02:56:42.365 --> 02:56:44.267
right authentication decisions 
for their context.  And all of 

02:56:44.268 --> 02:56:46.268
this helps to ensure that when 
users want to make a purchase 

02:56:47.548 --> 02:56:48.783
through the assistant, the 
experience feels natural and 

02:56:48.784 --> 02:56:50.784
easy.

02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:54.733
   So, let's make a payment 
transaction 

02:56:58.385 --> 02:57:00.385
as applied to voice 
transactions.  

02:57:01.714 --> 02:57:03.154
Okay, Google, order my usual 
from Starbucks.  

02:57:03.155 --> 02:57:07.235
&gt;&gt; Hi, Jenny.  Starbucks here.  
That's one tall Earl Gray.  

02:57:07.236 --> 02:57:08.668
Anything else?  
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  No, that will

02:57:08.669 --> 02:57:11.528
be all.  Thanks.  
   &gt;&gt; And are you picking that 

02:57:11.529 --> 02:57:13.561
up at your usual Starbucks?  
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Yes.  

02:57:13.955 --> 02:57:15.955
&gt;&gt; Okay.  That will be $3.

02:57:18.811 --> 02:57:24.630
45, but the balance on your 
Starbucks card is only $1.04.  

02:57:24.631 --> 02:57:27.079
Do you want to reload your card?
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Yes.  Put $20

02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:30.332
on it.  
   &gt;&gt; Okay.  I've added $20 to 

02:57:30.333 --> 02:57:36.049
your Starbucks card with Google 
Pay.  Your total is $3.45.  Are 

02:57:36.050 --> 02:57:38.050
you ready to place the order?  
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Yes.  

02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:42.441
&gt;&gt; Okay.  I put your order in 
and it will be ready soon.  

02:57:42.442 --> 02:57:44.442
Enjoy.  
   &gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Great.

02:57:47.566 --> 02:57:49.566
Looking forward to that.  

02:57:51.446 --> 02:57:53.068
As new devices are introduced 
and new interactions become 

02:57:53.069 --> 02:57:57.353
possible, we'll continue to 
invest in these new modalities 

02:57:57.354 --> 02:57:59.398
to ensure that we present our 
users with the best experiences 

02:57:59.399 --> 02:58:01.399
to 

02:58:03.821 --> 02:58:05.754
support their lives.  
   &gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  With 

02:58:05.755 --> 02:58:09.823
Google Pay, we focused on making
something that's fast and 

02:58:09.824 --> 02:58:11.867
efficient, scaleable, secure, 
and really a unified brand 

02:58:11.868 --> 02:58:15.158
that's recognized around the 
world as something that's easy 

02:58:15.159 --> 02:58:17.159
to pay.

02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:20.061
Whether that's in-store, online,
or through new experiences, as 

02:58:20.062 --> 02:58:24.196
Jenny just showed with voice.  
Google Pay gives users a totally

02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:26.660
seamless checkout experience.  
There are hundreds of millions 

02:58:26.661 --> 02:58:29.512
of payment cards on file.  And 
that's a huge benefit for 

02:58:32.190 --> 02:58:33.844
developers as they start to 
create seamless checkout 

02:58:33.845 --> 02:58:36.097
experiences of today, but also 
of tomorrow with assistive 

02:58:36.913 --> 02:58:38.556
experiences and more.  
   You know, I think the future 

02:58:38.557 --> 02:58:40.557
is 

02:58:41.649 --> 02:58:43.683
definitely going to be formless 
as we go into more voice, so 

02:58:43.684 --> 02:58:48.383
this is really awesome stuff 
that we can do.  And it kind of 

02:58:48.384 --> 02:58:52.891
leads to my final point, which 
is I do think this is a really 

02:58:52.892 --> 02:58:55.162
exciting time for payments.  
There's so much coming.  There's

02:58:55.163 --> 02:58:56.999
so much cool stuff happening.  
I'm personally excited to see 

02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:01.892
what all of you guys come up 
with as we move forward.  

02:59:04.373 --> 02:59:05.593
I want to call out that we have 
one more session later today 

02:59:05.594 --> 02:59:10.108
that's actually going to go into
a lot more detail on the demo 

02:59:10.109 --> 02:59:12.109
that Jenny just did.

02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:15.429
You can learn about all the 
assistant actions.

02:59:17.451 --> 02:59:19.937
And so check out addAdd 
Transactional Capabilities to 

02:59:22.596 --> 02:59:24.431
Your Actions, and that is 
onstage 5 at 2:30.  

02:59:24.432 --> 02:59:25.872
&gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  And a reminder 
that we have developer 

02:59:25.873 --> 02:59:31.098
documentation available at these
links, and we'll be adding to 

02:59:31.099 --> 02:59:33.099
these as more experiences are 

02:59:34.273 --> 02:59:36.731
built for Google Pay.  
   We'd love to hear from you, 

02:59:36.732 --> 02:59:38.732
so don't forget to provide 
feedback on our 

02:59:42.041 --> 02:59:44.041
session on the website schedule.

02:59:46.359 --> 02:59:46.980
And we'll be in the Sandbox 
afterwards to take any 

02:59:46.981 --> 02:59:48.981
questions.

02:59:50.930 --> 02:59:52.548
So please come and see us in 
Dome G.  And if you haven't 

02:59:52.549 --> 02:59:54.549
checked this out already, you 
can see some really cool 

02:59:55.405 --> 02:59:58.069
experiences of future payment 
experiences, including in-store,

03:00:00.542 --> 03:00:02.542
interactive retail experiences 
that are 

03:00:03.811 --> 03:00:05.035
there in Dome G to try, so do 
stop by.  

03:00:05.036 --> 03:00:07.036
&gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  I tried it.
It was very cool.  

03:00:08.493 --> 03:00:09.918
&gt;&gt; JENNY GOVE:  Enjoy the rest 
of IO, and thank you so much for

03:00:09.919 --> 03:00:10.318
coming.  
   &gt;&gt; BRANDON HERRING:  Thank 

03:00:10.319 --> 03:00:12.319
you.  

03:00:13.946 --> 03:00:15.946
[Applause]

03:01:22.777 --> 03:01:23.396
Build an AR App with the Poly 
Toolkit 

03:19:48.051 --> 03:19:50.704
your seat.  Our session will 
begin soon.

03:21:46.340 --> 03:21:49.392
   At this time, please find 
your seat.  Our session will 

03:21:49.393 --> 03:21:51.393
begin soon.

03:23:55.883 --> 03:23:59.148
   &gt;&gt; BRITTANY MENNUTI:  Hi, 
everyone.  Thanks so much for 

03:23:59.149 --> 03:24:02.814
joining us today.  My name is 
Brit Mennuti.  I'm joined here 

03:24:02.815 --> 03:24:06.916
today by my colleague Bruno, a 
software engineer on the team.  

03:24:06.917 --> 03:24:08.917
We have an awesome agenda ahead 
for you today.  

03:24:10.570 --> 03:24:12.570
So by the end of today's 
session, 

03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:16.093
you'll have helped us to demo an
AR app, but before we get into 

03:24:16.094 --> 03:24:18.340
that, I'll share a little bit of
history as to how and why we 

03:24:18.341 --> 03:24:22.042
built Poly.  I'll share what 
Poly is and how it can be useful

03:24:22.043 --> 03:24:24.271
to you as a developer.  And then
I'll pass it off to Bruno to 

03:24:26.932 --> 03:24:28.932
dive into the Poly API before we
do the demo.  

03:24:28.953 --> 03:24:30.795
You may be wondering, what is 
this Poly thing and why should I

03:24:30.796 --> 03:24:35.074
care about it?  I think the best
way to answer that question is 

03:24:35.075 --> 03:24:37.518
to take a quick trip down Poly 
developer memory lane.  

03:24:40.805 --> 03:24:42.473
The team that built Poly was 
actually originally devoted to 

03:24:42.474 --> 03:24:47.368
the idea of productivity in VR. 
It was our goal to make people 

03:24:47.369 --> 03:24:50.038
more efficient and effective at 
work using immersive technology.

03:24:52.082 --> 03:24:54.115
We had a whole bunch of 
hypotheses about how we could do

03:24:54.116 --> 03:24:56.116
that, and we 

03:24:57.998 --> 03:25:00.485
figured the best way to validate
those hypotheses was to build a 

03:25:00.486 --> 03:25:03.526
whole bunch of prototypes and 
test them with real people.  We 

03:25:03.527 --> 03:25:05.370
built everything like building 
your docs in VR, to training 

03:25:05.371 --> 03:25:08.238
people how to use the espresso 
machine in our microkitchen.  

03:25:08.239 --> 03:25:13.324
   But regardless of the 
prototype we built, one thing 

03:25:13.325 --> 03:25:15.795
was always the same:  We needed 
3-D models, and finding the 

03:25:18.072 --> 03:25:20.093
right 3-D model was really, 
really hard, especially if we 

03:25:20.094 --> 03:25:22.094
wanted a lot of 3-D models that 
looked like they belonged 

03:25:22.166 --> 03:25:25.029
together. D models, and finding 
the right 3D model was really, 

03:25:25.030 --> 03:25:29.096
really hard, especially if we 
wanted a lot of 3D models that 

03:25:25.030 --> 03:25:26.251
looked like they belonged 
together.  So we said, no big 

03:25:26.252 --> 03:25:28.252
deal, we'll make our own 3D 
models.

03:25:31.440 --> 03:25:33.678
Turns out, making your own 3D 
models is also really hard.  In 

03:25:33.679 --> 03:25:35.725
fact, what you see on this 
screen is the model of a hand 

03:25:35.726 --> 03:25:40.046
created by a software engineer 
named Chris on our team for one 

03:25:40.047 --> 03:25:41.661
of our virtual meeting 
prototypes.  How many of you 

03:25:41.662 --> 03:25:44.961
actually knew that was a hand 
before I told you?  I don't 

03:25:44.962 --> 03:25:51.736
believe some of you.  
   All jokes aside, this got us 

03:25:51.737 --> 03:25:55.023
thinking that maybe creating 
models could be easier and 

03:25:55.024 --> 03:25:57.024
perhaps VR was the answer to 
that.  

03:25:57.907 --> 03:25:59.907
So we pivoted and we built 
Blocks.

03:26:01.003 --> 03:26:03.003
Blocks is an app for the HTC 
vibe and 

03:26:04.006 --> 03:26:06.006
on

03:26:07.755 --> 03:26:10.830
occulus rift.  What makes it 
special is you actually inhabit 

03:26:10.831 --> 03:26:12.831
the same space as the thing that
you're modeling.  

03:26:13.688 --> 03:26:15.688
So instead of training your 
brain to 

03:26:17.582 --> 03:26:20.073
think about a 3D object on a 2D 
surface, you can literally just 

03:26:20.074 --> 03:26:23.765
walk around it.  Thanks to the 
launch of Blocks, that same 

03:26:23.766 --> 03:26:25.825
engineer Chris that I mentioned 
earlier was able to make this 

03:26:25.826 --> 03:26:28.262
beautiful fish tank model in 
less than 15 minutes.

03:26:35.461 --> 03:26:37.121
He also made this robot station 
all in Blocks, and I don't know 

03:26:37.122 --> 03:26:40.177
about you, but I think that 
robot hand looks a little bit 

03:26:40.178 --> 03:26:42.178
better than the hand I showed 
you earlier.  

03:26:42.636 --> 03:26:44.673
You might have also seen Chris 
in some of our launch videos.  

03:26:44.674 --> 03:26:46.674
That's right, folks.

03:26:48.344 --> 03:26:50.344
One day you too can become 
famous.

03:26:51.623 --> 03:26:53.266
And as we were reflecting on 
blocks, we started to realize 

03:26:53.267 --> 03:26:55.722
there are a whole bunch of other
resources for 3D assets 

03:26:58.788 --> 03:27:01.223
that could be used in AR and 3D 
development.  Tilt brush is 

03:27:01.224 --> 03:27:03.275
another VR app that lets you 
paint in 3D space.  You can 

03:27:03.276 --> 03:27:05.962
create everything from beautiful
portraits to entire 3D 

03:27:07.807 --> 03:27:09.807
environments, replete with both 
audio and visual effects.  

03:27:11.493 --> 03:27:14.367
And we also knew that there was 
this vast community of 3D 

03:27:14.368 --> 03:27:16.368
modelers out there 

03:27:18.448 --> 03:27:20.448
already making tons of assets 
that could 

03:27:21.907 --> 03:27:23.907
be used in AR and VR 
development.  

03:27:24.035 --> 03:27:25.877
So we thought to ourselves, 
maybe the problem wasn't that 

03:27:25.878 --> 03:27:28.537
there wasn't an easy way to make
models.  It was also that there 

03:27:28.538 --> 03:27:31.392
wasn't a single resource to find
all of those assets to use for 

03:27:31.393 --> 03:27:33.393
development.  And that's why we 
built Poly.

03:27:35.907 --> 03:27:39.013
Poly is a library of 3D assets 
and experiences.  And our 

03:27:39.014 --> 03:27:41.865
mission is to organize the 
world's 3D information and make 

03:27:41.866 --> 03:27:43.866
it accessible to creators and 
developers 

03:27:46.549 --> 03:27:48.549
like yourself

03:27:49.807 --> 03:27:52.631
.  
   When you visit Poly, you'll 

03:27:52.632 --> 03:27:59.662
see thousands of assets that 
have been uploaded by a vast 

03:27:59.663 --> 03:28:03.750
community.  When you upload your
assets to Poly, you have your 

03:28:03.751 --> 03:28:07.029
option to make them what we call
remixable.  What this means is 

03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:09.030
that you give other creators and
developers the right to use 

03:28:11.533 --> 03:28:13.533
your assets under a creative 
commons by a license.

03:28:15.193 --> 03:28:17.030
This means they can download 
those assets, use them in their 

03:28:17.031 --> 03:28:19.031
apps, as long as they give you 
attribution.  

03:28:21.999 --> 03:28:23.625
Well, the good news is that over
82% of public assets on Poly 

03:28:23.626 --> 03:28:28.316
today are actually remixable.  
So what this means is there are 

03:28:28.317 --> 03:28:32.188
tens of thousands of assets 
available for all of you to use 

03:28:32.189 --> 03:28:34.189
today for free under 

03:28:35.654 --> 03:28:37.741
creative commons license.  
   Now when you go to Poly, you 

03:28:37.742 --> 03:28:40.604
can browse by category.  You can
also search for exactly what you

03:28:40.605 --> 03:28:44.476
need.  We recently added object 
recognition to search, so you'll

03:28:44.477 --> 03:28:46.477
find what you need 

03:28:48.907 --> 03:28:51.446
even if it isn't manually tagged
.  

03:28:53.909 --> 03:28:54.970
And when you find the perfect 
asset, you can download the 

03:28:54.971 --> 03:28:57.417
file.  We offer downloads in the
form of obj 

03:29:00.715 --> 03:29:02.136
and in some cases fbx files as 
well.  

03:29:02.137 --> 03:29:04.728
You may be thinking, this sounds
great, but can I actually find 

03:29:04.729 --> 03:29:10.114
useful assets on Poly?  Let's 
look through some examples.  

03:29:10.115 --> 03:29:11.534
Maybe you need a sand castle 
model for your vacation mode 

03:29:11.535 --> 03:29:13.535
app.

03:29:15.420 --> 03:29:18.680
Or perhaps you want to recreate 
Noah's Ark in your living room. 

03:29:18.681 --> 03:29:20.681
Or maybe you've always wanted to

03:29:21.950 --> 03:29:23.950
include a realistic version of 
your BFF Carl in your next game.

03:29:25.061 --> 03:29:27.516
Fun fact, Carl is actually a 
real human.  He's one of the 

03:29:27.517 --> 03:29:30.196
talented designers behind Blocks
and Poly.

03:29:33.265 --> 03:29:34.935
Or maybe you're building an 
archaeology app and you need a 

03:29:34.936 --> 03:29:36.936
whole 

03:29:39.044 --> 03:29:41.044
bunch of 3D scans of historic 
artifacts.  

03:29:41.688 --> 03:29:44.570
Thanks to a partnership, there 
are a dozen of these actual 

03:29:44.571 --> 03:29:48.055
artifacts hosted on Poly for you
to download today.  And finally,

03:29:48.056 --> 03:29:50.056
perhaps all you ever wanted was 
a politically correct 

03:29:50.748 --> 03:29:53.861
cheeseburger.  That's right, 
folks.  This burger has the 

03:29:53.862 --> 03:29:57.965
cheese in both locations.  
   No matter what you're looking

03:29:57.966 --> 03:29:59.966
for, you'll find everything you 
need on Poly 

03:30:02.687 --> 03:30:05.318
to create a unique VR or AR 
experience.  Like this VR 

03:30:05.319 --> 03:30:07.353
scavenger hunt game created by 
artist and developer Harlan 

03:30:07.557 --> 03:30:09.557
Perez.

03:30:11.470 --> 03:30:14.129
He built this using blocks, 
Poly, and unreal engineUnreal 

03:30:14.130 --> 03:30:18.247
Engine.  
   Or these AR apps.  On the 

03:30:18.248 --> 03:30:20.497
left, you'll see an app from 
developer Andrew Deutsche where 

03:30:20.498 --> 03:30:24.793
he takes beautiful flower models
from Poly and puts them in the 

03:30:24.794 --> 03:30:27.069
New York City platform.  Or on 
the right, an app from developer

03:30:31.608 --> 03:30:34.060
Ben Ferns that uses the Poly API
to retrieve low Poly versions of

03:30:34.061 --> 03:30:36.061
real world objects in realtime. 

03:30:38.993 --> 03:30:40.439
Now, as we thought back to 
Poly's mission, it occurred to 

03:30:40.440 --> 03:30:42.440
us that we might be falling a 
little bit short on the 

03:30:42.507 --> 03:30:46.598
accessible portion.  Having to 
go to a website and download an 

03:30:46.599 --> 03:30:48.647
object every time you needed it 
for your development was perhaps

03:30:48.648 --> 03:30:53.453
not the most efficient solution.
   So that's why we built the 

03:30:53.454 --> 03:30:56.298
Poly API.  And with that, I'm 
going to hand it off to Bruno to

03:30:56.299 --> 03:31:01.628
share more.  
   [Applause] 

03:31:02.841 --> 03:31:06.090
&gt;&gt; BRUNO OLIVEIRA:  All right.  
Thank you.  So we're going to 

03:31:06.091 --> 03:31:10.426
talk about the Poly API and Poly
toolkit.  There's so many ways I

03:31:10.427 --> 03:31:12.886
could begin a conversation about
an API.  So when I asked for 

03:31:12.887 --> 03:31:16.171
advice, someone said, why don't 
you start with an inspirational 

03:31:16.172 --> 03:31:19.033
quote.  Something somebody 
famous said that's relevant to 

03:31:19.034 --> 03:31:21.856
the topic.  So this is the one 
that I chose.  

03:31:24.336 --> 03:31:26.336
A good API creates more problems
than it solves.  

03:31:27.998 --> 03:31:29.998
Does anybody know who famously 
said this and when?

03:31:31.891 --> 03:31:38.599
That's right.  Nobody.  Ever.  
   And that's why any time 

03:31:38.600 --> 03:31:42.668
you're working with an API, 
there's a simple, but 

03:31:42.669 --> 03:31:44.354
fundamental question that you 
have to ask, and that question 

03:31:44.355 --> 03:31:46.355
is why?  Why would you use this 
API?

03:31:49.073 --> 03:31:51.943
How is my life easier or better 
if I use the Poly API?  

03:31:53.771 --> 03:31:58.319
To answer that, let's go back a 
couple of decades.  So I've 

03:31:58.320 --> 03:31:59.954
always liked building games.  So
my friends and I would get 

03:31:59.955 --> 03:32:01.955
together 

03:32:03.478 --> 03:32:05.522
and we would try to build a 
bunch of games on the old 

03:32:05.523 --> 03:32:10.427
computers.  We kind of knew how 
to do the code.  But the problem

03:32:10.428 --> 03:32:15.330
that we had was that none of us 
really knew how to make art.  We

03:32:15.331 --> 03:32:17.794
had no skills whatsoever.  Stick
figures were already a 

03:32:17.795 --> 03:32:20.052
challenge.  
   But somehow, we had very high

03:32:21.664 --> 03:32:23.519
expectations about what our 
graphics were going to look 

03:32:23.520 --> 03:32:25.520
like.

03:32:26.624 --> 03:32:28.624
In reality, however, our 
graphics looked more like this.

03:32:30.497 --> 03:32:34.389
Does anybody know what that is? 
It's a dragon.  Of course.

03:32:38.693 --> 03:32:40.693
But come on.

03:32:41.787 --> 03:32:43.838
If this is a valid hand, then 
that's a valid dragon.  

03:32:45.881 --> 03:32:48.105
Now, you might think that my 
skills would have improved over 

03:32:48.106 --> 03:32:50.106
time.

03:32:51.177 --> 03:32:53.177
However, you would be wrong.

03:32:54.668 --> 03:32:56.668
I am the kind of developer who 
uses cubes for everything.

03:32:58.570 --> 03:33:00.851
So, with my skill level, I could
theoretically make a game about 

03:33:00.852 --> 03:33:06.198
a cube that shoots other cubes 
to protect the larger cubes from

03:33:06.199 --> 03:33:08.199
being hit by the 

03:33:09.275 --> 03:33:11.275
smaller cubes, all against the 
backdrop of moving cubes.  

03:33:12.961 --> 03:33:14.597
If you think that there's no way
that that game is viable, if you

03:33:14.598 --> 03:33:18.488
think that there's no way that 
that's an actual thing, it's 

03:33:18.489 --> 03:33:23.650
because you haven't played Cubic
Pilot.  Not only did I launch 

03:33:23.651 --> 03:33:26.353
this, but Google in some 
official capacity actually 

03:33:27.371 --> 03:33:29.371
endorsed this, because this is a
sample 

03:33:30.381 --> 03:33:32.381
for the games API.  

03:33:35.191 --> 03:33:37.423
Now, my point for this is we all
this have book as developers in 

03:33:37.424 --> 03:33:40.966
our shelf.  It's the top of my 
shelf.  Everyone has it.  It's a

03:33:40.967 --> 03:33:42.967
best-seller.

03:33:45.028 --> 03:33:48.301
It's called "Apologizing For the
Lack of Graphics."  Now, 

03:33:48.302 --> 03:33:50.759
sometimes we can get away with 
it.  Sometimes we can do clever 

03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:53.843
tricks in our games to make 
graphics unnecessary.  My 

03:33:53.844 --> 03:33:55.844
favorite one is claiming that 
it's magic.

03:33:58.479 --> 03:34:01.665
The dragon is invisible.  But it
doesn't work every time.  Users 

03:34:01.666 --> 03:34:03.666
end up noticing that we're doing
this.  

03:34:06.163 --> 03:34:09.034
Now, to some people, when I show
them this, what they suggest to 

03:34:09.035 --> 03:34:13.926
me is, why don't you just buy a 
collection of 3D assets?  You 

03:34:13.927 --> 03:34:16.384
can just buy a collection, like 
nice 3D assets, and then you 

03:34:16.385 --> 03:34:18.385
don't have 

03:34:19.651 --> 03:34:21.483
to use cubes or dragons anymore.
   And then I say, well, this is

03:34:21.484 --> 03:34:26.625
the traditional model for asset 
acquisition.  This model has a 

03:34:26.626 --> 03:34:28.626
couple of problems.

03:34:30.327 --> 03:34:32.327
One of the problems with this 
model is cats.  Obviously.

03:34:34.017 --> 03:34:36.017
Maybe I should go into more 
details.  All right.

03:34:37.692 --> 03:34:39.731
If you ever actually try to buy 
a 3D model of a cat online, you 

03:34:39.732 --> 03:34:45.054
know what I mean.  You can't 
just buy one cat.  You have to 

03:34:45.055 --> 03:34:47.055
buy super cat pack deluxe 

03:34:49.977 --> 03:34:52.435
special edition with 700 fully 
animated cats.  It's very hard 

03:34:52.436 --> 03:34:55.299
the find separate assets.  
   The second problem is that 

03:34:55.300 --> 03:35:00.049
sometimes you're still in the 
prototyping phase of your app.  

03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:02.083
At this point, in my app 
development cycle, I'm not even 

03:35:02.084 --> 03:35:04.084
sure if I'm making a 

03:35:05.134 --> 03:35:07.610
game about cats or about 
spaceships or even about cats 

03:35:07.611 --> 03:35:12.126
that fly spaceships.  It's a 
valid thing.  So I need that 

03:35:12.127 --> 03:35:14.565
flexibility to try it out with 
different assets.  

03:35:17.832 --> 03:35:20.732
And the third problem is users. 
As you know, users are fickle, 

03:35:20.733 --> 03:35:25.053
and they don't know what they 
want, so what happens if you 

03:35:25.054 --> 03:35:27.094
ship your app, and I know it's 
unthinkable, but suppose that 

03:35:27.095 --> 03:35:31.197
you never actually thought about
cats at all during the 

03:35:31.198 --> 03:35:33.198
development cycle of your app.

03:35:34.684 --> 03:35:36.684
And now, when it's in the user's
hand 

03:35:38.134 --> 03:35:39.980
at one time, the users want to 
have a cat in the app.  How do 

03:35:39.981 --> 03:35:42.620
you do that?  
   Well, you would need to 

03:35:42.621 --> 03:35:44.621
somehow figure out a way to pull
out a cat from 

03:35:48.549 --> 03:35:50.602
a run-time API.  
   So, Poly by contrast has the 

03:35:52.465 --> 03:35:54.890
flexibility that you need to try
out with many different assets 

03:35:54.891 --> 03:35:56.891
from Poly.

03:35:58.199 --> 03:35:59.635
It has a runtime API, which 
means that during runtime, you 

03:35:59.636 --> 03:36:03.334
can go ahead and search for cats
and then present cats to the 

03:36:03.335 --> 03:36:05.335
user, or anything else that they
want.  

03:36:06.837 --> 03:36:09.064
And also, it's not a static 
collection.  It's not something 

03:36:09.065 --> 03:36:11.309
that you just compile once and 
then you only have the same 

03:36:11.310 --> 03:36:14.571
assets.  It's a growing 
collection.  Because users are 

03:36:14.572 --> 03:36:16.572
contributing to that collection 
all the time.  

03:36:18.251 --> 03:36:20.308
If you see there, you're going 
to see that even I with my 

03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:22.309
limited skills made my 
contribution.

03:36:24.067 --> 03:36:28.560
Can you guess which one is my 3D
model over there?  Any guesses? 

03:36:28.561 --> 03:36:30.815
It's actually none of them.  I 
uploaded this cube.  

03:36:31.823 --> 03:36:34.069
[Laughter] 
   So whenever you're making a 

03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:39.006
game, you need a cube, you know 
where to look.  

03:36:43.726 --> 03:36:45.156
So I have this great collection 
of assets on Poly, and on the 

03:36:45.157 --> 03:36:48.650
other side, we have our apps, 
and we want to be able to 

03:36:48.651 --> 03:36:50.295
consume those assets.  So what's
the missing piece in that 

03:36:50.296 --> 03:36:55.436
puzzle?  Of course, what we 
needed is an API.  So the API is

03:36:55.437 --> 03:36:57.462
how your app gets access to 
these assets in Poly.  

03:37:00.363 --> 03:37:01.775
Now, naming is difficult in 
general in computer science, so 

03:37:01.776 --> 03:37:03.776
we put a bunch 

03:37:04.846 --> 03:37:06.909
of very creative people together
to come up with a name for this 

03:37:06.910 --> 03:37:09.560
API for Poly.  And after several
hours, we came up 

03:37:12.770 --> 03:37:14.927
with Poly API.  It's very 
precise.  

03:37:16.772 --> 03:37:19.416
On a very high level, how does 
this API work?  On a very high 

03:37:19.417 --> 03:37:21.417
level, it's like a search API.

03:37:23.091 --> 03:37:24.704
Your app wants 3D assets, so 
it's going to make a search 

03:37:24.705 --> 03:37:29.615
quarry.  In the simplest case, 
that's going to be a keyword.  

03:37:29.616 --> 03:37:31.454
For example, the app could say I
like cats, I would like some 

03:37:31.455 --> 03:37:33.455
cats, please, 

03:37:34.537 --> 03:37:36.537
and then the API would return 
some 

03:37:38.855 --> 03:37:40.302
interesting cats for your app to
consume.  

03:37:40.303 --> 03:37:43.162
Now, what happens if you're not 
a cat person?  Can you still use

03:37:43.163 --> 03:37:45.163
this API?

03:37:46.454 --> 03:37:48.454
The answer is yes.  Or what 
happens if you want to be much 

03:37:49.543 --> 03:37:50.753
more specific about the kinds of
animals that you want in your 

03:37:50.754 --> 03:37:58.551
app?  In that case, you can make
a more complex request.  For 

03:37:58.552 --> 03:38:00.387
example, you can say, I like low
complexity assets from the 

03:38:00.388 --> 03:38:02.388
animals 

03:38:04.060 --> 03:38:06.518
category, and I want them to be 
ordered from newest to oldest, 

03:38:06.519 --> 03:38:08.519
so you can make complex API 
requests like that.  

03:38:10.406 --> 03:38:12.064
You may be -- you probably would
not get any cats on this one, 

03:38:12.065 --> 03:38:14.065
because as we 

03:38:16.883 --> 03:38:18.883
know, cats are very complex 
animals

03:38:20.211 --> 03:38:22.892
.  
   You also have the option of 

03:38:22.893 --> 03:38:24.893
getting the owner's own as etc.

03:38:29.361 --> 03:38:31.850
You can get the assets that the 
user has uploaded.  You could 

03:38:31.851 --> 03:38:33.851
use that, for example, so 

03:38:34.924 --> 03:38:36.924
that the user app goes to your 
scene.  

03:38:38.214 --> 03:38:42.092
So we talked about the whats and
we talked about the why.  Now 

03:38:42.093 --> 03:38:45.137
let's move on to the next W 
question, which is when.  When 

03:38:45.138 --> 03:38:46.364
do we use the Poly API?  
Fortunately, the answer to this 

03:38:46.365 --> 03:38:48.365
one is much easier.

03:38:51.832 --> 03:38:56.450
How about now?  
   Let's do a live demo.  You 

03:38:56.451 --> 03:38:59.952
know what's the first rule of 
live demos onstage?  It's you 

03:38:59.953 --> 03:39:01.953
never do a live demo onstage.

03:39:03.004 --> 03:39:05.004
So I'm going to try and see if 
this will work.

03:39:06.930 --> 03:39:09.180
All right.  How many people 
actually think that this demo is

03:39:09.181 --> 03:39:13.929
going to work?  All right.  How 
many people think this demo is 

03:39:14.323 --> 03:39:16.323
going to fail?  All right.  A 
couple of people.  

03:39:17.416 --> 03:39:19.458
How many people think this is 
going to fail in some like epic 

03:39:19.459 --> 03:39:21.895
and embarrassing way?  Like 
something's going to catch fire 

03:39:22.307 --> 03:39:24.307
onstage.  Two people.  That's 
not bad.  All right.  

03:39:27.608 --> 03:39:29.608
So here I have my demo app.

03:39:30.899 --> 03:39:34.943
This is using ARCore and the 
Poly toolkit for Unity.  This is

03:39:34.944 --> 03:39:36.405
ARCore showing me the plains.  
We have this very nice carpet 

03:39:36.406 --> 03:39:39.243
that ARCore is tracking.  And 
now when I tap my finger on the 

03:39:40.885 --> 03:39:42.885
screen, I'm going to place an 
object, 

03:39:44.173 --> 03:39:45.202
and this object came from Poly, 
but it's precompiled into the 

03:39:45.203 --> 03:39:47.203
app.  It's like this little 
intersection.  

03:39:48.864 --> 03:39:50.915
Now, since I don't want to like 
bend down to the ground, I have 

03:39:50.916 --> 03:39:52.916
this hack 

03:39:54.815 --> 03:39:57.112
where I can increase the height 
of this over here.  Whoops.  

03:39:57.113 --> 03:39:59.113
It's running away from me.  
There we go.  

03:40:00.575 --> 03:40:02.616
So we have this little 
intersection.  Now, the point of

03:40:02.617 --> 03:40:04.867
this app is just to add some 
objects from Poly to make it 

03:40:07.567 --> 03:40:09.228
look more like a real city.  
   So what's one thing we could 

03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:13.336
add to make it look more real?  
   &gt;&gt; BRITTANY MENNUTI:  How 

03:40:13.337 --> 03:40:15.182
about some cars?  
   &gt;&gt; BRUNO OLIVEIRA:  Cars make

03:40:15.183 --> 03:40:17.183
sense.

03:40:18.683 --> 03:40:20.683
I'm going to type car.

03:40:21.739 --> 03:40:25.191
I made this keyboard myself.  
We're going to do a search.  

03:40:25.192 --> 03:40:27.633
These are our search results.  
Now all we have to do is tap one

03:40:27.634 --> 03:40:31.083
of these cars, and now it's in 
our scene.  I'll rotate this car

03:40:31.084 --> 03:40:35.164
a little bit.  There we go.  And
I'm going to carefully place it 

03:40:36.211 --> 03:40:38.656
here on one of our streets.  
There we go.  

03:40:40.961 --> 03:40:42.389
So I actually wrote some scripts
in this so that the cars 

03:40:42.390 --> 03:40:44.390
actually do something.

03:40:46.690 --> 03:40:49.349
So if you click run, then the 
car will run.  

03:40:53.361 --> 03:40:55.361
Now let's go back to results, 
let's add this one.

03:40:58.344 --> 03:40:58.446
It's going to place it over 
here.  

03:40:58.447 --> 03:41:00.542
You may or may not have played 
more exciting games, but, you 

03:41:00.543 --> 03:41:03.191
know, in some games, your goal 
is to, like, save the kingdom, 

03:41:03.192 --> 03:41:07.073
save the world.  In this game, 
your goal is just to make 

03:41:07.074 --> 03:41:09.074
traffic as bad as possible.

03:41:11.860 --> 03:41:13.907
And the other game in this is 
how many cars can you put in 

03:41:13.908 --> 03:41:17.392
this scene without them crashing
into each other?  My highest 

03:41:17.393 --> 03:41:19.393
score is one.

03:41:20.687 --> 03:41:24.589
Let's see if I beat my high 
score.  Whoa.  My high score is 

03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:28.713
now two.  Let's add something 
else.  What's something else 

03:41:28.714 --> 03:41:31.145
that you would see in a typical 
city?  

03:41:31.749 --> 03:41:34.000
&gt;&gt; BRITTANY MENNUTI:  How about 
a boat?  

03:41:36.650 --> 03:41:40.178
&gt;&gt; BRUNO OLIVEIRA:  A boat.  
Sure, why not?  A boat.  After 

03:41:40.179 --> 03:41:42.025
all, this is AR.  Searching for 
boat.  See what boats we have.  

03:41:42.026 --> 03:41:44.026
All right.

03:41:46.363 --> 03:41:48.363
Going to add this cruise liner. 
Let's make it a little bigger.

03:41:51.925 --> 03:41:53.569
I'm going to put this 
cruiseliner here on the road.  

03:41:53.570 --> 03:41:54.977
It's going to be driving on the 
wrong side of the road, but I 

03:41:54.978 --> 03:41:56.978
think that's not the worst 
traffic violation that's 

03:41:57.851 --> 03:41:59.851
happening here.

03:42:01.754 --> 03:42:05.081
Oh, my high score is two now.  
Perfect.  So let's add something

03:42:05.082 --> 03:42:09.187
else.  We will not be restricted
to forms of transportation.  

03:42:09.188 --> 03:42:12.111
Getting close to lunch.  Getting
hungry.  Let's add a jar of 

03:42:12.112 --> 03:42:14.112
peanut butter or something like 
that.

03:42:17.009 --> 03:42:20.334
I'm just making this up as I go.
Oh, even better.  All right.

03:42:23.411 --> 03:42:27.528
Let's put this here.  It's a 
giant jar of jam.  Does anybody 

03:42:27.529 --> 03:42:31.836
know what this is?  Any guesses?
It's a traffic jam.  Exactly.

03:42:35.547 --> 03:42:37.547
It's a terrible pun.  

03:42:38.661 --> 03:42:41.338
So this shows you how you can 
continue to add objects.  I 

03:42:41.339 --> 03:42:43.170
think nothing else surprising is
going to happen in this demo, 

03:42:43.171 --> 03:42:46.837
unless, of course, a dragon were
to appear and set fire to 

03:42:46.838 --> 03:42:50.371
everything.  So for those of you
who thought that something was 

03:42:50.372 --> 03:42:53.681
going to catch fire, you were 
right, in a way.  

03:42:54.295 --> 03:42:58.959
All right.  So I'm glad that 
this demo worked.  

03:42:59.881 --> 03:43:01.881
[Applause] 
   Thanks.

03:43:03.855 --> 03:43:07.142
   Now let's move on to how do I
actually use the API?  

03:43:09.621 --> 03:43:11.621
So we have the Poly API on one 
side, 

03:43:13.559 --> 03:43:15.559
and you have IU app on the other
side, 

03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:18.638
and it's naturally 
cross-platform.  This means they

03:43:18.639 --> 03:43:20.688
can get access to it from any 
device that has access to the 

03:43:21.086 --> 03:43:23.086
Internet.

03:43:25.366 --> 03:43:27.366
So we support several platform

03:43:30.184 --> 03:43:32.184
s, Android, iOS, Unity, Unreal, 
Web.

03:43:33.470 --> 03:43:35.470
Poly toolkit, which is an SDK 
for 

03:43:36.996 --> 03:43:38.996
Unity that lets you use the Poly
API.  

03:43:40.250 --> 03:43:42.676
So when you download and install
Poly Toolkit, it becomes fully 

03:43:42.677 --> 03:43:46.012
integrated into your Unity 
editor.  So you're going to see 

03:43:46.013 --> 03:43:51.311
that window.  I know that window
we can browse for Poly assets.  

03:43:51.312 --> 03:43:53.750
You can see that's going to show
you -- by default, it's going to

03:43:53.751 --> 03:43:56.224
show you the featured ones on 
the website, but it can change 

03:43:56.225 --> 03:44:00.115
the filters.  So you could 
filter by object type.  You 

03:44:00.116 --> 03:44:02.116
could filter by category.  You 
could say, let me look at this 

03:44:03.786 --> 03:44:06.059
stuff in the transport category,
the food category.  We could 

03:44:06.060 --> 03:44:10.566
also do a search, so there's a 
little search button there.  If 

03:44:10.567 --> 03:44:11.775
you need a dragon for your app, 
you can search for a dragon.  

03:44:15.010 --> 03:44:16.236
If you need a cube, if you need 
a cat, anything you want, just 

03:44:16.237 --> 03:44:18.835
click search, and you find the 
asset that you want.  

03:44:20.328 --> 03:44:22.281
Then, once you find something 
good asset that you want to 

03:44:22.282 --> 03:44:24.764
import into your scene, all you 
have to do is click on the 

03:44:24.765 --> 03:44:28.842
import button.  For example, I 
just click on the import button,

03:44:28.843 --> 03:44:30.843
and now this garden is on my 
scene.  

03:44:32.284 --> 03:44:33.523
Notice that this is already in 
your scene, in your project, and

03:44:33.524 --> 03:44:38.413
this is already a perfectly 
reasonable app.  If you click 

03:44:38.414 --> 03:44:40.652
play, it's going to run, and 
it's already like a full app.  

03:44:40.653 --> 03:44:44.600
   Of course, if you actually 
want the garden to do something,

03:44:44.601 --> 03:44:47.866
you have to write some code.  
Otherwise, it's going to be more

03:44:47.867 --> 03:44:49.867
like 

03:44:50.873 --> 03:44:52.873
one of those

03:44:55.720 --> 03:44:57.336
contemplative gardens.  
   But you know what's going to 

03:44:57.337 --> 03:44:59.337
happen, 

03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:03.000
you're going to ship this app on
Google 

03:45:04.015 --> 03:45:09.037
play Play, and the first thing 
users are going to do is say, 

03:45:09.038 --> 03:45:11.285
sure, this garden is very nice. 
However, I want a cat.  That's 

03:45:11.286 --> 03:45:14.147
what's going to happen.  So to 
get the users their cats, you 

03:45:16.267 --> 03:45:18.267
have to use the Poly API.

03:45:21.791 --> 03:45:24.038
You have to use the runtime part
of the Poly API.  So let's talk 

03:45:24.039 --> 03:45:26.069
about the runtime API.  It 
allows you to run, search, and 

03:45:29.601 --> 03:45:31.246
download assets.  
   I have no idea what that blue

03:45:31.247 --> 03:45:33.078
robot is doing.
This is an actual picture from 

03:45:33.079 --> 03:45:35.140
what's going on in the data 
center right now.

03:45:40.886 --> 03:45:42.886
So this is an overview of how 
the Runtime API works.  

03:45:44.369 --> 03:45:46.200
First, you have to create a 
request object.  You could 

03:45:46.201 --> 03:45:48.201
create the most typical one 

03:45:49.494 --> 03:45:52.365
would be the Poly list assets 
request.  This encodes your 

03:45:52.366 --> 03:45:55.833
search query.  Then you pass 
that object to one of the API 

03:45:55.834 --> 03:45:57.834
methods.

03:46:01.141 --> 03:46:02.769
For example, list assets, which 
means I want to list the assets 

03:46:02.770 --> 03:46:04.614
that match that search request. 
Then you're going to wait for 

03:46:04.615 --> 03:46:07.072
the callback, and the callback 
is going to have the results for

03:46:07.073 --> 03:46:09.712
your search, and then based on 
that.  Is, you have to figure 

03:46:09.713 --> 03:46:13.005
out which ones you want, if 
there's several matches, you 

03:46:13.006 --> 03:46:15.006
have to figure out which one you

03:46:17.112 --> 03:46:19.112
actually want to import, and 
then 

03:46:21.012 --> 03:46:22.226
lastly, import that into your 
scene.  

03:46:22.227 --> 03:46:24.227
Start with a basic example.

03:46:25.869 --> 03:46:30.054
If you just do Poly list assets 
as it's featured, this is the 

03:46:30.055 --> 03:46:32.489
default query.  This means you 
want to get exactly what Poly is

03:46:32.490 --> 03:46:34.737
showing on the website.  
Featured assets, no specific 

03:46:34.738 --> 03:46:37.614
category, no specific keyword.  
Just anything good that Poly is 

03:46:39.452 --> 03:46:41.452
showing on the website.  

03:46:43.170 --> 03:46:45.650
Then you execute that request.  
Just call list assets, you pass 

03:46:45.651 --> 03:46:49.375
your request, and once you get a
callback, you're going to get a 

03:46:49.376 --> 03:46:51.208
list of assets that you want.  
Then you're going to choose 

03:46:51.209 --> 03:46:54.280
among those assets in some way. 
For example, you could just let 

03:46:54.281 --> 03:46:56.281
the 

03:46:58.158 --> 03:47:00.158
user pick one of them.  And once
you know which one you want 

03:47:04.934 --> 03:47:08.005
to import, it's going to get 
imported into your scene.  

03:47:10.276 --> 03:47:13.734
Suppose that you want to do a 
keyword search.  In our example,

03:47:13.735 --> 03:47:18.280
we want cats.  Todays that, you 
simply set the keyword field of 

03:47:18.281 --> 03:47:20.973
the request to cat, and that's 
it.  Then you execute the 

03:47:20.974 --> 03:47:22.974
request, and then you get cats. 

03:47:24.851 --> 03:47:26.273
Now, by default, you're going to
get assets from newest to 

03:47:26.274 --> 03:47:28.541
latest, which normally are goods
sorting order.

03:47:31.651 --> 03:47:35.943
What if I don't want new cats, I
want the best cats.  In that 

03:47:35.944 --> 03:47:37.944
case, I just set the sorting 

03:47:39.501 --> 03:47:41.500
order to Poly order by best.  
And then you get from the first 

03:47:41.501 --> 03:47:43.591
cat to the best cat.  

03:47:46.633 --> 03:47:48.062
What happens if you are more 
picky about the cats that you 

03:47:48.063 --> 03:47:51.548
want?  You can fill in other 
fields.  You could specify the 

03:47:51.549 --> 03:47:53.549
maximum complexity field.

03:47:56.137 --> 03:47:59.830
Complexity just means the Poly 
complexity of the model.  So if 

03:47:59.831 --> 03:48:01.065
you're running an app in a 
performance sensitive 

03:48:01.066 --> 03:48:05.617
environment, you might just want
the low complexity models.  If 

03:48:05.618 --> 03:48:07.039
you don't, if you're not 
particularly strained about 

03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:10.340
performance, you could ask for 
high complexity models that are 

03:48:10.341 --> 03:48:12.341
more realistic.

03:48:13.381 --> 03:48:14.818
You can also set the filter and 
request how many cats per page 

03:48:14.819 --> 03:48:18.480
do you actually want.  
   So, again, it's getting close

03:48:18.481 --> 03:48:22.016
to lunchtime.  We're getting 
hungry.  So of course, the Poly 

03:48:22.017 --> 03:48:24.474
API has a solution for that.  
You can request anything from 

03:48:24.475 --> 03:48:28.771
our food category by using an 
API call.  So if you set the 

03:48:28.772 --> 03:48:32.540
category to food, you're going 
to get everything from the food 

03:48:32.541 --> 03:48:34.541
category.  Let's set the page 
size to 100.

03:48:38.055 --> 03:48:40.738
So 100 items of food at a time. 
   So chances are, if you run 

03:48:40.739 --> 03:48:45.024
this query right now, you're 
going to get a freshly uploaded 

03:48:45.025 --> 03:48:46.898
batch of cookies, which is nice.
   What happens if you're 

03:48:46.899 --> 03:48:48.899
worried about 

03:48:49.911 --> 03:48:50.923
the quality of the assets?  
Maybe I don't want to serve just

03:48:50.924 --> 03:48:54.012
any cookies that anybody has 
uploaded into the site, I want 

03:48:54.013 --> 03:48:56.013
to have some criteria.

03:48:59.952 --> 03:49:01.399
So, you could just hire a team 
and have a team whose only job 

03:49:01.400 --> 03:49:03.405
it is to search for assets and 
mark the ones that 

03:49:07.371 --> 03:49:11.037
are good that you want to 
present to your user and the 

03:49:07.371 --> 03:49:10.868
ones that are not.  We already 
help you do that work because 

03:49:10.869 --> 03:49:12.869
that's what we do for the Poly 
website.  

03:49:13.332 --> 03:49:15.332
So we decided to expose that in 
the API to make things easier.

03:49:19.756 --> 03:49:21.395
So we have a fly called cur 
ration status and you can use 

03:49:21.396 --> 03:49:24.502
that in your search query.  That
means that whatever asset that 

03:49:26.744 --> 03:49:28.804
has set to true, it means that 
our human reviewers, actually, 

03:49:28.805 --> 03:49:31.869
mark that as being a good asset.
So if you trust our good taste, 

03:49:31.870 --> 03:49:35.127
then you can use that flag to 
filter your assets as well.  

03:49:35.128 --> 03:49:37.163
   In terms of code, all you 
have to do 

03:49:41.384 --> 03:49:45.682
is set curated equals true.  
   Now we're going to have a 

03:49:45.683 --> 03:49:48.571
good problem to solve, which is 
you run the query, and now you 

03:49:48.572 --> 03:49:51.635
have a bunch of choices for the 
user, a bunch of cats that they 

03:49:51.636 --> 03:49:55.517
can choose from.  So how do you 
actually let them pick a cat or 

03:49:55.518 --> 03:49:59.182
a dragon or a car or anything 
else that they search for?  

03:49:59.183 --> 03:50:00.812
Well, you could, in theory, just
download all the models, import 

03:50:00.813 --> 03:50:04.327
them into Unity objecting, and 
then show them to the user.

03:50:07.382 --> 03:50:10.085
But this might be wasteful 
because you might spend a lot of

03:50:10.086 --> 03:50:12.733
memory and time downloading 
those, and the user is going to 

03:50:12.734 --> 03:50:15.178
pick one and then never look at 
the other cats.  So what's a 

03:50:15.179 --> 03:50:19.474
more economical way to do this? 
   Well, we have thumbnails.  So

03:50:19.475 --> 03:50:21.327
the API allows you to download 
thumbnails for any assets in our

03:50:21.328 --> 03:50:26.670
API.  So, for example, if you 
have an asset from a list of 

03:50:26.671 --> 03:50:28.719
results and you want a thumbnail
for it to show to the user, 

03:50:32.791 --> 03:50:34.791
all you have to do is fetch the 
nail API 

03:50:36.493 --> 03:50:38.546
hole, and then you're going to 
get a callback that represents a

03:50:38.547 --> 03:50:40.610
thumbnail for that asset.  You 
can do anything with that 

03:50:40.611 --> 03:50:46.171
texture.  You can map it to an 
object or convert it into a 

03:50:46.172 --> 03:50:48.460
sprite and display on the 
screen.  This is what we do in 

03:50:48.461 --> 03:50:50.511
our demo when showing possible 
cars.  These are not the actual 

03:50:50.512 --> 03:50:53.359
models.  What I'm doing is 
showing the thumbnails for the 

03:50:53.360 --> 03:50:55.360
models.

03:50:58.507 --> 03:51:00.139
Once the user clicks one of 
them, that's when I actually 

03:51:00.140 --> 03:51:03.051
import the model.  
   Speaking of placing objects, 

03:51:03.052 --> 03:51:07.736
what happens if you just place 
an object in the world?  Well, 

03:51:07.737 --> 03:51:10.171
if this was a traditional app, 
that's fine.  The object is 

03:51:10.172 --> 03:51:14.077
there on the scene.  That's what
you want.  But however, if we're

03:51:14.078 --> 03:51:16.150
working AR, you need to make 
sure that that object is 

03:51:17.597 --> 03:51:20.243
anchored to some real world 
surface.  Does anybody know what

03:51:20.244 --> 03:51:22.244
you can use to 

03:51:23.311 --> 03:51:25.311
do this?

03:51:26.840 --> 03:51:31.942
ARCore Anchors.  Yes, exactly.  
How did you know?  So that's 

03:51:31.943 --> 03:51:33.943
when the anchors come in handy. 

03:51:38.056 --> 03:51:38.074
So when ARCore does table 
surface, it's going to report 

03:51:38.075 --> 03:51:40.897
the surface to you through API. 
If you want to add an object so 

03:51:40.898 --> 03:51:42.791
that it's firmly placed on that 
surface, you use what is called 

03:51:42.792 --> 03:51:47.525
an anchor object.  So what you 
do is you import the object from

03:51:47.526 --> 03:51:50.784
Poly, and then you set its 
parent to the anchor object.  So

03:51:50.785 --> 03:51:53.656
that means that the object will 
remain stable on that table even

03:51:53.657 --> 03:51:55.657
if you 

03:51:58.384 --> 03:52:00.384
move it around, it's going to be
firmly placed on that table top.

03:52:01.040 --> 03:52:02.259
Even if ARCore improves its 
understanding of the scene, it's

03:52:02.260 --> 03:52:05.738
going to remain there.  
   So how do you accomplish this

03:52:05.739 --> 03:52:07.739
in code?

03:52:09.404 --> 03:52:11.054
After importing an asset, what 
you do is you set the active 

03:52:11.055 --> 03:52:14.337
number to false.  This is going 
to make it so that the object is

03:52:14.338 --> 03:52:16.406
invisible before the user places
it.  And then presumably, you're

03:52:16.407 --> 03:52:19.894
going to show some UI for the 
user.  It's going to say, well, 

03:52:19.895 --> 03:52:21.895
tap the screen somewhere to 
place this object.

03:52:24.625 --> 03:52:27.271
   Once the user touches the 
screen to 

03:52:30.326 --> 03:52:31.971
place the asset, then you do a 
raycast, and when you do a 

03:52:31.972 --> 03:52:33.972
raycast, you can 

03:52:36.717 --> 03:52:38.135
figure out exactly what the 
position of raycast hit is, and 

03:52:38.136 --> 03:52:40.780
that's what you use to hit the 
anchor.  Once you have that, you

03:52:40.781 --> 03:52:42.781
create the anchor.

03:52:44.267 --> 03:52:46.931
And then finally, you're going 
to set the object's visibility 

03:52:46.932 --> 03:52:51.029
property to true.  And that's 
all there is to it.  Import from

03:52:51.030 --> 03:52:53.030
Poly, set the anchor, and 

03:52:55.959 --> 03:52:57.959
now we have this object in your 
AR scene.  

03:52:59.642 --> 03:53:00.661
And Poly toolkit has a lot of 
other features that we're not 

03:53:00.662 --> 03:53:02.709
going to cover.  It does 
automatic rescaling of objects 

03:53:03.125 --> 03:53:08.250
for you.  It can convert units. 
If the object is in meters, it's

03:53:08.251 --> 03:53:12.981
going to convert.  It can get 
the featured assets.  It can use

03:53:12.982 --> 03:53:18.317
the user's own assets.  Even the
assets that the user has liked. 

03:53:18.318 --> 03:53:19.761
Change the material assignments.
If you have a different look for

03:53:19.762 --> 03:53:21.762
your app and specific materials.

03:53:24.473 --> 03:53:26.710
We can even do automatic 
generation, so we don't have to 

03:53:26.711 --> 03:53:28.711
keep track of which objects you 
downloaded from where, we 

03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:33.632
just automatically generate a 
copyright file that you can 

03:53:33.633 --> 03:53:35.045
display in your app.  
   So let's talk a little bit 

03:53:35.046 --> 03:53:36.914
about what goes on behind the 
scenes.  This is the part that 

03:53:36.915 --> 03:53:38.915
you don't have to worry about.

03:53:41.240 --> 03:53:43.097
This is what Poly toolkit does 
for you.  So, what's the 

03:53:43.098 --> 03:53:45.339
difference between the two 
foxes, the fox on the left, and 

03:53:45.340 --> 03:53:49.467
the fox on the right?  Oh, 
clearly the fox on the right is 

03:53:50.472 --> 03:53:56.193
sitting down.  Right?  And the 
other difference is that one is 

03:53:56.194 --> 03:53:58.194
a model and one is data.  

03:54:00.418 --> 03:54:02.418
So model is a collection

03:54:03.735 --> 03:54:04.571
that you want to render on your 
screen, and data is just 

03:54:04.572 --> 03:54:06.572
characters.

03:54:07.828 --> 03:54:09.828
The data represents the model.  

03:54:10.896 --> 03:54:13.367
Now, Poly API, of course, only 
outputs data, and what Poly 

03:54:13.368 --> 03:54:15.368
toolkit does 

03:54:16.658 --> 03:54:18.301
is convert that data into unit 
models.  For that, we need to 

03:54:18.302 --> 03:54:23.893
establish a format.  This is one
of those things that could be 

03:54:23.894 --> 03:54:26.154
easy, but in reality, it's not. 
Because apparently, nobody 

03:54:26.155 --> 03:54:29.936
agrees on how to do this.  This 
is a partial list of 3D formats 

03:54:31.025 --> 03:54:33.670
from Wikipedia.  
   Now, we have to start 

03:54:33.671 --> 03:54:38.940
somewhere.  So we decided to 
start with the most basic one.  

03:54:38.941 --> 03:54:42.466
OBJ.  So OBJ is a great format. 
It has everything that you're 

03:54:42.467 --> 03:54:44.467
ever 

03:54:45.975 --> 03:54:48.024
going to need for 3D objects, if
it's 1995.  

03:54:50.894 --> 03:54:53.945
For today's standards, it's a 
little underspecified.  It has a

03:54:53.946 --> 03:54:57.888
bunch of nonstandard extensions,
limited material support.  

03:54:57.889 --> 03:54:59.333
However, it is widely supported,
so we do offer that format in 

03:54:59.334 --> 03:55:01.334
the API.  

03:55:02.584 --> 03:55:04.584
To be a little more modern, we 
have GLTF.

03:55:05.994 --> 03:55:07.994
G It is more modern.

03:55:10.176 --> 03:55:12.461
It has an ample expressiveness, 
so it can encode scenes, nodes, 

03:55:12.462 --> 03:55:15.302
animations, materials.  And best
of all, it's a format that gets 

03:55:15.303 --> 03:55:17.303
everything right.

03:55:18.976 --> 03:55:20.824
It's stable, it's future-proof, 
and unlikely to change in the 

03:55:20.825 --> 03:55:22.825
near future.  Just kidding.  
It's changed.  

03:55:27.449 --> 03:55:29.476
However, gLTF 2 gets everything 
right and is unlikely to change 

03:55:29.477 --> 03:55:31.477
in the near future.

03:55:34.716 --> 03:55:36.716
So in practice in the Poly API, 
we

03:55:38.137 --> 03:55:39.578
offer in the OBJ and the gLTF 
format.  So you can choose which

03:55:39.579 --> 03:55:41.579
one you want.

03:55:45.014 --> 03:55:47.064
You can choose OBJ, and Poly 
toolkit uses gLTF 2 and uses 

03:55:47.065 --> 03:55:49.065
that as Unity objects.

03:55:54.242 --> 03:55:56.136
Doing everything automatically, 
including material regeneration.

03:55:59.213 --> 03:56:01.213
So we talked about Poly Toolkit 
for Unity.

03:56:02.878 --> 03:56:05.165
There's also Poly Toolkit for 
Unreal.  If you're developing a 

03:56:05.166 --> 03:56:08.818
native app, we do also have 
samples on our site showing how 

03:56:08.819 --> 03:56:10.819
to integrate with the Poly API 
on those platforms.

03:56:13.313 --> 03:56:15.313
So if you're developing, for 
example, 

03:56:17.618 --> 03:56:19.689
this is an example of Poly 
Toolkit for Unreal.  It's a 

03:56:19.690 --> 03:56:21.690
fully integrated environment 

03:56:24.372 --> 03:56:26.399
with you can download and use 
Poly assets.

03:56:31.597 --> 03:56:34.440
If you're developing Android, 
you can download into a simple 

03:56:34.441 --> 03:56:38.318
AR app, and it can include a 
specific Poly object on your 

03:56:38.319 --> 03:56:40.319
scene.  

03:56:42.217 --> 03:56:44.217
If you're using Web, there's 
also a 

03:56:47.539 --> 03:56:48.979
sample, and the sample uses 3JS.
This is the easiest one, because

03:56:48.980 --> 03:56:50.980
our 

03:56:52.034 --> 03:56:54.905
Poly website is also built using
3JS.  A fun fact, the guy who 

03:56:54.906 --> 03:56:57.752
created 3JS is the one who wrote
the sample.  

03:56:59.797 --> 03:57:02.291
So this just shows the wide 
variety of experiences that you 

03:57:02.292 --> 03:57:04.942
can build with the Poly API.  
For example, you're not 

03:57:04.943 --> 03:57:07.000
restricted to just AR.  It's not
just an AR toolkit.

03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:12.710
You can also build VR apps, you 
can build traditional 3D apps.

03:57:15.254 --> 03:57:17.254
This is an example of a simple 
escape 

03:57:18.948 --> 03:57:21.203
theEscape the Room app a couple 
of months ago, just to try out 

03:57:21.204 --> 03:57:23.204
what we 

03:57:24.264 --> 03:57:26.341
could do with the Poly API and 
with Poly objects.  The thing 

03:57:26.342 --> 03:57:27.613
that you notice is that even 
though different people created 

03:57:27.614 --> 03:57:31.306
the different objects in that 
scene, they somehow look nicely 

03:57:31.307 --> 03:57:33.764
together.  They look like they 
belong to the same scene.  

03:57:36.478 --> 03:57:38.942
We also added some lighting for 
an extra effect, and we got that

03:57:38.943 --> 03:57:43.008
cheesy, spooky atmosphere that 
we wanted.  The puzzles aren't 

03:57:43.009 --> 03:57:45.694
particularly hard.  I think I 
just spoiled the game for 

03:57:47.728 --> 03:57:49.728
everybody, because now you know 
that the 

03:57:50.796 --> 03:57:52.796
exit code is 714.  

03:57:53.911 --> 03:57:55.344
When we tried to play this game 
in the office, the first person 

03:57:55.345 --> 03:58:00.245
that we gave it to just put the 
headset on and said you have to 

03:58:00.246 --> 03:58:02.681
find a way to escape that room. 
What they immediately did is 

03:58:02.682 --> 03:58:04.771
just walked through the door and
won the game.  

03:58:05.381 --> 03:58:08.272
[Laughter] 
   Because what's to stop them? 

03:58:08.273 --> 03:58:11.196
And then we had to be more 
specific for the second user.  

03:58:11.197 --> 03:58:12.404
You actually have to solve our 
puzzles before you walk through 

03:58:12.405 --> 03:58:14.405
that door.

03:58:16.679 --> 03:58:18.679
That shows you some of the 
design problems.  

03:58:20.378 --> 03:58:22.658
Well, for me, of course, what it
means is that I can stop using 

03:58:22.659 --> 03:58:24.659
assets 

03:58:25.729 --> 03:58:27.729
like that, and maybe upgrade my 
assets to look more like that.

03:58:30.849 --> 03:58:32.685
Now, I'm not exactly a dragon 
expert, but I can sense that 

03:58:32.686 --> 03:58:34.686
there was some improvement in 
dragon quality there.

03:58:37.582 --> 03:58:41.275

04:24:18.328 --> 04:24:19.966
Our role at Google is to help 
the web ecosystem to be more 

04:24:19.967 --> 04:24:22.425
successful in Google Search.  So
we hope we can bring some of 

04:24:22.426 --> 04:24:27.756
this across here as well.  
   &gt;&gt; MARIYA MOEVA:  Right.  So 

04:24:27.757 --> 04:24:29.595
I want to start us off with an 
example of how this actually 

04:24:29.596 --> 04:24:33.269
works, so you can get an idea of
what you as a developer can do 

04:24:33.270 --> 04:24:35.314
to be more successful with 
Search.  

04:24:40.217 --> 04:24:42.525
So, this is Japanese website 
Rakuten Recipes, and they wanted

04:24:42.526 --> 04:24:47.030
to get more users.  They also 
have a ton of delicious recipes 

04:24:47.031 --> 04:24:48.673
on their site, so they were 
wondering, what can we do to get

04:24:48.674 --> 04:24:55.586
more people to notice us in 
Search?  What they decided to do

04:24:55.587 --> 04:24:58.020
is they changed their CMS in 
order to be able to mark up 

04:24:59.893 --> 04:25:01.540
every recipe that is added to 
the site with structured data 

04:25:01.541 --> 04:25:03.783
mark-up.  
   What this does is it lets the

04:25:03.784 --> 04:25:05.784
search 

04:25:07.281 --> 04:25:09.513
engine know that there are 
different entities, so things 

04:25:09.514 --> 04:25:12.980
like cooking time, different 
ingredients, a picture, and lets

04:25:12.981 --> 04:25:14.825
us display the result in a much 
more attractive way in the 

04:25:14.826 --> 04:25:17.937
search results.  
   And the site itself was in 

04:25:17.938 --> 04:25:22.225
Japanese, so we decided to 
switch off the mark-up for those

04:25:22.226 --> 04:25:26.900
of you who don't speak Japanese 
to something more legible.  So 

04:25:26.901 --> 04:25:28.739
instead of dumplings, you have 
here a party coffee cake, but it

04:25:28.740 --> 04:25:32.405
works the same way for 
dumplings.  This is how this 

04:25:32.406 --> 04:25:35.661
ends up looking like in the 
search results.  

04:25:37.327 --> 04:25:38.734
You can see that in addition to 
the regular elements of the 

04:25:38.735 --> 04:25:43.061
search page, so they have the 
title, they have the url and the

04:25:43.062 --> 04:25:44.686
description, they also have a 
really nice picture of 

04:25:44.687 --> 04:25:48.994
dumplings, and then they have 
the cooking time as well.  So 

04:25:48.995 --> 04:25:52.040
this worked out for them pretty 
well.  In fact, kind of 

04:25:52.041 --> 04:25:55.318
spectacularly.  So they got 2.7 
times more traffic from Search.

04:25:58.978 --> 04:26:01.845
   &gt;&gt; JOHN MUELLER:  Yeah, and 
we thought, developers usually 

04:26:01.846 --> 04:26:05.125
don't get as much advice around 
Search.  And they might not even

04:26:05.126 --> 04:26:08.985
know about all of the pitfalls 
and possibilities.  Shouldn't we

04:26:08.986 --> 04:26:12.904
share some of the knowledge with
them?  So with you-all as well? 

04:26:12.905 --> 04:26:16.965
   So we hope we can show how 
Search can make your project a 

04:26:16.966 --> 04:26:18.966
little bit more successful.

04:26:22.876 --> 04:26:24.908
So, today we'll look into 
various types of public web 

04:26:24.909 --> 04:26:26.728
presences and give you a broad 
overview of specific details 

04:26:26.729 --> 04:26:32.014
that you as a developer can 
watch out for and implement.  

04:26:32.015 --> 04:26:34.679
And these details can help make 
your projects more successful on

04:26:34.680 --> 04:26:38.964
Search, making it easier for 
Search engines to send users to 

04:26:38.965 --> 04:26:42.816
your projects directly.  
   So, you might be thinking, as

04:26:42.817 --> 04:26:44.817
a 

04:26:45.881 --> 04:26:48.543
developer, I don't really care 
how or if my stuff appears in 

04:26:48.544 --> 04:26:50.967
Search, but probably your 
customers, your users, the 

04:26:50.968 --> 04:26:53.432
people that you're building 
these projects for, they do 

04:26:53.433 --> 04:26:58.393
care.  And since you control how
your content appears in search, 

04:26:58.394 --> 04:27:02.056
you can have a huge impact here.
Think back about Rakuten recipes

04:27:02.057 --> 04:27:05.507
and what they did there.  
Globally, Google Search and 

04:27:05.508 --> 04:27:07.508
Google 

04:27:09.174 --> 04:27:10.202
News send billions of visitors 
each month to websites for free.

04:27:10.203 --> 04:27:14.095
   And it's not just about 
websites.  We're going to be 

04:27:14.096 --> 04:27:16.122
looking into various ways that 
search can work depending on 

04:27:17.548 --> 04:27:19.601
what you're working on.  The 
website is just the most common 

04:27:19.794 --> 04:27:24.904
format.  You could also be 
building a web app, which is 

04:27:24.905 --> 04:27:29.214
kind of similar, but slightly 
different as well.  Or you could

04:27:29.215 --> 04:27:31.215
be contributing to a content 
management system, a so-called 

04:27:33.290 --> 04:27:34.919
CMS, which enables others to 
build websites of their own.  

04:27:34.920 --> 04:27:39.424
   Or, as a part of that, maybe 
you're working on plug-ins or 

04:27:39.425 --> 04:27:44.135
themes or extensions for these 
content management systems.  

04:27:44.136 --> 04:27:46.169
We'll take a brief look at this 
as well as detailed 

04:27:46.170 --> 04:27:49.439
recommendations for each of 
them.  

04:27:51.081 --> 04:27:52.510
As I mentioned before, Search 
brings billions of visitors to 

04:27:52.511 --> 04:27:54.511
websites every month.  That's a 
lot of visitors.

04:27:57.849 --> 04:28:00.011
We serve trillions of searchs 
each year, and out of those, 

04:28:00.012 --> 04:28:02.012
this is quite surprising for me 
every time I look at 

04:28:04.311 --> 04:28:06.311
it, about 15% of the queries 
every day 

04:28:08.800 --> 04:28:10.625
are completely new ones, things 
we've never seen before.  So 

04:28:10.626 --> 04:28:12.626
maybe they're looking for one of
your projects.  

04:28:12.886 --> 04:28:14.886
And regardless of what you're 

04:28:16.785 --> 04:28:18.609
building, if search engines 
understand your content, you 

04:28:18.610 --> 04:28:20.610
could get a lot more visitors 
and potential customers with 

04:28:20.843 --> 04:28:24.710
Search.  So you as a developer, 
you can control that through the

04:28:24.711 --> 04:28:29.217
way that you set up your website
or content platform.  So to 

04:28:29.218 --> 04:28:31.043
understand these better, let's 
take a quick look at how Search 

04:28:31.044 --> 04:28:33.044
works.

04:28:34.759 --> 04:28:36.993
   &gt;&gt; MARIYA MOEVA:  Right.  So,
in order to be successful as a 

04:28:38.416 --> 04:28:40.466
developer in Search, you need to
know at least the basics of how 

04:28:40.467 --> 04:28:45.372
it works.  And I'm going to take
you through the super high level

04:28:45.373 --> 04:28:47.373
picture of how it works.

04:28:48.439 --> 04:28:50.684
If you're interested in the 
details, Google.com/jobs, you're

04:28:50.685 --> 04:28:52.685
welcome to apply.  
   [Laughter] 

04:28:53.732 --> 04:28:55.732
And then we can go into a lot 
more detail.  

04:28:57.222 --> 04:29:00.064
But, let's get started with the 
super high level picture.  So we

04:29:00.065 --> 04:29:02.065
generally talk about three 

04:29:03.087 --> 04:29:09.298
things.  First, crawling and 
discovery.  Then indexing.  And 

04:29:09.299 --> 04:29:10.533
finally, ranking and serving.  
I'm going to show you briefly 

04:29:10.534 --> 04:29:12.534
what each of these things is 
about.  

04:29:14.839 --> 04:29:15.119
So, of course, in order for us 
to be able to show anything in 

04:29:15.120 --> 04:29:18.850
the search results, first we 
need to be aware that it exists.

04:29:20.676 --> 04:29:22.718
So we have a series of systems 
that are going around following 

04:29:22.719 --> 04:29:24.719
links on the 

04:29:27.002 --> 04:29:28.832
web, and downloading web pages, 
html files, all the different 

04:29:28.833 --> 04:29:31.076
resources that come into making 
a website, like java 

04:29:35.759 --> 04:29:37.759
script files, CSS, images, what 
have you.

04:29:40.851 --> 04:29:42.848
And those systemsfect 
effectively are crawlers, and we

04:29:42.849 --> 04:29:44.849
call them Google bot.  The goal 
is to find everything that is 

04:29:46.187 --> 04:29:48.628
fresh, new, interesting, 
relevant, and important, and to 

04:29:48.629 --> 04:29:51.679
do that in an efficient way.  
   And in order to know which 

04:29:51.680 --> 04:29:55.342
URLs to crawl and in which 
order, we have another set of 

04:29:55.343 --> 04:29:57.343
systems which are known as 
schedulers.

04:30:01.095 --> 04:30:03.168
So they queue the URLs for the 
crawlers to go and fetch.  And 

04:30:03.169 --> 04:30:05.000
all of this gets then stored.  
   So you might think that this 

04:30:05.001 --> 04:30:09.269
is a pretty simple process, but 
if you start thinking that we 

04:30:09.270 --> 04:30:11.270
have to do this 20 

04:30:12.342 --> 04:30:14.987
billion times per day, then you 
kind of get an idea, it's a 

04:30:14.988 --> 04:30:16.988
little bit trickier than it 
seems at first sight.  

04:30:21.573 --> 04:30:24.635
In fact, in 2016, we saw 130 
trillion pages.  And every new 

04:30:24.636 --> 04:30:26.636
link that we see, usually 
there's two more links that 

04:30:28.302 --> 04:30:29.927
we've never seen before, so 
there's constantly new stuff, 

04:30:29.928 --> 04:30:33.193
and we have to decide what to 
crawl, how to update, and to do 

04:30:33.194 --> 04:30:35.194
this in the most efficient 
manner.  

04:30:35.434 --> 04:30:37.434
So, whilst we find the content, 
we have a series of other tasks.

04:30:39.546 --> 04:30:41.165
First, we have to make sure that
we're allowed to access that 

04:30:41.166 --> 04:30:45.857
content.  And for that, we will 
first go -- every time we access

04:30:45.858 --> 04:30:47.858
a site, we'll go to 

04:30:51.165 --> 04:30:53.165
a file called Robos text, which 
is a 

04:30:54.412 --> 04:30:56.264
pretty simple file containing 
info to search engines, and it 

04:30:56.265 --> 04:30:59.714
tells you this is okay to fetch 
and this is not okay, and we 

04:30:59.715 --> 04:31:01.134
obey this very strictly.  So 
that's the first thing we'll try

04:31:01.135 --> 04:31:03.181
to find on a website.  
   The other thing that we'll 

04:31:03.182 --> 04:31:05.680
try to do is to get as much 
content as possible 

04:31:09.331 --> 04:31:11.192
without troubling the normal 
work of the server, so the 

04:31:11.193 --> 04:31:14.889
website can function and serve 
its clients as usual.  And then 

04:31:14.890 --> 04:31:18.147
finally, we'll try to handle 
errors gracefully.  So, as a 

04:31:18.148 --> 04:31:21.803
developer, you have two tasks 
here.  The first, if you 

04:31:21.804 --> 04:31:23.804
remember again, that 

04:31:25.120 --> 04:31:26.746
we do fetches 20 billion times a
day and we see trillions of 

04:31:26.747 --> 04:31:30.204
pages every year is that your 
content should be really easy to

04:31:30.205 --> 04:31:34.514
discover.  So, ways to do that, 
and John will go into a little 

04:31:34.515 --> 04:31:36.951
bit more detail later is to, for
example, submit to us a list of 

04:31:38.985 --> 04:31:41.032
a few URLs that you have, like a
site map.  Or, also check that 

04:31:41.033 --> 04:31:43.096
all the resources that are 
necessary for your site to be 

04:31:46.966 --> 04:31:48.795
rendered are accessible to our 
crawlers.  

04:31:48.796 --> 04:31:50.826
So once we fetched everything 
that we were able to fetch, we 

04:31:50.827 --> 04:31:54.300
go to the next stage, and that 
is indexing.  So here we're 

04:31:54.301 --> 04:31:56.301
going to parse the 

04:31:59.179 --> 04:32:00.399
content, and into this comes 
things like what language is 

04:32:00.400 --> 04:32:02.629
this page, are there any images,
is there a title, is there a 

04:32:06.515 --> 04:32:09.015
description, and other different
elements on the page.  

04:32:11.050 --> 04:32:13.920
So, to do that, we also try to 
render the page, and as a 

04:32:13.921 --> 04:32:17.594
developer, especially if you're 
building a lot of really cutting

04:32:17.595 --> 04:32:19.862
edge fancy things, you have to 
keep in mind that currently, the

04:32:19.863 --> 04:32:21.863
search 

04:32:23.204 --> 04:32:25.204
systems are using Chrome 41 to 
render pages.

04:32:28.305 --> 04:32:29.310
So, not all of the different 
functionalities that you might 

04:32:29.311 --> 04:32:32.368
be thinking about could be 
supported by the Search 

04:32:32.369 --> 04:32:34.369
rendering systems.

04:32:37.259 --> 04:32:37.668
And if you want to find out 
more, I would suggest that you 

04:32:37.669 --> 04:32:41.133
have a look at the talk that 
John did earlier today in the 

04:32:41.134 --> 04:32:44.588
morning, in case you didn't wake
up at 8:30 to see it.  It will 

04:32:44.589 --> 04:32:46.214
be available on YouTube, and 
you'll be able to see a lot more

04:32:46.215 --> 04:32:49.753
about what we support in Search 
and how to render things 

04:32:49.754 --> 04:32:52.390
properly.  
   So, of course, given the huge

04:32:52.391 --> 04:32:57.105
amount of pages on the web, we 
also don't want to index more 

04:32:57.106 --> 04:32:59.577
than one of each unique thing.  
So we have a lot of systems in 

04:32:59.578 --> 04:33:03.275
place to eliminate duplicates 
and to keep only one copy of 

04:33:03.276 --> 04:33:05.324
each thing.  
   And then finally, we don't 

04:33:05.325 --> 04:33:10.644
want error pages, and we also 
don't want any spam.  So we will

04:33:10.645 --> 04:33:12.105
kick all of that out, and 
everything else that we want to 

04:33:12.106 --> 04:33:16.175
keep, we put in the index and we
process it so that it's ready to

04:33:16.176 --> 04:33:18.176
serve to users when they search.

04:33:19.858 --> 04:33:22.311
So for user developer here, I 
guess, it's important to 

04:33:22.312 --> 04:33:26.785
remember that key elements like 
titles and descriptions are 

04:33:26.786 --> 04:33:28.628
available in each page that your
users are creating, and then 

04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:31.672
also, to check how it's 
rendered.  But John will go into

04:33:31.673 --> 04:33:33.673
a lot more 

04:33:34.888 --> 04:33:36.810
detail here later.  
   And then finally, once we 

04:33:36.811 --> 04:33:39.644
have everything in the index, 
when users 

04:33:44.343 --> 04:33:46.267
start searching, we're going to 
pool pull a set of pages we 

04:33:46.268 --> 04:33:48.268
think are relevant results.  
We're going to add a bunch of 

04:33:49.524 --> 04:33:50.557
information we've already 
accumulated, like how important 

04:33:50.558 --> 04:33:53.414
they are and how they relate to 
the user's query.  And then 

04:33:53.415 --> 04:33:55.415
we're going to show them in some
specific order that we think is 

04:33:58.708 --> 04:34:01.170
most relevant for this user.  
   So, this is mostly on our 

04:34:01.171 --> 04:34:05.080
side, and you don't need to 
worry about anything here.  If 

04:34:05.081 --> 04:34:08.121
your content is already 
accessible and easy to render.  

04:34:08.122 --> 04:34:10.165
But if you're ready interested 
in ranking and search quality, 

04:34:10.166 --> 04:34:13.233
again, Google.com/jobs.  There's
plenty of interesting problems 

04:34:14.882 --> 04:34:17.119
to solve.  
   So, now that you know how 

04:34:17.120 --> 04:34:19.120
Search 

04:34:20.722 --> 04:34:22.849
works, let's have a summary of 
two things that you need to 

04:34:22.850 --> 04:34:26.697
remember.  First, you have to 
help us find the content.  And 

04:34:26.698 --> 04:34:29.350
second, you have to help us 
evaluate the content.  So, if 

04:34:29.351 --> 04:34:30.787
you're able to do these two 
things, you're pretty much set 

04:34:30.788 --> 04:34:34.034
as a developer.  
   Now, this is super, super 

04:34:34.035 --> 04:34:36.035
high level, 

04:34:37.088 --> 04:34:38.913
so what we're going to do next 
is show you how you can apply 

04:34:38.914 --> 04:34:41.756
this for each specific thing 
that you need to build.  

04:34:43.983 --> 04:34:45.210
So, we're going to start with 
websites, and John is going to 

04:34:45.211 --> 04:34:48.666
share with you some very 
specific advice about what to do

04:34:48.667 --> 04:34:50.667
and what not to do when 

04:34:52.699 --> 04:34:54.699
you're building a website for 
someone.  

04:34:55.608 --> 04:34:58.473
&gt;&gt; JOHN MUELLER:  All right.  
Thanks, Mariya.  That was a 

04:34:58.474 --> 04:35:00.474
great introduction into Search. 
Like you said, let's start with 

04:35:00.919 --> 04:35:02.553
websites.  
   You can build and maintain 

04:35:02.554 --> 04:35:06.007
one for yourself to kind of 
showcase your own content, or 

04:35:06.008 --> 04:35:08.008
maybe you're doing that for 

04:35:10.835 --> 04:35:11.837
other people to show -- to let 
them create websites on their 

04:35:11.838 --> 04:35:12.937
own.  
   You might be thinking that 

04:35:12.938 --> 04:35:16.379
showing up in Search isn't 
really your job as a developer, 

04:35:16.380 --> 04:35:18.380
but like we mentioned before, 

04:35:20.053 --> 04:35:21.672
as a developer, you play a 
really big role in kind of 

04:35:21.673 --> 04:35:24.525
putting everything in place so 
that Search can pick up the 

04:35:25.136 --> 04:35:27.136
content properly.

04:35:28.401 --> 04:35:29.810
So that's really important for 
us.  

04:35:29.811 --> 04:35:32.256
When it comes to website, I 
think it's worth taking a really

04:35:32.257 --> 04:35:34.257
big step back 

04:35:35.881 --> 04:35:37.109
and looking at the absolute 
basics.  So for us, that's a 

04:35:37.110 --> 04:35:39.110
URL.

04:35:41.211 --> 04:35:43.238
Essentially the address that's 
used to address a single piece 

04:35:43.239 --> 04:35:48.520
of content on the web.  Perhaps 
surprisingly, URLs are the cause

04:35:48.521 --> 04:35:50.521
of and solution to a lot of web 
search problems.  

04:35:52.171 --> 04:35:54.171
Traditionally, URLs on the web 
started out quite simple.

04:35:56.881 --> 04:35:59.726
They are requests that's sent to
the server, and it responds with

04:35:59.727 --> 04:36:02.200
unique HTML per URL.  Fragments 
within the URL, so 

04:36:08.907 --> 04:36:10.516
everything after thore hash sign
here.  Java script changed that 

04:36:10.517 --> 04:36:13.367
a little bit and suddenly a 
single URL could do that a 

04:36:13.368 --> 04:36:15.402
little bit more and show 
different kinds of content and 

04:36:15.403 --> 04:36:17.403
provide extra functionality.

04:36:20.308 --> 04:36:22.308
Some java script sites use 
fragments.

04:36:24.222 --> 04:36:26.222
Since these were easy to set 
with java script.  

04:36:26.269 --> 04:36:28.269
However, Google generally 
doesn't 

04:36:33.212 --> 04:36:34.420
support this, and as far as I 
know, no supports it with 

04:36:34.421 --> 04:36:36.421
individual fragments.

04:36:37.674 --> 04:36:39.674
So now we recommend using java 

04:36:41.134 --> 04:36:43.395
script's API to normal 
traditionally looking URLs.  So 

04:36:43.396 --> 04:36:44.197
in short, with URLs, stick to 
something more traditional.  

04:36:47.861 --> 04:36:50.702
Another really important thing 
that comes into play with URLs 

04:36:50.703 --> 04:36:54.578
is that often you have many 
different URLs that lead to the 

04:36:54.579 --> 04:36:58.270
same content.  As a developer, 
that's usually no big deal, and 

04:36:58.271 --> 04:37:01.142
you can look at that, and you 
think, well, index HTML, that's 

04:37:03.395 --> 04:37:06.495
obviously the home page.  
Everybody developer knows that. 

04:37:06.496 --> 04:37:08.366
But for search engines, that's 
not so obvious.  It could be 

04:37:08.367 --> 04:37:10.367
something completely different. 

04:37:12.408 --> 04:37:14.408
Sometimes you also just add 
tracking 

04:37:15.478 --> 04:37:16.708
parameters to URLs, and all of 
these different URLs are 

04:37:16.709 --> 04:37:20.387
essentially, for search engines,
separate pages that we could 

04:37:20.388 --> 04:37:23.036
look at and say, well, there 
might be something different 

04:37:23.037 --> 04:37:25.037
here.  And you can imagine at 20
billion 

04:37:28.346 --> 04:37:30.591
times a day, that could lead to 
a lot of inefficient crawling.  

04:37:30.592 --> 04:37:36.334
   So we prefer to have a single
URL per piece of content.  And 

04:37:36.335 --> 04:37:39.402
there are two ways that you can 
do that.  The first is to 

04:37:39.403 --> 04:37:41.403
consistently use the 

04:37:42.656 --> 04:37:44.930
same URLs across your whole 
website.  So if you have 

04:37:44.931 --> 04:37:48.382
internal navigation, link to the
same pages.  If you have a file 

04:37:48.383 --> 04:37:53.268
like Mariya mentioned, use the 
same URLs there.  If you use 

04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:55.511
anything to guide people to your
websites, make sure you use the 

04:37:57.338 --> 04:37:59.168
same URLs there, instead of 
having these different patterns 

04:37:59.169 --> 04:38:01.169
that all lead to the same thing.

04:38:03.012 --> 04:38:05.012
And secondly, one element that 
you 

04:38:06.636 --> 04:38:08.636
can also use is

04:38:10.596 --> 04:38:13.237
the rel canonical link element, 
that tells us search engines or 

04:38:13.238 --> 04:38:16.289
Google, if you look at this 
paging this is actually the URL 

04:38:16.290 --> 04:38:18.290
that I prefer you look at.  This
is the one that I want you to 

04:38:18.527 --> 04:38:21.973
index.  And together, this makes
it a little bit easier for 

04:38:21.974 --> 04:38:23.974
search engines to pick the right
URL.

04:38:27.310 --> 04:38:31.996
   So, we have URLs covered.  
What else is there?  Let's take 

04:38:31.997 --> 04:38:33.997
a look at a typical search 
results page.

04:38:36.071 --> 04:38:40.958
So we have on top the title, the
Google I/O schedule page.  Then 

04:38:40.959 --> 04:38:42.778
we have the URL, which is right 
below it.  It's a bread crumb 

04:38:42.779 --> 04:38:46.243
URL.  We'll look at that briefly
a little bit earlier as well.  

04:38:46.244 --> 04:38:47.870
And then you have the 
description.  So these are three

04:38:47.871 --> 04:38:49.931
elements on a search results 
page that are immediately 

04:38:51.352 --> 04:38:54.387
visible to everyone who is 
searching for something.  And 

04:38:54.388 --> 04:38:56.259
they come from your pages 
directly.  So it's something 

04:38:56.260 --> 04:38:58.260
that as a developer, it's really
easy to place.  

04:39:03.595 --> 04:39:05.217
When you look at an HTML page, 
they're very visible and easy to

04:39:05.218 --> 04:39:08.251
find.  So we have the title on 
top.  This is really easy to put

04:39:08.252 --> 04:39:10.252
in here.

04:39:15.585 --> 04:39:16.607
We have the canonical element, 
which is really easy to place 

04:39:16.608 --> 04:39:21.678
here.  And we have the 
description, meta description.  

04:39:21.679 --> 04:39:23.719
So while these elements don't 
directly affect the rankings, or

04:39:23.720 --> 04:39:26.978
the order that Mariya talked 
about, they do affect how we 

04:39:26.979 --> 04:39:29.419
show a page in the search 
results, and with that, they do 

04:39:29.420 --> 04:39:33.301
affect how people actually come 
and visit your pages or not.  

04:39:33.302 --> 04:39:35.560
   So, we've seen a few of the 
basic 

04:39:39.104 --> 04:39:40.717
elements here, like the 
metadata, the titles, the URLs, 

04:39:40.718 --> 04:39:43.573
the descriptions.  What could 
you as a developer do to make 

04:39:43.574 --> 04:39:44.802
that a little bit easier?  
Especially if you have various 

04:39:44.803 --> 04:39:46.803
people 

04:39:48.859 --> 04:39:50.482
who are using your website, your
project to put content online, 

04:39:50.483 --> 04:39:53.972
we recommend making it as easy 
as possible for them to do the 

04:39:53.973 --> 04:39:58.035
right thing.  So not just for 
you as a developer to put 

04:39:58.036 --> 04:39:59.862
titles, descriptions, and all of
that into your pages, but also 

04:39:59.863 --> 04:40:01.863
for those 

04:40:02.920 --> 04:40:06.167
who are creating pages on your 
platform to put that in here.  

04:40:06.168 --> 04:40:08.168
So here you see a user interface
from 

04:40:09.170 --> 04:40:12.364
blogger with a really easy way 
to add a description to 

04:40:12.365 --> 04:40:14.615
individual pages.  
   And we feel the easier it is 

04:40:14.616 --> 04:40:18.334
for people making your pages to 
actually put this content in 

04:40:18.335 --> 04:40:20.335
there, the more likely 

04:40:22.162 --> 04:40:26.078
they'll actually do that.  
   When we looked at the search 

04:40:26.079 --> 04:40:28.079
results, we saw this kind of 
bread crumb there as well.

04:40:31.598 --> 04:40:33.207
A bread crumb is for us 
something that is -- something 

04:40:33.208 --> 04:40:35.208
that you can provide on your 
pages to make it easier to 

04:40:36.506 --> 04:40:39.756
understand where this page 
belongs within your website.  We

04:40:39.757 --> 04:40:41.757
call this a type of a rich 
result, 

04:40:43.221 --> 04:40:45.047
because it's not just a pure 
text result.  And there are 

04:40:45.048 --> 04:40:48.486
different kinds of rich results 
that you can also use.  

04:40:50.557 --> 04:40:51.774
For example, you can add mark-up
for articles, if you have 

04:40:51.775 --> 04:40:56.376
articles on a page.  You could 
tell us about podcasts, which is

04:40:56.377 --> 04:40:58.002
really cool, because there's a 
podcast player built into the 

04:40:58.003 --> 04:41:00.892
search results.  So if you have 
a podcast, if you have 

04:41:03.949 --> 04:41:05.561
a project that includes audio 
content, then suddenly that 

04:41:05.562 --> 04:41:07.562
content is immediately available
in the search 

04:41:11.271 --> 04:41:13.105
results without anyone needing 
to install a next draft, which 

04:41:13.106 --> 04:41:15.143
is really cool.  
   And finally, recipes, of 

04:41:15.144 --> 04:41:19.205
course.  Which we saw with 
Rakuten in the beginning.  So, 

04:41:19.206 --> 04:41:22.260
how do you get all of these rich
results?  Well, Mariya mentioned

04:41:22.261 --> 04:41:24.261
that briefly.

04:41:27.346 --> 04:41:28.967
Essentially, it's just a bunch 
of JSON LD mark-up that you can 

04:41:28.968 --> 04:41:31.409
add to top of your pages that 
gives us a lot more information.

04:41:33.437 --> 04:41:37.106
So this is something that you 
can just add to the pages here. 

04:41:37.107 --> 04:41:38.546
It's really easy to add.  We 
have a bunch of different types 

04:41:38.547 --> 04:41:40.547
of mark-up that you can add 
here.

04:41:43.466 --> 04:41:45.095
There's a code lab here for I/O 
as well, so if you're curious on

04:41:45.096 --> 04:41:47.096
how to do 

04:41:49.368 --> 04:41:52.007
that, I'd definitely take a look
at the code lab.  I have a link 

04:41:52.008 --> 04:41:55.271
here.  The code lab includes 
information on finding the right

04:41:55.272 --> 04:41:58.728
types of mark-up to add, how to 
add it, and how the test it.  So

04:41:58.729 --> 04:42:00.729
that's a great thing to check 
out.  

04:42:02.621 --> 04:42:04.066
Another element when it comes to
web pages, if you're working on 

04:42:04.067 --> 04:42:09.159
just a general web page project,
is speed.  For us, speed is a 

04:42:09.160 --> 04:42:11.829
ranking factor at Google, so it 
helps us to determine 

04:42:15.506 --> 04:42:16.520
which pages we should show in 
the order, in the search 

04:42:16.521 --> 04:42:19.579
results.  But generally, we've 
also found that speed makes a 

04:42:19.580 --> 04:42:23.030
big difference, even outside of 
search engines.  And there are 

04:42:23.031 --> 04:42:25.031
various tools to test speed.

04:42:26.717 --> 04:42:27.927
We have a link here that gives 
you an overview of the different

04:42:27.928 --> 04:42:29.928
testing tools that we have.

04:42:32.619 --> 04:42:34.268
One of the tools is page speed 
insights that gives you a great 

04:42:34.269 --> 04:42:37.987
overview of what you could be 
testing, what you could be 

04:42:37.988 --> 04:42:40.017
looking at, what you could be 
improving.  

04:42:43.078 --> 04:42:44.905
And then one other really 
important tool when it comes to 

04:42:44.906 --> 04:42:47.551
Search is Search Console, kind 
of what the name says.

04:42:51.001 --> 04:42:52.440
So within Search Console, you 
get a lot of information about 

04:42:52.441 --> 04:42:54.441
this whole pipeline that Mariya 
showed, everything 

04:42:58.583 --> 04:43:01.558
from discovery to crawling to 
indexing, and to serving.  How 

04:43:01.559 --> 04:43:02.980
we show your pages in the search
results, you can find 

04:43:02.981 --> 04:43:04.981
information about 

04:43:06.044 --> 04:43:08.128
this in Search Console.  
   Additionally, we'll alert you

04:43:08.129 --> 04:43:10.982
of critical issues as they 
arise.  So we strongly recommend

04:43:10.983 --> 04:43:14.445
that everyone checks this out if
you're making a public web 

04:43:14.446 --> 04:43:16.446
presence, anything that you 

04:43:17.897 --> 04:43:18.907
want to have indexed in Search, 
and it looks like a lot of you 

04:43:18.908 --> 04:43:20.538
do.  
   So the first step when it 

04:43:20.539 --> 04:43:25.506
comes to Search Console is to 
verify ownership.  We don't show

04:43:25.507 --> 04:43:28.370
the data in Search Console to 
just everyone.  You have to kind

04:43:28.371 --> 04:43:30.371
of prove to us that this is 
actually your website.

04:43:34.472 --> 04:43:36.100
One thing that I find really 
important here is if you're 

04:43:36.101 --> 04:43:38.138
making a project for others 
online, make it as easy as 

04:43:39.357 --> 04:43:40.972
possible for them to verify 
ownership.  So make it possible 

04:43:40.973 --> 04:43:45.684
for them to add any of these 
verification tokens so that they

04:43:45.685 --> 04:43:47.310
don't always have to come back 
to the development team and say,

04:43:47.311 --> 04:43:49.311
hey, I need this special file 
that has this 

04:43:52.972 --> 04:43:54.972
content and put that on the page
.  

04:43:56.515 --> 04:43:58.515
So we talked about websites 
quite a 

04:44:00.397 --> 04:44:02.024
bit, but web app is another 
really important topic, which I 

04:44:02.025 --> 04:44:06.311
imagine a lot of you have seen 
in different ways here at I/O 

04:44:06.312 --> 04:44:10.197
already.  Web app is kind of 
like a normal website, but it 

04:44:10.198 --> 04:44:12.198
provides a lot more 

04:44:13.607 --> 04:44:15.544
interactive functionality, 
interaction, maybe logged in 

04:44:15.545 --> 04:44:18.002
view, personalization.  Maybe it
has parts that don't actually 

04:44:20.851 --> 04:44:22.851
need to be indexed as well.  For
example, a travel business might

04:44:23.504 --> 04:44:25.736
have information about 
timetables and general pricing, 

04:44:25.737 --> 04:44:27.983
but also have detailed 
information about kind of 

04:44:27.984 --> 04:44:31.460
specific connection plan for 
individual connections or 

04:44:31.461 --> 04:44:33.461
personalized pricing as well.  

04:44:36.535 --> 04:44:38.174
Or, in this case, for Search 
Console, we have a lot of 

04:44:38.175 --> 04:44:41.918
general informational pages, as 
well as a lot of content that's 

04:44:41.919 --> 04:44:44.150
kind of unique and where you 
have to be logged in to actually

04:44:44.151 --> 04:44:46.794
gain access to that.  
   So for these type of sites, 

04:44:46.795 --> 04:44:50.657
you kind of have to balance 
between what you want to have 

04:44:50.658 --> 04:44:53.092
indexed and what you don't 
really want to have indexed.  

04:44:53.093 --> 04:44:57.766
   And for web apps in general, 
I also take a look at the java 

04:44:57.767 --> 04:44:59.767
script side 

04:45:01.584 --> 04:45:03.584
session from earlier today

04:45:04.680 --> 04:45:06.559
.  
   There are a few things we 

04:45:06.560 --> 04:45:10.652
found that are kind of unique 
when it comes to web apps that 

04:45:10.653 --> 04:45:12.890
generally don't play such a big 
role on websites in general, 

04:45:15.332 --> 04:45:17.332
especially if you're making 
normal HTML pages.

04:45:18.572 --> 04:45:22.453
The first one is how to actually
find URLs on your site.  So we 

04:45:22.454 --> 04:45:24.889
talked about URLs briefly.  
Mariya mentioned how important 

04:45:24.890 --> 04:45:27.943
they are for discovering pages, 
and within web apps, we've seen 

04:45:27.944 --> 04:45:32.424
that people sometimes don't use 
traditional anchor tags to let 

04:45:32.425 --> 04:45:35.068
us know about URLs.  So, in 
particular, we love finding 

04:45:39.559 --> 04:45:42.628
things like this, where we've 
had an A tag, a link to a page. 

04:45:42.629 --> 04:45:44.873
We control that.  It's really 
easy to find.  It's a lot 

04:45:44.874 --> 04:45:46.874
trickier when you have 

04:45:47.931 --> 04:45:50.374
something like a span that calls
a java script function with an 

04:45:50.375 --> 04:45:54.681
on click handler.  Then search 
engines, when they look at that,

04:45:54.682 --> 04:45:57.119
they're like, I don't know, what
do we need to do here?  Does 

04:45:57.120 --> 04:45:58.957
this show a dialogue?  Does this
show new page?  Does this go 

04:45:58.958 --> 04:46:01.615
somewhere?  We don't know.  So 
we can't crawl this kind of 

04:46:01.616 --> 04:46:03.696
link.  
   So what you can do, if you 

04:46:03.697 --> 04:46:06.134
want to have an on-click handler
and handle 

04:46:10.415 --> 04:46:12.415
things in java script is combine
the two.

04:46:13.690 --> 04:46:15.517
So you have your on-click 
handler and your attribute to 

04:46:15.518 --> 04:46:20.259
let us know about the other page
that we can go off and crawl.  

04:46:23.334 --> 04:46:25.346
And another extreme when we come
to web apps is we often run into

04:46:25.347 --> 04:46:28.997
situations where we see tons of 
different URLs, which makes it, 

04:46:28.998 --> 04:46:31.646
again, quite inefficient to 
actually crawl through.  So, 

04:46:31.647 --> 04:46:34.096
there are different things that 
you can do here to let us know 

04:46:34.097 --> 04:46:39.388
about this.  The first is 
obviously to avoid us actually 

04:46:39.389 --> 04:46:42.658
going off and crawling all of 
these different URLs.  So if 

04:46:42.659 --> 04:46:44.079
these don't provide unique 
functionality that you need to 

04:46:44.080 --> 04:46:48.972
have indexed separately, maybe 
you can use other ways of 

04:46:48.973 --> 04:46:50.973
linking to them other than A 
element.  

04:46:51.611 --> 04:46:53.611
Another thing that you can do is

04:46:54.866 --> 04:46:56.293
within search consoleSearch 
Console, tell us about 

04:46:56.294 --> 04:47:00.082
individual parameters within the
URL that you don't care about.  

04:47:00.083 --> 04:47:02.765
So this is a really neat tool, 
but it's also very strong 

04:47:02.766 --> 04:47:06.858
functionality, in that if you 
set this up indirectly, then of 

04:47:06.859 --> 04:47:08.910
course we won't go off and crawl
all of these URLs.  And if this 

04:47:08.911 --> 04:47:10.964
is something that you care 
about, then absolutely we won't 

04:47:10.965 --> 04:47:14.829
be able to index that.  
   So watch out for this, but 

04:47:14.830 --> 04:47:17.289
this is a great way of handling 
this kind of duplication within 

04:47:17.290 --> 04:47:23.986
a website.  
   Again, like we talked about 

04:47:23.987 --> 04:47:27.238
before, a lot of web apps use 
java script frameworks, and you 

04:47:27.239 --> 04:47:29.239
have to watch out 

04:47:32.728 --> 04:47:35.471
for some specific details as 
well.  We can crawl and index 

04:47:35.472 --> 04:47:37.923
the content in an efficient way.
For that, I really refer back to

04:47:37.924 --> 04:47:43.291
the java script side session 
that we had this morning.  A 

04:47:43.292 --> 04:47:45.292
really quick way, if you just 
want 

04:47:46.757 --> 04:47:48.606
to have a short view of whether 
or not your java script site, 

04:47:48.607 --> 04:47:50.607
your web app 

04:47:51.673 --> 04:47:52.688
works for Search is to use a 
mobile-friendly test, which is 

04:47:52.689 --> 04:47:56.131
shown here, which shows the 
mobile view as mobile Google bot

04:47:56.132 --> 04:47:58.132
would show.  This is really 
important for us, 

04:48:00.667 --> 04:48:02.091
because we're switching to 
mobile first indexing, where 

04:48:02.092 --> 04:48:04.092
Google bot is actually using a 
mobile device to crawl pages 

04:48:05.948 --> 04:48:07.361
rather than a desktop device.  
So definitely makes sense to 

04:48:07.362 --> 04:48:09.362
check this out.

04:48:12.371 --> 04:48:17.359
   We also have a bunch of best 
practices and general guidelines

04:48:17.360 --> 04:48:21.207
that apply more to web apps that
you can check out in the other 

04:48:21.208 --> 04:48:23.454
sessions as well.  
   So, what do you do if you're 

04:48:23.455 --> 04:48:26.501
not just building one 
application or one website, but 

04:48:26.502 --> 04:48:28.955
rather a whole platform?  I 
don't know.  Mariya?  Can you 

04:48:28.956 --> 04:48:30.956
tell us more?  

04:48:33.377 --> 04:48:35.377
&gt;&gt; MARIYA MOEVA:  I have some 
ideas

04:48:37.537 --> 04:48:39.537
.  You could be building an 
individual 

04:48:40.820 --> 04:48:43.049
site or a web app for yourself 
or someone else.  Or you could 

04:48:43.050 --> 04:48:45.050
be contributing to the entire 
management system or another 

04:48:45.283 --> 04:48:50.000
hosting platform.  And here, 
what I mean by in is, any type 

04:48:50.001 --> 04:48:52.028
of platform where other people 
can create their own online 

04:48:52.029 --> 04:48:57.048
presence.  So, it can come in 
different flavors.  For example,

04:48:57.049 --> 04:48:59.722
it could be something like Word 
Press where you could download 

04:49:01.552 --> 04:49:03.192
it and host it on your open 
server, or it could be a fully 

04:49:03.193 --> 04:49:06.072
hosted system plus your own 
domain, like Square Space, for 

04:49:07.718 --> 04:49:09.952
example, or it could be 
something where you just get a 

04:49:09.953 --> 04:49:11.953
URL on their own domain, 

04:49:12.993 --> 04:49:14.619
and also it's hosted by them 
like Tumblr.  So there are all 

04:49:14.620 --> 04:49:18.684
these different flavors that you
could be working for a system 

04:49:18.685 --> 04:49:22.582
like this, which in its own turn
has a bunch of users.  So what 

04:49:22.583 --> 04:49:24.583
you do affects all of these 

04:49:26.052 --> 04:49:27.269
people, and that is a lot of 
power, and a lot of 

04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:29.718
responsibility.  
   So we're going to talk about 

04:49:29.719 --> 04:49:33.807
what can you do to make all 
these people successful in 

04:49:33.808 --> 04:49:36.249
search by making some changes to
the platform itself.  

04:49:37.875 --> 04:49:39.875
And this is a really important 
topic 

04:49:41.936 --> 04:49:44.592
for us right now, because more 
than 50% and growing of the web 

04:49:44.593 --> 04:49:49.257
is currently built on various 
TMSs.  So, more than half of the

04:49:49.258 --> 04:49:53.570
content on the web is affected 
by the systems, and if you're 

04:49:53.571 --> 04:49:54.987
working in one of them or 
planning to do so in the future,

04:49:54.988 --> 04:49:56.988
it's 

04:49:59.274 --> 04:50:00.493
really great if you're able to 
make people successful as well, 

04:50:00.494 --> 04:50:02.494
because 

04:50:04.584 --> 04:50:06.001
that's why they came on the 
ebbhe web, maybe connect to some

04:50:06.002 --> 04:50:07.831
customers and so forth.  
   So we've been thinking a lot 

04:50:07.832 --> 04:50:12.105
about this, and we've built a 
set of APIs to help you 

04:50:12.106 --> 04:50:14.337
integrate search functionality 
directly into the interface of 

04:50:14.338 --> 04:50:19.834
those systems.  And I want to 
show you some APIs and how 

04:50:19.835 --> 04:50:21.460
they've been integrated already,
maybe to give you some 

04:50:21.461 --> 04:50:23.461
inspiration and ideas about what
you can do.  

04:50:25.329 --> 04:50:27.329
So, as John was mentioning 
before, 

04:50:28.828 --> 04:50:31.269
the first thing that we need in 
order to show any type of Search

04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:33.742
information or Search 
functionality is to have proof 

04:50:36.206 --> 04:50:38.445
that you're indeed the owner of 
the site.  He mentioned how this

04:50:38.446 --> 04:50:43.529
works for individual sites, so 
you can have an hl file, you can

04:50:43.530 --> 04:50:46.402
have a DNS entry, so forth.  But
for the less savvy CMS users, 

04:50:48.029 --> 04:50:50.889
wouldn't it be great if you 
could actuallyHTML file, you can

04:50:50.890 --> 04:50:55.023
have a DNS entry, so forth.  But
for the less savvy CMS users, 

04:50:50.890 --> 04:50:54.756
wouldn't it be great if you 
could actually simplify it to 

04:50:50.890 --> 04:50:57.191
one click?  And it is possible 
with the verification API.  So 

04:50:57.192 --> 04:50:59.050
we've built this API so that you
can use it, and if the user 

04:50:59.051 --> 04:51:02.953
authorizes you, you could verify
their site, which is hosted on 

04:51:02.954 --> 04:51:04.954
your platform on their 

04:51:05.974 --> 04:51:10.986
behalf.  They just need to click
one button and they immediately 

04:51:10.987 --> 04:51:12.987
have access to the search 
information, so the experience 

04:51:14.072 --> 04:51:15.914
for them is really smooth and 
you can do this for a thousand 

04:51:15.915 --> 04:51:17.915
users or two million users or 
whatever it is, and immediately 

04:51:18.972 --> 04:51:21.207
they get access to all kind of 
interesting stats.  

04:51:23.057 --> 04:51:25.057
Which brings me to the next API,

04:51:26.905 --> 04:51:28.946
which is the Search Console API,
and that provides access to 

04:51:28.947 --> 04:51:31.811
aggregated steps per site.  So 
you can see things like clicks, 

04:51:32.622 --> 04:51:34.622
impressions, crawlers.  You can 
submit a site map through there.

04:51:36.483 --> 04:51:38.483
And you can slice and dice this 
in many different ways.

04:51:41.588 --> 04:51:43.821
So, for example, you can look 
per country, per time period, or

04:51:43.822 --> 04:51:46.307
per dwishgs and you can build 
very interesting interfaces with

04:51:46.308 --> 04:51:48.343
that.  And here on the slide is 
an example of 

04:51:52.620 --> 04:51:54.856
a request where you just pull in
the top queries per clicks for a

04:51:54.857 --> 04:51:56.857
specific period 

04:51:58.306 --> 04:51:59.736
of time, and as a result, you 
can get the queries position and

04:51:59.737 --> 04:52:01.562
so forth.  
   Now, a table in itself might 

04:52:01.563 --> 04:52:03.563
be 

04:52:05.388 --> 04:52:07.388
informative, but it's not

04:52:08.489 --> 04:52:10.489
really exciting.

04:52:12.377 --> 04:52:15.010
We've been working with WIX, and
they created this achievements 

04:52:15.011 --> 04:52:17.011
side bar for their users.

04:52:18.550 --> 04:52:21.209
So they're using the search 
analytics data to give these 

04:52:21.210 --> 04:52:22.834
little passages every time 
something happens that they 

04:52:22.835 --> 04:52:24.835
think 

04:52:25.917 --> 04:52:27.779
the user will be happy to hear 
about.  So their users are super

04:52:27.780 --> 04:52:29.780
excited about 

04:52:32.046 --> 04:52:34.106
this gamefied approach, and 
they're constantly looking to 

04:52:34.107 --> 04:52:36.952
see, okay what did I get now?  
Here's clicks and impressions 

04:52:36.953 --> 04:52:39.419
built in an achievement side bar
like this.  

04:52:41.449 --> 04:52:43.288
We've also been working with 
Square Space, and actually just 

04:52:43.289 --> 04:52:47.555
this Monday, they announced this
new report that they integrated 

04:52:47.556 --> 04:52:52.461
into the interface of their own 
CMS.  So what you see here is 

04:52:52.462 --> 04:52:54.906
the one-click verification.  
When the user clicks connect to 

04:52:57.561 --> 04:52:59.613
Google, on the back end, their 
site gets verified, and then 

04:52:59.614 --> 04:53:01.854
this report gets populated with 
information from Search Console.

04:53:04.701 --> 04:53:06.325
So here, the user can see 
clicks, impressions, and the 

04:53:06.326 --> 04:53:10.802
time series over the last month.
   Square Space has a bunch of 

04:53:10.803 --> 04:53:14.884
other analytics reports inside 
their CMS, so people can compare

04:53:14.885 --> 04:53:18.497
and build the full picture of 
how they're doing in search.  

04:53:18.498 --> 04:53:20.498
And at this point, they don't 
even 

04:53:22.042 --> 04:53:23.871
know that Search Console exists,
but they have everything that 

04:53:23.872 --> 04:53:26.909
they need to know how they're 
doing and to accomplish the 

04:53:26.910 --> 04:53:28.139
correct tasks right there in 
their Square Space dashboard.  

04:53:28.140 --> 04:53:32.028
   So we are pretty excited 
about this kind of functionality

04:53:32.029 --> 04:53:36.287
and we want to build up on it, 
and we would be looking forward 

04:53:36.288 --> 04:53:37.912
to work with other CMSs, if 
you're representing one and 

04:53:37.913 --> 04:53:40.187
you're interested in this.  
   Another thing that we really 

04:53:40.188 --> 04:53:42.188
wanted 

04:53:43.865 --> 04:53:45.272
to help users with is get their 
content as fast as possible on 

04:53:45.273 --> 04:53:47.928
the search results.  And so 
we've been looking into ways to 

04:53:50.166 --> 04:53:52.617
use the indexing API that we 
have in order to get content 

04:53:52.618 --> 04:53:55.673
submitted super quickly, and 
then also be able to share the 

04:53:55.674 --> 04:53:59.778
indexing decisions.  So what did
our search systems think about 

04:53:59.779 --> 04:54:03.433
this URL and what did they want 
to do with it.  And we worked on

04:54:03.434 --> 04:54:06.080
this for a few months, and at 
this point, it's in a place 

04:54:06.081 --> 04:54:08.081
where this can happen within 
seconds.  

04:54:09.538 --> 04:54:11.601
So, again, with WIX, we built a 
pretty cool integration, where 

04:54:11.602 --> 04:54:16.248
when the user submits a page and
it matches a certain quality 

04:54:16.249 --> 04:54:18.734
criteria, basically, they can 
click a button within the WIX 

04:54:20.773 --> 04:54:22.591
interface, and then the page 
gets submitted through the 

04:54:22.592 --> 04:54:24.677
indexing API, and then after 
that, they immediately get a 

04:54:26.115 --> 04:54:28.115
response if their page got on 
the search results or not.  

04:54:29.969 --> 04:54:30.995
So for the WIX users, this is a 
pretty cool experience because 

04:54:30.996 --> 04:54:35.086
they can see their page in the 
search results immediately after

04:54:35.087 --> 04:54:39.768
they've created it.  There's no 
waiting, there's no wondering, 

04:54:39.769 --> 04:54:42.005
am I on Search or not?  Within 
seconds, they're in Google.  

04:54:42.006 --> 04:54:47.096
   So, we're interested in 
working with other CMSs, and if 

04:54:47.097 --> 04:54:49.371
you represent some kind of 
content management system or a 

04:54:51.814 --> 04:54:53.814
platform, which lets users 
create their 

04:54:55.683 --> 04:54:57.907
own presence online, and 
especially if your users are 

04:54:57.908 --> 04:54:59.946
less savvy and they don't really
know what to do with Search, we 

04:55:01.370 --> 04:55:03.228
are really interested in talking
to you to see if it might be a 

04:55:03.229 --> 04:55:05.284
good fit to participate in the 
CMS partnership program.  

04:55:07.472 --> 04:55:09.850
So there's a link on this slide 
which will take you to a forum, 

04:55:09.851 --> 04:55:13.075
and there you can tell us a 
little bit more about who you 

04:55:13.076 --> 04:55:15.076
represent and how you would like
to work with us.  

04:55:15.331 --> 04:55:16.173
So, looking forward to hearing 
from some of you, hopefully.  

04:55:16.174 --> 04:55:21.867
   Now, you could be 
contributing not just to the 

04:55:21.868 --> 04:55:24.704
core product of the CMS, but to 
a bunch of other things which 

04:55:24.705 --> 04:55:26.705
people install in order to 
enhance the 

04:55:29.534 --> 04:55:31.534
functionality of their site

04:55:33.282 --> 04:55:34.912
.  One of those things are 
plugins.  So, for example, 

04:55:34.913 --> 04:55:39.461
things like a shopping cart or 
maybe a way to add reviews or a 

04:55:39.462 --> 04:55:42.309
comment plugin, things like 
that.  So, while it can enhance 

04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:46.599
the functionality of the site, 
it can also significantly alter 

04:55:46.600 --> 04:55:49.440
the functionality of the site in
terms of performance and other 

04:55:49.441 --> 04:55:51.719
factors.  
   So, I wanted to give you a 

04:55:51.720 --> 04:55:53.720
few tips 

04:55:54.765 --> 04:55:56.765
on what to do if you're building
plugins.  

04:55:57.871 --> 04:55:59.700
First of all, make sure that it 
doesn't slow down the 

04:55:59.701 --> 04:56:01.701
performance of the site.

04:56:03.558 --> 04:56:05.607
So in order to do this, have a 
test site, install a plugin, and

04:56:05.608 --> 04:56:07.608
use our 

04:56:08.858 --> 04:56:10.704
speed tools to make sure that 
the site with the plugin is 

04:56:10.705 --> 04:56:12.705
doing just as well as the site 
without the plugin.

04:56:16.194 --> 04:56:18.631
This is webpagetest.org, and the
neat part about it is that 

04:56:21.903 --> 04:56:23.528
it will give you a super 
detailed breakdown of what and 

04:56:23.529 --> 04:56:27.225
when.  So you can see how your 
plugin is affecting the 

04:56:27.226 --> 04:56:29.226
performance of the site.  So 
test that out.  

04:56:32.320 --> 04:56:33.757
Then, if you're building a 
common plugin, and if you've 

04:56:33.758 --> 04:56:38.220
been on the Internet in general,
you will know that there are a 

04:56:38.221 --> 04:56:40.678
lot of comments out there, which
are maybe a lot less valuable 

04:56:40.679 --> 04:56:44.355
than other comments.  And 
especially in some spaces, 

04:56:44.356 --> 04:56:48.219
they're altogether spammy, or 
they're bots which are going 

04:56:48.220 --> 04:56:51.314
around and posting autogenerated
stuff in order to create links 

04:56:51.315 --> 04:56:53.356
that they're hoping search 
engines will follow to some 

04:56:53.357 --> 04:56:55.357
spammy websites.  

04:56:56.811 --> 04:56:58.446
So this is not pleasant for any 
user.  And you can actually help

04:56:58.447 --> 04:57:00.447
them out a little bit if you're 
building a plugin 

04:57:03.739 --> 04:57:05.739
like this by adding a specific 
type of 

04:57:07.434 --> 04:57:09.908
annotation to those links by 
default so that search engines 

04:57:09.909 --> 04:57:14.613
know not to trust them.  This is
a link attribute that we call No

04:57:14.614 --> 04:57:16.648
Follow, and basically what it 
does is it will just tell search

04:57:16.649 --> 04:57:21.112
engines, don't follow this link.
Don't trust it.  So if you're 

04:57:21.113 --> 04:57:23.113
building a comment plugin, 
definitely consider adding this 

04:57:26.199 --> 04:57:28.436
to the links in the comments.  
   Finally, and most 

04:57:28.437 --> 04:57:30.437
unfortunately, we have noticed 
that one of the main 

04:57:33.951 --> 04:57:35.584
vectors for attack on websites, 
and attacks on websites are 

04:57:35.585 --> 04:57:39.694
increasing, is hacks through 
plugins.  So a lot of hackers 

04:57:39.695 --> 04:57:43.154
and malicious -- other malicious
people will get access to a site

04:57:43.155 --> 04:57:44.780
through an old plugin, and if 
you're building plugins, there's

04:57:44.781 --> 04:57:48.030
a few things you can do to make 
sure that your users are not 

04:57:48.031 --> 04:57:50.705
affected by this.  
   First of all, make sure that 

04:57:50.706 --> 04:57:55.395
every time you add an update, 
everybody who has this plugin 

04:57:55.396 --> 04:57:57.396
automatically receives it.

04:57:59.253 --> 04:58:00.878
Then, make sure to follow coding
best practices so that there's 

04:58:00.879 --> 04:58:04.338
no back door so that the hackers
can exploit.  And finally, if 

04:58:04.339 --> 04:58:06.339
you get tired of this plugin and
decide not to support it 

04:58:08.028 --> 04:58:10.295
anymore, make sure it is clear 
to people that this is not 

04:58:10.296 --> 04:58:12.296
supported so they don't 

04:58:13.581 --> 04:58:14.998
go ahead and install something 
that is actually making their 

04:58:14.999 --> 04:58:20.073
site more vulnerable.  
   These are another thing that 

04:58:20.074 --> 04:58:25.373
is very closely related to CMSs,
and a lot of people install them

04:58:25.374 --> 04:58:27.411
in order to improve the 
appearance of their site to make

04:58:27.412 --> 04:58:31.700
it look cooler, or give it a 
specific feel.  So they can 

04:58:31.701 --> 04:58:33.937
change how the site looks and 
how users perceive it, but they 

04:58:33.938 --> 04:58:37.021
can also affect performance and 
they can also affect mobile 

04:58:37.022 --> 04:58:39.022
friendliness.  

04:58:40.885 --> 04:58:44.759
So, again here, test your theme,
make sure that it's responsive. 

04:58:44.760 --> 04:58:46.170
You can do this with a 
mobile-friendly test that John 

04:58:46.171 --> 04:58:48.171
was showing earlier.  And for 
performance specifically, we 

04:58:52.264 --> 04:58:54.301
recommend, again, having a test 
site with the theme, and with 

04:58:54.302 --> 04:58:56.945
another theme, having a look at 
how it performs.  

04:58:59.007 --> 04:59:00.630
Lighthouse is one of our speed 
tools that's really useful in 

04:59:00.631 --> 04:59:04.121
this case, because it's in the 
browser.  You don't need to have

04:59:04.122 --> 04:59:06.122
the site processed by Search in 
order to test it.  

04:59:08.182 --> 04:59:09.599
So here's a blogger site that we
used for the purposes of this 

04:59:09.600 --> 04:59:12.258
example.  We installed the 
theme, and then we 

04:59:15.511 --> 04:59:17.351
used lighthouse to do the 
performance testing.  So you see

04:59:17.352 --> 04:59:19.352
how long it takes actually 

04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:22.390
until what they called the first

04:59:24.271 --> 04:59:25.284
meaningful page, which is when 
all the elements appear to the 

04:59:25.285 --> 04:59:27.321
user.  
   So the overall score for this

04:59:27.322 --> 04:59:30.983
team was not super great, and 
the specific user metrics were 

04:59:30.984 --> 04:59:33.670
not great either.  But then we 
went ahead and we switched to 

04:59:33.671 --> 04:59:38.179
another theme.  So you can see 
here, it's much faster to load, 

04:59:38.180 --> 04:59:40.180
and the user can interact with 

04:59:41.437 --> 04:59:43.258
it much faster as well, and 
consequentially, the score is 

04:59:43.259 --> 04:59:45.259
also great.  
   So if you're building themes,

04:59:47.733 --> 04:59:49.733
definitely make sure that it's 

04:59:51.213 --> 04:59:52.840
performance and also it's 
responsive by using the free 

04:59:52.841 --> 04:59:54.841
tools that we provide.

05:00:01.601 --> 05:00:02.818
Hopefully, for any of these 
things that we've told you you 

05:00:02.819 --> 05:00:06.885
might be building, you might 
have enough tools and equipment 

05:00:06.886 --> 05:00:08.510
to go ahead and make 
improvements and make your users

05:00:08.511 --> 05:00:11.992
happy and more successful in 
search.  We know that there's 

05:00:11.993 --> 05:00:14.033
many, many different details and
links that we provided.

05:00:18.520 --> 05:00:20.609
So if you have to remember just 
four things, pay attention to 

05:00:20.610 --> 05:00:23.056
what John is going to tell you 
right now.  

05:00:25.309 --> 05:00:28.786
&gt;&gt; JOHN MUELLER:  All right.  
Thanks.  Wow, that was a lot.  

05:00:28.787 --> 05:00:31.226
Looking back at these things, 
there are a few common elements 

05:00:31.227 --> 05:00:33.227
that we 

05:00:34.276 --> 05:00:36.514
covered that came up again and 
again.  So first, is remember 

05:00:36.515 --> 05:00:41.394
the basics.  URLs, titles, and 
descriptions.  They do matter.  

05:00:41.395 --> 05:00:43.886
They do play a big role when it 
comes to search.  They play a 

05:00:43.887 --> 05:00:46.329
big role in how people come to 
your site through search.  

05:00:48.784 --> 05:00:51.026
Secondly, remember to take 
advantage of structure data, 

05:00:51.027 --> 05:00:55.095
like the Rakuten example in the 
beginning.  Obviously, they saw 

05:00:55.096 --> 05:00:59.788
a big change in the traffic from
Search, even without ranking 

05:00:59.789 --> 05:01:01.806
changes, just by making their 
Search results look a lot more 

05:01:01.807 --> 05:01:04.489
visually appealing.  
   And then, take advantage of 

05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:06.720
all of the tools and APIs that 
we have available.

05:01:09.798 --> 05:01:12.686
So use Search Console, 
understand how Search Console 

05:01:12.687 --> 05:01:14.727
works, use the APIs from Search 
Console to make it better for 

05:01:17.796 --> 05:01:20.053
your users, people who are using
your products to really create 

05:01:20.054 --> 05:01:22.054
fantastic web presences.  

05:01:23.307 --> 05:01:24.938
And then, finally, especially if
you're making something for 

05:01:24.939 --> 05:01:26.939
other people 

05:01:28.387 --> 05:01:30.010
to create web presences in, make
it as easy as possible for them 

05:01:30.011 --> 05:01:33.511
to do the right thing as well.  
So, make it easy for them to put

05:01:33.512 --> 05:01:35.512
the 

05:01:37.609 --> 05:01:39.634
right fields in, to add data 
about titles and descriptions on

05:01:39.635 --> 05:01:42.891
pages, make it easy for them to 
really create high performance 

05:01:42.892 --> 05:01:44.892
web pages.  

05:01:45.946 --> 05:01:47.375
So, these are only some general 
tips, I think to get started 

05:01:47.376 --> 05:01:50.620
with.  There are obviously a lot
of different aspects that come 

05:01:50.621 --> 05:01:53.499
into play with search, but we 
think these aspects are really 

05:01:55.319 --> 05:01:57.319
critical to start with.  We have
a lot more information in our 

05:01:58.825 --> 05:02:00.825
developer center, developer 
guides.

05:02:02.676 --> 05:02:04.102
We have Search Console help 
center with a lot more 

05:02:04.103 --> 05:02:05.931
information about Search in 
general, and specifically about 

05:02:05.932 --> 05:02:08.371
Search Console.  
   If you have any more 

05:02:08.372 --> 05:02:10.372
questions today, 

05:02:13.263 --> 05:02:14.892
we'll be in the Web and Sandbox 
area later today, so feel free 

05:02:14.893 --> 05:02:16.893
to come by there as well.  

05:02:19.566 --> 05:02:21.001
And finally, there are, of 
course, other ways to reach out 

05:02:21.002 --> 05:02:24.463
to us online as well.  You can 
find us on Twitter.  We do live 

05:02:24.464 --> 05:02:26.464
office hours hangouts where 

05:02:27.549 --> 05:02:29.583
you can join us with a YouTube 
Live hangout.  We're available 

05:02:29.584 --> 05:02:31.584
in the webmaster help forum if 
you have any questions.

05:02:34.288 --> 05:02:36.514
So, don't let questions kind of 
stick around, make sure you get 

05:02:36.515 --> 05:02:38.760
answers to them from us if you 
need them.  

05:02:40.586 --> 05:02:42.624
We hope you found this 
introduction into Search 

05:02:42.625 --> 05:02:44.625
interesting.  Thank you all for 
coming.

05:02:47.119 --> 05:02:49.567
We wish you and your projects 
more success online through

   May 10, 2018.

06:14:53.635 --> 06:14:56.316
   Creating a Persona.

06:19:48.964 --> 06:19:52.869
   &gt;&gt; Welcome.  Please fill in 
the seats near the front of the 

06:19:52.870 --> 06:19:54.945
room.  Thank you.

06:21:05.800 --> 06:21:07.800
Creating a Persona.

06:22:06.138 --> 06:22:09.851
   &gt;&gt; At this time please find 
your seat.  Our session will 

06:22:09.852 --> 06:22:11.852
begin soon.

06:22:22.025 --> 06:22:24.025
S

06:23:52.750 --> 06:23:54.750
Had.
   (applause).

06:23:55.005 --> 06:23:57.005
&gt;&gt; I always wanted to do that 
little hop up the stairs.

06:23:58.059 --> 06:24:00.711
Thank you for coming, we've got 
the coolest people at IO right 

06:24:00.712 --> 06:24:02.712
here.
   (applause).

06:24:02.756 --> 06:24:06.640
Give yourselves a hand!  
Excellent.  Excellent.  Thank 

06:24:06.641 --> 06:24:08.936
you for joining me, we're going 
to dig into the world of 

06:24:08.937 --> 06:24:13.003
persona.  First I want to see a 
show of hands, how many people 

06:24:13.004 --> 06:24:15.004
brought a persona with them 
today?

06:24:17.337 --> 06:24:20.186
   &gt;&gt; WALLY BRILL:  Great.  It's
a trick question.  You all did.

06:24:20.797 --> 06:24:25.065
   Oh, I better get the clicker.
   So we're going to talk about 

06:24:25.066 --> 06:24:27.514
how persona can make your 
actions stand out, 

06:24:30.579 --> 06:24:32.628
they can extend the brand, and 
they can increase usability.

06:24:34.694 --> 06:24:39.169
First, I'm Wally Brill.  I'm the
head of conversation disierntion

06:24:39.170 --> 06:24:41.606
advocacy and education here at 
Google, and I've been teaching 

06:24:41.607 --> 06:24:45.675
robots to talk for about 20 
years.  Actually I've been 

06:24:45.676 --> 06:24:49.762
teaching them to talk longer 
than that, but when I was a kid,

06:24:49.763 --> 06:24:53.264
they didn't talk back, which was
kind of depressing.

06:24:55.948 --> 06:24:58.791
So this is a previous Persian 
that of mine, I even had hair.  

06:24:58.792 --> 06:25:00.792
I just want to tell you folks, 
there 

06:25:02.047 --> 06:25:04.047
is no distinct correlation 
between hair 

06:25:06.783 --> 06:25:09.441
loss and designing personas, 
it's okay.

06:25:10.873 --> 06:25:12.734
Years ago when I had hair, I was
a record producer, I was working

06:25:12.735 --> 06:25:14.978
mostly in the UK.
   And I had this idea, whether 

06:25:14.979 --> 06:25:17.269
it was good or not, I'm not 
sure, but I wanted 

06:25:21.944 --> 06:25:23.784
to create an opera that was 
interactive, I wanted to be able

06:25:23.785 --> 06:25:27.501
to talk to the cargts and change
plots, like one of those choose 

06:25:27.502 --> 06:25:29.938
your own adventure stories, 
right?

06:25:30.768 --> 06:25:32.768
So what did I do?

06:25:34.644 --> 06:25:36.701
I decided I would find a 
technology that would work to do

06:25:36.702 --> 06:25:38.981
this, and in those days we were 
thinking about things like 

06:25:40.412 --> 06:25:42.412
CD-ROMs, I don't know if any of 
you remember CD-ROMs.

06:25:44.526 --> 06:25:48.839
Oh, I see a nod.  I see a couple
nods.  Good.  Whew.

06:25:51.269 --> 06:25:52.723
I went to the company that 
invented speech recognition and 

06:25:52.724 --> 06:25:55.804
said to them can you tell me 
about this stuff?  They said 

06:25:55.805 --> 06:25:57.805
well you know about sound, 

06:25:59.769 --> 06:26:01.769
dmom here, and they made me take
a job 

06:26:05.885 --> 06:26:08.107
there and they sent me to see a 
man named James Giancola, I 

06:26:08.108 --> 06:26:11.928
don't know if you know of him, 
he was one of the pioneers for 

06:26:11.929 --> 06:26:13.591
conversational design for 
interactive speech, he gave a 

06:26:13.592 --> 06:26:16.893
talk at Stanford which 
completely blew my mind because 

06:26:16.894 --> 06:26:18.894
it was about how you can speak 

06:26:21.184 --> 06:26:23.184
naturally to a robot and it will
speak naturally back to you.

06:26:26.119 --> 06:26:27.743
He wrote a book called Voice 
User Interface Design which I 

06:26:27.744 --> 06:26:30.600
recommend to anybody interested 
in this stuff.

06:26:32.261 --> 06:26:33.684
Moving along, this is our 
fabulous conversation design 

06:26:33.685 --> 06:26:35.685
team that I recently joined at 
Google.

06:26:37.992 --> 06:26:43.372
Lots of happy faces there.
   Now, let's get down to it.  

06:26:43.373 --> 06:26:45.822
What's a persona, how do we go 
about designing the perfect 

06:26:45.823 --> 06:26:49.916
digital employee that's going to
work for us and make us stand 

06:26:49.917 --> 06:26:51.953
out?
   So what is a persona?

06:26:55.659 --> 06:26:57.659
It's the aspect of someone's 
character 

06:26:58.772 --> 06:27:01.081
that's presented or perceived by
others, it's your face that you 

06:27:01.082 --> 06:27:04.787
show to the world, it's the who 
of who you are that you let 

06:27:04.788 --> 06:27:06.788
people see, right?

06:27:08.858 --> 06:27:10.858
Now, in acting, people use 
personas all the time.

06:27:15.709 --> 06:27:17.781
In the 1930s, Leslie Howard and 
Norman Shirer did a version of 

06:27:17.782 --> 06:27:21.031
Romeo and Juliet that was very 
successful, it was very widely 

06:27:21.032 --> 06:27:23.032
liked and it did well.

06:27:24.750 --> 06:27:26.750
Now, spin onto the 1990s, and 
here is 

06:27:29.254 --> 06:27:30.900
Leonardo DiCaprio and clairl 
Danes performing exactly the 

06:27:30.901 --> 06:27:33.775
same content but with very 
different personas and it came 

06:27:36.621 --> 06:27:39.494
across very much for 
contemporary and it was a big 

06:27:39.495 --> 06:27:41.495
success of the time but very, 

06:27:45.365 --> 06:27:47.365
very different from that 
original film.

06:27:48.478 --> 06:27:50.109
Now, everybody has a unique 
persona, you get it when you 

06:27:50.110 --> 06:27:53.568
born, it changes with you as you
develop and as you grow, and 

06:27:53.569 --> 06:27:55.569
like I say, it's the who of who 
you 

06:27:57.620 --> 06:27:59.647
are, it differentiates us one 
from another and makes us 

06:27:59.648 --> 06:28:01.881
individuals.

06:28:05.602 --> 06:28:07.857
But now we live in the future, 
right?  There are 500 million 

06:28:07.858 --> 06:28:09.858
devices that 

06:28:12.339 --> 06:28:15.183
have the Google Assistant on 
them, 500 million.  Can I get an

06:28:15.184 --> 06:28:20.088
okay?
   (Cheering) right.  That's a 

06:28:20.089 --> 06:28:22.089
lot of people, a lot of devices 
too.

06:28:22.386 --> 06:28:25.224
So people have high expectations
of what an intelligent assistant

06:28:25.225 --> 06:28:29.545
can do and how and where we can 
interact with it, and it's not 

06:28:29.546 --> 06:28:34.230
just this thing that you talk 
to.  Now we're talking about 

06:28:34.231 --> 06:28:36.231
surfaces that 

06:28:38.506 --> 06:28:40.506
the AI moves across, 
effortlessly, from 

06:28:42.840 --> 06:28:45.493
your Google Home to your TV to 
your smartphone to your car to 

06:28:45.494 --> 06:28:47.494
your watch, 

06:28:49.161 --> 06:28:51.612
all these surfaces we have to 
take into consideration when 

06:28:51.613 --> 06:28:54.886
we're designing persona.  See, 
it's not just voice, it's also 

06:28:57.146 --> 06:28:59.146
audio content like sound design,
it's 

06:29:00.223 --> 06:29:02.873
visual content now, it's 
interaction design.  The 

06:29:02.874 --> 06:29:04.874
interaction design actually has 
a 

06:29:06.169 --> 06:29:08.169
lot to do with how your persona 
comes 

06:29:09.421 --> 06:29:11.421
across, and it's even 
typography.

06:29:12.514 --> 06:29:14.514
Here is a quick example.

06:29:15.828 --> 06:29:17.828
This is a joke, I am not holding
up 

06:29:20.379 --> 06:29:20.863
any hope for it being a great 
joke, but you can see that the 

06:29:20.864 --> 06:29:22.864
punchline is really 

06:29:29.855 --> 06:29:33.255
punched up because of 
typography.  So we've got to 

06:29:29.855 --> 06:29:31.855
think about visual 

06:29:33.870 --> 06:29:34.854
surfaces as well as audio 
situations.

06:29:34.855 --> 06:29:36.891
So let's pivot for a second, and
now talk about a voice-first 

06:29:36.892 --> 06:29:38.892
world and 

06:29:39.900 --> 06:29:41.900
understand why persona design is
so important.

06:29:44.594 --> 06:29:46.021
So we're going on to talk about 
a series of documents that you 

06:29:46.022 --> 06:29:49.919
will make when you're designing 
a persona and what they'll do is

06:29:49.920 --> 06:29:51.920
they'll help you keep the 

06:29:53.984 --> 06:29:56.013
writing, the things that the 
system says consistent and clear

06:29:56.014 --> 06:30:00.928
because otherwise it can appear 
fractured, and if the persona is

06:30:00.929 --> 06:30:03.588
fractured, people lose trust in 
the actual action.

06:30:07.509 --> 06:30:09.509
So in wired for speech -- well, 
sorry, 

06:30:10.752 --> 06:30:12.586
there is no such thing as no 
persona, by the way, that was my

06:30:12.587 --> 06:30:14.587
trick question I stuck in there.
There we go.

06:30:17.879 --> 06:30:20.114
In wired for speech,  Cliff Nass
and Scott Brave said when people

06:30:20.115 --> 06:30:22.115
hear any voice, they 
automatically and 

06:30:25.869 --> 06:30:28.275
unconsciously assign a 
personality to it.  This is a 

06:30:28.276 --> 06:30:30.276
really important thing.  Within 
a second, second and a half of 

06:30:33.360 --> 06:30:35.200
hearing a voice, you create an 
image in your mind, you have an 

06:30:35.201 --> 06:30:38.492
idea of who you're listening to.
You know what I mean?

06:30:40.135 --> 06:30:41.552
So whenever you hear somebody, 
somebody calls you up that you 

06:30:41.553 --> 06:30:46.455
don't know, you've got an idea 
of who they are, you have a 

06:30:46.456 --> 06:30:48.456
sense of them because 

06:30:49.516 --> 06:30:51.516
you know what, we can infer age,
we can 

06:30:52.576 --> 06:30:54.398
infer gender, we understand 
their educational level by the 

06:30:54.399 --> 06:30:56.399
kind of things 

06:30:58.895 --> 06:31:01.152
they say, we get register.  Now,
register is the social context, 

06:31:02.764 --> 06:31:05.823
it's where this persona is in 
relation to me.  Is it my boss? 

06:31:05.824 --> 06:31:09.702
Is it my employee?  Is it my 
peer?  Who is this that I'm 

06:31:09.703 --> 06:31:13.881
speaking with?  We also get a 
sense of locale if they have an 

06:31:13.882 --> 06:31:16.125
accent that's different from 
ours.  We just don't recognize 

06:31:16.126 --> 06:31:22.057
accents if we have the same one.
   So the other inferred traits 

06:31:22.058 --> 06:31:24.058
we get 

06:31:25.920 --> 06:31:27.920
are intelligence, 
trustworthiness and likeability.

06:31:28.354 --> 06:31:30.234
All these things come through in
that first second, second and a 

06:31:30.235 --> 06:31:32.673
half of hearing a voice.  So 
it's really important that we 

06:31:32.674 --> 06:31:34.674
get this right.

06:31:36.351 --> 06:31:38.351
We have to set ourselves up for 

06:31:39.389 --> 06:31:41.389
success because now more than 
ever the 

06:31:42.640 --> 06:31:44.640
experience of the action is the 
brand to the consumer.

06:31:47.527 --> 06:31:49.527
What happens is every touch 
point matters.

06:31:50.600 --> 06:31:52.600
So billboard advertising, the 
web, 

06:31:54.484 --> 06:31:56.484
radio, TV, absolutely -- social 
media, 

06:31:57.761 --> 06:32:00.406
absolutely every touch point 
carries the brand essence, so 

06:32:00.407 --> 06:32:02.407
it's vital that we get 

06:32:04.482 --> 06:32:06.106
it right because if we leave it 
to chance, you never know what 

06:32:06.107 --> 06:32:11.422
you're going to get, so you 
don't just use anything.  You've

06:32:11.423 --> 06:32:13.462
got to design your persona 
because otherwise the results 

06:32:13.463 --> 06:32:15.463
will be  unpredictable.

06:32:17.732 --> 06:32:22.241
   So how do we do it?  How do 
we actually design one?  This is

06:32:22.242 --> 06:32:24.242
where some of the fun stuff 
starts.

06:32:25.904 --> 06:32:27.945
We need to make that digital 
employee, and what I have done 

06:32:27.946 --> 06:32:29.946
is I've suggested 

06:32:31.207 --> 06:32:32.654
we take two airlines to map this
out and to talk about how we do 

06:32:32.655 --> 06:32:38.583
it.  These are two airlines that
obviously don't exist.  One is 

06:32:38.584 --> 06:32:41.221
Important  Airlines, it's a 
national carrier, it's 

06:32:41.222 --> 06:32:43.222
important, you 

06:32:44.898 --> 06:32:46.321
can see their strap line:  We're
important and we will get you 

06:32:46.322 --> 06:32:48.555
there.  Right?  Kind of 
traditional tion kind of 

06:32:48.966 --> 06:32:51.211
straight.
   On the other hand, there's 

06:32:51.212 --> 06:32:54.667
Millennial Airlines and their 
strap line is:  It's an awesome 

06:32:54.668 --> 06:32:58.596
day to fly!  Do you want to say 
that with me?  It's an awesome 

06:32:58.597 --> 06:33:02.056
day to fly!  Once more, with 
feeling.  It's an awesome day to

06:33:02.057 --> 06:33:10.223
fly!  Great.  Thank you.  Whew.
   So the first step in 

06:33:10.224 --> 06:33:12.224
designing a 

06:33:14.288 --> 06:33:16.944
persona is we need to understand
the brand.  We need to interview

06:33:16.945 --> 06:33:19.400
the stakeholders, we need to 
talk to people in brand, in 

06:33:21.851 --> 06:33:23.851
marketing, in customer 
experience, 

06:33:24.905 --> 06:33:28.005
customer service.  We want to 
look to see if there's a style 

06:33:28.006 --> 06:33:31.491
guide.  Now, the marketing 
people and the brand people will

06:33:31.492 --> 06:33:34.738
have already done this, they 
will have distilled their brand 

06:33:34.739 --> 06:33:36.986
down, but you want to go over it
and understand it and really get

06:33:36.987 --> 06:33:38.440
it.
   So you're going to experience

06:33:38.441 --> 06:33:41.715
the product too.  You're going 
to get on the plane and go take 

06:33:41.716 --> 06:33:44.184
a trip somewhere.  You may visit

06:33:47.687 --> 06:33:49.326
because those contact center 
agents are actually carrying the

06:33:49.327 --> 06:33:51.972
brand essence with them when 
they speak to customers over the

06:33:51.973 --> 06:33:55.626
phone.  You're going to check 
out social  media, and if 

06:33:55.627 --> 06:33:57.627
there's a retail 

06:33:59.712 --> 06:34:01.712
component, you'll go into a 
store, right?

06:34:01.768 --> 06:34:04.022
So let's talk about Important 
for a second.  Let's talk about 

06:34:04.023 --> 06:34:06.023
my water for a second.  Here it 
is.

06:34:09.546 --> 06:34:12.011
So Important Airlines brand is 
solid.  They're confident.  

06:34:12.012 --> 06:34:14.653
They're experts.  They know what
they're doing.  They're 

06:34:14.654 --> 06:34:18.364
reliable.  They're utterly 
straightforward.  There's no 

06:34:18.365 --> 06:34:21.482
frills or anything.  And they're
safe.  They've got a great 

06:34:21.483 --> 06:34:25.955
safety record.  But you're not 
going to get wildly excited 

06:34:25.956 --> 06:34:27.956
flying on Important, right?  No 
surprises.

06:34:29.842 --> 06:34:32.298
Now, Millennial, on the other 
hand, where it's an awesome day 

06:34:32.299 --> 06:34:37.374
to fly, thank you for helping me
with that, the Millennial  

06:34:37.375 --> 06:34:40.330
Airlines brand is bold, it's 
hip, it's fun, it's friendly, 

06:34:40.331 --> 06:34:42.594
it's even exciting and 
delightful, it's a whole 

06:34:44.243 --> 06:34:46.692
different kind of world.  It's 
there to bring excitement of 

06:34:50.821 --> 06:34:54.484
travel into your life.
   So those are two sets of 

06:34:54.485 --> 06:34:58.434
brand essences, right?  Now 
let's understand the customer.  

06:34:58.435 --> 06:35:02.532
We need to know who is going to 
use this interaction.  So we 

06:35:02.533 --> 06:35:06.447
want to understand their context
and their customer journey.  We 

06:35:06.448 --> 06:35:08.878
want to know who they are 
through their demographics, 

06:35:08.879 --> 06:35:13.781
where do they live, what do they
like, how old are they, we want 

06:35:13.782 --> 06:35:15.238
to understand the frequency of 
engagement because that's going 

06:35:15.239 --> 06:35:17.282
to have a lot to do with how 
verbose your 

06:35:20.333 --> 06:35:22.333
prompts are.

06:35:24.028 --> 06:35:26.085
If they're freblght users, you 
can keep things short F they're 

06:35:26.086 --> 06:35:28.937
infrequent users, you might want
to give them a little more 

06:35:28.938 --> 06:35:30.574
information, and we want to 
understand their expectations 

06:35:30.575 --> 06:35:33.203
and needs.  Now, one thing you 
should know is that 

06:35:37.689 --> 06:35:39.516
people generally like to be 
mirrored.  They like the idea of

06:35:39.517 --> 06:35:41.594
interacting with someone who at 
least relates to them in 

06:35:46.525 --> 06:35:48.525
some ways.  It's a preference, 
right?

06:35:50.628 --> 06:35:53.679
So the Important Airlines 
customer, mid 30s and up.  These

06:35:53.680 --> 06:35:56.351
are business travelers, they're 
frequent, frequent fliers, 

06:35:56.352 --> 06:35:59.408
they're road warriors, they're 
high value because those 

06:35:59.409 --> 06:36:01.409
business class and first class 

06:36:03.031 --> 06:36:05.031
seats are expensive

06:36:06.582 --> 06:36:08.436
.  Whereas on the other hand, 
our millennial customer is late 

06:36:08.437 --> 06:36:13.121
teens on mid 30s, they're 
millennials, they're holiday 

06:36:13.122 --> 06:36:15.122
makers, they're backpackers, 

06:36:16.790 --> 06:36:19.447
they're Young families going to 
Orlando maybe, they're 

06:36:19.448 --> 06:36:21.893
budget-conscious and they don't 
use the airm very much, they 

06:36:21.894 --> 06:36:25.952
uses it for holidays once or 
twice -- and they don't use the 

06:36:25.953 --> 06:36:27.998
airline very much, they use it 
for holidays once or twice a 

06:36:28.200 --> 06:36:30.200
year.

06:36:32.476 --> 06:36:35.340
So we know the brand, we know 
the customer.  Now, what task 

06:36:35.341 --> 06:36:37.341
are we going to do here?

06:36:40.013 --> 06:36:45.591
What am I've chosen is FliFlo, 
flight information, status of my

06:36:45.592 --> 06:36:47.872
flight, is it late, cancelled, 
on time, when is it expected, 

06:36:47.873 --> 06:36:51.558
all that good stuff, right?
   Which leads us to choosing 

06:36:51.559 --> 06:36:54.200
the medium for the audio.  Now, 
there are two ways to do this.

06:36:57.652 --> 06:36:59.652
You can use text-to-speech, TTS,
I'm 

06:37:00.932 --> 06:37:02.770
sure you all know what that is, 
versus custom recording, which 

06:37:02.771 --> 06:37:05.432
is when you have an actor in 
front of a microphone recording 

06:37:05.433 --> 06:37:09.096
prompts.  Right?  Text-to-speech
is the computer-generated voice.

06:37:12.364 --> 06:37:14.364
Customer recording is the human 
actor.

06:37:16.667 --> 06:37:18.943
So text-to-speech is infinitely 
scalable, it's really easy to 

06:37:18.944 --> 06:37:21.859
use, it's really cheap, because 
what it's doing is it's reading 

06:37:21.860 --> 06:37:26.386
written content.  It handles 
dynamic content really well, so 

06:37:26.387 --> 06:37:28.621
in our case, we've got an 
airline with a lot of changes 

06:37:28.622 --> 06:37:30.622
going on, 

06:37:34.375 --> 06:37:36.375
you know,

06:37:39.348 --> 06:37:40.380
Duluth to Minneapolis, all these
things going ask stuff change p 

06:37:40.381 --> 06:37:42.401
on the fly so we'll probably use
text-to-speech there.

06:37:44.659 --> 06:37:46.659
Oh, can you go back one, please?
There we go.

06:37:52.245 --> 06:37:54.103
The cons are limited voice 
availability and occasionally 

06:37:54.104 --> 06:37:56.552
you'll hear, I think Sundar 
mentioned this in 

06:38:00.411 --> 06:38:02.027
the keynote, you hear procity, 
and that's the melody of speech,

06:38:02.028 --> 06:38:06.925
and occasionally, certainly in 
the old days, text-to-speech 

06:38:06.926 --> 06:38:11.649
procity wasn't great.  I think 
you'll agree from what we heard 

06:38:11.650 --> 06:38:13.650
this week that it's now 
phenomenally good, it's almost 

06:38:16.339 --> 06:38:18.621
indistinguishable from human 
speech.

06:38:25.186 --> 06:38:27.186
So TimeOut Magazine?

06:38:32.956 --> 06:38:34.478
in London decided to use 
text-to-speech, happenings 

06:38:34.479 --> 06:38:37.138
happening.  From secret Tango 
lessons to breakfast 

06:38:41.453 --> 06:38:42.669
raves, connecting customers to 
the coolest stuff to do, they 

06:38:42.670 --> 06:38:44.670
do.

06:38:45.711 --> 06:38:47.376
They created tirks o who is a 
millenial, she's hip and 

06:38:47.377 --> 06:38:50.016
happening, she knows what's 
going on in London at any given 

06:38:50.017 --> 06:38:52.253
time.
   Let me give an example of 

06:38:52.254 --> 06:38:54.488
what she sounds like.

06:38:58.189 --> 06:38:58.991
&gt;&gt; Okay, Google, talk to Time 
Out.

06:38:58.992 --> 06:39:04.083
&gt;&gt; Hey, you again.  Got a quiet 
week ahead?  Not anymore.  When 

06:39:04.084 --> 06:39:06.372
do you want to go out?  Today, 
this week or this weekend?

06:39:07.786 --> 06:39:11.478
&gt;&gt; Who are you?
   &gt;&gt; I'm Tio.  No one knows the

06:39:11.479 --> 06:39:13.479
city like me because I've been 
discovering the brilliant and 

06:39:14.544 --> 06:39:18.845
searching out the secret and 
extraordinary for a long time.  

06:39:18.846 --> 06:39:21.380
If you want to know about food, 
art, culture and nightlife, then

06:39:21.381 --> 06:39:25.197
I am your social companion.  Try
me.  What do you want to do and 

06:39:25.198 --> 06:39:28.453
when do you want to do it?
   &gt;&gt; Where are you from?

06:39:33.366 --> 06:39:35.815
&gt;&gt; In West Kensington born and 
raised.  On the estate was where

06:39:35.816 --> 06:39:37.857
I spent most of my days.

06:39:42.695 --> 06:39:44.695
Chilling out maximum I know

06:39:47.310 --> 06:39:49.310
can, relax Illinois n, all 
hipster.  Skating so much.

06:39:50.977 --> 06:39:53.012
I got into debt and my mom 
started to shout.  She said you 

06:39:53.013 --> 06:39:55.474
need to get a job at a place 
called Time Out.  What else do 

06:39:55.475 --> 06:39:58.758
you want to do?
   &gt;&gt; Quit.

06:39:59.809 --> 06:40:00.617
&gt;&gt; WALLY BRILL:  That's pretty 
cool, right?  Pretty 

06:40:00.618 --> 06:40:03.072
interesting.
   That's a pretty solid persona

06:40:03.073 --> 06:40:06.383
and you get a sense of who she 
really is.

06:40:10.677 --> 06:40:13.572
Now, on the custom recording 
side, headspace, which does 

06:40:13.573 --> 06:40:15.573
meditation 

06:40:18.488 --> 06:40:20.488
guidance, needed to use an 
actual real 

06:40:22.563 --> 06:40:24.397
voice Andy  Puticom who is the 
guy who started headspace and he

06:40:24.398 --> 06:40:29.297
does guided meditations and I 
won't play one now because they 

06:40:29.298 --> 06:40:31.298
chill me out so much I couldn't 
carry on with this talk, but 

06:40:32.365 --> 06:40:34.396
they're really, really good.  
And the thing about custom 

06:40:34.397 --> 06:40:36.397
recording 

06:40:37.877 --> 06:40:39.313
is it's natural, it's 
expressive, it's comprehensible 

06:40:39.314 --> 06:40:42.580
and any voice in the world can 
be used, right?  You can go and 

06:40:42.581 --> 06:40:45.642
hire anybody to be the voice 
actor.  Now, luckily for 

06:40:45.643 --> 06:40:47.643
Headspace they've got Andy, he's
there all the time, because 

06:40:48.906 --> 06:40:51.567
sometimes it can be expensive to
record and maintain, and it 

06:40:51.568 --> 06:40:53.568
relies on the 

06:40:54.653 --> 06:40:56.747
availability of that artist.  
Andy goes there every day, so 

06:40:56.748 --> 06:40:58.768
he's okay.

06:41:02.261 --> 06:41:03.942
So let me play you an example of
Headspace just a short one to 

06:41:03.943 --> 06:41:06.407
hear what the voice sounds like.

06:41:09.505 --> 06:41:12.696
   &gt;&gt; Hi.  My name is Andy.  
Welcome to headspace.

06:41:15.985 --> 06:41:17.426
Using proven meditation and 
mindful nsz tech niksz, I'll 

06:41:17.427 --> 06:41:20.956
show you how to train your mind 
for a healthier, happier, more 

06:41:20.957 --> 06:41:25.039
enjoyable life.  To get started,
try one of our short sessions, 

06:41:25.040 --> 06:41:27.071
they're each under two minutes 
long and can help bring a little

06:41:27.072 --> 06:41:30.785
more mindfulness into your life.
Three options to choose from, 

06:41:30.786 --> 06:41:32.786
wake up, take a moment or 
unwind.

06:41:35.149 --> 06:41:37.149
Which one would you like to try?

06:41:38.397 --> 06:41:40.397
   &gt;&gt; WALLY BRILL:  Okay.  Now, 
because we're doing flight 

06:41:43.333 --> 06:41:45.333
information, we've chosen TTS, 
right?

06:41:46.406 --> 06:41:49.941
So the fun part, how do we 
design this persona?  How do we 

06:41:49.942 --> 06:41:51.213
create that perfect 
representative, our digital 

06:41:51.214 --> 06:41:55.493
employee?  What are the steps we
have to take?  This is where we 

06:41:55.494 --> 06:41:57.751
get creative, dig into that 
creative brain and let's get 

06:41:58.982 --> 06:42:03.315
going.  So we go back to the 
airlines.  We understand the 

06:42:03.316 --> 06:42:07.479
brand, the customer, the task 
and the medium.  Now we're going

06:42:07.480 --> 06:42:09.480
to go and invent some people.

06:42:10.977 --> 06:42:12.420
We're going to write biographies
for imaginary characters who 

06:42:12.421 --> 06:42:15.704
might be a good fit for the job 
we have for them.

06:42:18.150 --> 06:42:22.276
So who is that perfect 
representative?  Who can it be? 

06:42:22.277 --> 06:42:25.554
They've got to make the action 
useful and usable.  They've got 

06:42:25.555 --> 06:42:27.603
to be comprehensible.  They've 
got to be somebody that you 

06:42:30.891 --> 06:42:34.741
would really want to work with. 
The first step is register.  We 

06:42:34.742 --> 06:42:38.894
need to know what that social 
context is.  Right?  We talked 

06:42:38.895 --> 06:42:41.948
about this a little bit before. 
What's the relationship between 

06:42:41.949 --> 06:42:47.452
me and that persona?  Is it my 
peer, a really close friend of 

06:42:47.453 --> 06:42:51.543
mine?  Is it an employee, 
somebody that works for me and 

06:42:51.544 --> 06:42:56.677
just does whatever I ask 
whenever I need it?  Or is it an

06:42:56.678 --> 06:42:58.678
advisor, somebody who 

06:43:00.163 --> 06:43:02.182
maybe knows more stuff than me, 
is at somewhat of a higher 

06:43:02.183 --> 06:43:04.231
explefl that I'm taking 
information from?

06:43:09.562 --> 06:43:12.008
Now, when we do this for real, 
you'll probably want to create 

06:43:12.009 --> 06:43:14.009
three different 

06:43:15.150 --> 06:43:16.575
personas, and you may make them 
of three different registers, 

06:43:16.576 --> 06:43:18.576
someone a peer, 

06:43:24.915 --> 06:43:27.368
maybe two are employees, you'll 
play around with it a little 

06:43:27.369 --> 06:43:29.850
built, and you'll make the 
registry different for them.

06:43:31.087 --> 06:43:33.087
Now, have a look at this chart.

06:43:34.157 --> 06:43:36.205
This again comes from Clifford 
Nass and you'll see that there's

06:43:36.206 --> 06:43:40.509
a vertical axis which is 
dominance and submissiveness 

06:43:40.510 --> 06:43:42.953
versus friendliness and 
distance.  This is kind of handy

06:43:42.954 --> 06:43:47.033
because when you're deciding 
what kind of persona you want 

06:43:47.034 --> 06:43:49.034
and how it's going to relate to 

06:43:50.507 --> 06:43:52.507
your customer, you can use this 
quite 

06:43:54.827 --> 06:43:56.827
effectively to position them.

06:43:58.941 --> 06:44:00.941
Now, for Important Airlines, we 

06:44:02.756 --> 06:44:04.756
decided we wanted a

06:44:06.729 --> 06:44:08.792
butler, somebody like a butler 
who would relate to that 

06:44:08.793 --> 06:44:10.811
demographically wefl, remember 
they're 35 and up, we 

06:44:15.103 --> 06:44:17.103
wanted somebody with some  
gravitas, 

06:44:19.812 --> 06:44:21.812
it's a British airline h British
airline, so we wanted a sort of 

06:44:23.252 --> 06:44:25.252
concierge character that you 
could trust.

06:44:27.328 --> 06:44:29.328
So we have Terrence Butler, he's
56, his occupation is Butler.

06:44:33.859 --> 06:44:36.917
He comes from Bromley in Kent, 
which is a lovely suburb.  Why 

06:44:36.918 --> 06:44:38.330
do I care about his height and 
weight?  Because it affect 

06:44:38.331 --> 06:44:40.602
voice.  It affects the largeness
of the voice, 

06:44:44.499 --> 06:44:46.499
versus the smallness of the 
voice 

06:44:47.951 --> 06:44:48.971
(Talking low, then higher) so 
there's a lot in there in terms 

06:44:48.972 --> 06:44:50.972
of size.

06:44:52.242 --> 06:44:54.693
It he's firmly built, thinning 
hair, just a shout out to people

06:44:54.694 --> 06:45:00.409
losing their hair.  He lives 
where he works, he's single, and

06:45:00.410 --> 06:45:02.410
he went to the Ivor Spencer 
international school for Butler 

06:45:03.461 --> 06:45:06.930
administrators, which is a real 
place!  Can you believe  it?  

06:45:06.931 --> 06:45:10.222
Phenomenal.  Am.
   Carrying on, he's a collector

06:45:10.223 --> 06:45:13.515
of rare wines.  Why do we will 
care?  Because he's detail 

06:45:13.516 --> 06:45:15.516
oriented.

06:45:16.591 --> 06:45:18.591
His parents, Jack, was a retired
hotel 

06:45:20.013 --> 06:45:23.273
manager, so he understands the 
hospitality  industry.  Right?  

06:45:23.274 --> 06:45:25.274
His mother was a retired nurse.

06:45:27.999 --> 06:45:31.301
Again, a caretaking profession. 
He doesn't have any siblings.  

06:45:31.302 --> 06:45:33.808
The reason we're interested in 
siblings is if you're the oldest

06:45:33.809 --> 06:45:38.154
of four  kids, you may be a 
little better at being a 

06:45:38.155 --> 06:45:39.596
caretaker than the youngest, and
my family actually works that 

06:45:39.597 --> 06:45:41.623
wairks I'm the youngest and I'm 
a little crazy but 

06:45:45.732 --> 06:45:47.182
my eldest brother is very 
straight-ahead.  What does he 

06:45:47.183 --> 06:45:49.183
like to wawfn?

06:45:51.663 --> 06:45:53.663
He likes to watch  Upstairs 

06:45:55.325 --> 06:45:57.377
Downstairs, downtown Abby, he 
has also been 30 years in this 

06:45:57.378 --> 06:46:00.239
job, so he really knows it.
   Now we flashback to the brand

06:46:02.886 --> 06:46:04.886
attributes of Important and see 
how they match up.

06:46:05.983 --> 06:46:07.637
So Important is solid, it's 
confident, it's expert, it's 

06:46:07.638 --> 06:46:11.539
reliable, it's straightforward, 
it's safe.  Right?

06:46:13.577 --> 06:46:15.577
So how does Terrence relate to 
that?

06:46:18.098 --> 06:46:20.120
Well, he's a butler, he's been a
butler for a long time, he's 

06:46:20.121 --> 06:46:23.259
confident, expert and reliable, 
he's very straightforward, and 

06:46:23.260 --> 06:46:27.529
he's worked for that family for 
over 30 years, so he's somebody 

06:46:27.530 --> 06:46:29.530
you can trust, and the fact 

06:46:30.608 --> 06:46:32.868
that eases an avid collector of 
rare wines tells you that he is 

06:46:32.869 --> 06:46:35.920
detail oriented and he is an 
expert.

06:46:38.991 --> 06:46:41.237
Now, the next step is we're 
going to create beyond this 

06:46:41.238 --> 06:46:45.381
birks o, we're going to create 
two more documents.  We're going

06:46:45.382 --> 06:46:47.727
to create a monologue, which 
gives us a sense of who this 

06:46:48.128 --> 06:46:53.002
character is.  It's a paragraph 
like a conversation that they're

06:46:53.003 --> 06:46:55.444
having with a friend in a bar or
somewhere where they're just 

06:46:56.676 --> 06:46:58.676
telling them something that 
happened 

06:47:00.147 --> 06:47:02.147
that day or that week, and it's 
really 

06:47:03.198 --> 06:47:05.198
just to get us into the 
character a 

06:47:06.900 --> 06:47:08.560
little more deeply, and if 
you're using custom recording 

06:47:08.561 --> 06:47:12.484
with voices actors, it's a great
way for them to dive back into 

06:47:12.485 --> 06:47:14.485
the character if they've 
recorded 

06:47:15.563 --> 06:47:17.563
that monologue once because on 
Monday 

06:47:19.057 --> 06:47:21.057
they may be in the studio 
recording for 

06:47:22.146 --> 06:47:24.596
a sausage company, and on 
Tuesday they may be doing a car 

06:47:24.597 --> 06:47:29.062
commercial.  But on Thursday 
they're coming in to do your 

06:47:29.063 --> 06:47:32.577
action, and you want them to be 
in your persona.  So that's why 

06:47:32.578 --> 06:47:34.578
these materials really help.

06:47:35.889 --> 06:47:37.889
The monologue really helps.

06:47:39.969 --> 06:47:41.816
So let me give you example of 
one.

06:47:41.817 --> 06:47:44.075
&gt;&gt; I quite enjoy this 
occupation.  It's extremely 

06:47:44.076 --> 06:47:46.120
gratifying to know that one is 
indispensable.

06:47:49.426 --> 06:47:51.714
If sir is stepping out of an 
evening, I shall have prepared 

06:47:51.715 --> 06:47:53.715
sir's dinner jablght and 
accessories and I shall of 

06:47:55.835 --> 06:47:57.673
course assist him in tying his 
bow  tie.  The work of a 

06:47:57.674 --> 06:47:59.674
gentleman's gentleman is never 
done.

06:48:00.358 --> 06:48:02.358
&gt;&gt; WALLY BRILL:  So he's pretty 
formal, right?

06:48:04.259 --> 06:48:06.303
His language is pretty formal.
   And the next thing we're 

06:48:06.304 --> 06:48:08.304
going to do is we're going to 
create a sample dialogue.

06:48:11.631 --> 06:48:13.045
Now, I know that all of you 
whenever you decide to make an 

06:48:13.046 --> 06:48:15.046
action or create 

06:48:16.932 --> 06:48:18.353
an action, you start with 
conversation, you start with 

06:48:18.354 --> 06:48:20.590
sample dialogues, right?  You 
write the conversation out like 

06:48:20.591 --> 06:48:22.591
a 

06:48:24.661 --> 06:48:26.487
two-part play, here is the user,
here is the system, here is the 

06:48:26.488 --> 06:48:28.488
user, here is the system, and 
that really helps to 

06:48:32.061 --> 06:48:32.270
tell you whether this 
conversation is  

06:48:32.271 --> 06:48:35.526
natural-sounding.
   So here is Terrence in an 

06:48:35.527 --> 06:48:37.527
actual interaction the way he 
would be if he 

06:48:40.417 --> 06:48:42.417
were working in the action.

06:48:43.847 --> 06:48:45.847
   &gt;&gt; Okay, Google, talk to 
Important Airlines.

06:48:48.907 --> 06:48:50.325
&gt;&gt; Getting Important Airlines.
   &gt;&gt; Good morning.  You're 

06:48:50.326 --> 06:48:52.559
through to Important Airlines, 
am I speaking with Wally?

06:48:53.802 --> 06:48:55.630
&gt;&gt; That's right.
   &gt;&gt; Thank you.  And do you 

06:48:55.631 --> 06:48:57.631
require information regarding 
your flight to London today?

06:48:59.122 --> 06:49:01.412
&gt;&gt; Yes.
   &gt;&gt; WALLY BRILL:  So and do 

06:49:01.413 --> 06:49:04.237
you require information 
regarding your flight to London 

06:49:04.238 --> 06:49:09.383
today?  Very formal language.  
Vesm in persona.  Very much 

06:49:09.384 --> 06:49:11.384
locked into what we would 

06:49:12.653 --> 06:49:17.379
expect for this character.
   Now let's move along and go 

06:49:17.380 --> 06:49:22.305
to Millennial, which is, as we 
know, a very different airline 

06:49:22.306 --> 06:49:24.306
indeed.

06:49:27.689 --> 06:49:30.355
So the Millennial  Airlines 
persona is a Young woman we call

06:49:30.356 --> 06:49:33.409
Helen Highwater.  I'll say that 
again.  Helen Highwater.

06:49:39.343 --> 06:49:39.389
She's 26 years old, she's a gate
agent at San Francisco 

06:49:39.390 --> 06:49:41.471
International, she comes from 
Mill  Valley, California, 

06:49:44.121 --> 06:49:46.359
another nice suburb, she's 5-5, 
115 pounds, physical descripg 

06:49:46.360 --> 06:49:48.360
shows she's 

06:49:50.436 --> 06:49:53.290
kind of a hipster, she has this 
wild asymmetrical haircut, she 

06:49:53.291 --> 06:49:55.786
lives in a 3 bedroom apartment 
in the Mission with a 

06:49:58.867 --> 06:50:00.948
couple friends of hers, Jack who
is a software developer 

06:50:00.949 --> 06:50:03.997
interestingly enough and Natalie
in med school.  She's going out 

06:50:03.998 --> 06:50:05.998
with Gary, who is a 

06:50:08.507 --> 06:50:10.535
drummer in a band call the 
Ironic  Three.  The reason 

06:50:10.536 --> 06:50:13.378
they're ironic is because there 
are five members.  She studied 

06:50:13.379 --> 06:50:15.855
drama and English, which gives 
her a lot of help towards what 

06:50:15.856 --> 06:50:22.429
she really wants to be, which is
a standup comic.  That's her 

06:50:22.430 --> 06:50:24.308
dream of the she spends every 
free minute working on her act.

06:50:28.628 --> 06:50:30.628
So her parents, Ron, manages 
Mill 

06:50:32.410 --> 06:50:34.572
Valley branch of the Bank of 
Marin, so she has a certain 

06:50:34.573 --> 06:50:36.573
sense of responsibility.

06:50:38.724 --> 06:50:39.975
Lucy teaches English Lit at the 
middle school, a love of 

06:50:39.976 --> 06:50:43.248
language.  You may think some of
these things aren't that 

06:50:43.249 --> 06:50:45.249
necessary, but I promise you, if
you are get into a studio with a

06:50:46.556 --> 06:50:47.776
voice arltist, they're going to 
go thank you, thank you, thank 

06:50:47.777 --> 06:50:49.846
you, thank you, this gives me 
some depth, it gives me 

06:50:51.076 --> 06:50:53.076
something to work with.  She 
doesn't have any siblings.

06:50:55.407 --> 06:50:57.437
Had he work history was that  
she -- her work history was that

06:50:57.438 --> 06:50:59.915
she was a bartender at Cobbs 
comedy club.

06:51:04.432 --> 06:51:06.432
She likes Game of Thrones, 
Stranger 

06:51:11.394 --> 06:51:13.217
things, Amie  Sadaris, Amie 
Shipper, all the good stuff.

06:51:13.218 --> 06:51:15.903
Now, back to the brand.  This 
brand is bold, hip, fun, 

06:51:17.539 --> 06:51:18.763
happening, they're friendly, 
they're exciting, and they're 

06:51:18.764 --> 06:51:21.601
delightful.  I think she could 
be a really good match for this.

06:51:21.801 --> 06:51:26.489
   So let's see how she ties up 
for it.  26-year-old hipster.  

06:51:26.490 --> 06:51:30.975
She's hip.  She works as a gate 
agent at San Francisco  

06:51:30.976 --> 06:51:32.814
International, she's done it for
three years without missing a 

06:51:32.815 --> 06:51:37.567
day.  She's reliable.  We can 
count on her.  She's a people 

06:51:37.568 --> 06:51:41.670
person, she gets along with 
everybody, even drummers.  That 

06:51:41.671 --> 06:51:44.343
makes her friendly and fun.  And
her dream is to make a living as

06:51:44.344 --> 06:51:48.218
a standup.  Now, if you're going
to be a standup, you better be 

06:51:48.219 --> 06:51:51.895
bold, you better be friendly, 
you better be fun, and please be

06:51:51.896 --> 06:51:54.414
delightful.
   So she's got a monologue.

06:51:57.465 --> 06:52:02.617
Let's have a listen.  Zie use 
everything, and believe me, when

06:52:02.618 --> 06:52:04.455
you deal with the passengers, 
there's endless amounts of 

06:52:04.456 --> 06:52:09.001
material like the woman who was 
going to loss stone but her 

06:52:09.002 --> 06:52:10.642
luggage was on Italy way to aws 
stirntion or the parents off on 

06:52:10.643 --> 06:52:12.685
holiday who each expect the 
other one to Brit kids to the 

06:52:12.686 --> 06:52:16.768
airport.  Then there's the guy 
who thinks he deserves an 

06:52:16.769 --> 06:52:19.418
upgrade because he was in some 
obscure rock band from 20 years 

06:52:19.419 --> 06:52:22.499
ago or something.  It's great 
training for a standup and I get

06:52:22.500 --> 06:52:26.645
paid for it.  And if I can deal 
with them, there isn't a heckler

06:52:26.646 --> 06:52:30.545
in the world who can bother me.
   &gt;&gt; WALLY BRILL:  So pretty 

06:52:32.197 --> 06:52:33.436
consistent, she is who she is, 
we get a sense of her through 

06:52:33.437 --> 06:52:35.437
the monologue.  Now let's see 
what she would be like 

06:52:38.895 --> 06:52:40.895
in a sample die dialogue, 
actually doing the job.

06:52:44.293 --> 06:52:46.293
&gt;&gt; Okay, Google, talk to Millal 
Airlines.

06:52:47.158 --> 06:52:50.015
&gt;&gt; Getting Millal Airlines.
   (Tone).

06:52:52.117 --> 06:52:54.754
&gt;&gt; Millennial Airlines, it's an 
awesome day to fly.  Is this 

06:52:54.755 --> 06:52:56.354
Wally?
   &gt;&gt; Yup.

06:52:56.355 --> 06:52:58.356
&gt;&gt; Great.  Document info about 
your flight to London today?

06:52:59.579 --> 06:53:00.400
&gt;&gt; That's right.
   &gt;&gt; WALLY BRILL:  So 

06:53:00.401 --> 06:53:05.896
completely different kind of 
language.  Do you want info?  

06:53:05.897 --> 06:53:08.165
It's an awesome day to fly.  
Very different than our last 

06:53:08.166 --> 06:53:10.166
persona, 

06:53:12.861 --> 06:53:14.077
Terrence, because these brands 
are so dispircht we need to be 

06:53:14.078 --> 06:53:16.078
consistent to 

06:53:19.798 --> 06:53:21.798
the brand, so as you can see, it
makes a difference.

06:53:23.397 --> 06:53:26.919
Right snt.
     So in terms of positioning 

06:53:26.920 --> 06:53:30.982
these guys, where do we think 
they would fit on this chart?  

06:53:30.983 --> 06:53:33.897
Well, let's start with Terrence.
   He's kind of submissive, he's

06:53:35.743 --> 06:53:37.743
introverted, he just does what 
he's 

06:53:39.200 --> 06:53:40.619
told, he does the job, he does 
it very, very well, but does he 

06:53:40.620 --> 06:53:45.333
the job.  He's not overly 
friendly, he's not distant, he's

06:53:45.334 --> 06:53:47.334
just kind of in that 

06:53:50.029 --> 06:53:53.901
middle place somewhere.  What 
about Helen?  She's super 

06:53:53.902 --> 06:53:55.902
friendly, she's an 

06:53:59.197 --> 06:54:02.053
extrovert to the extreme and 
she's a lot of fun, so she 

06:54:02.054 --> 06:54:07.408
belongs right there over on the 
right.  The next step which 

06:54:07.409 --> 06:54:09.409
we're not going to 

06:54:10.890 --> 06:54:12.733
dive into too deem right now is 
what we call user testing, 

06:54:12.734 --> 06:54:16.817
sometimes you do what's called 
Wizard of Oz testing, you can do

06:54:16.818 --> 06:54:19.051
this effectively with dialogue 
flow by actually mocking up 

06:54:19.052 --> 06:54:21.052
quickly the main pass of your 
interactions and then 

06:54:24.356 --> 06:54:26.444
playing them for people, have 
people work through them and get

06:54:26.445 --> 06:54:28.445
a sense of how 

06:54:29.961 --> 06:54:31.961
usable it is, and how much that 
persona 

06:54:35.835 --> 06:54:37.835
matches their ingoing 
expectations.

06:54:39.427 --> 06:54:42.274
So we've got a few take-aways 
for you.

06:54:44.525 --> 06:54:46.775
First, review the actions you've
already made.  And they're 

06:54:46.776 --> 06:54:53.004
wonderful.  I know.  But is the 
persona clearly defined?  Do you

06:54:53.005 --> 06:54:55.046
feel confident that the persona 
is well imagined and well  

06:54:55.047 --> 06:54:59.532
created?  Is it representative 
of the brand, the user and the 

06:54:59.533 --> 06:55:01.533
task?

06:55:03.852 --> 06:55:06.377
Does it work right?
   Number two, define that 

06:55:06.378 --> 06:55:08.378
persona.

06:55:11.358 --> 06:55:11.892
You're going on follow the 
process, learn about the brand, 

06:55:11.893 --> 06:55:13.921
know the user, know the task, 
and define appropriate 

06:55:15.590 --> 06:55:17.590
characters, which is for me the 
fun part.

06:55:18.673 --> 06:55:23.378
   And then bring it to life.  
Write these monologues, write 

06:55:23.379 --> 06:55:28.522
these sample dialogues, and make
recordings of them because you 

06:55:28.523 --> 06:55:31.195
can only tell about 
conversational voice user 

06:55:31.196 --> 06:55:33.629
interface by listening to it.  
If you read it on the page, it 

06:55:33.630 --> 06:55:37.769
won't have the same effect at 
all, and if you've got 

06:55:37.770 --> 06:55:39.849
stakeholders that you're trying 
to talk to about what you're 

06:55:42.886 --> 06:55:45.137
doing and to explain this is the
right thing, they've got to hear

06:55:45.138 --> 06:55:48.825
it, you don't want to give them 
anything with writing on it.  

06:55:48.826 --> 06:55:52.935
Just say close your eyes, listen
to this.

06:55:54.167 --> 06:55:57.005
And then test.  Test your action
with real customers.

06:56:01.513 --> 06:56:03.757
Locally-fidelity prototypes, 
dialogue flow, however, but you 

06:56:03.758 --> 06:56:05.758
want to derive some data and 
some proof points for your 

06:56:07.637 --> 06:56:09.637
stakeholders to say customers, 
users 

06:56:11.318 --> 06:56:13.318
really felt this was right for 
our brand.

06:56:15.175 --> 06:56:19.253
And that gives you success, I 
hope.  I'm sure.  And it will be

06:56:19.254 --> 06:56:21.328
wonderful, and you'll make 
beautiful personas.

06:56:25.261 --> 06:56:29.336
So with that, I'm going to ask 
you to give us some feedback.  

06:56:29.337 --> 06:56:31.337
You all know the drill.

06:56:34.084 --> 06:56:35.951
And finally, here rl are a 
couple rorlsz that are really 

06:56:35.952 --> 06:56:40.241
quite wonderful.  Developers.
Google.com.   Google.com/io.

06:56:45.212 --> 06:56:48.076
Kathy Pearl who recently joined 
our team wrote a wonderful book 

06:56:48.077 --> 06:56:50.560
called designing voice user 
interfaces.

06:56:55.243 --> 06:56:57.514
Wired for  Speech by Clifford 
Nass I recommend, talks about 

06:56:57.515 --> 06:56:59.515
persona at great links.

06:57:01.420 --> 06:57:03.420
And voice user interface design 
by 

06:57:05.321 --> 06:57:07.321
James Giancola is a important 
baseline 

06:57:08.361 --> 06:57:10.361
book, this kicked off a whole 
generation of  GUI designers.

06:57:10.417 --> 06:57:12.417
   With that, thank you very, 
very much 

06:57:15.308 --> 06:57:17.308
for coming, and have a wonderful
rest of IO.

06:57:19.177 --> 06:57:20.609

   &gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  Hello, 
hello, welcome.

07:23:54.116 --> 07:23:56.116
&gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  Hi, everyone, 
thanks for coming.

07:23:56.974 --> 07:23:57.574
(applause).
   &gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  It's been a

07:23:57.575 --> 07:24:01.651
long day, huh?  It's been a long
three days.  I know Steren and 

07:24:01.652 --> 07:24:05.111
myself really appreciate all of 
you sticking around and coming 

07:24:05.112 --> 07:24:07.781
to our session, so just one more
time, thank you, everyone.

07:24:08.190 --> 07:24:10.190
&gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  It's good 
to have you with us.

07:24:14.130 --> 07:24:16.178
This is Myles, Myles Borins, 
Myles works on Google Cloud, 

07:24:16.179 --> 07:24:18.423
we've been working together over
the last year, he 

07:24:21.679 --> 07:24:23.679
also happens to be the director 
of the 

07:24:25.143 --> 07:24:25.967
nodes jis technical steering 
committee.

07:24:25.968 --> 07:24:28.410
(cheers and applause).

07:24:29.022 --> 07:24:31.022
&gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  And of 
course, 

07:24:32.893 --> 07:24:37.433
he's a long time Node.js lover, 
the first time you used Node.js 

07:24:37.434 --> 07:24:39.070
was for installation, something 
like that?

07:24:39.071 --> 07:24:41.331
&gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  Yeah.
   &gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  Nice.

07:24:41.749 --> 07:24:45.022
   &gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  This is 
Steren, Steren is a product 

07:24:45.023 --> 07:24:47.023
manager for Google 

07:24:48.685 --> 07:24:51.376
Cloud platform, the serverless 
team and we've been working 

07:24:51.377 --> 07:24:53.821
really closely on new Node.js 
technologies, previously was 

07:24:53.822 --> 07:24:58.139
involved in the stack driver 
error reporting product and you 

07:24:58.140 --> 07:25:02.013
used Noticed in production in 
2011.  Was that like 04 or 06?

07:25:02.623 --> 07:25:04.673
   &gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  06 I 
think.

07:25:05.489 --> 07:25:07.489
&gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  Did anyone 
start 

07:25:08.692 --> 07:25:10.692
with noticed

07:25:12.229 --> 07:25:14.312
No Dierks 06 in the awd jens?  
Right on.  That was buggy, right

07:25:14.313 --> 07:25:17.960
when they introduced util.  Fun 
fact about Steren, his we go 

07:25:20.036 --> 07:25:22.036
invitation was actually written 
in 

07:25:24.102 --> 07:25:25.728
JavaScript approximate, that's 
still online, that means your 

07:25:25.729 --> 07:25:27.359
wedding invitation will never 
break.

07:25:27.360 --> 07:25:28.771
&gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  Never.  The
web.

07:25:28.772 --> 07:25:30.772
All right.

07:25:33.394 --> 07:25:36.171
So who can name this French 
pastry?  So it's called a mill 

07:25:36.172 --> 07:25:40.645
fill.  Literally translating to 
thousand layers.  So it's 

07:25:40.646 --> 07:25:42.646
basically a cake made of many, 
many, many layered.

07:25:46.760 --> 07:25:49.403
So one of my teachers used to 
say, in French, Tout probleme 

07:25:49.404 --> 07:25:51.660
est un Mille-feuille de choses 
simples.

07:25:59.133 --> 07:26:01.133
So translating, every problem is

07:26:05.764 --> 07:26:10.331
Mille-feuille trrks so any 
problem can be broken down into 

07:26:10.332 --> 07:26:13.186
simple things.  This is true for
code and also for software 

07:26:13.187 --> 07:26:17.935
architectures.  If you break 
down your big app into simple 

07:26:17.936 --> 07:26:20.605
things, it will be simpler.  If 
you break them down into 

07:26:21.415 --> 07:26:23.415
Microservices.

07:26:25.432 --> 07:26:27.506
So that brings us to  
microservices.  In 

07:26:27.507 --> 07:26:29.507
Microservices?

07:26:31.824 --> 07:26:33.824
Well, maybe your app has grown 
to big, 

07:26:35.691 --> 07:26:37.691
maybe it's actually hard to 
understand, 

07:26:40.174 --> 07:26:42.174
develop, maintain, manage, this 
is why 

07:26:43.852 --> 07:26:45.852
Microservices can be a solution.

07:26:48.568 --> 07:26:49.994
You break up the monolith, 
decouple those Microservices, 

07:26:49.995 --> 07:26:51.995
you make them simpler to 
understand and maintain, and 

07:26:55.393 --> 07:26:56.432
potentially each service will be
written in a different language 

07:26:56.433 --> 07:26:58.433
owned by a 

07:27:00.936 --> 07:27:02.936
different team and deployed 
independently.

07:27:05.433 --> 07:27:09.076
   As a consequence, they'll 
scale independently if you 

07:27:09.077 --> 07:27:11.077
decouple them.

07:27:13.177 --> 07:27:15.633
The scaling is independent, too 
and by making them more fine 

07:27:15.634 --> 07:27:17.634
grained, that will 

07:27:19.697 --> 07:27:21.697
result in a better utilization 
of your 

07:27:22.949 --> 07:27:24.949
resources that will result in a 
lower 

07:27:26.023 --> 07:27:28.023
build for you, and lastly, 
Microservices 

07:27:30.860 --> 07:27:32.860
pair great with Node.js due to 
the asynchronous nature of Node.

07:27:34.870 --> 07:27:36.870
js

07:27:37.889 --> 07:27:40.325
so Microservices, break up the 
Monday list, scale independently

07:27:40.326 --> 07:27:46.246
and pair great with Node.js.  
But what is Node.js?

07:27:47.690 --> 07:27:49.690
&gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  So I was given
this slide.  Node.

07:27:51.119 --> 07:27:56.248
js.  JavaScript.  How many 
people like JavaScript?  Sweet.

07:27:56.861 --> 07:27:58.861
   So I don't know if any of you
have 

07:28:04.421 --> 07:28:06.421
seen this little emoji  list, 
the rocket 

07:28:09.915 --> 07:28:11.392
turtle, sub stack drew this 
turtle, JavaScript was not 

07:28:11.393 --> 07:28:14.069
supposed to be a fast language, 
it was pretty amazing how fast 

07:28:17.340 --> 07:28:19.570
both as a run time and also for 
node iteration.  Node is one of 

07:28:19.571 --> 07:28:22.355
those things you can get it done
in 10 or 15 minutes because 

07:28:24.423 --> 07:28:26.423
somebody has written the module,
you just need find it.

07:28:28.075 --> 07:28:30.925
At its base, node is a 
JavaScript run time, we take the

07:28:30.926 --> 07:28:32.926
V8 virtual machine 

07:28:36.209 --> 07:28:38.256
that comes in the Chrome 
browser, wrap it with an 

07:28:38.257 --> 07:28:40.257
underlying architecture 

07:28:41.707 --> 07:28:43.945
wrapping, all the system calls, 
wraps platforms and allows 

07:28:43.946 --> 07:28:45.946
developers to just 

07:28:47.423 --> 07:28:48.643
write JavaScript and do compute,
write servers and all those 

07:28:48.644 --> 07:28:53.109
different things.  It allows you
to leverage your fronted end 

07:28:53.110 --> 07:28:55.565
skills, it's event driven, that 
means that compute is driven by 

07:28:55.566 --> 07:28:57.566
events.  Something come putsz 
when something 

07:29:01.057 --> 07:29:02.686
happens, that can be an http 
request, that can be some sort 

07:29:02.687 --> 07:29:07.571
of message coming over a socket,
it can be user input with a 

07:29:07.572 --> 07:29:09.572
keyboard, it can be some sensor 
if 

07:29:11.440 --> 07:29:13.487
you're work with IOT, any form 
of IO.  Anytime there's input, 

07:29:13.488 --> 07:29:15.488
some sort of 

07:29:17.566 --> 07:29:20.014
compute  runs.
   The event-driven architecture

07:29:20.015 --> 07:29:24.834
plays really great with async 
nonblocking I/O, multiple things

07:29:24.835 --> 07:29:28.897
can run in parallel without 
blocking each other.  When I 

07:29:28.898 --> 07:29:30.519
make some sort of request over a
socket rs I'm able to suspend, 

07:29:30.520 --> 07:29:34.802
let other things execute and 
resume when I'm done without 

07:29:34.803 --> 07:29:36.803
requiring the developer to 

07:29:38.466 --> 07:29:40.739
program any of this, it just 
happens.  Many events execute 

07:29:40.740 --> 07:29:42.740
without blocking each other and 
this ends up being really 

07:29:45.865 --> 07:29:48.061
great for web servers because it
means multitell people can 

07:29:48.062 --> 07:29:50.530
connected can connect to the 
same processor at the same time,

07:29:50.531 --> 07:29:52.761
and it works you don't have to 
worry about timing, you just 

07:29:52.762 --> 07:29:55.623
worry about handling the 
evented.

07:29:57.859 --> 07:29:59.859
So to sum that up, Node.

07:30:01.137 --> 07:30:03.137
js is a JavaScript run time 
that's event 

07:30:05.651 --> 07:30:08.311
driven with async nonblocking 
I/O.

07:30:09.119 --> 07:30:11.770
&gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  The last 
term we need to define from the 

07:30:11.771 --> 07:30:13.771
title of this talk is 
serverless.

07:30:15.849 --> 07:30:17.849
Who here is using a serverless 
product?

07:30:18.486 --> 07:30:21.125
So we should agree that there 
are a lot of definitions for 

07:30:21.126 --> 07:30:23.365
server lts.  I'm going to 
highlight here the key 

07:30:26.002 --> 07:30:28.002
characteristics that we'll use 
around this talk.

07:30:29.937 --> 07:30:32.180
The first one that to me is the 
main characteristic is that you 

07:30:32.181 --> 07:30:34.181
pay for what 

07:30:37.260 --> 07:30:41.956
you use so it's bidding, if you 
don't use it, you don't pay, and

07:30:41.957 --> 07:30:43.957
then the bill is 

07:30:45.436 --> 07:30:47.060
proportional to your usage.  Of 
course you don't need to 

07:30:47.061 --> 07:30:49.061
provision in advance any 
resource, all of this is 

07:30:56.030 --> 07:30:57.044
done on demand so why are we 
able to achieve that bidding 

07:30:57.045 --> 07:30:59.045
model?

07:31:02.861 --> 07:31:03.345
Because of the rational model.  
So a serverless product will 

07:31:03.346 --> 07:31:05.346
scale 

07:31:08.878 --> 07:31:10.889
with usage without having to 
worry about it.  It grows with 

07:31:10.890 --> 07:31:12.861
you from a single developer to a
company with thousands of 

07:31:12.862 --> 07:31:17.315
developers.
   It follows your usage.  And 

07:31:17.316 --> 07:31:19.316
why can it scale?

07:31:21.388 --> 07:31:23.388
Well, because of a programming 
model.

07:31:26.081 --> 07:31:28.554
The Cloud providers takes care 
of the rest.  You folk us on 

07:31:28.555 --> 07:31:30.555
your code.

07:31:31.838 --> 07:31:34.138
That means that no  
infrastructure management, no VM

07:31:34.139 --> 07:31:37.404
management, everything is 
abstracted from you.  So you 

07:31:37.405 --> 07:31:39.443
focus on your code, that also 
means that you focus on 

07:31:39.444 --> 07:31:41.444
delivering 

07:31:43.127 --> 07:31:45.127
business value and value to your
users.

07:31:47.829 --> 07:31:50.501
So to recap, serverless, pay for
what you use, it scales, and 

07:31:50.502 --> 07:31:54.995
allows you to focus on code.  
This is the principles that we 

07:31:54.996 --> 07:31:58.664
are going to -- these are the 
principles we are going to use 

07:31:58.665 --> 07:32:00.665
along that talk, and 

07:32:01.932 --> 07:32:04.825
you will see it's not actually, 
not only for compute.

07:32:05.642 --> 07:32:07.642
&gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  So Google 
Cloud has 

07:32:09.582 --> 07:32:11.009
a number of different serverless
offerings.  We have Cloud 

07:32:11.010 --> 07:32:15.093
functions.  How many people here
have been using node and Cloud 

07:32:15.094 --> 07:32:17.094
function so far?  Cool.

07:32:19.390 --> 07:32:21.390
We've got

07:32:24.570 --> 07:32:27.470
got app engine storage, Cloud 
storage, Big Query, data  flow, 

07:32:27.471 --> 07:32:32.280
ML engine, Firebase sweet, app 
scripts, all these different 

07:32:32.281 --> 07:32:33.303
products, what define them as 
serverless is the fact that you 

07:32:33.304 --> 07:32:37.000
don't have to manage them, we'll
scale them for you, manage them 

07:32:37.001 --> 07:32:39.001
for you, you can 

07:32:43.074 --> 07:32:44.524
utilize them as much as you need
it.

07:32:44.525 --> 07:32:46.529
&gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  And today 
we are very proud to share with 

07:32:46.530 --> 07:32:48.530
you the preview of Node.

07:32:50.457 --> 07:32:50.667
js on the app engine standout  
environment.

07:32:50.668 --> 07:32:52.668
(cheers and applause).

07:32:54.379 --> 07:32:56.379
Thank you.

07:33:00.711 --> 07:33:02.711
So yes, we are adding a new 
language 

07:33:04.155 --> 07:33:06.155
to app engine standout, Node.js.

07:33:07.853 --> 07:33:10.083
We'll release it in a few weeks.

07:33:14.545 --> 07:33:16.787
So let's see a small demo of 
nodes jis on app engine 

07:33:16.788 --> 07:33:19.256
standout.  Myles will tell you 
more about it.

07:33:20.888 --> 07:33:23.554
&gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  So this 
package JSON file is 

07:33:23.555 --> 07:33:25.596
outpalestining a hello world 
application, we have a single 

07:33:30.072 --> 07:33:31.894
start script that calls node on 
server JS which if you don't 

07:33:31.895 --> 07:33:33.895
define the start 

07:33:35.602 --> 07:33:37.602
script and just run NPM start, 
that's 

07:33:38.879 --> 07:33:40.327
the default command and just do,
which if you're not expecting 

07:33:40.328 --> 07:33:43.184
that to do it.  It has a single 
dependency, which is express.

07:33:43.389 --> 07:33:48.302
   Here is our express app.  
We're making an app using 

07:33:48.303 --> 07:33:50.303
express.  We have a single 
route.

07:33:54.360 --> 07:33:56.360
And we celebrate Node.

07:34:00.322 --> 07:34:01.333
js on app engine standard, fall 
back to 884 local development, 

07:34:01.334 --> 07:34:03.334
there's one more 

07:34:04.410 --> 07:34:08.270
thing we'll need to get this 
onto app engine standard.  Tiny 

07:34:08.271 --> 07:34:10.271
bitty yaml.

07:34:15.143 --> 07:34:17.661
This one line of yaml run time 
nodejs8 is the only thing you 

07:34:17.662 --> 07:34:19.662
run on Node.

07:34:21.314 --> 07:34:23.314
js apps and it will run dprks 
the 

07:34:24.388 --> 07:34:26.259
command is gcloud app deploy.  
Steren has something loaded on 

07:34:26.260 --> 07:34:30.342
his computer, so we'll switch 
over to it right now.

07:34:33.408 --> 07:34:35.636
And you're see Steren is in the 
Cloud shell, he has that app we 

07:34:35.637 --> 07:34:37.637
were just showing you, and he's 
going to type in 

07:34:40.334 --> 07:34:42.334
that command that I just 
mentioned.

07:34:48.058 --> 07:34:50.058
Gcloud app deploy.

07:34:55.667 --> 07:34:57.667
So this is how you know it's a 
real demo.

07:34:58.762 --> 07:35:00.762
(laughter).

07:35:03.041 --> 07:35:05.041
But we haven't actually deployed
yet.  Are you ready?

07:35:06.490 --> 07:35:07.305
&gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  Let's do 
it.

07:35:07.306 --> 07:35:09.151
&gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  We're start to
go deploy.  In the time it takes

07:35:09.152 --> 07:35:14.312
to deploy, I'll try to list all 
the things I like about T it's 

07:35:14.313 --> 07:35:16.544
an idiomatic node run time 
environment, meaning we're using

07:35:16.545 --> 07:35:21.032
the exacted version of node that
gets published by Node.js, no 

07:35:21.033 --> 07:35:23.286
special run tiemgz or special 
API's, it's the same app you can

07:35:23.287 --> 07:35:27.349
run in other places, it scales 
to zero so when urnltd using it,

07:35:27.350 --> 07:35:29.406
you're not paying for T it's a 
managed run time which means 

07:35:31.471 --> 07:35:33.332
everything but your code and the
node modules you're using will 

07:35:33.333 --> 07:35:37.838
get updated by us.  If there's a
security fix that needs to lan 

07:35:37.839 --> 07:35:40.309
into node, and trust me there 
are, we'll patch that for you 

07:35:40.310 --> 07:35:42.310
without you or your users ever 
really noticing.

07:35:46.773 --> 07:35:48.773
Oh, wow, I couldn't even get to 
to T it's already deployed.

07:35:51.761 --> 07:35:54.008
You also get NPM on the Cloud, 
hybrid monitoring for free and 

07:35:54.009 --> 07:36:00.553
free https.  Wow, that was fast.
   We can go and see the service

07:36:00.554 --> 07:36:02.554
right 

07:36:06.554 --> 07:36:08.554
now, it's already running

07:36:12.148 --> 07:36:14.148
.  So there you go.  This 
service has been deployed, we're

07:36:15.619 --> 07:36:17.254
already running it, this is in 
my opinion like a really great 

07:36:17.255 --> 07:36:21.204
user experience, being able to 
deploy, have it up on the Cloud 

07:36:21.205 --> 07:36:23.870
so quickly and be able to share 
that with people to take a look.

07:36:25.521 --> 07:36:27.557
   So now that we're done with 
the demo, 

07:36:31.460 --> 07:36:32.890
we'll talk a little bit more.
   &gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  So this 

07:36:32.891 --> 07:36:38.611
was Node.js on app engine 
standard environment.  It is 

07:36:38.612 --> 07:36:40.612
idiomatic, which means that you 

07:36:42.270 --> 07:36:44.304
can use any module from the NPM 
registry that you want, there is

07:36:44.305 --> 07:36:46.305
no A pi or 

07:36:47.757 --> 07:36:50.201
language restriction, as you've 
seen, it deploys fast and scales

07:36:50.202 --> 07:36:52.202
instantly.

07:36:53.746 --> 07:36:55.746
And as Myles said, it is secure.

07:36:57.816 --> 07:36:59.816
So you get one click http for 
your 

07:37:02.498 --> 07:37:04.498
system domains and it 
auto-updates.

07:37:05.469 --> 07:37:07.469
So I will now do a deep dive 
into 

07:37:09.159 --> 07:37:11.159
three updated piece of  
infrastructure.

07:37:12.623 --> 07:37:14.681
The first one that is what we 
call internally faster than 

07:37:14.682 --> 07:37:17.129
light builds.  So what's that?

07:37:20.997 --> 07:37:22.825
When you type gcloud app deploy,
we'll first tonal upload the 

07:37:22.826 --> 07:37:25.276
files that have actually changed
since last time.  Okay?

07:37:28.363 --> 07:37:30.363
This is an opt myization.

07:37:34.475 --> 07:37:36.713
The faster than light build 
arrives later.  We look at your 

07:37:36.714 --> 07:37:39.351
package.JSON and package-lock.

07:37:42.789 --> 07:37:44.789
JSON, we do NPM install for you 
in the Cloud.  Good.

07:37:46.459 --> 07:37:48.459
But actually, this is what we 
defined as the speed of light.

07:37:53.379 --> 07:37:55.379
Actually if we notice that your 
package.

07:37:58.363 --> 07:38:00.363
JSON hasn't changed, we are 
going to 

07:38:03.362 --> 07:38:05.362
give you what we just gave you 
before.

07:38:06.388 --> 07:38:08.388
If you do a new deployment.

07:38:10.406 --> 07:38:12.403
So we use our caching system to 
give you the cached modules, 

07:38:12.404 --> 07:38:14.356
that's how we can go faster than
light.

07:38:14.357 --> 07:38:15.568
This was the first piece of 
updated infrastructure for this 

07:38:15.569 --> 07:38:20.879
new run time.  The second one is
a new run time environment.  So 

07:38:20.880 --> 07:38:22.880
let's see a bit of the technical
stack.

07:38:27.673 --> 07:38:30.542
So first, you gave us your code 
when you will do G Cloud at 

07:38:30.543 --> 07:38:34.390
deploy.  This is your 
application code.  As I said, we

07:38:34.391 --> 07:38:37.035
install the node modules for 
you, including the native 

07:38:37.036 --> 07:38:39.036
modules, can be any modules.

07:38:41.327 --> 07:38:43.327
And that, everybody, there is 
Node.

07:38:45.798 --> 07:38:47.446
js and here this is an off the 
shelf Node.js, there's no 

07:38:47.447 --> 07:38:49.447
special customization here.

07:38:51.543 --> 07:38:53.543
Node is relying on the OS 
packages and 

07:38:54.607 --> 07:38:56.423
for example you might have heard
about headless Chrome and yes 

07:38:56.424 --> 07:38:58.461
all of the packages to run 
headless Chrome are 

07:39:01.734 --> 07:39:03.734
present in the app engine image,
and 

07:39:05.389 --> 07:39:07.389
that lives on top of the regular
OS, 

07:39:08.400 --> 07:39:10.400
which is

07:39:14.292 --> 07:39:16.292
duh but

07:39:17.900 --> 07:39:20.135
which is Ubunt you can.  Its 
automaticallily updated without 

07:39:21.371 --> 07:39:23.371
you having to worry about it.

07:39:25.247 --> 07:39:28.091
It will automatically update 
your Node.js version, the OS 

07:39:28.092 --> 07:39:30.092
package and the OS is also auto 
mactdly updated.

07:39:32.768 --> 07:39:35.016
All of that lives in the secured
sandbox, and this is a new 

07:39:35.017 --> 07:39:38.692
sandbox technology that we are 
introducing with this new run  

07:39:38.693 --> 07:39:40.693
time.

07:39:44.399 --> 07:39:46.399
Under the hood, the sandbox is 
based 

07:39:49.093 --> 07:39:51.093
on Gvisor, a sandbox we opened 
last week.  Check it out.

07:39:53.566 --> 07:39:55.598
This is our new run time 
environment.  And the last piece

07:39:55.599 --> 07:39:57.599
of infrastructure I 

07:39:59.134 --> 07:40:01.134
would like to highlight is 
automatic 

07:40:02.143 --> 07:40:04.143
scaling

07:40:05.290 --> 07:40:09.163
.  What is automatic scaling?  
Let's take an example.  App 

07:40:09.164 --> 07:40:11.609
engine constantly monitors the 
instance capacity and traffic 

07:40:11.610 --> 07:40:16.331
that your application capacity 
and traffic, and it ensures that

07:40:16.332 --> 07:40:19.186
the appropriate number of 
instances are available to run 

07:40:19.187 --> 07:40:21.834
your application.  So what does 
that mean?  Let's take an 

07:40:21.835 --> 07:40:23.835
example.

07:40:25.304 --> 07:40:26.941
So as I said, if there is no 
request arrive to go your 

07:40:26.942 --> 07:40:31.820
application, there is no 
instance scheduled.  And when I 

07:40:31.821 --> 07:40:33.821
say instance, it's not a VM 

07:40:37.802 --> 07:40:39.802
instance, it's an app that we 
name instance.

07:40:39.822 --> 07:40:41.822
Now some traffic toorves your 
application.

07:40:43.311 --> 07:40:45.578
Well, we will scale up as fast 
as possible one instance.

07:40:47.607 --> 07:40:49.777
Here I'm going to pause for a 
second.  I want to highlight one

07:40:49.778 --> 07:40:51.778
concept that 

07:40:53.451 --> 07:40:55.121
is very important for 
developers.  The very first of 

07:40:55.122 --> 07:40:57.122
these requests will 

07:41:00.812 --> 07:41:02.437
hilt what we calling the code 
start, that means that this 

07:41:02.438 --> 07:41:04.869
request will actually hit the 
instance while it is 

07:41:09.206 --> 07:41:10.848
starting up and this usually 
results in a higher latency than

07:41:10.849 --> 07:41:13.282
usual.
   Of course, we try to -- not 

07:41:13.283 --> 07:41:15.325
we try, but we do boot up the 
instance very, 

07:41:22.852 --> 07:41:23.962
very fast, but you also have 
spient a responsibility  here, 

07:41:23.963 --> 07:41:26.215
you have to ensure that your 
start command is fast too.

07:41:29.464 --> 07:41:32.112
So in the start, make sure to 
not do things like build or a 

07:41:32.113 --> 07:41:34.170
lot of initialization.  Do the 
minimum required to start your 

07:41:36.412 --> 07:41:39.285
application because this will 
have an impact on the cold start

07:41:39.286 --> 07:41:42.540
of your application.
   So here as I said the very 

07:41:42.541 --> 07:41:46.015
first request will hit this cold
start but the next one 

07:41:46.016 --> 07:41:48.249
everything is fine.
   But then your traffic will 

07:41:48.250 --> 07:41:50.250
start to 

07:41:52.392 --> 07:41:55.035
increase a little bit, and here 
before this first instance 

07:41:55.036 --> 07:41:57.062
arrives at capacity, we will 
anticipate that you need a 

07:41:59.549 --> 07:42:01.797
second one, and we'll schedule a
second one so that when you 

07:42:01.798 --> 07:42:04.262
actually need it, it's there.  
It doesn't need to scale more.

07:42:07.351 --> 07:42:12.391
   Now let's imagine your app is
featured on a popular blog post 

07:42:12.392 --> 07:42:14.392
and you have a huge spike of 
traffic.

07:42:16.461 --> 07:42:19.918
Well, don't worry, app engine 
scales very fast.  So it will be

07:42:19.919 --> 07:42:21.919
scaleup instances as much as 
needed.

07:42:23.834 --> 07:42:25.446
You can control, you can tell us
the maximum number of instances 

07:42:25.447 --> 07:42:27.447
if that matters to you.

07:42:30.127 --> 07:42:32.127
And of course when things go 
down, 

07:42:34.183 --> 07:42:36.661
well, we will ramp down the 
number of instances to zero.  So

07:42:36.662 --> 07:42:38.893
that's what we call automatic 
scaling.  You did not have to do

07:42:38.894 --> 07:42:46.466
anything to get this behavior.
   But this is not new at all.  

07:42:46.467 --> 07:42:48.467
App engine has been doing that 
for ten years.  Ten years now.

07:42:51.554 --> 07:42:53.554
What is new is that actually we 

07:42:55.848 --> 07:42:58.705
updated our automatic scaling 
algorithm.  So the updates 

07:42:58.706 --> 07:43:02.047
include it is more predictable. 
As a developer, you will better 

07:43:03.460 --> 07:43:05.712
understand how it behaves when 
you look at your instance chart,

07:43:05.713 --> 07:43:07.713
you will better understand it.

07:43:11.904 --> 07:43:12.934
Second, it actually improves 
instance utilization and 

07:43:12.935 --> 07:43:14.935
performance.

07:43:18.660 --> 07:43:21.114
So we measured a reduction of 
30% of those cold starts, so 

07:43:21.115 --> 07:43:23.115
that means that 

07:43:24.572 --> 07:43:26.572
the latency of all of our apps 
across app engine has went down.

07:43:29.247 --> 07:43:31.888
And also better utilization 
means lower builds for everybody

07:43:31.889 --> 07:43:33.889
using app 

07:43:35.852 --> 07:43:37.852
engine, and this was released in
the 

07:43:39.863 --> 07:43:41.897
last months.

07:43:47.911 --> 07:43:49.917
The third point are new settings
that we are introducing to 

07:43:49.918 --> 07:43:51.918
better control 

07:43:56.891 --> 07:44:00.691
these scale algorithms, help you
balance between cost and 

07:43:56.891 --> 07:43:57.858
performance.
   Also as I said, helps you cap

07:43:57.859 --> 07:43:59.874
the number of instances so that 
you can cap your build but also 

07:43:59.875 --> 07:44:04.088
the number of data connections, 
for example.

07:44:05.310 --> 07:44:07.310
So this was three pieces we 
updated.  To you, Myles.

07:44:08.956 --> 07:44:10.956
&gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  We biltd a 
product with Node.

07:44:12.839 --> 07:44:15.274
js comprised of services to 
share with you today and Steren 

07:44:15.275 --> 07:44:17.275
will demo it on the machine 
fowls right now.

07:44:21.145 --> 07:44:23.145
Privilege

07:44:27.370 --> 07:44:29.005
   &gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  Go for 
it.

07:44:29.006 --> 07:44:31.262
&gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  We created a 
web page watcher, and we're able

07:44:31.263 --> 07:44:34.110
to put an address into the 
submission bar, and it will 

07:44:34.111 --> 07:44:36.111
start watching it.

07:44:37.364 --> 07:44:39.364
And at five-minute inyes mentsz,
it's 

07:44:40.614 --> 07:44:42.650
going to use headless Chrome to 
take a recall -- five minute 

07:44:42.651 --> 07:44:47.369
increments, it's going on use 
headless Chrome and only take 

07:44:47.370 --> 07:44:50.023
screen captures when there's 
been a difference in the page.  

07:44:50.024 --> 07:44:52.282
This website allows you to set 
nid number of different websites

07:44:52.283 --> 07:44:56.376
to watch, and this has been a 
lot of fun on use on like the 

07:44:56.377 --> 07:45:01.271
Google website to see the 
changes to the Google header.  

07:45:01.272 --> 07:45:02.901
You could use it to watch your 
own site to make sure that 

07:45:02.902 --> 07:45:05.971
things aren't going down if you 
have a personal page that isn't 

07:45:05.972 --> 07:45:07.972
changing a lot.

07:45:10.281 --> 07:45:12.308
But it was a way for us to 
experiment with breaking things 

07:45:12.309 --> 07:45:16.164
into different services and put 
together a really great example.

07:45:16.979 --> 07:45:19.630
   So Steren, did you have 
anything you wanted to add to 

07:45:19.631 --> 07:45:20.897
that?
   &gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  I want 

07:45:20.898 --> 07:45:23.551
to tell you how it's done.
   &gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  That sounds

07:45:23.552 --> 07:45:24.807
great.
   &gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  Let's go

07:45:24.808 --> 07:45:27.089
back to the slides.  So this is 
a product, this is an 

07:45:27.912 --> 07:45:29.912
application.  A website watcher.

07:45:34.010 --> 07:45:36.010
How did we build it?

07:45:41.360 --> 07:45:43.360
Well, every five minutes, there 
is a 

07:45:44.434 --> 07:45:47.264
chron job that will trigger 
first microservices.  First is 

07:45:47.265 --> 07:45:49.265
called task  scheduler, the 

07:45:50.736 --> 07:45:52.564
job of this Microservices is to 
ask the database for a list of 

07:45:52.565 --> 07:45:55.035
web pages to screenshot.

07:45:59.659 --> 07:46:01.659
When it receives this list, it 
will

07:46:06.289 --> 07:46:08.934
actual get you intie a topic a 
message for each page of 

07:46:08.935 --> 07:46:10.935
screenshot.

07:46:14.463 --> 07:46:15.885
Then it will fowsh a second 
microservice -- then it will 

07:46:15.886 --> 07:46:19.192
fowsh a second microservice the 
web pages and the job of this  

07:46:19.193 --> 07:46:21.193
microservice, it has one job, to
take screen shots.

07:46:23.051 --> 07:46:25.716
So as I said previously, this is
using headless Chrome under the 

07:46:25.717 --> 07:46:27.717
hood in 

07:46:28.981 --> 07:46:31.626
order to take those screen 
shots.  So it opens a web page, 

07:46:31.627 --> 07:46:36.942
takes a screenshot, saves it 
into Google Cloud storage.  

07:46:36.943 --> 07:46:40.815
That's its only job.
   Now the new file arrives into

07:46:40.816 --> 07:46:42.816
Cloud storage.

07:46:45.526 --> 07:46:48.398
This will trigger an event, this
will send an event that will 

07:46:48.399 --> 07:46:50.399
trigger a Google Cloud function 
that will compare this 

07:46:53.494 --> 07:46:55.336
new screenshot with the last 
known referenced screenshot for 

07:46:55.337 --> 07:46:59.792
that web page, we call it image 
diff because the job of that 

07:46:59.793 --> 07:47:01.416
function is to compare two 
images and if there is a 

07:47:01.417 --> 07:47:03.417
difference between the 

07:47:05.091 --> 07:47:06.911
images, it will store the new 
image into a new folder in 

07:47:06.912 --> 07:47:08.912
Google Cloud storage.

07:47:10.820 --> 07:47:12.820
So this is how we continuously 
get 

07:47:14.066 --> 07:47:16.304
the updates of all of the web 
pages that we want to track.

07:47:16.918 --> 07:47:18.918
Okay.

07:47:21.377 --> 07:47:23.377
Now, the user arrives onto a 
website.

07:47:25.664 --> 07:47:27.664
So an http request arvedz to a 
web 

07:47:28.679 --> 07:47:33.636
fronted front end, another 
microservice, query a list, 

07:47:33.637 --> 07:47:35.883
asking for a list of web pages, 
when I see the detail of that 

07:47:35.884 --> 07:47:39.985
web page, we update the screen 
shots, so it also queries Cloud 

07:47:39.986 --> 07:47:42.430
storage.  That's how we build a 
product.

07:47:44.466 --> 07:47:46.466
For custom microservices all 
communicating with each other.

07:47:47.098 --> 07:47:50.376
   Now Myles is going to tell 
you more a bit about the code.

07:47:51.608 --> 07:47:55.684
   &gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  So the 
first microservice that we're 

07:47:55.685 --> 07:47:58.737
showing is our screenshot 
server.  You're going to knoll 

07:47:58.738 --> 07:48:02.415
we're using  async functions 
because -- you're going to knoll

07:48:02.416 --> 07:48:04.650
we're using  async functions 
because app engine comes with no

07:48:04.651 --> 07:48:06.651
date 

07:48:07.713 --> 07:48:09.713
out of the box, we'll start a 
browder 

07:48:11.600 --> 07:48:13.439
session by awaiting puppeteer to
watch, we'll then await a new 

07:48:13.440 --> 07:48:15.873
page from the browser object, 
we're going to await 

07:48:20.371 --> 07:48:22.366
surf to go that URL, we'll await
setting the viewport to the size

07:48:22.367 --> 07:48:24.820
of the image that we want to 
take and then we'll await a 

07:48:24.821 --> 07:48:26.821
screenshot in the image buffer.

07:48:27.919 --> 07:48:29.567
We then await closing the 
browser and then we return the 

07:48:29.568 --> 07:48:33.452
image buffer.  We're doing a lot
of asynchronous work in here 

07:48:33.453 --> 07:48:35.453
that is going to allow us to use
the same service to pull lots of

07:48:37.112 --> 07:48:39.112
different images at the exact 
same time without blocking.

07:48:41.194 --> 07:48:42.643
We're able to do it in a single 
linear fashion without having to

07:48:42.644 --> 07:48:45.495
manage a whole bunch of 
call-backs or any sorts of 

07:48:47.145 --> 07:48:48.372
promises, although under the 
hood there's lots of different 

07:48:48.373 --> 07:48:52.064
promises going on.
   Now, this is deployed using 

07:48:52.065 --> 07:48:56.558
app engine standard, and there 
were some other talks going on 

07:48:56.559 --> 07:48:58.559
this week about headless Chrome 
and you can find those 

07:49:01.723 --> 07:49:03.723
if you go and check the I/O web 
page  later.

07:49:04.790 --> 07:49:06.623
So this is our service that the 
part of the service that actual 

07:49:06.624 --> 07:49:08.624
saves to a 

07:49:10.274 --> 07:49:12.733
bucket, similarly, we're using 
asink in a way to be able to do 

07:49:12.734 --> 07:49:17.636
this in a linear fashion, but we
did to the bucket, we rename the

07:49:17.637 --> 07:49:19.637
images to be based on a time 

07:49:20.902 --> 07:49:22.578
stamp, and we save it and await 
that information and then log 

07:49:22.579 --> 07:49:26.848
it.  And because all of the 
Node.js client libraries support

07:49:26.849 --> 07:49:30.946
promises, you are going to be 
able to use our various client 

07:49:30.947 --> 07:49:32.947
libraries to talk to all 

07:49:35.223 --> 07:49:36.635
of our various servers using 
async await right out of the  

07:49:36.636 --> 07:49:38.887
box.
   Then the last thing we wanted

07:49:38.888 --> 07:49:40.888
to show 

07:49:42.356 --> 07:49:44.647
you was the image diff from our 
Cloud function that's doing the 

07:49:44.648 --> 07:49:46.648
image diff.

07:49:47.956 --> 07:49:49.956
Every time a new file gets add 
to do a 

07:49:51.033 --> 07:49:52.849
Cloud storage bucket, this 
function is automatically called

07:49:52.850 --> 07:49:54.850
and we wanted to 

07:49:55.904 --> 07:49:57.776
show how quickly from the event 
that the function is executed 

07:49:57.777 --> 07:49:59.777
with, we can grab 

07:50:01.053 --> 07:50:02.895
the file and the context at 
which -- of that file inside of 

07:50:02.896 --> 07:50:06.769
Cloud storage.  So we don't even
need to write any logic to tie 

07:50:06.770 --> 07:50:08.814
the two together, we just need 
one service to save it and this 

07:50:08.815 --> 07:50:11.266
new service just reacts.  One 
thing that's really great about 

07:50:13.103 --> 07:50:15.338
all these different services is 
that out of the box, if you 

07:50:15.339 --> 07:50:19.209
start logging, stack driver is 
going to grab all those logs and

07:50:19.210 --> 07:50:21.636
you're going to be able to use 
stack driver logging to look at 

07:50:21.637 --> 07:50:24.284
all the logs of what's going on.
I don't know about you, but I 

07:50:24.285 --> 07:50:26.285
never 

07:50:30.910 --> 07:50:34.910
write a service write it the 
first time, I write it locally 

07:50:30.910 --> 07:50:32.910
and will then it works 
differently in the Cloud.

07:50:35.915 --> 07:50:37.901
Being able to just log and have 
it working is really awesome.  

07:50:37.902 --> 07:50:39.902
For the demo we put together, 
you'll 

07:50:42.075 --> 07:50:43.315
see online later, we used bunion
and have a pretty robust logging

07:50:43.316 --> 07:50:45.749
system you'll be able to take a 
look at.

07:50:46.364 --> 07:50:48.799
&gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  Let's look 
at the Cloud console to see 

07:50:48.800 --> 07:50:52.274
those Microservices in the 
console.  As I said, we do have 

07:50:52.275 --> 07:50:56.398
three app engine services, so 
you will see them on the app 

07:50:56.399 --> 07:50:59.653
engine dashboard.  So I'm 
opening my services.  Oh, we 

07:50:59.654 --> 07:51:01.654
have four because I just 
deployed one.  Oh, that was you?

07:51:07.364 --> 07:51:09.364
So default screenshot and task 
scheduler now.

07:51:11.369 --> 07:51:13.369
We have one Cloud function.

07:51:14.379 --> 07:51:16.379
See if I open it.

07:51:23.974 --> 07:51:25.922
Image diff as you see, the 
trigger is Cloud storage bucket 

07:51:25.923 --> 07:51:30.915
trigger.  Now, as Myles said, 
out of the box, all your logs 

07:51:30.916 --> 07:51:32.916
are going to be collected 

07:51:35.001 --> 07:51:37.444
into stack driver logging, so 
let me figure out some of those 

07:51:37.445 --> 07:51:40.836
logs and -- let me filter out 
some of those logs and only 

07:51:40.837 --> 07:51:42.837
shoar the application logs that 
are here.

07:51:49.668 --> 07:51:51.505
So these are the logs for the 
app across all the services, so 

07:51:51.506 --> 07:51:53.506
as you see, you are 

07:51:56.799 --> 07:51:59.486
see we loaded the website, we 
also, what else did we do, we 

07:51:59.487 --> 07:52:02.333
saved screenshots, all of this 
gets logged in a different 

07:52:02.945 --> 07:52:07.239
severity.
   Here we had an error 

07:52:07.240 --> 07:52:09.476
apparently.
   Lastly I wanted to show when 

07:52:09.477 --> 07:52:13.789
your logs go to stack driver, 
they are going to be collected 

07:52:13.790 --> 07:52:17.891
and grouped together by stack 
driver error reporting.  Here 

07:52:17.892 --> 07:52:19.327
what you see here is a list of 
error groups, so all of your 

07:52:19.328 --> 07:52:22.572
errors, if they are the same, 
are going to be grouped together

07:52:22.573 --> 07:52:25.434
on this page as one group.  So 
this is out of the box when you 

07:52:25.435 --> 07:52:30.393
use app engine especially Node.
js on app engine.

07:52:33.461 --> 07:52:36.721
That is all for the demo of the 
resources.  Let's go back to the

07:52:36.722 --> 07:52:40.618
slides.
   Now I'm going to talk a 

07:52:40.619 --> 07:52:42.619
little bit 

07:52:44.950 --> 07:52:46.950
more about how to connect 
Microservices.

07:52:48.627 --> 07:52:50.627
So of course you can directly 
call a service.

07:52:51.692 --> 07:52:53.923
So that's the case, for example,
when a client calls a front end.

07:52:56.771 --> 07:52:58.998
So an http request arrives, 
that's a direct call.  It's also

07:52:58.999 --> 07:53:01.230
the case when you receive a web 
hook.  Whul receive a web hook, 

07:53:01.231 --> 07:53:03.231
that will be a direct call.

07:53:05.347 --> 07:53:07.347
And lastly, two Microservices 
can call 

07:53:08.616 --> 07:53:10.616
each other directly, of course.

07:53:11.881 --> 07:53:13.881
Ly another kind of communication
between 

07:53:15.742 --> 07:53:17.372
Microservices which actually can
be quite convenient and useful 

07:53:17.373 --> 07:53:19.373
is what we 

07:53:22.691 --> 07:53:24.691
call asynchronous execution and 
events.

07:53:25.754 --> 07:53:27.783
So if you remember, every five 
minutes lz a service was 

07:53:27.784 --> 07:53:29.784
scheduled, so this is 

07:53:33.729 --> 07:53:35.565
one kind of scheduled services.
   Now you remember anytime we 

07:53:35.566 --> 07:53:39.667
put a file into Cloud storage, 
something happened, the function

07:53:39.668 --> 07:53:44.379
was triggered.  So this is 
another kind of communication, 

07:53:44.380 --> 07:53:48.242
we call that reactive services. 
So when something happens, this 

07:53:48.243 --> 07:53:50.243
is 

07:53:52.901 --> 07:53:54.936
triggered via events.  Another 
way to do asynchronous 

07:53:58.834 --> 07:54:00.834
execution is to actually use a 
task 

07:54:06.413 --> 07:54:08.458
queue, so one service will anc 
you a task into a queue and this

07:54:08.459 --> 07:54:12.141
queue will make sure that the 
task is executed by retrying if 

07:54:12.142 --> 07:54:14.982
needed and by dispatching test 
rate that you want, so task 

07:54:14.983 --> 07:54:19.070
queues can be quite convenient 
for asynchronous task execution.

07:54:26.428 --> 07:54:29.268
And lastly, as we made in our 
demo, you can use subscriber 

07:54:29.269 --> 07:54:34.592
pattern where one service will 
publish a message into a pub 

07:54:34.593 --> 07:54:37.252
serve topic and one or many 
other services that are 

07:54:37.253 --> 07:54:39.253
subscribed to that 

07:54:40.750 --> 07:54:45.300
topic will receive the message.
   Lastly, maybe this is 

07:54:45.301 --> 07:54:48.385
obvious, but sharing storage is 
also a way to communicate 

07:54:48.386 --> 07:54:52.924
between services.  You can have 
two services sharing the same 

07:54:52.925 --> 07:54:55.613
database, that is a kind of 
connection.  In our case, we 

07:54:55.614 --> 07:54:59.905
used Cloud data store and Google
Cloud storage.  So connecting 

07:54:59.906 --> 07:55:01.906
Microservices, we can 

07:55:03.171 --> 07:55:04.620
directly call them, you can use 
asynchronous execution and 

07:55:04.621 --> 07:55:06.871
events and shared storage.

07:55:10.133 --> 07:55:12.366
   &gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  So after 
talking about all these 

07:55:12.367 --> 07:55:15.417
different types of services and 
products, you may be wondering 

07:55:15.418 --> 07:55:17.863
like when should I use functions
or when should I uses app 

07:55:24.208 --> 07:55:26.208
engine or maybe when should I 
use a k us bernetes?

07:55:27.703 --> 07:55:29.530
These are decisions teams need 
to make.  A little more into 

07:55:29.531 --> 07:55:33.399
functions first.  We talked 
about events and async, that's a

07:55:33.400 --> 07:55:35.400
lot of the programming model 
used for this.

07:55:35.646 --> 07:55:37.646
You have different kinds of 
triggers.

07:55:38.899 --> 07:55:41.158
There you have pub sub, Google 
Cloud storage so whenever 

07:55:41.159 --> 07:55:43.603
something ends up in a bucket, 
it triggers it, you can have 

07:55:45.235 --> 07:55:47.075
database transactions, one 
that's interesting is logs, you 

07:55:47.076 --> 07:55:52.022
can have a function run every 
time you see things in logs, you

07:55:52.023 --> 07:55:54.272
can filter different kinds of 
error messages or automate pager

07:55:54.872 --> 07:55:57.535
duty, something like that.  
Maybe not pager duty, but you 

07:55:57.536 --> 07:55:59.536
can also 

07:56:01.213 --> 07:56:03.259
use web hooks, any sort of http 
can go and call it.  One of the 

07:56:03.260 --> 07:56:05.726
thing that's nice with Cloud 
functions and they can really 

07:56:07.546 --> 07:56:08.769
single purpose, it has a well 
defined programming model with a

07:56:08.770 --> 07:56:11.003
really quick way to get tolt 
data that's coming in 

07:56:14.907 --> 07:56:17.156
from the event, one that I 
really like is an e-mailer, for 

07:56:17.157 --> 07:56:19.795
example.  You may have a whole 
bunch of different services that

07:56:19.796 --> 07:56:22.853
need to send e-mail, so if you 
have one Cloud function that 

07:56:22.854 --> 07:56:24.854
just does all the off and all 
the messaging to whatever e-mail

07:56:30.375 --> 07:56:33.366
service you're running, you can 
make e-mail topic on pub sub and

07:56:33.367 --> 07:56:35.367
just publish 

07:56:37.925 --> 07:56:41.383
a to, a from, a body and a title
and an e-mail will just go out. 

07:56:41.384 --> 07:56:43.405
Let's say you decide to change 
your e-mail provider service, 

07:56:43.406 --> 07:56:46.072
you just have to change that one
Cloud function and no one else 

07:56:46.073 --> 07:56:50.139
needs to refactor their code, as
long as you have defined API 

07:56:46.073 --> 07:56:49.043
service between all your 
services that isn't broken, you 

07:56:49.044 --> 07:56:51.044
can change it to any 

07:56:53.378 --> 07:56:54.992
language or any service you want
to.

07:56:54.993 --> 07:56:56.993
On the other hand, we have app 

07:56:58.079 --> 07:57:00.079
engine, app engine for example, 
http 

07:57:01.771 --> 07:57:03.771
services are generally what are 
exposed.

07:57:05.032 --> 07:57:07.075
It's multipurpose, though.  You 
can use it will for front end 

07:57:08.928 --> 07:57:11.583
applications, you can use it to 
serve static resources, it disbt

07:57:11.584 --> 07:57:15.070
does not are a defined function 
wrapper, so you can take any 

07:57:15.071 --> 07:57:16.704
node application for the most 
part that you've already been 

07:57:16.705 --> 07:57:18.931
running and just launch it.  If 
you have multiple different 

07:57:18.932 --> 07:57:20.932
things that are going, multd 
pell rowtsz that 

07:57:23.622 --> 07:57:25.257
you're handling, database 
queries, templating, you may 

07:57:25.258 --> 07:57:27.890
find that running something on 
app engine makes more sense 

07:57:34.157 --> 07:57:36.157
for the use case than a Cloud 
function

07:57:37.370 --> 07:57:39.415
but you can define your own 
compute relationship.  Cloud 

07:57:39.416 --> 07:57:41.051
functions and app engine work 
really great together F your 

07:57:41.052 --> 07:57:43.718
team prefers thinking about 
things as functions like run 

07:57:43.719 --> 07:57:45.719
with that, I know 

07:57:47.189 --> 07:57:49.189
entire websites that have 
thousands of 

07:57:51.069 --> 07:57:53.138
page views and hours and they've
written their entire 

07:57:53.139 --> 07:57:55.787
infrastructure on functions and 
there's tons of big node apps 

07:57:55.788 --> 07:57:58.444
that can just run on app engine 
and scale as necessary.

07:58:00.073 --> 07:58:01.510
You could really break apart the
problem as it makes sense to 

07:58:01.511 --> 07:58:05.587
your team apples you need to go 
and they both share a lot of 

07:58:05.588 --> 07:58:08.070
similarities.  They're both 
going to scale to zero when 

07:58:08.071 --> 07:58:10.071
you're not using them, you're 
going 

07:58:12.738 --> 07:58:14.792
to pay for what you use, and 
under the hood they're using the

07:58:14.793 --> 07:58:18.866
same sandbox, using the same 
auto scaling, there's no right 

07:58:18.867 --> 07:58:20.894
or wrong.
   One of the cool things about 

07:58:20.895 --> 07:58:24.148
it too is you can start thinking
it almost becomes more of a 

07:58:24.149 --> 07:58:28.020
differences of how you wanted to
think about your compute and how

07:58:28.021 --> 07:58:30.299
you want to factor your code, 
but from an ops perspective 

07:58:30.300 --> 07:58:32.300
they're very similar.

07:58:33.973 --> 07:58:36.811
We also wanted to announce today
that node date is going to be 

07:58:36.812 --> 07:58:40.748
coming to GCF really soon, 
you'll be able to use all these 

07:58:40.749 --> 07:58:43.596
features both on Cloud functions
as well as app engine.

07:58:44.400 --> 07:58:46.400
&gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  All right.

07:58:47.670 --> 07:58:49.670
To recap, deploying Node.

07:58:51.270 --> 07:58:54.456
js Microservices serverless 
Node.js Microservices.  What 

07:58:54.457 --> 07:58:56.457
have we seen today?

07:58:57.540 --> 07:59:00.179
First, breaking up the monolith.
So as you've seen, we've built 

07:59:00.180 --> 07:59:02.180
an 

07:59:03.451 --> 07:59:05.451
entire product made out of very,
very 

07:59:07.367 --> 07:59:09.367
simple pieces, each of these 
pieces is a 

07:59:11.366 --> 07:59:12.374
few files or even one file for 
some of them.  Break up the 

07:59:12.375 --> 07:59:17.527
monolith.  Microservices   
architectures can help you build

07:59:17.528 --> 07:59:19.528
rich product from a decoupled 

07:59:22.220 --> 07:59:24.220
small, scalable, maintainable, 
understandable components.

07:59:27.091 --> 07:59:29.273
Second, we showed you a preview 
of Node.js on app engine 

07:59:29.274 --> 07:59:31.274
standard environment.

07:59:32.582 --> 07:59:34.582
This is coming in a few weeks.

07:59:35.636 --> 07:59:37.268
Lastly, what you should remember
is that Google Cloud platform 

07:59:37.269 --> 07:59:39.269
has 

07:59:40.425 --> 07:59:42.673
everything you need to build it 
serverless Microservices using 

07:59:42.674 --> 07:59:44.674
Node.

07:59:47.015 --> 07:59:48.637
js, and personally, I can't wait
to see what we'll build with 

07:59:48.638 --> 07:59:53.527
Node.js a.m. engine standard and
all of those products.

07:59:56.734 --> 07:59:58.734
(applause)

08:00:01.672 --> 08:00:03.512
.
   &gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  Thank you. 

08:00:03.513 --> 08:00:05.360
So if you enjoyed the session, 
you can go and get your feedback

08:00:05.361 --> 08:00:07.361
here through the schedule link.

08:00:10.814 --> 08:00:13.695
You can use web or Android or 
Kirk's OS, let us know what you 

08:00:13.900 --> 08:00:16.141
think.  Here are some resources,
you'll find the docs for the 

08:00:16.142 --> 08:00:18.142
a.m.

08:00:19.220 --> 08:00:20.649
engine standard, you'll see the 
functions and the dem mole that 

08:00:20.650 --> 08:00:22.650
we were 

08:00:24.710 --> 08:00:27.368
showing you today is all there 
-- the demo that we were showing

08:00:27.369 --> 08:00:30.017
you today.
   Just a quick round of 

08:00:30.018 --> 08:00:31.473
applause for everyone who is 
watching at home on the live 

08:00:31.474 --> 08:00:32.289
stream.
   (applause).

08:00:32.290 --> 08:00:36.392
   &gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  And one 
more quick round of applause, 

08:00:36.393 --> 08:00:38.420
you don't really see t but 
there's some amazing people at 

08:00:38.421 --> 08:00:41.931
the back of house in the back 
here who have been working all 

08:00:41.932 --> 08:00:43.358
day tirelessly, just a round of 
applause for them.

08:00:43.359 --> 08:00:45.359
(cheers and applause).

08:00:49.286 --> 08:00:54.207
   So don't go yet.  Hold on.
   &gt;&gt; STEREN GIANNINI:  One more

08:00:54.208 --> 08:00:58.487
thing.  One more thing.  Look 
under your seat.  No, joarking!

08:00:58.702 --> 08:01:00.702
   (laughter).
   Look over there.

08:01:01.983 --> 08:01:03.983
We have a stand where you can 
scan 

08:01:04.988 --> 08:01:07.640
your badge and we'll send you 
invites to try tomorrow or as 

08:01:07.641 --> 08:01:09.710
soon as we get your e-mails 
Node.js on app engine standard 

08:01:09.711 --> 08:01:12.762
environments, so if you wanted 
to give it a try, scan your 

08:01:12.763 --> 08:01:14.763
badge over there.  Thank you.
   &gt;&gt; MYLES BORINS:  Thank you.

08:01:16.301 --> 08:01:18.747
   (The session concluded at 
4:07 p.m.

08:01:21.948 --> 08:01:23.948
)
