00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well first and foremost, this is a defect

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because if a statement produces an infection

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
then it must be erroneous itself, and an error in the code

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is what we normally call a defect.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Since a defect in this situation implies that we can actually fix it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
such that the infection goes away, it is also a cause,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because it causes the infection in question.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The term infection, however, only applies to program states.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Therefore, it is no applicable in here.
