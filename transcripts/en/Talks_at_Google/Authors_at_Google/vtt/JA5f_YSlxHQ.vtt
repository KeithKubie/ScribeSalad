SUSAN WOJCICKI: Thank you
everybody for coming.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.640
I'm very pleased to have John
Wood here, who is the founder

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.850
of Room to Read and author of
two books, "Leaving Microsoft

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.700
to Change the World," which he
came to Google before and

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.950
spoke for a book tour, and
for his latest book.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.790
"Leaving Room to Read." We have
copies in the back for

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.370
all of you who want to
get your own version.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.910
But I was very excited to have
John here because Room to Read

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.170
has been a charity that I have
personally supported.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.200
And I think he's done some
really amazing things.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.290
So as he mentioned in
his title his book,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.430
he did leave Microsoft.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.890
He did change the world in
a lot of different ways.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.470
And in just 10 years, he has
opened up 1,6000 schools,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.720
15,000 libraries.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.235
He has distributed 12 million
books, and he has reached 7.8

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.800
million children.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.240
And he works in Bangladesh,
Cambodia, India, Laos, Nepal,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.750
South Africa, Sri Lanka,
Tanzania, Vietnam, and Zambia.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.210
So that's a really impressive
list of accomplishments.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.420
And John wound of doing
this somewhat by--

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.070
I don't know if it's
by accident.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.340
But I'd like John to come up.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.060
And I'm going to ask him some
questions about his

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.450
story and this book.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.640
And then I'll open it up
to the rest of you

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.780
to hear your questions.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.670
So let's welcome John.

00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.045
JOHN WOOD: It's always amazing
how nobody wants to

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:52.940
sit in front row.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.260
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Yeah.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.960
JOHN WOOD: There's always empty
chairs in the rows.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.920
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Yeah,
I was gonna--

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.880
JOHN WOOD: There we got one.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.910
We got at least taker.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.830
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Yes,
at least one taker.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.490
And future people will come.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.900
We'll have them sit
in the front too.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.580
JOHN WOOD: OK.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.270
SUSAN WOJCICKI: We'll call them
out as soon as they come

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.704
in the back door, to come
into the front.

00:02:08.704 --> 00:02:10.250
Oh look, more people
in the front.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.670
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.350
Sit in the front row.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.480
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So let's maybe
just start from the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.430
beginning, if we can.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.410
JOHN WOOD: I was
born-- no, no.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.200
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So this happens
to me too, if you ask

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.080
me to repeat my story.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.475
But it is really interesting.

00:02:27.475 --> 00:02:32.780
And I'd like everyone to hear
how is it that you wound up

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.300
like being at Microsoft?

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.370
Similar to probably a lot of
people here in the room, you

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.420
were a marketing manager for
APAC at Microsoft, thinking

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.550
about changing the world
with software.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.490
And then all of a sudden,
something happened and your

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.660
life took a totally
different course.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.230
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.280
I joined Microsoft in 1991.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.050
I was two years out of grad
school, did my MBA.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.340
Really had no business
being there.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.890
I don't know if any of you over
wake up in the morning

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.960
and you kind of feel like oh my
gosh, like I really don't

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.260
know that I really belong in
this hypersmart environment.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.860
I definitely felt that
way when I joined

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.430
Microsoft in '91.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.650
And by '98, I was a little
bit burned out.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.800
You know the whole seven
year itch thing.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.750
After seven years of way too
many meetings and way too many

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.080
flights and stuff like that, I
decided off to Nepal and do an

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.000
18 day trek, just kind of clear
my head and get away

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.070
from it all, the Annapurna
circuit.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.010
There was actually a rumor that
if you went high enough

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.570
in the Himalayas you could
escape the sound of Steve

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.600
Balmer's voice.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.820
And I decided to give
that a shot.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.793
No, I loved working for Steve.

00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:35.460
I learned a lot under him.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.740
But when I was on day two of
my trek, I met a headmaster

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.350
who wanted to show
me his school.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.070
It was a really ramshackle,
dilapidated school, dirt

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.376
floors, no desks, 80 children
crammed in a room that

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:50.000
probably should not
held more than 20.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.880
And then he said, well come and
see the school's library.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.630
And I thought, oh, this will
be the exciting, optimistic

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.110
part of the tour.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.330
How many of you were library
nerds as kids?

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.550
You work at Google,
so that's probably

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.370
a fairly safe question.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.560
So I was like a total library
nerd as a kid.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.970
So I thought this will be the
exciting part of the tour,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.960
kids with smiles on their
faces, reading books.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.660
Eh, totally wrong, empty room,
completely devoid of

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.470
children's books.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.090
And I asked the head master,
how can this be?

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.300
You have 450 kids showing up.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.279
They want to learn and their
parents want them to learn.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.220
And the headmaster said, well
in Nepal we're too poor to

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.540
afford education.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.600
But until we have education,
we will always remain poor.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.020
And that just hit me like a
ton of bricks as being the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.765
cruelest possible Catch-22 that
you have these kids who

00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:33.810
are five years old, or six years
old, or seven years old,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.310
and they're being told you've
lost the lottery of life.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.680
And thankfully, the headmaster,
like me, was an

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.750
action-oriented optimist.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.100
He said perhaps sir, you will
someday come back with books.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.130
And I thought this would be a
great reason to make an annual

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.850
leave from Microsoft and come
back to Nepal and trek.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.590
So I was like, yup, kind of
selfish motivation to sign up.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.420
But I'm kind of joking a little
bit about the self

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.346
motivation.

00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:57.110
But I grew up in a town,
small town, that

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.960
was very middle class.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.950
We have a great school library
and we had a great community

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.610
library that had been
built in 1896.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.430
So I thought well, here's
my pay it forward.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.235
I'll thank the world for my
libraries, with one library.

00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:08.440
And didn't realize we wouldn't
really stop there.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.870
But I went back a year later
with 3,000 donated books on

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.060
the back of six rented donkeys,
and my 73-year-old

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.130
father in tow as my unpaid
right-hand man.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.200
And it just felt really good.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.280
And I said well, that was fun.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.050
Like maybe we'll
keep doing it.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.840
And that was the point
of departure.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.420
It was that trip in '99
returning and seeing the

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.305
smiles on faces of the kids who
had never seen brightly

00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:31.170
colored children's
books before.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.920
The library shelves were
suddenly full.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.130
And that's the moment I started
to kind of edge my way

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.960
to the door of Microsoft, to
think maybe my next act will

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.010
not be in tech.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.190
Maybe it will be in something
a bit more basic.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.250
SUSAN WOJCICKI: It's like you
read the numbers here and you

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.830
think like 7.8 million
children whose

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.320
lives you've touched.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.050
Like do you have any stories
or like kids that really

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.560
touched you in particular, like
you saw them, you saw

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.430
they learned something,
you saw that they got

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.680
access to this book?

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.120
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.890
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I mean like what
is that experience for

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.690
like one of the 7.8 million kids
and how does it really

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.795
change their life, to
be able to have the

00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:09.840
books and the libraries?

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.640
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.960
It's pretty amazing to me these
kids, I hope one day all

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.250
of you get a chance, including
you, you're always welcome to

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.840
come visit our projects.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.000
With 1,600 schools and 15,000
libraries, there's lots of

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.500
places to go visit and meet the
kids and meet the-- not

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.930
just kids, but the parents and
the grandparents, whose lives

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.865
are being changed.

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:28.130
And I'll tell you a story
about a student.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.360
But first I'll you a story about
being in Nepal with a

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.610
number of our chapter leaders
who are running fundraising

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.560
chapters all of the world.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.440
We're very entrepreneurial.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.570
So we've actually given birth
to 57 fundraising chapters

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.660
around the world, 12,000
people involved.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.270
They have not quit their day
job to change the world.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.350
They've kept their day job.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.660
But they're changing the world
through raising funds for Room

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.580
to Read, including our San
Francisco chapter.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.980
But the Tokyo chapter co-founder
Susan Lodge was

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.580
with me on this trip.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.550
And Susan told a story about
being in a village where we

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.380
had a lot of girls
in our long-term

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.110
girls education program.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.740
And as you and I both know from
our discussions, it's

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.640
depressingly inexpensive
to change a girl's

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.640
like through education.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.300
It's $250 per girl, per year.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.120
And so the fact that over
100 million girls in the

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.640
developing world woke up this
morning and not go to school

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.530
is to me just an absolutely
avoidable tragedy because it's

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.540
not an expensive
problem to fix.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.920
But Susan said to me, John,
you've got me, Room to Read's

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.840
got me forever because I just
was talking a grandmother.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.290
And she was holding my hand and
with tears in her eyes she

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.510
said, I can die now that I know
that my granddaughter is

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.510
going to get educated.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.270
And Susan said you know,
you got a fan for life.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.650
So there's a grandmother.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.290
We watch parents.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.330
And everything we do at Room to
Read is under a challenge

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:39.850
grant model.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.870
The idea is you can't help
people if they don't want to

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.110
help themselves.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.600
So we don't go into a village
and build them a library or

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.620
build them a school.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.260
Hey, step aside local people,
we're here to help you.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.620
We say we're going to help you,
but only if you want to

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.300
help yourself.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.120
So the parents will put in sweat
equity to each project.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.715
So I've watched these parents at
school openings, at library

00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:01.680
openings, where the mothers will
come up and say, they'll

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.130
point down to the river.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.110
That's a pretty steep decline.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.270
And they'll say, I carried the
sandbags from the river up.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.830
And then other parents, their
fathers will say, well I

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.805
helped to dig the foundation.

00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:13.180
So It's very much of
a self-help model.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.620
And those parents motivate me.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.020
Because parents everywhere
are the same.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.320
They want their kids to have a
better life than they've had.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.290
And it almost always
comes to education.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.110
If you only bequeath one thing
to your child, you probably

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.330
would want to bequeath
education.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.230
But to land the plane, your
question with the students,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.260
one of my favorite stories of
a student I met with last

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.000
summer, my father decided for
his 86th birthday, he wanted

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.299
to go to Zambia with me on
a trip that I was doing.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.470
And I love my parents.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.700
They're such adventurous
people.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.604
And we are in this little
village in rural Zambia.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.140
And met a kid named Girus.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.760
He's a 13-year-old student
and really well read.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.660
He has a Room to Read library
in his school.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.095
And he was very articulate in
welcoming me to the library.

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:53.620
And officially, he was like
the head of the welcoming

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.650
committee that welcoming
our delegation.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.580
And I talked to him at first.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.610
I said Girus, you seem like
a very smart young man.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.030
And he said, yes.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.000
And so what would you like
to be when you grow up?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.290
And Girus said, oh, I will be
the first Zambian to be

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.500
Secretary General of
United Nations.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.890
And I said OK, that's great.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.690
So you're learning a lot in your
library about leadership.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.500
And he said yes, but I've also
learned that I will have to do

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.800
other things along the way.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.160
That will not be my first job.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.000
I said OK, what would be like
an interim kind of lily pad

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.830
you would jump to on the way
to that side of the pond?

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.550
And he, said well I will first
be president of Zambia.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.700
And it's kind of funny
story, right?

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.800
So this was in July,
last summer.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.500
Well in October, a couple months
later, at the United

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.540
Nations, I was a guest of Gordon
Brown, who's running

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.020
this amazing Education First
initiative for Ban Ki-moon.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.990
And Ban Ki-moon was telling a
story about growing up in

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.650
post-war South Korea in a
village that had been

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.140
decimated by the war.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.570
They were learning outside.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.880
The teacher had a stick, was
drawing in the dirt.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.240
That was their chalkboard.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.610
They had no books.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.040
And Ban Ki-moon said then one
day, these books showed up.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040
And we were really excited.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.650
And my parents said to me,
you must read every

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.420
one of those books.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.840
And he said we opened them up,
on the inside front cover it

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.810
says, "A Gift, From The United
Nations." Anybody getting

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.860
chills now, just thinking about
that fact that the kid

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.180
in the village with the stick
and the dirt and donated books

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.650
is now Secretary General
of the United Nations.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.930
So I don't think Girus's story
is really that far-fetched.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.070
And when I think of it, I think
about one of my heroes,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.800
Nelson Mandela.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.520
What would South Africa look
like today had Nelson Mandela

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.840
not been one of the lucky few
black South African kids to

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.450
get educated in that era?

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.950
What if Wangari Maathai
had not had education.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.293
The Green Belt movement in East

00:10:42.293 --> 00:10:43.080
Africa would not happened.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.060
All these kids are out there.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.310
We're all born with the
same gray matter.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.170
So if we can just reach them at
a young age, I think those

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.730
Girus stories, I mean Girus
could be the next Ban Ki-moon.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.460
We'll never know, we'll never
know unless we try to reach

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.460
every one of them.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.840
If we don't reach them, we
know it won't happen.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.610
But if we don't try,
we'll never know.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.406
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So is that a
goal of yours, to reach every

00:11:03.406 --> 00:11:04.380
one of them?

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.380
JOHN WOOD: Ultimately, yes.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.480
Yeah.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.370
I mean not just Room to Read,
I mean the greatest things

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.255
that happen in human
history happen

00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:12.470
when there's a movement.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.240
But movements have to have--
you got to have

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.980
the lead sled dogs.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.680
You got to have like a lot of
sled dogs to pull the sled.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.170
But we hoped to be one of
the lead sled dogs.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.390
And our interim goal was
originally to reach 10 million

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.240
children across the poorest
parts of the world by 2020.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.170
As you know, because I know
you read all the investor

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.750
reports we send you diligently,
we're actually on

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.190
track to reach 10 million
children five

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.140
years early, by 2015.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:40.030
And to be clear, we're not a
movement of billionaires.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.640
They're welcome.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.730
But we're not a top-down
model.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.100
We don't have no celebrities
involved.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.260
But it's just ordinary,
average people

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.240
who are coming together.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.900
And we've reached 7 abd 1/2
million kids already.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.940
We'll reach 10 million
kids by 2015.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.240
And then from there, I want to
start sentences with the words

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.480
"every child."

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.240
Every child gets a
chance to read.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.940
Every child gets a
habit of reading.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.290
Every girl child gets to go to
school, alongside the boys.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.270
Because in the developing world
today, about 40% of

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.330
girls don't go to school.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.390
And that's just a shame.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.730
So ultimately, we want to
reverse the notion that any

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.500
child can ever be told again,
you were born in the wrong

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.800
place, at the wrong time, to
the wrong parents, and you

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.850
therefore did not
get educated.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.250
We think that notion belongs in
the scrap heap of history.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.550
It might take 30 or 40 years
to get it there.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.410
But boy, if we could do that,
that's like the whole

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.620
Archimedes, give me a lever long
enough and I can move the

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.180
Earth, that would be I
think Earth moving.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.195
Will be, will be Earth moving.

00:12:37.195 --> 00:12:37.330
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Definitely.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:37.895
No, it will.

00:12:37.895 --> 00:12:39.145
It definitely will.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.650
So I understand you started one

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.860
school sort of by accident.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.570
You went there.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.930
You thought though like well,
I'll just go there on my

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.190
annual trek.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:57.150
But then you actually wound up
creating 1,600 schools and

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.850
15,000 libraries.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.040
So how did that happen?

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.620
How did it happen that you
went from one to a lot?

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.750
And maybe tell us a little
about scaling?

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.720
Like at Google, we're really
good about scale.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.450
And I think one of the things
that's really impressive about

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.620
you is you've been able to take
something that you did

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.970
once and actually scale
it many, many times.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.970
So how did that happen?

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.370
JOHN WOOD: I think that to
really explain it I have to

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.910
make sure I just use the word
"we" as I often as I can.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.590
Because I've always said I don't
want to be the leader of

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.840
an organization.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.240
I want to be one of
many, many, many

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.080
leaders of a global movement.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.490
So that requires you to A,
hire smart; B, recruit

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.340
volunteers in a really,
really smart manner.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.180
Delegate, delegate,
delegate, right.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.360
Founders have a duty to get out
of the way with certain

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.150
things that they do well
and don't do well.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.890
And if you ask one of my team,
they can probably give you a

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.690
really long list of the stuff
that I don't do very well.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.430
One thing that I happen to do
well, according to my board,

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:49.730
is I'm a good rainmaker.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.660
And they think I'm a decent
public speaker and they think

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.990
I'm pretty good with
the media.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.220
So about five years ago, I faced
the choice of do you

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.460
want to be CEO or do you want to
backfill that position and

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.070
go be a full-time ambassador?

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.710
And I write in the book about
that because no founder's

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.930
journey is done until they
actually kind of extract

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.920
themselves from that position.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.600
And so that was for
me, a tough thing.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.360
But one of my mentors, a banker
Goldman Sachs, he said

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.820
look, the minute you're not CEO,
what are you going to do?

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.370
It's like you're going to get
your butt on a plane, you're

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.520
going to fly around the world.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.960
You're going to raise money,
you're going to speak, you're

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.410
going to raise money, and
you're going to speak.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.600
And the Earth's is going to spin
faster, the more times

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.720
you can circle it, telling the
Room to Read story and

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.990
encouraging people
to get involved.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.980
So I think for me, we have a
great CEO, Erin Ganju, like

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.570
me, a business person,
ex-Goldman, ex-Unilever, a

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.620
brilliant woman.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.050
She's hired out a
management team.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.560
So we can get a lot more
done because of that.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.970
But I think for us, a lot
of it was just kind of--

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.290
it's like a law of
just compounding.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.050
We said, let's do 10 libraries
our second year, then let's

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.070
try to do 40, and let's
try to do 100, and

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.240
let's try to do 1,000.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.010
I don't know that there's
any secret sauce to it.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.120
A lot of it for us is
just the execution.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.510
A lot of it is not being shy
about asking for funding.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.460
Because I mean how many of you
know an NGO that you love

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.940
that's perpetually cash
strapped like

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.270
every one of us, right?

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.750
So a lot the NGO world, I think
they treat fundraising

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.830
as kind of a dirty little side
business that they have to be

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.160
kind of embarrassed about.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.070
And we're not at all.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.880
I love going out and
telling people--

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.450
Katie's here.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.320
When Katie was at the University
of Miami and they

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.520
me had come speak, Miami of
Ohio, the colder, but better

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.290
Miami, no offense to
our friends in

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.230
Florida, but I love them.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.770
And as I said to the students,
you guys if you want, you can

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.180
build a school in Nepal
and go visit it.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.320
It only costs $35,000.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.560
And there was some kind
of nervous chuckling.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.190
I go start with the alums, start
with the professors,

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.230
start there.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.260
And within like, I don't know, a
three weeks. they had raised

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.290
money to build a school.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.810
And that was $35,000.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:45.880
And they're really
proud of that.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.330
And hopefully that's going to
continue a tradition year

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.570
after year after year.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.460
But I go to technology
conferences, I go to

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.350
investment banking conferences,
and I say every

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.295
one of you in this room who is
educated, you would not be you

00:15:57.295 --> 00:15:57.990
without education.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.160
I would not be me.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.950
This is a chance to
pay it forward.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.700
$5,000 for a classroom library,
or $35,000 for a

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.320
school, or $250 for a girl
to go to school.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.290
We've just got really good
at kind of productizing,

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.770
pitching, and we pitch
persistently.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.260
SUSAN WOJCICKI: When
we talked, I was

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.120
impressed about the data.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.120
And how like you use data and
you've taken a lot of things

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.900
that you've learned from like
running in a business world

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.530
and apply that to schools.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.350
Like you told me some statistics
about like well if

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.720
the girl lives like this far
away, then like this much cost

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.450
for her bicycle or this much--

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.770
so maybe you can tell us a
little bit like data and how

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.040
you guys use that?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.860
We're also a very data
driven company.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.520
And it's interesting to see
how you've applied this to

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.980
building schools globally.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.920
JOHN WOOD: I am a very big
believer from my time in

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.310
business that what gets
measured gets done.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.760
I know I'm preaching to the
choir here on that one.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.890
So we try to measure every
single thing we do.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.420
And we're fortunate--

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:58.860
SUSAN WOJCICKI: It
sounds familiar.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.870
JOHN WOOD: --that we have
some great supporters

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:01.340
who helps us do it.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.069
The Gates Foundation funds
all of our evaluations,

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.910
cross-program, cross-country,
under a six year grant.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.150
So we can hire independent
outside evaluators.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.839
You want to have independent
evaluators, right?

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.720
Because those evaluators should
not be on your org

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.654
chart, reporting in to you.

00:17:15.654 --> 00:17:17.510
The should be independent
outsiders.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.240
They go out and they make
random, unannounced spot

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.680
checks on our facilities
and they collect data.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.605
Is there a checkout system
in place in the library?

00:17:24.605 --> 00:17:25.800
Are kids using it?

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.700
How many books are going
home with the kids?

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.000
We do samples in the places
where we do literacy training,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.900
assessments to see sample
schools which doe have a Room

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.863
to Read library versus the
schools that do have a Room to

00:17:35.863 --> 00:17:36.260
Read library.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.470
We just got a report last
week from Bangladesh.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.440
And you look at number of words
per minute a child can

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.010
read, control school, a
Room to Read school.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.080
Well, OK that's great.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.550
They're reading lots of words.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.460
Do they comprehend?

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.170
So you ask them some
comprehension questions.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.490
How do they score at the control
schools, how do they

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.690
score at the Room
to Read schools?

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.070
Girls' education, we look at
the percentage of girls who

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.950
passed to the next grade every
year, a very simple assessment

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.440
of whether it's working
or not.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.030
But if you think about this for
a minute, if you're born a

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.500
girl who's poor, in a rural
village, in one of the world's

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.590
50 poorest countries, to
uneducated parents, you have

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.640
five strikes against you.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.070
The world would expect
you to fail.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.440
Yet, two years ago,
97% of our girls

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.700
passed to the next grade.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.040
Last year it was 96% We went out
and did a survey last year

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.960
to figure out what percentage of
the girls who had finished

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.250
secondary school, like what
are they doing now?

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.120
They finished secondary
school.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.500
That's great.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.530
Now, what are they doing?

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.230
We found that 64% of them are
now enrolled in university or

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.930
tertiary education.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.010
That is a rate of attainment
higher than some schools in

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.110
the developed world.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.280
And to be clear, we're not
saying congratulations.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.650
You've graduated secondary
school.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.270
Here's your Room to Read
college scholarship.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.640
We're saying congratulations,
you're on our own.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.130
Good luck.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.860
Find a government scholarship
scheme, work by day, go to

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.120
school by night or vice versa.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.950
And we work with these girls on
their life skills to give

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.440
them the confidence.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.080
So they're going and they're
applying for these

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.640
scholarships.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.840
So they're working.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.040
And they're are in school.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.330
And I think great because as we
know, that's how a middle

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.300
class begins to form, when not
just boys, but also when girls

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.910
get educated and go
on to university.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.140
AUDIENCE: But all of your
schools are co-ed.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:12.870
Is that right?

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.170
JOHN WOOD: Yes.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.460
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So maybe you can
tell us a little bit about

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.830
philosophy there and why you
think that's so important?

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.160
JOHN WOOD: I think that if look
at the world today and

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.350
you look at a situation like
Malawa's in Pakistan where

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.380
girls are being harassed or shot
for going to school or

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.600
you look at places in the
world where people are

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.790
throwing acid on girls, and just
really bad stuff happens

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.590
all throughout the world.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.570
And my own personal belief is
that a lot of the reason for

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.720
that is that boys and girls
just don't go to

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.850
school side by side.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.840
They don't grow up in
relatively normal

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.470
circumstances where boys and
girls are in the classroom

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.610
together from kindergarten
through grade one, through

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.130
grade two, through
grade three.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.810
And so the boys haven't really
seen the girls achieve

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:53.255
academically.

00:19:53.255 --> 00:19:56.740
And when all these girls are
not in school, well then

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.430
society starts to really devalue
the women and the

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.620
girls because they didn't
go to school.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.290
And I think we have to
not just change--

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:05.340
this whole thing about women's
empowerment, it can't be a

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.390
women's issue.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.520
Men, we've got to
enlist in this

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.580
battle for gender equality.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.360
Not just because it's the
right thing to do.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.930
I think it was Hillary Clinton
that said it's

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:15.740
not a women's issue.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.990
It's a human rights issue.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.720
I know for myself if somebody
ever came up to me and said,

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.740
women are dumb, women are
inferior, I would have all

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.680
this case data to reject that
notion, my educated

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.550
grandmother, who read to me,
God bless her; my educated

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:36.940
mother; my educated older
sister; all the girls in my

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.275
school who kicked my butt
academically and

00:20:39.275 --> 00:20:40.670
were top of the class.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.270
I don't think that boys and
girls going to school, as

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.860
somebody said, is going to solve
every single problem.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.520
But I think if you actually have
that be the new normal

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.150
from age five, that's going to
do a lot to take these forces

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:57.420
of misogyny and these forces of
sexism and turn them around

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.185
in a really, really
significant way.

00:20:59.185 --> 00:21:03.040
SUSAN WOJCICKI: And now that
there's the internet, how do

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.360
you think that's going to change
books ands libraries

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.540
for schools globally?

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.660
I mean you could imagine
it could be easier.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.310
You just like download
the books.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.360
You don't actually have
to ship them anymore.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.670
I mean do you see like a world
where you're actually

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:25.230
installing digital libraries in
all of these locations and

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.510
like just getting files?

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.130
JOHN WOOD: I think in the
medium term, yes.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.250
I think in a short term, there's
a risk really of

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.150
putting the cart before
the horse.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.130
And also different things are
going to work in different

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.650
places based upon
circumstances.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.220
You look at something like Khan

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.050
Academy, absolutely fantastic.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.783
But there's certain
preconditions you have to have

00:21:46.783 --> 00:21:47.920
to actually have
that be useful.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.880
Like it helps to have
electricity.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.630
And it helps to have a computer
and it helps to have

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.950
broadband and it helps
to be literate.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.640
So what Room to Read is doing
is a lot of the stuff we're

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.110
doing is kind of the really
early stage foundational stuff

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:05.650
of saying let's get kids from
grade one to have really well

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.040
trained teachers.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.650
Because at the end of the day,
you want your kids to have

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:10.670
good teachers.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.820
Let's have them have
well-stocked libraries.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.550
Let's have literature in
the mother tongue.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.650
Because publishers don't publish
books in languages

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:18.960
read by predominantly
poor people.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.200
We should talk about
that a little bit.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.430
And the reality is for us is
we can open a library for

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.940
about $5,000.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.960
The average library serves
400 children.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.140
So you're looking at a cost of
$12.50 per child reached.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.510
So the low-tech solution is

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.740
actually really cost effective.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.000
Books don't need
to be rebooted.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.750
Books don't have operating
systems that degrade.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.290
I mean really $1 a book for
localized publishing, it's a

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.880
very, very cost effective
solution.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.780
And for us, it's not because
we're Luddites, but it's

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.500
really because we're working
on some really deep

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.160
foundational issues of
is a child literate?

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.030
Is a child going to be able
to learn to read?

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.710
But once that happens, I think
what ends up happening is

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.640
those kids should
be the same as--

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.840
I don't want to speak
for any of you.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.850
But I'm platform agnostic.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:05.840
I love to read books.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.110
I love to read magazines.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.490
If I'm going to long trip and
I'm going read the Steve Jobs'

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.885
bio, I'm likely to actually put
it on my device because

00:23:11.885 --> 00:23:13.050
it's going to save me
from carrying around

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.390
a seven pound book.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.680
But I think the key thing is
literacy, a habit of reading

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.220
from a young age, are
preconditions for any

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.270
technology solutions to actually
be able to work.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.440
And just think about this for
yourself, if you hadn't gotten

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.540
literate at a young age, odds
are really strong you would

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.650
not be working here.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.370
And I think we have to remind
the world of that [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.210
Because I read you're
a tough interviewer.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.940
No, but I do want to say that
because I do want to remind

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.420
that 98% of the illiterate
people in the world today are

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.970
in the developing world.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.010
And we haven't totally cracked
literacy in the developed

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.730
world, but we've come
really, really far.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.290
But in the developing world,
it's 49 our of 50 illiterate

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.230
people live in the
developing world.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.990
SUSAN WOJCICKI: One of the
things I did not list in all

00:23:55.990 --> 00:24:00.570
of these accomplishments is
the fact that in addition

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.020
you're also publishing books--

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.910
JOHN WOOD: Yes.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.860
AUDIENCE: SUSAN WOJCICKI:
--in 20 languages.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.040
JOHN WOOD: Right.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.520
SUSAN WOJCICKI: And you sort
of alluded a little bit to

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.350
this about needing to do that.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:16.770
So like maybe tell us a little
bit more like in addition to

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.560
creating libraries and schools,
you also had to

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.990
become a publisher?

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.360
JOHN WOOD: So what
happened to us--

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.700
in the new book, which by the
way it on sale here today--

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.680
SUSAN WOJCICKI: See.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.560
JOHN WOOD: Just so
we practice.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.090
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Yes.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:30.485
JOHN WOOD: In the new book, one
of my favorite chapters--

00:24:30.485 --> 00:24:31.670
SUSAN WOJCICKI: They're
subsidized, a big rule.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.710
JOHN WOOD: I know.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.100
I'm stocking up, man.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.720
You know, you guys here at
Google get this big cheaper

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.990
than my author price.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.480
I have to pay Penguin $17
a copy if I want to give

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.780
a copy to my mom.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.380
You're getting it for $10,
so I hope you stock up.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.630
Arbitrage.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.730
Where were we?

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:51.780
SUSAN WOJCICKI: How you
became a publisher?

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.850
How you became a publisher,
very apropos.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.190
JOHN WOOD: Hi, Paul.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.440
Remember to tell you
my Paul [? Hare ?]

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.940
story at some point too,
of the interview.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.020
No.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.420
So what happened to us was that
I wrote a chapter in this

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.830
new book, called "Searching for
Seuss." How many of you

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.550
were Dr. Seuss fans as kids?

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.720
Oh yeah, like 90% for
that question.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.720
So in the developing world, you
actually can't find the

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.480
equivalent of Dr. Seuss.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.660
Because the for-profit
publishers don't want to

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.290
publish books for children in
languages where people live on

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.610
less than $2 a day.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.900
And if you have $2 in your
pocket, think about what if

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.320
that was all you had for food,
shelter, clothing, medicine.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:30.810
That's it.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.330
You don't have anything
left over for books.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.460
So the for-profit publishers
don't publish children's

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:39.040
literature in Nepalese, Khmer,
Lao, Zulu, Setswana, Xhosa,

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.120
Sinhalese, Tamil, [INAUDIBLE],
Rajasthani, Bengala.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.030
I gave you a really depressing
long list of languages.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.480
But this for me is like
where the supply

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.570
chain of poverty starts.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.120
Because if kids don't have books
in their mother tongue,

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.336
how are they growing up literate
and how they going to

00:25:51.336 --> 00:25:52.570
grow up in a habit of reading?

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.110
We learned this because we
were talking about data

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.880
collection, what gets
measured gets done.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.190
In 2003, we went out and asked
our customers, we asked the

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.870
little people, how
are we doing?

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.850
What would cause you to
libraries more often?

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.630
Would it be longer hours, open
at night, open on weekends?

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.440
The number one answer kids gave
us, 52% of kids said more

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.950
books in the mother tongue.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.160
More books in Nepalese, more
books in Vietnamese.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.520
Well, that sounds like a giant
no-brainer, of course they

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.790
want books in the language
they speak at home.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.650
But the for-profit publishers
don't publish because there's

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.080
no profit incentive.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.180
So we looked at the data.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.620
And at Room to Read,
we don't sit around

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.290
and whinge or whine.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.620
We don't talk about problems.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.720
We act about solutions.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.990
And so we went out to the Skoll
Foundation, and thank

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.870
goodness Jeff Skoll has a team
and Sally Osberg have a team

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:40.570
that takes risks.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:44.440
They gave us $100,000 to go
search for Seuss, to go find

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.720
the Dr. Seuss or the Drs.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.960
Seuss, starting with Nepal, but

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.080
eventually in other languages.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.780
And what we found was this
absolutely, incredibly

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.190
creative community that existed
in these countries,

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.480
authors and artists with
story ideas, but

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.560
nobody had ever asked.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.680
We found a group called the
Nepalese Society for

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.210
Children's Literature.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.420
We don't know what the heck they
had been doing all those

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.070
years because they hadn't been
producing much children's

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.730
literature.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.170
But we said, we have the money
to produce 10 books.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.890
And within a month, our local
team in Nepal had 67

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.320
manuscript ideas.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.350
So we already had a backlog
of manuscript ideas.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:21.640
And so we basically decided we
would become a publisher, not

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.050
on a for-profit basis.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.190
And the thing that we wanted
to do, we said it would be

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.430
easier to just translate
existing children's books,

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.840
like to just overlay some Khmer
script on "Clifford the

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.850
Big Red Dog." But we decided
that we should actually do

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.820
original literature.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.960
Because what's the point of
having a book about the White

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.020
Christmas so that kids in Zambia
can be confused about

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.400
caroling, and eggnog's,
and snowflakes.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.390
Or have a book where mom drives
up in the Volvo station

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.940
wagon to the suburban ranch home
and kids in Nepal like

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.390
don't know what a suburban
home is.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.820
And so we become a publisher
in local language.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.490
And those first 10 books,
from little

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.550
things, big things grow.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.790
We've now published 850
original titles.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:27:59.990
We're going to publish
our 1,000

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.500
original title this year.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.180
And it's local, local, local,
local authors, local artists,

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.260
local editors, and
local content.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.180
Now, what's great about that
then is we also control the

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.470
printing presses.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.200
And it's literally
$1 per book.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.250
So we even have like
10-year-olds, who for their

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.200
birthday will say if everything
can give me $10,

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.800
Room to Read can produce
100 book.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.720
So the local area publishing
thing took off from that.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.270
And it's great.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.350
I tell a story in the book--

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.620
did can you indulge me in
one more quick story?

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:29.200
One of my favorite in the new
book is called "Baby Fish Goes

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.590
to School." So if "Searching for
Seuss" as a chapter, was

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.880
about the problem.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.800
"Baby Fish Goes to School"
is a chapter where the

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.710
solution comes up.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.290
And what happened is not just
adults wanted to write

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.420
children's books, but a lot of
the students came up to us and

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.210
said they had story ideas.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:46.440
And so in Sri Lanka, two teenage
girls, 13 or 14 years

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.920
old, came up the concept that
they wrote and illustrated,

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.610
called "Baby Fish
Goes to School."

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.940
And it was all about a little
fish who lives in the pond.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.230
And every day watches the
animals walking along the side

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.840
of the pond, going to school.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.890
He sticks his head above the
water and says, where you guys

00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.400
go every day?

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.590
And horse says, we
go to school.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.920
We love it.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.120
And the pig says, we sing
songs and play games.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.080
And the chicken says,
we get to eat curry.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.280
And we get to dance and take
naps and read books.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.260
And Baby Fish is like wow,
that's fantastic.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.700
I want to go to school.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.870
Well, that night it
tells mother.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.380
And the mother says, you
can't go to school.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.245
Why not?

00:29:14.245 --> 00:29:16.450
Well, the school is on land.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.200
And Baby Fish is like OK,
that totally sucks.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.850
That's a loose translation
from Tamil language.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.020
But the animals thankfully are
action-oriented optimists.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.060
They're not talking
about the problem.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:29.900
They're acting in
the solution.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.820
They go out-- and maybe a bonus
point for anybody who

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.239
guesses what they do?

00:29:35.239 --> 00:29:36.600
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.030
JOHN WOOD: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.310
The bonus points are redeemable

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.040
for absolutely nothing.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.370
Yeah, the animals buy a
fishbowl, they scoop up Baby

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.410
Fish, they walk to the fish's
school, plunk him down in

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.660
front of the chalkboard
and voila, Baby

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.280
Fish goes to school.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.270
And I don't think you could have
invented that story kind

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.100
of from an ivory tower
where I live.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.500
It was the Sri Lankan
teenage girls.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.650
And actually one of them now,
it's fantastic, the girl that

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.100
illustrated it is now
in her third year of

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.930
art college in Colombo.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:03.140
And still continues to ping me
on Facebook with her updates.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.390
I mean on Google+.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.480
You can actually look her up.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.870
If you have actually
Bing her--

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.280
come on, cheap tech humor.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.000
We're all friends.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.210
We're all friends, yeah, OK.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.840
SUSAN WOJCICKI: They didn't
think it's so funny.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.740
JOHN WOOD: I practiced that line
in front of the mirror

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.900
last night.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.570
Oh, I'm going to slay them
with my Bing joke.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.920
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So what can
everyone do to help?

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:42.780
So you work at a company
here, like

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.510
everyone here in the room.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.760
You talked about your different
volunteer chapters.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.710
Like what are the different ways
for people to be involved

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.770
and people to contribute
to the cause and

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.590
the movement then?

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.920
JOHN WOOD: I would go back to
the whole time, treasure,

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.270
talent, the three T's that
nonprofits talk a lot about.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.250
So if you have talent, we
can put you to work.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.490
We're currently looking for
somebody who can help us with

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.140
YouTube APIs.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.970
And we need an expert
in that to help our

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:09.900
online marketing team.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.970
I'm not sure exactly what
they need to do.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:12.960
But they asked me to pitch the
fact that we need somebody who

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.540
knows YouTube really well.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.610
There's other talents.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.080
We have a great relationship
with Salesforce.com.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.840
All of our projects reside up in
the cloud under an all you

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.630
can eat, free license for all
500 plus of our employees.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.210
It saves us so much money.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.950
But we actually have Salesforce
engineers who

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:29.770
volunteer their time.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:30.430
They're just down the
street from us.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.300
They come in and they actually
work with our team on our

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.810
global solutions database.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.440
So talent, we need talent.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.320
My email is john@
roomtoread.org.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.420
I'm happy to be the
clearinghouse for you if you

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.560
have ideas on that.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.470
Getting involved in our
fundraising chapters, right?

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.310
We have these fundraising
chapters around the world.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.670
We would love to have a

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.020
Googleplex fundraising chapter.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.740
Why not take some of your free
time and say let's just get

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.540
our friends together.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.360
Let's use that company
matching.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.280
Let's build a couple of
libraries or a couple of

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.030
schools somewhere in the
developing world and maybe

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.440
actually go visit them.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.320
And so turn that not just into
philanthropy, but turn it into

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.710
a travel opportunity.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.420
Maybe if you have kids or you
want to do an adventure with

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.720
your parents, like I do with my
parents on a regular basis,

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.380
you can do that.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.700
And I would say don't be shy.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.410
You have corporate matching.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.700
Your stock is doing all right.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:21.790
It would be great to have more
support from within Google.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:22.700
And lots of other stuff.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.920
If you have ideas, pitch
us on your ideas.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.380
If you have nieces, nephews,
kids, we've got a great

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.350
program called Students
Helping Students.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.190
We'd love to get students
involved in our work and

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:34.320
inculcate them into a habit of
philanthropy from a young age.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.770
Which really is great, because
it only teaches kids to be

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.800
philanthropic, but it also
teaches them business skills,

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.570
selling skills, social skills
when those kids are going out

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.020
and doing fundraising events.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.240
So anything you can do.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.110
If you have time, if you have
treasure, if you have talent,

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.230
we're open to all
of those things.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:51.220
SUSAN WOJCICKI: That's great.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:57.000
And what percentage of the funds
go to the actual kids?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.700
JOHN WOOD: We actually deploy
$0.83 on the dollar directly

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.460
to programs.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.880
I don't know if you guys
know Charity Navigator.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.120
It's kind of like the SEC of
the fundraising world.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.090
And they give from one
to four stars.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.200
And we've received four stars
every single year they've

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.510
rated us, which is the seven
consecutive years

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.640
they've been around.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.080
And only 2% of nonprofits in
America have achieved seven

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.730
consecutive years of Charity
Navigator four-star ratings.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.240
So at $0.83 on the dollar,
we're amongst the elite.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.480
And one of the questions
we get is well,

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.330
how do you do that?

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.990
Because you can't run
on no overhead.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.650
I mean having a CFO is
considered overhead.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.380
But you got to have a CFO or
else you're going to turn in

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.260
one of these silly nonprofits
that unravel because they have

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.260
no financial control.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.240
So overhead is a bit
like cholesterol.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.100
I think there's good cholesterol
and there's bad

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.290
cholesterol, just
as there's good

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.790
overhead and bad overhead.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:51.210
So we've done all kinds
of creative things.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.660
One of chap;ters in the book
is called "No Range Rovers,

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.400
The War on Overhead." And it's
all about saying let's not

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.190
spend money on these shiny
$75,000 vehicles that aid

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.430
workers love to drive around in
or be driven around in by

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:04.550
their driver.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.020
Let's eliminate that expense
because the $75,000--

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.090
who's good at math here.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:08.880
We're at Google.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.960
Who's good at math?

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.540
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Come on.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.159
Don't be shy.

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:12.920
JOHN WOOD: Come on,
[? Paul Hare. ?]

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.130
Good.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:14.770
I'll put Paul on the spot.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:19.380
So Paul, a Range Rover in
Cambodia costs $75,000.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.510
We can print one local
language book for $1.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.389
How many books do
you sacrifice--

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.690
this is your warm-up question.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.469
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
take a rough guess.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:30.110
It's somewhere around 75,000.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:30.719
JOHN WOOD: Perfect.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.400
OK.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.010
Second question.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.710
A girl's education, a girl's
scholarship for

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.460
one year costs $250.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.050
How many girls don't go to
school this year if we buy

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:42.424
five Range Rovers?

00:34:45.045 --> 00:34:48.409
AUDIENCE: Need help.

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.810
JOHN WOOD: OK.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:51.520
How many girls don't go to
school if we buy one?

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.170
JOHN WOOD: 300.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.489
Oh my gosh, you guys
need to hire me.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:57.739
I'm better on math.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:00.960
No, kidding.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.630
Sorry, Paul.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.050
But 300 girls.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.960
So if you buy like five Range
Rovers per country, but you're

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.620
working in ten countries like
we are, literally you're

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.870
cheating tens of thousands of
girls out of education.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:13.080
So we basically looked at it
and said, let's figure out

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.670
every single way we
can save money.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.170
So one day I was in a board
meeting and one of my mentors,

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:20.080
Muneer Satter, a Goldman banker,
was telling me that he

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.930
has been flying so much that
he had 3 million miles on

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.320
American Airlines.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.230
And I kind of rubbed my hands
together greedily and said

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.320
what's your password?

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.330
And he gave it to me.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.320
And I ran him down.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:30.840
I ran him down.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.150
He's got zero miles in his
account right now.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.570
Because I wanted to fly around
the world for free.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.340
And I told that story at the
Barclays Asia Forum.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.810
And all these Barclays
bankers said, we're

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:40.610
competitive with Goldman.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.230
We're going to compete
mile for mile.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.355
Every time they donate a mile,
we're going to donate a mile.

00:35:44.355 --> 00:35:45.970
Well, then we needed
hotel rooms.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:47.030
Because you don't want
to just fly for free.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.980
You want to stay for free.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.460
So Nicky from our team in San
Francisco, they closed a deal,

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:55.960
Cindy and Nicky closed a deal,
150 free room nights from

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.700
Hilton, per year.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.360
But we needed office space where
we raise money, Tokyo,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.050
London, Sydney, Hong Kong.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.250
Those are expensive cities
to open offices in.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.040
Credit Suisse said fine, we're
just going to give you some

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:06.940
desk space.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.670
And so they're are landlord.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.750
We don't pay a cent.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.090
Actually, they pay us every
year through a grant.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.400
So we get a grant every year,
but also we get-- and that's

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.840
kind of what I said, the time,
treasure, talent, maybe one of

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.760
your talents here in this room
is figuring out how to help us

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.840
to save money.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.750
This year, Lenovo has a deal
with Room to Read.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.940
They're giving us 500 laptops.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.900
So every single employee around
the world will have a

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.675
brand new laptop.

00:36:29.675 --> 00:36:30.910
Now, think about that
for a second.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:35.020
At $1,000 plus a laptop, every
laptop represents four years

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.190
of a girl's education.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.480
So in a certain sense, I'm
really lucky that I grew up

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.660
with parents who were like
on a really tight budget.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.740
Because my parents always taught
me to make the dollar

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.720
go as far as possible.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.160
And there's so many examples in
the book of how we do that.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.300
So no matter what your cause
or what your passion,

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.570
definitely read that chapter
and share it with

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:51.990
boards you're on.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:55.340
Because there's so many ways the
nonprofit world can save

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.110
money on overhead so that more
money goes to the programs.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.660
They just have to build that
muscle of constantly asking

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.150
people for favors.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.180
How many miles do you
have by the way?

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:06.300
AUDIENCE: SUSAN WOJCICKI:
Yeah.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.700
We discussed actually
my miles.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:09.500
Yeah.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.090
He's very true to his word.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:12.840
And when we meant, that
was one the questions.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.330
So yes, so we're working on him
donating some of my miles.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.182
I have a lot.

00:37:19.182 --> 00:37:20.535
JOHN WOOD: Good.

00:37:20.535 --> 00:37:21.230
Which airline?

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.214
No, I'm kidding.

00:37:23.214 --> 00:37:24.340
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Yes I do.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.800
American.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.700
JOHN WOOD: Actually, I told that
story once in Hong Kong.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.550
And somebody in the audience
was like--

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.660
in Hong Kong, they're flying on
Cathay and they're flying

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.620
on Singapore Airlines.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.830
And someone goes oh my God, he
had to fly 3 million miles on

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.080
American Airlines.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.770
SUSAN WOJCICKI: I think
other people

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.770
here have a few questions.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.810
So I don't want to be a hog.

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:50.280
We have a microphone.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.840
AUDIENCE: Hey, I just had
a quick question.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.380
Well, no.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.515
I have several questions that
kind of interrelate.

00:37:55.515 --> 00:37:58.470
The first being who
are these teachers

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.620
that are in your school?

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.060
Were they kind of in the
community before, were they

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.120
trained as teachers, or are they
just coming out of grade

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.500
12, which is very
often the case.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.230
And then also--

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.380
JOHN WOOD: Can I answer
that question first?

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.710
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Yeah, sure.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.550
JOHN WOOD: I only have
so much brain power.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:16.970
So one of gating criteria for
countries that we work in,

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:21.220
along with provinces or
districts within a country, is

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.940
does the ministry of education
have its act together in terms

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.020
of teacher training colleges?

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.290
And are there enough trained
teachers coming out that we'll

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.550
be able to actually put them
into the schools and will the

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:33.380
government actually pay those
teacher salaries?

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.520
Because everything we do is
under tripartite agreement

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.710
where Room to Read helps to
build the school, the

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.260
community donates the labor, but
the ministry of education

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.530
actually supplies the teachers
and pays their ongoing salary.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.550
So for us, the minister of
education partnership is a

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.000
really critical part
of what we do.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.920
Now, we also then do additional
workforce

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.460
development--

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.770
I don't like to use the
word training--

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.670
but kind of professional
development for teachers.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.980
So we actually work with them on
how do you run an effective

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.940
library, how do you get kids
in habit of reading, how do

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.700
you teach kids to decode words,
how do you teach kids

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.490
to learn script like Khmer?

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.540
So we're doing a lot of literacy
training, writing

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.310
training, habit of reading and
librarian training also kind

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:15.640
of top up the skills those
teachers have.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:15.950
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:18.300
I think that answered several
of my questions too.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.930
But in addition to that--

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.910
so you're working mainly with
government schools.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.880
And I know at least in Zambia,
I have first-hand hand with a

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.070
lot of community schools, which
are on the rise and

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:33.570
basically cost way less than
government schools.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:37.880
But you get more teachers that
are coming out of grade 12.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.680
You get more undertrained
teachers that don't

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.030
necessarily get paid enough to
have the motivation to teach

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.500
as well or to be as dedicated
to their students.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.120
So do you see kind of like a
movement in that direction for

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.406
Room to Read or is that
on the horizon?

00:39:55.406 --> 00:39:56.100
JOHN WOOD: Not really.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.700
Because I've done as much
study as I can.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.640
And I read James Tooley's book
and Fernando Reimers from

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.440
Harvard Graduate School of
Education sits in our board.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.520
So we've kind of looked
at all this stuff.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.540
But the problem with the kind
of the community school

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.570
approach that's happening in
developing world is there

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.550
hasn't really been any
organization--

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.790
and if I'm wrong, please
tell me and email me--

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.550
but that's actually scaled
in a significant way.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:19.440
So you have a lot of this little
community run schools,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.670
but almost none of them have
actually scaled beyond a

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.610
certain number of locations.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.040
And what we're about at Room to
Read is really about scale,

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.370
but scale with quality.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:29.930
But also to be sustainable.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.190
And the only way these schools
will be sustainable, in our

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.600
experience, in the long run,
is that the community is

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.550
signed up to run them, but the
government is also signed up

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:38.800
to continue to support them.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.420
So as you get more students
coming in and

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.560
you need more teachers--

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.060
so our investors don't have to
have the ongoing costs of

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.750
paying the teachers.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:46.830
The government is actually
building

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.720
that into their budget.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.220
And that lets us actually
leverage that local

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.830
government's money.

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.180
AUDIENCE: So I guess one of my
questions was kind of around--

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.950
well, one of the things that
struck me in reading the first

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:59.515
book was how important having
a focus on results was.

00:40:59.515 --> 00:41:02.012
You got a lot of the results,
you published them in your

00:41:02.012 --> 00:41:04.750
email signature, and you
made it very prominent.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.390
And in kind of looking at a lot
of the other nonprofits,

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.500
it seems that one of things
that helped you succeed

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.350
tremendously was your first-time
business experience

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.960
and then translating that
focus on results and

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.970
efficiency to the
nonprofit world.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.560
For a lot of the nonprofits that
are kind of focusing on

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.000
efficiency gains and trying
to kind of improve their

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.090
operations, do you think it's
as easy to help those

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.070
organizations improve, as just
having more business oriented

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.615
people apply their knowledge to
the nonprofit world or do

00:41:33.615 --> 00:41:35.640
you think there's more of
a systematic shift?

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.540
You talked a little bit about

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.260
expenditures and some of those--

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.000
JOHN WOOD: OK.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.120
Can you rephrase?

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:41.195
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Yeah.

00:41:41.195 --> 00:41:45.810
So the question was basically
you'd have a lot of success

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.340
because of being very data
driven and from the experience

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.300
that you've had coming from
the business world.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.495
And so the question was--

00:41:53.495 --> 00:41:55.990
AUDIENCE: It's a little bit
about do you think that you

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:57.370
need more people from
the business world?

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:58.680
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Do you need more
people from the business

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:03.170
world in order to have
nonprofits be able to benefit

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.970
from some of those
business skills?

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:05.790
JOHN WOOD: I think it helps.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.375
But I should also give like full
credit for the fact that

00:42:08.375 --> 00:42:11.660
a lot of our staff have
trained in education.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.670
And you can't have too
many business people.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.480
But you have to have people who
actually have trained as

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.600
educators, who have trained and
have pedagogical ideas,

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.810
who have trained about what are
the issues for girls and

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:21.860
women to keep them in school.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:26.210
So too many business people
probably would be a bad idea.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.340
But I think too few is
also a bad idea.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.310
So my hope is that more and more
people may as well get in

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:31.910
and say, OK, we're going
to make sure

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:33.050
that we actually have--

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.530
and a lot of this stiff the
business people do is like the

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:36.610
boring stuff, right?

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.040
It's like we have to have
an audit committee.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.280
I haven't put you
to sleep yet.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.940
But you have to have an audit
committee because you have to

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:43.530
audit early.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:44.510
You have to audit often.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:45.660
If there's financial
malfeasance,

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.390
you got to find it.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.120
You got to cut it off
at the source.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.410
And so there's a lot of stuff
that I think business leaders

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.860
can do in the nonprofit space
that will help the whole

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:54.490
sector to be more efficient.

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:57.010
And I think the more efficient
the sector is, I think

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.000
the pie will grow.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.530
Because if people see inspiring
examples, and it

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:03.560
could be Kiva, it could be
charity, water, it could be

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.160
Room to Read, as people see
those things that work, I

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.375
think more money gets
attracted in.

00:43:08.375 --> 00:43:11.950
The ones that don't work very
well are doing in a disservice

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:14.140
to the rest of us because that
makes it too easy for the

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.180
cynics to be cynical, if they
see one more nonprofit that's

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.500
kind of playing hanky panky
with their books.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.700
So I think there's definitely
a role for

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.100
more business people.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.310
But also, I think we just can't
forget the fact that you

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.020
also need people who have
actually trained.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.200
Like, I'm not an educator.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.515
So we better have a lot of
those in our team or else

00:43:30.515 --> 00:43:32.550
we're in trouble.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.510
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Next question?

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:37.030
AUDIENCE: So kind of going off
of that, I think the beautiful

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:39.160
thing is that there's tons and
tons of nonprofits out there

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.470
kind of working towards
a great mission.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.170
But sometimes they can
overlap and work

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:44.100
towards the same mission.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.550
So what do you feel kind of
separated Room to Read to

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:49.830
allow you to scale, to kind
of stand out and really be

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:52.060
successful compared to some
people that are also working

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.190
towards literacy?

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:55.310
JOHN WOOD: Yeah, well actually
I can play on that question

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:58.550
because a lot of our success at
Room to Read is because we

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:02.430
have found really clever ways
to partner with other NGOs.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:05.150
I think there's way too much
reinvention of the wheel in

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.860
this sector.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:10.800
There's 1,2 million NGOs
registered in America alone.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.030
And like 90% of them run on
budgets of less than a quarter

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.340
million dollars a year.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.223
So think about the duplication
there, that everyone of them

00:44:17.223 --> 00:44:19.830
needs to balance their bank
statement, and publish an

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.670
annual report, and
have a website.

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:24.080
And I think many times that NGOs
find smart ways to work

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.840
together, you can get
a lot more done.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.640
I'll give you just two quick
examples of that.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:34.460
When Room to Read launched in
Uttarakhand in northern India,

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.810
there is a group called CHIRAG,
the Central Himalayan

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:38.210
Rural Action Group.

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.620
They had opened over
100 schools.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.410
But none of their schools had
libraries or very few of their

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.590
schools had functioning
libraries.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:45.230
So we said great.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.090
This is fantastic.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.570
You've put down these schools
that might have cost $40,000

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.340
to $50,000 to build.

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.950
On a $5,000 budget we can come
in and put in the library and

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.810
make your schools
more effective.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.190
Another one, how many you have
heard of the "Girl Rising"

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.100
film that's coming
out next month?

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.620
So we are one of the
participants in "Girl Rising."

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.470
And in this film they profile
a girl named Suma, who was

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.550
formerly a household
slave in Nepal.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.250
They have this terrible
oppressive system called the

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:12.620
Kamlari system where lower
caste girls are sold into

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.520
indentured servitude to be
household servants for the

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.490
middle class.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:20.110
Their parents get a payment
of like $20 per year, just

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:21.840
sickening to me.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.050
But these girls deserved
to be freed.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.580
Well, we wanted to be part
of that because there's a

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:30.160
movement now to say that's a
barbaric 9th century practice.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.470
Let's get beyond it.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.550
But we don't know
how to do that.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.870
But thankfully there's a group
in Nepal called the Nepalese

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:36.520
Youth Opportunity Foundation.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.265
Som Paneru runs it.

00:45:37.265 --> 00:45:39.130
A fantastic guy, I've
known for years.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:40.180
They know how to do it.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.730
So they went out and agitated
they started freeing these

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.190
girls, 100, 200, 300, 400.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:46.580
Well, what do you do with
the nine-year-olds or

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.730
ten-year-olds that weren't
going to school?

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:49.060
Well, she wants to
go to school.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:49.900
We better get in school.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.050
So we based partnership, where
they free, we educate.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.110
It's a bit more complicated
that that.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.110
But let's just keep it simple.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:57.340
They free, we educate.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.970
We went out and I pitched
a banker at Barclays.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.690
He said my wife and I will fund
every single girl you can

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:03.200
get in that.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.620
Don't stop at 400, don't stop
at 500, don't stop at 600.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.920
Today, over 700 girls have
been free through that

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.850
partnership.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.100
So NYF frees them, Room
to Read educates them.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.340
And one of the girls, Suma, who
will be featured in the

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:19.280
"Girl Rising" film, just about
over a year ago, there was a

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.250
film that was shot, the "Girl
Rising" film, and got shown to

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.730
Tina Brown who runs the Women
in the World Conference.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.025
And in the film, Suma was
singing a song she wrote to

00:46:27.025 --> 00:46:30.890
her parents to say, why do you
educate your sons, but oppress

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:31.950
your daughters?

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.140
And the song was expressing to
her parents her feelings about

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.580
don't ever do this
to me again.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.656
Well, Tina Brown saw the film,
or somebody on Tina's staff, I

00:46:39.656 --> 00:46:41.790
don't know, saw the film and
said we need to Suma to come

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:45.240
to New York and sing her song to
open the Women in the World

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.830
Conference.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:47.750
It was incredible.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.080
She sang in Nepalese.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.270
There were the supertitles,
like in the opera.

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.100
She brought down the house.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.355
Well then somebody from the
State Department saw it and

00:46:55.355 --> 00:46:58.560
said well, Secretary Clinton's
staff has suggested that Suma

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.690
should come back and end the
conference on the same note,

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:03.430
in re-sing that song.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.620
So in our office in New York,
where I work out of, we have

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.760
seen these photos of Suma, who
3 and 1/2 years ago was a

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.080
household slave.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.280
And here she is with Meryl
Streep, here she is with

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.260
Chelsea Clinton, here she is
with Sheryl Sandberg, here she

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.700
is with Hillary Clinton.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.830
And I just love that, just
like that Girus,

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:21.840
here you've got Suma.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.780
That's the potential
these kids have to

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.080
just blow us all away.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.000
So anyway, long answer
to a short question.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.100
But that's I think the
power of NGOs finding

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.810
ways to work together.

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:34.420
AUDIENCE: You touched on this in
your answer just now about

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.260
slavery in Nepal.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.110
But I'm curious to hear how you
deal with cultural issues

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.750
whereby, particularly in terms
of women, where they are

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.450
discouraged from learning,
they are discouraged from

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.930
going to school, they're
discouraged from being

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:49.620
involved in public life, how
you partner, or how you

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.780
overcome some of those
challenges, particularly where

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.940
there is violence directed
against those who are trying

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.250
to buck this trend?

00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:57.520
JOHN WOOD: Yeah.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.410
I think the key thing for us
is that some of the heroic

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.660
employees at Room to Read
are local women.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.260
Their titles are Social
Mobilizes.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.670
And they're well-educated
Zambian women, Tanzanian

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:09.920
women, Nepalese women,
and Cambodian women.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.580
And that's exactly
what they do.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:11.520
They socially mobilize.

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.760
They go out, they kind of
agitate in the community.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.080
They find out what are the
barriers to education?

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.590
But many times we've found the
barriers are not really

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:19.410
attitudinal.

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.020
Many times we've found the
barriers are actually

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.420
financial, which is great
because that's a really easy

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.700
problem to solve.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.160
There's other barriers.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.510
Our team in India was working in
a certain province where a

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:34.690
number of districts, they
couldn't find almost any girls

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.880
who had ever made it
past grade nine.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.720
And they thought originally well
this might be some kind

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.870
of like cultural thing.

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.060
But it actually wasn't.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.660
It was a Muslim community.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.680
And the parents didn't feel
comfortable sending their

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.050
daughters to a school, the
high school, because they

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.690
didn't have any female
teachers.

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:50.210
And they didn't want their
daughters to be in a place

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:51.270
without female teachers.

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:52.960
Well again, that's an easy
problem to solve.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.350
Our team went to the ministry of
education and said we need

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.350
to put female teachers
in these schools.

00:48:57.350 --> 00:49:00.126
Because if we do, the girls
will stay in 9, 10,

00:49:00.126 --> 00:49:01.580
11, and grade 12.

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.750
And within a year, over 500
girls in all these different

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:08.640
villages were now enrolled
in grades 9 and 10.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.450
I tell a story in a book about,
just really quickly,

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.760
about Reema Shrestha, one
of our girls' education

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.190
[INAUDIBLE] officers in Nepal.

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:18.800
In 2008, we were on
a visit with her.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.570
And I said Reema, what's good
about Room to Read in Nepal,

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:22.670
what's bad about Room
to Read in Nepal?

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.830
And she said John, I was
so excited in January.

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:26.140
I got our budget approved.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.660
I was told that we could
add 500 girls to the

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.440
program this year.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.500
She thought wow, 500
lives changed.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.610
What a humongous number.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:34.780
She was so excited.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.290
And she went out, and through
our network of NGO partners,

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.770
to our government partners, and

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.050
said we have 500 positions.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:46.450
She had 4,000 applications
within a month.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.740
And she said John, do you know
it feels like to turn down

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.750
3,500 girls?

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.290
And I said, do you know what
it makes me feel like, it

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:53.330
makes me feel like a failure.

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.250
Because you should not be in the
business Reema of saying

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.330
no or even not yet.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.010
You should be in the business
of saying yes.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.340
And now, I end on that note
because I think that yes is a

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.240
beautiful word.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.730
And I would like to invite all
of you-- really, I go back to

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:05.440
the thing I said earlier.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.460
I don't want to be the leader
of an organization.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.740
I want to be one of
many, many, many

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.240
leaders of a global movement.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.490
And so I do hope that all of
you will get involved and

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:15.070
hopefully join us.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.185
And if you want to hear a good
story about how we choose the

00:50:17.185 --> 00:50:18.940
name Room to Read, I know we're
out of time, but grab

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.830
[? Paul Hare. ?]

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:22.470
because he hosted a dinner party
at which several bottles

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.890
of wine and several smart
friends came together.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:26.980
And that's how we came
up with the brand.

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.710
If you've not read "Leaving
Microsoft to Change the

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:30.850
World," there actually a little
vignette called the

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:33.100
Name Game, which is all
about Paul and Susan

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:33.960
hosting this party.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.730
And I was proposing we call the
organization Books Ahoy,

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.990
because we were like sending
books overseas.

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:43.890
And Paul convinced me that
the wrong [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:44.930
So again, thank you.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:46.040
I know how busy you are,
so you being here.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.370
SUSAN WOJCICKI: No,
thank you Paul.

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:48.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:49.620
and Paul.

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:50.870
Thank you for coming.
