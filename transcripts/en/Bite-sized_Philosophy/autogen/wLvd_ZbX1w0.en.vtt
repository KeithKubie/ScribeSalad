00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 It is not a coincidence that the Western individual is intuitive 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.820
 A person has been unfairly hanged on a cross and tortured 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.230
 "It's like ..." Yes 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.940
 "Right" 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 "!exactly" 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.130
 So what do you do about it? 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.270
 Okay 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.300
 I thought about it for a long time too 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.740
 It's like ... well you do not pile up with crowds 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.010
 Because all it does is to allow you to be as horribly as you can imagine and suffer through nothing 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.160
 This is a bad idea 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 So what about not doing it 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.140
 "Well, there's a deep idea in the West too, it's like" pick up your damned suffering and bear it 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.740
 Try to be a good person in order not to make it worse 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.960
 this is the truth 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.670
 I read a lot about the terrible things people did to each other 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.530
 You can not even imagine it 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 Very awesome 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.480
 So you do not want to be someone like that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.330
 Now do you have a reason to be? Yeah 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.550
 You have so many reasons, my God there are so many reasons to be very upset because of you 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.500
 Everyone you know will die 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.240
 You know, you too 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.150
 There will always be an amount of pain and much of it will be unfair 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.200
 "It's like" Yeah, no wonder you're upset "It's like" act out and see what happens 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.480
 You make everything you complain about 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.700
 The worst is without limits 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.500
 There is this idea that hell hole is not her decision 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.840
 Because no matter how bad it is, there is a stupid son of a bitch like you can find a way to make it much worse 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 "So you think" What do you do about it? 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.520
 Well accept it, this is what life is, it is suffering 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.380
 This is what the religious have always said: life is suffering 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.930
 Yes really 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.490
 So, who wants to admit it? Well, just think about the subject then what to do with that suffering 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.770
 Try reducing them 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.400
 Start with yourself 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.270
 How useful are you? 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.950
 You own yourself with Christ, so when your father dies, you will not be far away in the corner 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.110
 While you can help plan the funeral and you can stand firm so people can count on you 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.550
 Is it better than being a victim of a sample? Of course you are a victim 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 Rabah, for sure 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.960
 ..Take yourself, and perhaps Tamtlk yourself then know how to do it 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.410
 You know what your speech is, if you have to admit it 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.670
 You know there are a few things you can improve a bit 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.800
 You may even be able to arrange your current situation 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.140
 So maybe make yourself shine a little and then your eyes will open slightly 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.680
 And then you can make yourself shine more and then perhaps you can gather your family again 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:55.090
 Instead of being the embryos of hatred, hatred, and nepotism that are governed by Christmas 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.100
 So when you fix yourself a bit, be humble, because .. Learn, my God, that you are a "reformer and a reformer" if there is such a thing 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.300
 Then you have to find a way to solve ... well 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.120
 Can you find a way to reconcile with your foolish brother? 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.410
 How the hell will you deal with it? 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.390
 And then perhaps you reach something and start your family to play its role in some way 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.820
 "Well ... that somehow removed some of the suffering," he said, although he played down the chances of vengeful revenge 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.850
 This kind of pain is so annoying that after a few gatherings of your family 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.480
 And be a little consistent, at least a little because you did something difficult 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.930
 Which is actually difficult, you are more wiser 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.570
 So maybe you can try and try away from the family and try to change some small things without destroying them 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.520
 Our society is complex, and we teach our students that they can simply reform it 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.020
 "It's like" I go and fix a military helicopter and see where it will go 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.480
 "It's like .. you'll act like a chimpanzee with a big screwdriver." Look, it's better 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.170
 The answer is not that it is not the best, complicated stuff and fixing things is very difficult 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.730
 You have to act as a golden tool to fix things 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.520
 And you are not 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.730
 So this is the other message from the West 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.300
 They are like: How do you overcome the suffering of life? 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.770
 I'm not saying it's just a West letter 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.600
 How can the suffering of life be overcome? Be a better person 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.110
 So do it well, that's hard 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.280
 Requires responsibility. I think if you tell someone you want a meaningful life? 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.740
 Everything you do makes a difference 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.780
 This is the definition of meaningful life everything you do makes a difference 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.060
 You must carry it with you 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.320
 Or do you want to completely forget about the theme of meaning 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.600
 Then you do not have any responsibility, because who may matter? You can go around life as you want 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.640
 Satisfactory to reckless desires, it may be of benefit 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.320
 And be stuck in the mean but without having any responsibilities which one you want? 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.680
 "Well, ask yourself" Whom are you seeking? 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:14.810
 And you will quickly find that it is not the majority of your soul that is seeking all the subject matter because .. see what you should do to do so 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.640
 You have to take the fact that life is suffering you have to face yourself in this way 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.920
 Well that's tough, it's amazing that people can even do it 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.280
 I am amazed every day when I'm out and I do not find riots and fire in everything 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.510
 It is possible .. God .. Talk to people and be like 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.550
 I know someone who has been involved in a motorcycle accident 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.550
 The accident had actually wrecked him, and his work was on electrical wires 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.320
 He worked with someone with paralysis 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:54.030
 They had complementary to the palaces, as two of them can do one person's work so they are there to repair electricity poles in the cold cold 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.840
 Despite the fact that one of them was three quarters broken by the bike accident and the other has paralysis paralysis 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:05.010
 This is how our civilization goes, there are all these people who are destroyed 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.010
 They have problems you can not believe 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.780
 They go to work, do things they do not like and even see, the lights are on 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.910
 God, it is a miracle 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:22.160
 It's a miracle, we are very naive, college students, postmodern types, very reluctant 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.470
 They do not know that they are surrounded by a miracle to sample it as a miracle how all these things work 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:36.570
 You, all the crazy chimpanzees who do not know each other, can sit here together in the same room, soaring for two hours without tearing each other apart. 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.620
 Because that's what chimpanzees do 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.990
 And therefore 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.480
 Anyway, so 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.540
 what happened? Well, I've done some videos 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.720
 I got to the heart of some things, at least to the extent that I can say so I told you what is the core 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.850
 I had this idea about what to do about it and that is not my idea .. not my idea 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.170
 It is a very old old fashioned idea very very much older than Christianity 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.100
 It is ancient, it is the oldest story of mankind 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.500
 Rank and own yourself 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.950
 Overcome your suffering, see if you can be somehow a hero 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.650
 Make suffering in the world less 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.320
 Well, this is way forward as far as I can tell if there is any way forward 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.620
 Nothing is under attack by the postmodernists 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.030
 So be aware that they know exactly what they are doing and know exactly why they are doing it
