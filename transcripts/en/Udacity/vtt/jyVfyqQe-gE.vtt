00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.650
It recommends picking a major or

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.610
primary color that is representative
of your app's branding or personality.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.910
You can use this color in large
blocks such as this toolbar

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.380
to make your app instantly recognizable.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.020
For example,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.810
YouTube's primary color would be red or
inbox's color would be blue.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.420
Next, you pick an accent color.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.930
This is a brighter, more saturated color
designed to draw attention to certain

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.330
elements, such as
a floating action button.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.650
Two colors alone may not be enough
range to create your whole UI, so

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.270
we then break these down into lightness
ranges to build out your palette.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.840
Here's an example of Material's
light blue color swatch.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.380
Material assigns numerical
values to this range,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.430
where lighter shades have a lower number
and darker shades have a higher number.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.800
These numbers themselves don't mean
anything intrinsically, but they're

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.170
useful terminology when discussing
when to use a particular tint.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.204
We calibrate our lightness scale on your
primary color calling it the 500 shade.

00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:07.243
Then darker shades have higher numbers,
like 700 or 900.

00:01:07.243 --> 00:01:09.181
And lighter shades have lower numbers.

00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:11.839
We use an A prefix for those accent,

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:15.659
those more saturated colors
that we talked about.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.923
Such as, light blue A200.

00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:21.218
Now we recommend that you stick
to three hues of your primary and

00:01:21.218 --> 00:01:25.210
one accent color to keep your
palette simple, but versatile.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.550
For example,
let's create the palette for

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.150
an app which has an indigo personality.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.780
I'll pick indigo 500 shade
as my primary color.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.055
And then grab the indigo 700 and
300 shades for complementary areas.

00:01:39.055 --> 00:01:44.625
Next, I'll pick pink A200 as a hot
accent color for contrasting elements.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:48.215
Let's apply our shiny
new palette to our app.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:52.477
We can use the primary color in blocks
of your UI like extended toolbars,

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.277
to embed our personality.

00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:57.547
Next, we could apply the 700
shade to the status bar to give

00:01:57.547 --> 00:02:00.327
it contrast against the toolbar.

00:02:00.327 --> 00:02:04.507
And then the 300 shade for a block of
secondary information for example.

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:07.817
Finally, we'll use the accent color
on elements you want call out,

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:12.710
such as the fab, on toggles or
perhaps a focused text field.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.220
Material provides a hand-tuned pallet of
colors that you can use in your apps,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.320
and are a great starting point if
you don't have an existing brand.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.260
If you do, however, then you absolutely
should use your own brand colors.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.920
But, applying the Material
system of accents and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.170
shades helps to work this into your UI.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.070
If you have a primary color, but
no accent, then you can use color fairy,

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.740
such as complimentary colors
to help you pick one.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.370
There's some great tools online.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.570
This is an example from color.adobe.com.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.367
If you really want a monochromatic
palate, so just one color in there,

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:49.421
it's fine to just use just
shades of your primary color.

00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:53.580
But then you're going to lose the
ability to highlight certain elements.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.200
A quick tip is that you'll likely
use your accent color close to or

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.230
on top of your primary color.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.790
So, for example,
the fab on top of this toolbar here.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.400
So you want to make sure you pick
colors that have enough contrast.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.680
So this one would get a little bit lost.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.610
So that's the essence of working
with color in Material Design.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.650
This is the most powerful, immersive and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.460
completely adaptable
to your application.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.630
So no matter if your app is whimsical or

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.610
serious, it's easy to work
with color to express that.
