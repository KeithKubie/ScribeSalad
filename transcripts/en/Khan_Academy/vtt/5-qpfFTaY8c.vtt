00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.045
- [Instructor] In a previous video

00:00:02.045 --> 00:00:05.386
we started to get an
intuition for rate curves

00:00:05.386 --> 00:00:08.334
and what the area under
a rate curve represents.

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:10.685
So, for example, this rate curve,

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:13.266
this might represent a speed of a car

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:17.831
and how a speed of a car is
changing with respect to time.

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:20.683
And so this shows us that our
rate is actually changing,

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:23.202
this isn't distance as function of time,

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:24.886
this is rate as a function of time.

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:26.939
So, this looks like car is accelerating.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.049
At time one it is going
ten meters per second

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:32.752
and at time five, let's
assume that all of these

00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:35.557
are in seconds, so at five seconds,

00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:38.045
it is going 20 meters per second.

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:40.394
So, it is is accelerating.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:43.599
Now the relationship between
the rate function and the area,

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:45.863
is that if we're able
to figure out this area,

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:49.681
then that is the change
in distance of the car.

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:53.848
So rate or speed in this case
is distance per unit time,

00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:57.781
if we're able to figure out
the area under that curve,

00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:01.215
it will actually give us
our change in distance,

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:03.665
from time one to time five.

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:05.688
It won't tell us our total distance,

00:01:05.688 --> 00:01:08.097
cause we won't know what
happens before time one,

00:01:08.097 --> 00:01:10.657
if we're not concerned with that area.

00:01:10.657 --> 00:01:14.470
And the intuition for that,
it's a little bit easier

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.496
if you're dealing with rectangles.

00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:18.216
But just think about this,
let's make a rectangle

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:21.823
that looks like a pretty good
approximation for the area,

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:26.799
let's say from time one to
time two right over here.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.939
Well what is this area from
the rectangle represent?

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.784
To figure out the area we
would multiply one second,

00:01:32.784 --> 00:01:36.196
that would be the width
here, times roughly,

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.672
looks like about ten meters per second.

00:01:38.672 --> 00:01:41.370
And so the units here would
be ten meters per second,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.290
times on second, or ten meters.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.228
And we know from early
physics or even before,

00:01:47.228 --> 00:01:49.960
that if you multiply a rate times time,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.123
or a speed times a time,
you're gonna get a distance.

00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:55.685
And so the unit here is in distance,

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:59.182
as you can see, this area
is going to represent,

00:01:59.182 --> 00:02:02.603
it's gonna be an approximation
for the distance traveled.

00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:05.924
And so, if you wanted
to get an exact version,

00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:09.008
or an exact number for
the distance traveled.

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:12.006
You would get the exact
area under the curve.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.904
And we have a notation for that.

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:17.523
If you want the exact area
under the curve right over here,

00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:20.040
we use definite integral notation.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.473
This area right over here,

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:23.829
we can denote as a definite integral

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.496
from one to five, of R of t, dt.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.047
And once again, what does this represent?

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:33.551
In this case when our rate is speed?

00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:36.125
This represents this
whole expression reprsents

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:39.958
our change in distance
from t is equal to one,

00:02:45.816 --> 00:02:47.649
to t is equal to five.

00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:52.149
Now with that context, let's
actually try to do an example

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.997
problem, the type that you
might see on Khan Academy.

00:02:55.997 --> 00:02:58.767
So, this right over here tells us,

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:02.510
Eden walked at a rate of r
of t kilometers per hour,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.100
where t is the time in hours.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.730
Okay, so t is in hours.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.448
What does the integral,
the definite integral

00:03:09.448 --> 00:03:12.710
from two to three of r
of t dt equals six mean?

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.668
So before I even look at these choices,

00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:17.620
this is saying, so this is
going from t equals two hours

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.806
to t equals three hours and
it's essentially the area

00:03:20.806 --> 00:03:23.376
under the rate curve and here the rate is,

00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:24.714
we're talking about a speed.

00:03:24.714 --> 00:03:29.510
Eden is walking at a certain
number of kilometers per hour.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.683
So what this means,
that from time two hours

00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:36.850
to time three hours, Eden
walked an extra six kilometers.

00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:41.175
So, let's see which of
these choices match that.

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:44.258
Eden walked six kilometers each hour?

00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:48.288
It does tell us from time two to three,

00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:51.656
Eden walked six kilometers,
but it doesn't mean,

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:55.823
but we don't know what happened
from time zero to time one,

00:03:56.948 --> 00:03:59.155
or from time one to time two.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.740
So I would rule this out.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.794
Eden walked six kilometers in three hours.

00:04:04.794 --> 00:04:07.142
So this is a common misconception,

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:10.153
people will look at the top bound

00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:13.649
and say okay, this area represented
by the definite integral

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.738
this tells us how far in total

00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:18.538
we have walked up until that point.

00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:20.992
That is not what this represents.

00:04:20.992 --> 00:04:23.866
This represents the change in distance

00:04:23.866 --> 00:04:26.433
from time two to time three.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.090
So, I'll rule that out.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.413
Eden walked six kilometers
during the third hour.

00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:33.473
Yes, that's what we've been talking about.

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:38.189
From time equal two hours
to time equal three hours,

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.585
Eden walked six kilometers
and you could view that

00:04:40.585 --> 00:04:44.500
as the third hour, going
from time two to time three.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.066
Eden's rate increased by
six kilometers per hour

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:50.850
between hours two and three.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.485
So let's be very clear,
this right over here,

00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:58.665
this isn't a rate, this is
the area under the rate curve,

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:01.160
this is what this definite
integral is representing.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.248
And so this isn't telling
us about our rate changing,

00:05:04.248 --> 00:05:07.819
this is telling us how does
the thing that the rate

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.005
is measuring the change
of, how does that change

00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:12.812
from time two to time three?

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:15.625
So we would rule that out as well.
