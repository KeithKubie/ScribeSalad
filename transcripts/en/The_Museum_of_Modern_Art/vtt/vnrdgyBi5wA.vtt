00:00:03.096 --> 00:00:05.449
- Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life

00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:08.878
was made in 1913,
directed by Mack Sennett,

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:11.586
and is your quintessential chase film.

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:15.882
This film has every
single comedy chase trope

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.756
that you could ever want.

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:21.385
It has a villain with
a dastardly mustache.

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:23.017
It has a very beautiful young woman

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:24.868
who is tied to train tracks.

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:27.529
It has Keystone Cops on a handcart

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.703
that you often see in these films.

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:33.342
And it also has, at
that time, a celebrity,

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:36.919
Barney Oldfield, who was
the first man to ever

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:40.805
race a car at 60 miles
an hour in an oval lap.

00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:43.775
So you have these three modes of action

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:45.009
occurring all at once:

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.384
the handcart, the
locomotive that is racing

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:51.762
towards the same spot,
and Barney in the car.

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:54.246
And it's really quite
breathtaking to watch

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:56.386
and see who will get there first.

00:00:56.986 --> 00:00:58.329
Although it's telling what seems to be

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.880
an old-fashioned story,
it's also telling a story

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.270
that's all about speed
and movement and motion.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.140
And I kept thinking
about Italian futurism.

00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:12.652
The Italian futurists were
very interested in dynamism,

00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:14.152
movement of all kinds, whether it be

00:01:14.152 --> 00:01:16.097
the movement of a train in the city,

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:18.820
a gull flying through the sky,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.415
or the Boccioni painting
of the Soccer Player.

00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:26.380
Translate that static
movement from the canvas

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.522
to a film like Barney
Oldfield, and you have this

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:34.060
interrelationship of
futurism to the cinema.

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:37.750
Both deal with these
complex notions of movement.
