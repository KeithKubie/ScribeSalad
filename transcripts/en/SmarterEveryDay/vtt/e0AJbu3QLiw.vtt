00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:01.195
Hey it's me Destin,

00:00:01.195 --> 00:00:02.409
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:03.640
This is my buddy Ben,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.823
and he got a new toy,

00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:06.447
so we're gonna try to shoot with this.

00:00:06.447 --> 00:00:07.942
Just because we want to try it.

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:08.806
Show em what it does.

00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:10.266
Do I have to stand right here?

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:10.885
(Ben) Yes.

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:11.747
OK, here we go.

00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:13.956
Alright so today on Smarter Every Day

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:16.509
I am gonna tell you how I determined my cologne,

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:17.673
my man smell.

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:20.484
And the way I did it was using the scientific method

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:22.523
but the reason I did it is pretty interesting.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:25.264
You know that smell is linked to memory.

00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:27.823
So I used to squirrel hunt here and it smells

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:29.497
like childhood to me, it's pretty interesting.

00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:31.985
You probably have things like that in your life.

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:33.797
Like honeysuckles might remind you of your grandmother

00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:34.704
or something like that.

00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:36.680
So today on Smarter Every Day I'm gonna show you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.811
how I selected that cologne, because after all

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:42.521
I wanted to be really desirable for my wife right?

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.146
Here we go. Hypothesis.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.048
If people like different smells, I should be able to

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:52.152
test scientifically to determine the optimum smell

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:55.003
for my wife, which I can then wear consistently

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.448
and hopefully trigger memories about me when I'm not around.

00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:00.978
But first we've got to figure out how to set up this experiment.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.357
I searched the internet trying to find out which colognes

00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:05.106
women seem to prefer most.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.403
I Googled the popular brands but realized quickly

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:09.707
that this was influenced by marketing, so instead

00:01:09.707 --> 00:01:12.479
I went to Two X to try to get opinions of women

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.976
talking to other women about their men.

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:16.541
This gave me some good preliminary data.

00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.037
But then I went to the Smarter Every Day Facebook page

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:21.586
and asked everyone on there which colognes they preferred.

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:23.961
This is where I started to see some clear front runners,

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:26.235
which made me wonder if I really wanted to smell like

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:27.732
every other man in the world.

00:01:27.732 --> 00:01:30.052
There were over 300 unique responses submitted

00:01:30.052 --> 00:01:31.794
by 800 different comments.

00:01:31.794 --> 00:01:35.033
Clearly I can't afford a bottle of each of these colognes.

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.138
If you've ever looked at how much these things cost

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:40.177
you'd know that this experiment is about to get expensive.

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:42.695
I was surprised to find that there are web sites that buy

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:44.924
huge bottle of name brand cologne and divide them up

00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:49.713
into smaller samples, but 200 colognes is still way too many to try.

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:53.169
So I asked my friend Will Leahy to compile all this survey data

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:55.092
up together into one chart.

00:01:55.092 --> 00:01:58.821
Clearly women respond well to the smells on the left side of this chart,

00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:01.799
so keeping that in mind, obviously I want to get a larger sample

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.740
of the fragrances on that side.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.972
However I realized that this could also mean that these brands are

00:02:06.972 --> 00:02:08.683
simply marketed more effectively.

00:02:08.683 --> 00:02:12.272
So to keep things fair I chose several colognes that weren't as popular.

00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:14.234
Once I cut away the less interesting candidates

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.145
I narrowed it down to a manageable size that I felt like I could test

00:02:17.145 --> 00:02:20.218
over a six month period, and here they are.

00:02:20.218 --> 00:02:22.064
There's a broad spectrum represented here.

00:02:22.064 --> 00:02:24.165
There's super expensive stuff, cheap stuff,

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:26.202
popular stuff, and stuff that's less known.

00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:28.431
At this point, I would have been willing to bet

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:30.239
that she was gonna go for something that was on

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.859
the left side, that's more popular with other ladies.

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.896
OK when the bottles showed up, I found myself

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:36.901
being biased by the names on the bottles.

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:38.766
For example, there was one called Explorer.

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:41.744
I want to be an explorer so I wanted that one to win.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.271
Obviously I had to blind myself to the marketing

00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:46.948
and assigned each vial a number which I could then

00:02:46.948 --> 00:02:48.882
cross reference at the end of the experiment.

00:02:48.882 --> 00:02:51.643
With that out of the way it came down to brute force science.

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:54.576
Over the course of three months I applied colognes randomly

00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:56.710
and documented her reactions to each.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.717
I didn't want her to expect a scent at a certain time of day

00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:02.104
so often I would not apply anything and just make sure

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:04.396
that she wasn't getting confused or, maybe even

00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:06.214
starting to give me lazy data.

00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:08.664
After four months of doing this I narrowed it down to two fragrances.

00:03:08.664 --> 00:03:11.517
One for casual Destin, and one for fancy Destin.

00:03:11.517 --> 00:03:15.608
Which means it's time to start conditioning her for memory triggers.

00:03:15.608 --> 00:03:17.551
So in mid October I travelled to Peru.

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:20.463
But before I even made it to my connecting gate in Atlanta

00:03:20.463 --> 00:03:23.950
I got this text message followed up by this Facetime call.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.625
Yup.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:27.021
So is this the scent.

00:03:27.021 --> 00:03:29.379
Earlier today she was preparing the kids schoolwork

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.887
and I decided to test it on her to let her eyes tell the story.

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:34.296
Alright the moment of truth.

00:03:34.296 --> 00:03:35.945
I'm not gonna show you what kind of cologne I have.

00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:38.789
I'm going to apply it.

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:41.046
[laughs]

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:42.710
And I'm gonna let you smell it.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.032
(Wife) Mm hmm.. It's nice.

00:03:46.772 --> 00:03:47.811
- Is it the nicest?

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.231
- It's the nicest.

00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:50.138
- Do you like it?

00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:51.033
- I like it.

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:55.792
- I'm not gonna tell you what the smell is because it's unique to us, right?

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:56.442
- Right.

00:03:56.442 --> 00:03:59.150
- OK so I will tell you that out of everything that we tried,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.323
it wasn't one of the most popular ones, but it was on the suggested list.

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:07.843
Alright so when I was in Peru, I snuck in her bedroom and sprayed

00:04:07.843 --> 00:04:10.725
this smell that took me several months to arrive at,

00:04:10.725 --> 00:04:13.399
on my pillowcase, and what happened?

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.659
- It reminded me of you.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.525
- When I was in a different continent, in the jungle.

00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:18.094
- Yes

00:04:18.094 --> 00:04:21.471
- So, that was the point. To try to create memories

00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:24.478
that would be established long after I was gone

00:04:24.478 --> 00:04:26.308
so now I'm gonna take this smell to the

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:28.188
safety deposit box and spray it on our will.

00:04:28.188 --> 00:04:30.717
In case I die. [laughs]

00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:33.260
I'm just kidding.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.898
I guess now I will show people how I shave.

00:04:34.898 --> 00:04:35.610
Is that OK?

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.815
- Yes, you can show people.

00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:37.657
- I can show people?

00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:38.586
- Wear clothes.

00:04:38.586 --> 00:04:39.781
- What?

00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:41.162
- When you show them.

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:42.694
- Oh cause I shave in the shower?

00:04:42.694 --> 00:04:43.343
- Yeah.

00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:44.737
[laughs]

00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:49.601
- Alright, this episode of Smarter Every Day was sponsored

They're clearly a superior product.

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.236
I used to shave with little disposable stuff like this

00:04:56.236 --> 00:04:59.309
but this is the same price as this and it's way better.

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:01.735

I guess, smellier every day in this video.

00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:39.321
Have a good one.

00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:41.326
Alright we're gonna see if you can keep up.

00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:42.073
Are you ready?

00:05:42.073 --> 00:05:42.776
Here we go. Come on. [laugh]

00:05:46.316 --> 00:05:47.598
(Destin) I think it's awesome,

00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:49.549
but I think I'll do this.

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.747
- Yeah that's way better, that's so you.

00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:52.841
[laughs]

00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:55.573
[laughs] Stupid.

00:05:55.573 --> 00:05:56.520
Was it fun?

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.678
- Yeah it was fun.

00:05:57.678 --> 00:05:58.883
-Was it interesting?

00:05:58.883 --> 00:06:00.173
- It was very interesting.

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:02.306
- So there you go. Any closing thoughts?

00:06:02.306 --> 00:06:05.142
- Or maybe not pregnant, I might smell.

00:06:05.142 --> 00:06:05.923
- Oh that's right.

00:06:05.923 --> 00:06:07.809
- I mean.. yes.

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:09.740
- That's... [laugh] That's a factor.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.550
- Just a thought.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.433
- We have more variables to isolate.

00:06:14.433 --> 00:06:16.520
Might have to redo this in six months.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.519
[laugh]
