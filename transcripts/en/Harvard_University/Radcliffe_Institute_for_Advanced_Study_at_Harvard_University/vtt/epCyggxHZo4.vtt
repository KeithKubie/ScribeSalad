00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.650
- Good afternoon.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.109
I'm Alyssa Goodman.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.090
I'm one of the
co-directors for science

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.930
here at the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.270
And so I have the privilege
of welcoming all of you

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.470
and also welcoming the many from
the crew of the Tara vessel,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.080
which you will hear all
about this afternoon

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.700
from Eric Karsenti.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.761
I'm not going to introduce Eric.

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.510
I'm going to introduce
Chris Bowler, who's

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.460
going to introduce Eric.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.930
And so before I
do that, I should

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.190
explain that this event is
part of a series of events

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.030
that goes under the general
title of "The Undiscovered."

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.160
And what we mean by
"The Undiscovered,"

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.090
for this year at Radcliffe, is
discoveries that are very, very

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.870
hard to anticipate.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.160
So for example, you go out
to measure the deceleration

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.280
of the universe with a lot of
telescopes and a lot of people.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.340
And you accidentally measure
the acceleration of the universe

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.380
and win a Nobel Prize.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.950
Or you go out and
there is 15,000 species

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.050
of plankton known and you
sequence a lot of stuff.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.150
And you wind up with
10 times that many.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.380
But I don't want to steal
Eric or Chris' thunder.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.280
So I won't tell you
anything more about that.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.890
What I would like to say
is that I'm really, really

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.500
honored that this all came
to be and that Tara is here.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.660
And I should explain
that Chris Bowler--

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.130
who I'm about to
tell you about--

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.830
and I were fellows together
at the Radcliffe Institute

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.210
a couple of years ago.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.730
And we knew that Tara-- the
vessel that's moored in Boston

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.550
Harbor now and you
can go see it--

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.440
was going to be making
this big world tour.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.939
And we thought,
wouldn't it be great

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.370
if we could bring the Tara
mission here to Radcliffe,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.080
and let you hear
about it from Eric,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.840
and let you experience its
educational aspects by going

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.950
to the ship?

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.590
And I'm sure Eric will say
more about all of that.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.810
And so I'm just really glad
that that has come to fruition.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.590
And I invite you to come to more
of these "Undiscovered" events.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.080
And the big annual
science symposium

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.360
that will cover many
topics in science

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.270
is on the 26th of October,
as it says somewhere

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.670
in the fine print.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.530
And then that next
slide is my final point

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.200
here before telling you
a little bit about Chris,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.330
which is I'm an astronomer.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.770
I forgot to mention that.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.930
And we're kind of
embarrassed that--

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.790
you see that little
tiny blue piece

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.770
that says "ordinary matter"?

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.059
That's what we actually can
observe in the universe.

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:30.350
And then we knew that we made
one mistake, which was we

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.660
left out all this stuff
that's called dark matter.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.910
And then that discovery I
told you about a minute ago,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.576
where there was the
acceleration instead

00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:38.205
of the deceleration
of the universe--

00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:40.580
that was when we needed to
invent this funny thing called

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.300
dark energy, which we
have no idea what that is.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.190
OK, so when we say "the
undiscovered" or "the unknown,"

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.760
It's basically everything
that's green and orange

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.930
in that picture.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.460
Now interestingly,
what I've known--

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.780
what I've learned, rather, in
the very recent past about life

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.880
sciences and about
the work of Tara,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.980
gives you the bottom
half of this diagram,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.050
which looks oddly similar.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.640
And for those of you who
are not biology experts,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.930
we go in the little slice called
"eukarya," which also includes

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.670
things like plants and yeast.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.920
And so it's not even just us.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.580
And so all that other stuff
is bacteria, and viruses,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.190
and other things that
you'll hear about today.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.050
And mostly, we
didn't know about it

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.830
until we sequenced large
fractions of the ocean, which

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.820
you will hear
plenty about today.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.250
So anyway, I think
it's remarkable

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.220
that a lot of science,
especially today,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.000
is, let's say, data
that will tell us

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.050
something about our universe
and our world in the future.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.449
But that we [AUDIO OUT]
don't understand.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.740
And so part of the mission
of this "Undiscovered" theme

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.290
is to explain that if science
were taught a little bit more

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.534
like that, it might
seem more exciting.

00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:52.700
Of course, we run the risk
of sounding like we don't

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.949
know what we're talking about.

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.340
But we try not to do that.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.920
So anyway, before
I ramble on more,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.930
let me just tell
you that I'm really

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.360
pleased to have
Chris Bowler here.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.943
And I'll just tell
you briefly that he

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:08.060
is the CNRS Director of Research
at the Institut de Biologie--

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.590
half English, half French--

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.470
de l'Ecole Normale
Superieure in Paris.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.980
And he himself is
someone who uses

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.570
genomics approaches to study
plants, and phytoplankton,

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.130
and particular diatoms.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.350
And so he's much
more expert than I

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.640
to introduce Eric and his work.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.820
And he also serves as a
scientific coordinator

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.950
for the Tara expeditions
that you'll hear about today.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.540
So thank you.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.590
And Chris, I turn
it over to you.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.570
Thanks.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.710
- Thank you.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.510
Thank you, Alyssa.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.620
So as Alyssa mentioned, I'm
normally based in Paris.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.470
I had the fortune
and the honor to be

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.390
a Radcliffe fellow a couple
of years ago here in Harvard,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.860
where I met Alyssa.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.960
And that's when we first
started talking about Tara.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.030
And it's really the
realization of a dream today

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.400
that Tara is in town.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.750
Tara is docked down close
to the New England Aquarium

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.080
after a two year expedition.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.810
And Eric Karsenti is
here with us today

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.870
to present today's lecture.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.100
So that's a fantastic
combination of events,

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.000
of circumstances.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.900
And thank you so much
for coming here and being

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.270
interested to hear more.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.510
So, to introduce
Eric, Eric got his PhD

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.250
from the Pasteur
Institute in Paris.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.640
He then went to San
Francisco, UCSF,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.000
to do a postdoc with
Mark Kushner, who

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.560
is here somewhere--

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.980
Harvard faculty since
25 years, I think.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.240
Did you tell me yesterday?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.280
Yeah.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.940
So it's, again, a combination of
stars that come together today

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.950
with Mark being here as well.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:19.920
So following the postdoc at
UCSF, Eric went back to Europe

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.370
and worked, in particular, at
the European Molecular Biology

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.830
Laboratory in Heidelberg,
which is the European center

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.560
of molecular
biology, with, today,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.400
about two and a half
thousand people working

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.200
there or something.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.630
And Eric was the Director
of the Cell Biology Program

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.060
at EMBL for 15 years.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.880
So he set up the Cell
Biology Program over there,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.030
and during that
time, made all kinds

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.640
of fundamental discoveries
about how cells work--

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.820
the mechanics of the
cells, the physics

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.920
of interacting with the
biology of individual cells--

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.020
and made all kinds of wonderful
contributions to that field.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.950
At the same time, Eric
was also a sailor.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.790
He loved sailing.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.020
He's passionate
about sailing and was

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.830
finally able to combine
his passion for biology

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.460
with his passion for sailing
through the interaction

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.600
with the Tara
Expeditions Foundation.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.980
Through this
collaboration together,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:38.290
Eric has set up a scientific
program based upon the research

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.990
schooner that he will introduce
to you to understand more

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.700
about life in the ocean.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.060
And, as you will
see from his talk,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.190
you will see how he's able
to combine his expertise

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.900
in understanding cell
biology through a physical

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.010
perspective-- perspective
of physics of the system,

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.580
how he's brought that thinking
into understanding of life

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.760
in the ocean and where
life in the ocean

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.870
came from, from an
evolutionary point of view,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.480
way back to the
beginnings of time.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.440
So it's a fantastic combination
of a very high-level cell

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.070
biology with understanding
of ocean processes.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.290
So we have been working
together for 10 years now

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.980
on the Tara Oceans Project.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.789
It's very far from finishing.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.240
We still have a
lot of work to do.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.309
But we've already done a
lot of things together.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:44.370
And Eric has received many
accolades over recent years.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.560
He won the gold
medal of the CNRS

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.730
from the CNRS in France,
which is the highest

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.630
accolade for science in France.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.690
He won that in 2015.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.580
And he's won several
other medals, as well,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.160
for his scientific
achievements--

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.250
to the extent today that
some people in France

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:10.440
talk about Tara as
the new Calypso.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.000
And some people talk about
Eric as the modern day Darwin.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.350
So I'm sure he's going to
entertain you for the next 45

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.640
minutes or so, giving
you his view about life

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.010
on our beautiful planet
and in the oceans.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.153
Thank you, Eric.

00:09:27.153 --> 00:09:30.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:36.330
- Thank you.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.390
So it's very nice to be here.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.100
I like this place and this
town, and especially being in--

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.645
you know I'm living on
Tara right now, so--

00:09:44.645 --> 00:09:45.520
living in the harbor.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.353
So it's really nice.

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:51.390
I can walk around as if
I was a Boston citizen.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.320
So, yes.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.540
So thank you, Chris, for
this beautiful introduction

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:03.510
Yes, today what I want to
do is to talk to you about--

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.430
I know that this is
very general audience,

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.140
so I try to make a general talk.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.710
And I will talk about my
previous work on the cells,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.300
actually, as Chris said before.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.200
And after that I will
come to Tara Oceans.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.980
There is a link between the two.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.740
I will try to show you how this
is connected, at least for me--

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.460
how I see this connection.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.550
So you know, we all
start as a round ball.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.380
We are an embryo.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.520
This is a frog egg.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.830
You know that I worked on
this in Mark's lab, actually.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.410
I will show you some
experiments we did with this.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.200
And this cell divides
many, many times--

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.190
thousands of times.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.850
And then it makes an organism.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.060
What is absolutely amazing
is that it's very complex.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.710
An embryo is extremely complex.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.720
There are lots of
complicated processes

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.240
that are going on
during the development.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.510
And this is why,
very often, people

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.770
think that there is a god that
should have generated this.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.370
But as scientists,
we try to-- even

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.940
if there is a god somewhere--
we are trying to understand

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.410
how this actually forms.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.750
So when the divides the
first sets cells in general,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.460
and the first cells of the
embryo, they make a spindle.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.680
So you see here the
chromosomes condense.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.860
You see the chromosomes
in red here.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.920
They contain the
genetic information.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.560
The mitotic spindle is a
machine which is made of tubes--

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.870
small tubes-- that segregate the
chromosomes to the two daughter

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.330
cells.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.370
So when you look
at this again, it's

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.760
even more fascinating than just
looking at the embryo dividing.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.460
You see the precision with which
the chromosome are segregated.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.960
There is almost never a mistake.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.330
And yet this is a
very dynamic process.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.770
And these are tubes
that organize themselves

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:58.740
into complex, very functional
structure-- a machine.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:05.010
So these days, a lot of people
think that life is DNA--

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.840
that the DNA
contains information

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.685
and that this is directing
the organization.

00:12:10.685 --> 00:12:12.460
But It's more complex than this.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.130
And in fact, I just
want to go back

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.230
to philosophy a little bit.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:22.170
And Kant already was thinking
about this in his book

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.150
on the critics of judgment.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.760
And he said, in an
organism, organ functions

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.830
emerge from properties
of parts and the whole.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.555
So this is interesting, because
very often in modern science

00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:36.390
we are working in a
very reductionist way.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.850
We think one thing does
something, which does the next.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.720
But he understood that it was
more complicated than this.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.800
And that we need to understand
the whole and the parts

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.320
to understand our
living system functions.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.500
And living matter is therefore
a self-organized end.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.208
And this was the first
time that somebody

00:12:53.208 --> 00:12:55.270
talked about
self-organization, which

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.630
is a philosophical concept.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.310
This reasoning led
Kant to question

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.040
the use of classical causality
principle to explain life.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.230
And he suggested that
a new type of science

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.080
would be necessary to
explain how end and means are

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.410
interconnected.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.500
So when I read this,
I liked it a lot,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.820
because this is
really the problem.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.470
We have to crack this problem.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.942
So somebody else, also,
was a great thinker,

00:13:19.942 --> 00:13:21.750
Erwin Schrodinger.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:27.360
And he gave a series of
lectures in the 1940s

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.650
in Trinity College.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.890
And he said some things
which are very interesting.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.845
He said, how can the
events in space and time

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:35.178
which take place within the
special boundary of a living

00:13:35.178 --> 00:13:38.160
organism be accounted for
by physics and chemistry.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.750
Because he thought
that we should

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.400
be able to extend life in
terms of physics and chemistry.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.480
There obvious inability
of present day physics

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.220
and chemistry to
account for such events

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.560
is no reason for doubting
that they can be accounted

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.570
for by those sciences.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.080
So obviously, this is
what we think here.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.180
But at the time, it
was not so obvious.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.175
So and then, there
are two sentences

00:13:59.175 --> 00:14:00.300
which are very interesting.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.070
He says there are two ways of
producing orderliness in living

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.090
matter-- order from disorder--
since he was a specialist

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.450
of statistical physics
or statistical mechanism,

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.000
which is known to physicists,
he was not so surprised about

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.240
this--

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.140
but the other one was
the order from order--

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.470
so cell duplication.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.740
And that seemed to be
more complicated to him.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.160
He suggested that-- at the
time we did not know about DNA,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.010
he suggested that there was
something in living matter

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.800
which was he called the
aperiodic crystal, which

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.700
in fact, now we know is the DNA.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.920
So now we know the origin of
living matter organization.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.570
We have to think it
in two different ways.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.540
One is statistical
mechanics-- how

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.712
collective behavior leads to
emerging functions and systems.

00:14:46.712 --> 00:14:49.170
And the aperiodic crystal is
a [INAUDIBLE] self-duplication

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.620
of the DNA molecule.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.040
So the DNA molecule is to be
seen, really, as something

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.660
which has information in it.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.270
But it doesn't
really direct things.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.060
It generates the
production of molecules

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.940
which have information.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.690
But these molecules have to
interact, and interact somehow

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:09.400
collectively and stochastically
to generate complex patterns.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:15.410
So now if we think about
life, not only now,

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.240
but in a very general context--

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:23.810
so from the context of
evolution and of local events--

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.000
I think the DNA
kind of links both.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.490
Because the DNA has
the memory of what

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.570
happened over four billion
years during the evolution.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.150
And there was a lot
of complexification

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.060
during this time of the DNA, but
of cells or so, and organisms.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.390
At our time scale, we have
to understand how our cells

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.440
and organisms get organized.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.007
But this also comes
from the origin of order

00:15:49.007 --> 00:15:50.090
at the evolutionary level.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.850
So it's just that there
are lots of things

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:57.830
happening during a long time
which are kept in the DNA.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.890
And at our time
scales, the molecules

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.620
which are, at a given
time, in the cells

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.890
get organized into complex
functional systems.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:14.060
So just to show you something
about the question of evolution

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:19.350
at the level of organism, one
of the big questions, also--

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.970
for example, for
Darwin and Lamarck--

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.760
they were discussing a lot
about the origin of the eye.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.060
Eyes are striking, because
they are a beautiful structure,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.200
extremely precise.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.610
They function very well.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.030
And how can this come about?

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.720
And obviously, at the
time, they did not

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.260
have much ways of understanding
all these structures.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.160
That's why you develop the
theory of evolution with--

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.450
you know we did not know
about mutations, variations,

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.130
and selection.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.590
But in fact, there are
many different eyes.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.440
You see that these eyes of
the eyes of a bird, which

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.610
are very much like ours.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.110
They are like a
photographic system.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.310
But there are the
eyes of insects,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.210
which have multiple facets.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:08.260
Here, these are eyes into
a clam or a shellfish.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.390
I don't remember exactly.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.390
There are many eyes
on the edge here.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.910
And this is a primitive
worm, a flatworm.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.710
They are very, very
simple eyes here.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.599
So the eyes have developed
in different ways.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:26.260
But they always are used to get
light and inform the organism

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.530
of the light that comes.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.270
But they took very
different shapes.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.600
So now before going into this--

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.750
I will come back that
after Tara Oceans--

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.270
I want to say something
on the origin of order

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.190
at the cell level.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.610
So at the level
at our time scale.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.430
And I will start
with experiments

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.150
made by Mark and
by me, actually,

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.810
using the cell cycle and
assembly of the mitotic spindle

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.100
as an example to understand
how morphogenesis

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.582
can happen at the cell level.

00:17:55.582 --> 00:17:57.540
So there are two questions
about morphogenesis.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.530
One is time-- how time
is determined in cells.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.030
And the other is shapes--

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.400
patterns in space.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.540
So this is just a
beautiful experiment.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.200
That actually drove me
to go to Mark's lab.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.100
He showed this movie
in Berlin in 1981.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.590
And I really was struck by this.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.682
So he showed-- this is
a frog egg, actually,

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:20.890
that has not been fertilized.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.550
So they have removed the
nucleus from this egg.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:28.950
There is no cytoskeleton,
no centrioles in there.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.420
So they cannot
divide physically.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.440
But what you can do is prick
the egg with a fine needle.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.000
And this starts the cell cycle.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.750
So you see, the egg
contracts every 30 minutes,

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.260
very regularly.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.820
And this shows that there is a
clock somewhere in this cell.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.190
There is a clock
going on, ticking.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.650
And at the time, we had
no idea what it could be.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.140
It's very interesting, because--

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.600
I remember, at this time
it was really exciting,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.930
because it was a mystery.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.760
We didn't know how this could
function, generate a very, very

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.126
precise time like this.

00:19:02.126 --> 00:19:03.750
So I don't go into
the details of this,

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.820
because this is a long
story-- complicated.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.320
But I'll just show
you the principle.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.290
So the clock turned out to
be in fact a circular system.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.940
So you have an
inactive regulator

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.580
of the cell, which
can be activated

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.060
by an activator, which is
synthesized continuously

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.890
in the cytoplasm of the egg.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.450
This activator, by combining
with the regulator,

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.910
activates it.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.670
And this one does
a lot of things--

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.790
I will show you--

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.690
on the cytoplasm of the
cell and changes its shape.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.390
Then, in the same
time, this complex

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.930
activates its own
degradation, the degradation

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.560
of the activator, so that
the clock can go back

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.970
into its original state.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.280
So this is an oscillator.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.850
And I show you this, because
this is a general principle

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.960
in biology, this loop.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.630
There are lots of
feedback loops and systems

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.530
that are feeding
back on themselves.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.950
And this is part of
self-organization principles,

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.410
actually.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:10.400
So what does this
active thing do?

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.160
Well, it does something
very interesting.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.510
Because what happens in
interphase-- you know,

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.690
when the cells don't divide--

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.740
they have a nucleus.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.067
So you see the nucleus
here and the cytoplasm.

00:20:20.067 --> 00:20:22.400
And in the cytoplasm, there
are tubes, the microtubules,

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.882
which are nucleated by
the centrosome here.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.650
When the regulator
gets activated

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.330
it changes the state
of the cytoplasm.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.850
So it switches
just one molecule,

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.780
which changes the state of
the cytoplasm in such a way

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.850
that instead of making an
astral array of microtubules,

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.110
it makes a bipolar spindle.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.020
So the centrioles duplicate.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.660
They go at the two
poles of the spindle.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.370
And the microtubules
get reorganized

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.860
into bipolar spindles,
the function of which

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.074
is to segregate the chromosomes
to the two poles of the cell.

00:21:02.074 --> 00:21:03.490
So you see this
is really amazing.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.730
It's a very complicated system.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:10.500
There is a clock that
changes the state of the cell

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.801
so that it can divide and
segregate its chromosomes.

00:21:13.801 --> 00:21:15.300
So it's very
important, because this

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.960
is the mechanism by which the
information which is in the DNA

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.980
is transmitted to
the dividing cells.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:29.520
Now, this is the clock.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.380
It works in fact because--

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.270
so this is the activator.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:38.250
This is the inactive
molecule of the clock.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.370
And it becomes
activated abruptly here.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.230
So there's a positive feedback
loop here, a negative feedback

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:47.590
loop, and then the regulator
gets degraded, and so on.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.870
So you get, really, an
oscillation this way.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.830
And each time, what
happens when this becomes

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:56.600
activated-- you get
a mitotic spindle.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.830
So the next question
was actually,

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.310
how do you assemble a spindle
like this with microtubules

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.501
around the chromosomes?

00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:08.000
So this is interesting, because
this is a machine, actually,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.570
that segregates the chromosomes.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:14.750
So how do the machines
can get assembled?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.390
So that's another experiment
I did in Mark's lab.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.310
So I put "The French Connection
and the Bay of Pigs."

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.080
This is a joke, because
when I came to Mark's lab,

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.970
he put me on a bench together
with another French guy.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:33.410
And so our bench was called
the French Connection.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.450
And there was
another bay, on which

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.380
there were two students, Tim
Mitchison-- with Professor

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.190
[? Nwataba ?] and Frank McKeon.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.569
And the two of them
were pretty lousy.

00:22:46.569 --> 00:22:48.110
So they were living--
you know, there

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.340
were dirty benches and things.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.050
So we called it the Bay of Pigs.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.430
But this turned out to be nice,
because I used the centrioles--

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.740
the team was purifying
centrioles from cells--

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.500
and I used the centrioles
that it was purifying

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.800
to do some experiments
in frog eggs,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.840
to try to understand
how the spindle forms.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.990
So then what we did,
it was very primitive.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:20.470
We just injected centrosomes
into frog eggs which

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.490
were either in interphase.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.812
So we could block the eggs
in interphase or in mitosis.

00:23:25.812 --> 00:23:27.770
And when we injected
centrosomes in interphase,

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.860
we got very nice astrals--

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.651
so the nucleated
microtubules, as expected,

00:23:30.651 --> 00:23:33.320
they form astrals
like in any cell.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.220
But in mitosis,
nothing happened.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.350
We did not see any astrals.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.050
And we were very surprised,
because we could still

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.820
see the spindle--

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.940
the meiotic spindle
anyway in the egg.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.340
So it meant that the
microtubules could assemble

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.870
around the chromosomes, but
the centrosomes could not

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.107
nucleate microtubules.

00:23:50.107 --> 00:23:51.690
And at the time this
was very strange,

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.440
because everybody
thought that centrosomes

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.600
were organizing the spindle.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:02.960
So what I did then was
to inject nuclei of cells

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.575
without centrosomes into
frog eggs in interphase

00:24:06.575 --> 00:24:07.370
and in mitosis.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.400
And around each
nucleus, I got a spindle

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.930
assembling around chromosomes.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.620
So this was, for us,
it was really exciting,

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.290
because it was, really,
the chromosomes that

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:23.600
induced the machine that
is going to distribute them

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.450
to the two daughter cells.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.130
So when I came back
to EMBL, I wanted

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.090
to continue working on this.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.380
And with a postdoc, actually--

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.710
Rebecca Heald was
previously a student

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:40.430
of Frank McKeon, who
was a student of Mark.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.480
So you see there is a
history behind of people.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.140
And we put DNA onto
beads and put these beads

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.760
into frog egg extracts.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.589
And spindle assembled in
vitro around the beads.

00:24:52.589 --> 00:24:54.630
And when you look at the
formation of the spindle

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.580
by video, you see
that it's really

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.760
a self-organizing system.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.720
It's really amazing.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.060
The microtubules grow
from the chromatin.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.979
And they self-organize
into a bipolar spindle.

00:25:03.979 --> 00:25:05.770
So they are not very
nice here because this

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.350
is stuck on a [INAUDIBLE]
to have quantitative data.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.480
But they can be really
beautiful, actually,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.480
like normal spindles.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.860
This whole observations
led me to the question

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.200
of self-organization in general.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.377
And it's easy to talk
about self-organization.

00:25:22.377 --> 00:25:24.460
But if you want to really
understand how it works,

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.690
you have to understand what
self-organization is based on.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.610
So there are basically
two principles

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:36.350
that lead to the emergence
of patterns in systems.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.910
One is collective behavior
and energy dissipation.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.500
So there was very
old experiments.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:50.404
If you heat liquid from below
in a thin layer like here,

00:25:50.404 --> 00:25:52.570
at the beginning, when you
increase the temperature,

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.730
the water molecules
behave randomly.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.640
So you don't see anything.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.460
But suddenly they start to
behave in a coherent way.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:05.030
So the molecules of
water form cylinders.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.390
They form really
regular cylinders.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.760
But these cylinders are
dynamic, so they exist just

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.660
because water molecules--

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.630
it's convection.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.980
They are moving all the time,
but they move collectively

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.860
together so that
a pattern emerges.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.950
The second mechanism
is reaction-diffusion.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.450
And the first experiments were
done by Belousov-Zhabotinsky.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:29.840
By chance, Belousov once
mixed two chemicals.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.550
And these chemicals, instead--

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.300
normally if you mix
blue with white,

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.300
you get something
intermediate, or red and white,

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.450
you get some kind
of other color.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.120
But when he mixed
these two chemicals,

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:48.520
they generated waves or
patterns that were steady state.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.567
They kept oscillating,
or they formed patterns.

00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:54.400
So at the time, people
did not believe this,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.580
because it looked like it was
violating the second principle

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.270
of thermodynamics.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.810
But finally this was
accepted, because they really

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:03.310
demonstrated that it worked.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.810
And in fact, it's
Turing-- you know,

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:08.440
the guy who actually
invented the computer--

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.500
who developed the theory
of the reaction-diffusion.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.080
And reaction-diffusion is,
in fact, two molecules react.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.301
They defuse.

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:17.800
And one of the
molecules that defuse

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.070
feeds back into the
reaction and inhibits it.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:27.370
So therefore this can
oscillate or generate patterns.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.840
So and also, at a
different scale,

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.190
if you look at the
formation of fish shoals,

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.540
it is also a
self-organized system.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.920
Because the fish
look at each other.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.894
They like to swim together,
so they come to each other.

00:27:42.894 --> 00:27:44.810
They don't like to be
too close to each other.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.720
So they move apart.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.230
And this is this plus
the speed that determines

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.540
the shape of the shoal.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.700
So it's not one fish
that tells the shoal,

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.230
we should go that direction.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.870
It's the collective behavior
of the fish that determines

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.450
the shape of the shoal.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.310
So I though that
something like this

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:08.570
was going on, too, for the
organization of the spindle.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.100
And we started to look
for what it could be.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.470
So I was wondering
what in the chromosomes

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.290
could get the microtubules
to grow just around them.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:23.670
And one day, Iain Mattaj at
EMBL was working on the nucleus.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.360
And he came to me and said,
I have a small protein

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.410
called Ran, which can be
induced at a high energy

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:32.330
state or low energy state.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.570
And this one may be involved
in the assembly of the spindle.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.894
So he had a lot of
tools to study this.

00:28:38.894 --> 00:28:41.310
And we could demonstrate that,
in fact, this was the case.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.520
So this molecule, when
it is in the GTP state--

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.870
high energy state--
generates a gradient.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:49.714
So this generates a gradient
around the chromosomes

00:28:49.714 --> 00:28:51.130
that signals the
microtubules they

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.930
should grow in this region.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:55.610
And this forms a
gradient, because this

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.320
is a reaction-diffusion system.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.290
So we demonstrated this,
actually, theoretically.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.940
So there is a molecule in
the chromosomes that loads

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.110
GTP on the Ran, and a
molecule in the cytoplasm that

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.780
transforms GTP into
GDP, so that you

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.880
have a reaction here--
reaction-diffusion

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.360
around the chromosomes.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.210
So this generates
a gradient that

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.800
leads to local assembly
of microtubules.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.300
So this was the first part to
understand how the chromosomes

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.860
induce spindle assembly.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.720
Now the second question
was, how do the microtubules

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.060
get organized into a bipolar
structure-- into a shape?

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.010
And here I worked with
physicists Stan Leibler

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.800
and his postdocs.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.022
And so what we did is to develop
a simple theoretical system.

00:29:42.022 --> 00:29:43.730
They did experiments
like this, actually.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.220
But then we did it
in the computer.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:51.170
So we know that microtubules
can bind to motors--

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.480
the molecular motors that
move along the microtubules

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.050
by using energy.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.310
And some of the motors can move
to one end of the microtubules

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.310
and others to the other.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.840
But they can crosslink
microtubules, also.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.990
So by playing with
the parameters--

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.450
the speed, the
probability with which

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.060
they bind to microtubules,
the speed of movement,

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.910
and various things--

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.280
we could start to build
a computer simulation

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.510
to see what happens
when you mix motors

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:25.767
and microtubules randomly
and how the system evolves.

00:30:25.767 --> 00:30:27.850
And what you see is that
under certain conditions,

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.900
you get a formation of
self-organized asters,

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:37.440
or vortices, or sometimes
networks of microtubules

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.730
that look like
spindles a little bit.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.690
And then, just to
show you live what

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.950
happens-- so these are
very old simulations.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.370
So you start from
random system, and you

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.530
get a very organized
pattern spontaneously.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.910
So the typical
self-organized system.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.700
And if you change the
parameter of the system,

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.700
you can get others patterns,
for example, vortices,

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.790
as you can see here.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.000
So at the end, they
managed to actually--

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.140
with Rebecca in another
postdoc, Francoise, actually--

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.360
model the spindle completely.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.200
So this is beautiful,
because this is based on--

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.260
there are parts of the
simulation are determinist,

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.635
but most of it's
just stochastic.

00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:30.070
So it's stochastic interaction
between information

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.670
rich molecules that leads
to the self-organization

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.600
of the spindle.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.240
And you can model
it in the computer.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.829
So we really have understood
how the system works.

00:31:39.829 --> 00:31:42.120
So this is very important,
because we really understand

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.286
morphogenesis at this level.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.480
OK.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.580
Now, we have understood the
assembly of the spindle.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.120
But then I thought, there is
something very interesting.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.380
Because we can generate
spindles without chromosomes.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.737
There are ways of doing this.

00:32:01.737 --> 00:32:03.820
So when you generate
spindles without chromosomes,

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.730
they have no function.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.919
But when they are
interacting with chromosomes,

00:32:08.919 --> 00:32:11.460
the function emerges from the
interaction of the microtubules

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.150
with the chromosomes.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:18.030
So I really like this, because
this is really going back

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:22.750
to the question of Kant.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:25.620
Cell shapes self-organize
from stochastic interactions

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.750
between information
rich molecules.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.520
Complex functions
emerge from interactions

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.320
between self-organized shapes.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.150
And function results
from contingency.

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.650
There is no "goal and end."

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.380
So it's just the fact
that they are microtubules

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.140
and the chromosomes that
the function emerges

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.742
from this system.

00:32:41.742 --> 00:32:43.950
The chromosomes don't know
they want the microtubules

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.260
to segregate them.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.290
It's just that the whole
segregates the chromosomes.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.200
And it just happens.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.700
Philosophically, I think it's
really important to understand

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.950
this, because this is the
fundamental question of life,

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:02.955
actually, is, how do we get
to do what we do from nothing?

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.240
And then if you start to
look at cells in general,

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.680
our body is made of many cells.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.157
We have 200 cell types.

00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:13.240
They are different shapes.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.864
And these shapes are
largely determined

00:33:14.864 --> 00:33:16.890
by the cytoskeleton--
so microtubules

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.640
and the filaments, the filaments
which are forming your muscles,

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.450
also.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.060
And depending on the state of
the cytoplasm of the cells,

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.530
you can generate
different types of shapes.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:30.350
And this is amazing, because we
have 200 different cell types,

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:33.480
but this is one genome.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.320
So it's not the
genome that decides

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.020
on the shape of the cells.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.080
It's using the genome
in a certain environment

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.660
you can generate a
specific set of shapes.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.820
This is very important,
because, for all the people

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:50.160
who work on genomics and things
like this, don't forget that.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.470
This is complicated.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.390
I mean, you cannot understand
life by just sequencing.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:58.950
OK.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:03.440
So now I just want to go
beyond that a little bit.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.460
I want to say something about--

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.639
extend this a bit to the
embryogenesis program.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:14.400
So how do you get from a ball to
the first shapes of the embryo,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.810
and then to the
complexification of the embryo?

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:19.250
So this involves a lot of
symmetry breaking events.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.730
You break the symmetry of--

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.750
the cells suddenly don't
interact in the same way

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.610
they were interacting before.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.110
And the collective
cell behaviors.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:31.510
There are feedback loops,
also, like reaction-diffusion

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.620
processes, and spatio-temporal
forward feedback processes.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.389
I will show you what--
it's complicated--

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:40.300
I'll just show you what
it is with a nice example.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.714
I will take an example,
which a group did in the EMBL

00:34:44.714 --> 00:34:46.130
in the Department
of Cell Biology,

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.120
they did these experiments,
which are beautiful.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.060
So this is a fish.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.519
And you see here
the fish, actually,

00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:57.570
they feel each other
by the lateral line.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.060
So the same formation
of fish I showed before

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.100
is because they can feel
the vibration of water.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.080
And this is because in
the lateral line here

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.090
they have small
sensory organs that

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.980
have cilia that
feel the movement

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.290
of the water next to them.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.385
So Darren, who has been
doing these experiments,

00:35:16.385 --> 00:35:20.770
he was filming the formation
of this lateral line.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.980
And he saw that in fact,
this is a collective of cells

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.640
that move along a path
that has been deposited

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.210
before this stage
during embryogenesis.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.970
So when the embryo was before--

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:37.720
a line of chemotactic
molecules has been

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.610
deposited on the muscles here.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:41.650
And then this
collective that moves

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.930
from behind the ear
moves toward the tail

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:48.940
along this chemotactic trail.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.920
Now, the first
thing you think is

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.100
that there is a
gradient on this trail

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.850
and that the cells
feel the gradient.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:58.960
But in fact, Darren showed
that there is no gradient.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.820
Because what he did was
to cut the trail here.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.890
And the collective,
instead of keep

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:08.410
going because the
trail is cut here,

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:12.040
turn around and
start to move back.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.680
So the collective feels a
trail, but it must generate

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.755
the gradient by itself--

00:36:19.755 --> 00:36:22.530
so that self-generated gradient.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:27.370
So I hired a student who did,
actually, the theory of this.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:31.630
And he developed a
theory that demonstrated

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.080
how the gradient
is self-generated

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.680
at the front of the cells.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.450
And then, in fact,
this was beautiful.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:41.230
Because the theory actually
described in the same time

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:47.010
why the collective was
breaking up and forming organs

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:54.290
like this behind the
moving collective.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.670
So what we know
is cell shapes are

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:01.570
determined by a complex network
of cytoskeleton molecules.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.760
Forms and functions emerge
from stochastic events.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.820
And cell forms
richness originates

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.160
from stochastic events.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.090
So now, then the thing is that
cell form richness probably

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.490
originates from
complexification processes

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:15.820
during geological times.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.137
And collective cell behaviors
and branching events

00:37:18.137 --> 00:37:19.720
allow for extensive
variation of forms

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.930
in multicellular organisms.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:26.420
So what this means is that what
we see now is very complex.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.490
We see these complex cells.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.290
We know that before it
was not so complex--

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.170
that there was only
bacteria, viruses,

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.120
relatively simple things.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.420
So we have to understand
how complexity emerged.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:44.150
So if you look at the diversity
of oceanic cell shapes,

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:48.730
now, it's just amazing.

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.580
That's pictures we took
with the confocal microscope

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.050
of different cells.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.445
And you see a whole
zoo of patterns.

00:37:55.445 --> 00:37:59.600
These are unicellular cells
that live only in the oceans.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.600
And they live,
usually, not alone.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.167
They live in symbiosis with
many other small cells.

00:38:05.167 --> 00:38:07.000
And we don't understand
how all these shapes

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
are generated, actually.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.690
How the complexity-- why is
there so many different cell

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:11.330
shapes?

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:14.390
So if you look at
evolution now, you

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.920
know life started about
four billion years ago.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.720
And there was no oxygen. So
it was mostly carbon dioxide

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.700
and nitrogen. Then probably,
bacteria and viruses

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.580
lasted for about
2.5 billion years.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.610
And then some
photosynthetic bacteria

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.500
started to emerge
during this time.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.180
They produced the
oxygen. That started

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.580
to oxygenate the atmosphere.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.010
And eukaryotes started
around this time, also.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:46.450
So cells like us, with a
nucleus and a complex cytoplasm.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.480
But the complexification of life
actually occurred pretty late.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.150
I mean, around almost
at the same time

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:55.700
as the oxygen concentration
increased to about 20%.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.820
And then you get protists,
animals, and plants,

00:38:58.820 --> 00:38:59.870
first in the oceans.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.710
And then they
populated the earth.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.290
So here is just radiation.

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.080
And you see that
the protist actually

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.970
represent a lot of the
diversity that exists on earth.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:14.350
And you are here, human
beings, close to mushrooms.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:16.600
And this is our branch.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.430
And the rest is the protists.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:25.930
I've been thinking
a lot about this,

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:29.320
based on what I did
at the cellular level.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.010
I was wondering if evolution
was really working the way

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.570
we think--

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.910
basically, by simple
variation and selection.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.600
And I think that it's much
more complicated than this,

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.420
and that there are lots of
interaction between cells,

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:49.540
organisms, that lead to the
generation of complicated DNA

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.700
patterns and
cellular structures.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.810
So the Tara Oceans,
in this context,

00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:01.850
is kind of related
to this, because we

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:04.450
wanted to understand how all
these organisms have been

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:08.480
generated, how the DNA has been
complexified during this time,

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.640
and things like this.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.500
So we thought that it would
be interesting to collect

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.270
these organisms
during an expedition.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.420
But all the organisms--
you know, very often

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:26.410
the people who go mine biology
collect one type of organism.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.910
Here we wanted to
collect everything

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.890
to see how all these
organisms interact

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:34.540
and how the environment actually
affect their interaction

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.220
or their behavior.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:41.970
So to do that we needed to
collect all these organisms,

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:46.660
but also the data
about water mass,

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.780
carbon concentration, oxygen,
salinity, temperature,

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.710
or depth--

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.476
various kinds of parameters.

00:40:53.476 --> 00:40:58.530
So the other thing is
that the ocean is complex.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.410
And I think this has
probably been very important

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:04.270
for evolution.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.380
There is a global circulation
that is modeled here by NASA.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.460
You see the Gulf Stream here.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:16.810
And each big oceanic basin
has a gyre or multiple gyres.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.890
So the water is
circulating all the time.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.890
So this circulation actually
transports the organism

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:24.960
all the time from one
point to the next.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.830
So it transports organisms from
warm waters to cold waters,

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.899
from surface to depth.

00:41:31.899 --> 00:41:34.065
So they keep being exposed
to different environments

00:41:34.065 --> 00:41:36.850
and to different organisms.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.180
So you can think of
the ocean somehow

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:43.890
as a huge washing machine
that mixes the organisms all

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:46.180
the time.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.860
And in fact, I'll
just show you a movie

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.710
that shows the distribution
of different organisms.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:57.670
And right here
there are diatoms,

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:00.060
which are small
unicellular photosynthetic

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:03.410
organisms, in blue.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.650
Also large organisms,
synechococcus bacteria--

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.670
different types of bacteria.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.660
So this is a model
Darren modeled, actually,

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:16.600
that has been generated by
Mick Follows here at MIT here.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:22.080
And what Mick does is basically
seeds the ocean in a computer--

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.830
the ocean of the Earth with
a mixture of organisms.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.140
At the beginning we have
homogeneous distribution.

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.760
And with time, the organisms
distribute like this.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.930
So the whole distribution
of the life in the ocean

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.680
self-organizes into
a pattern, also.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:46.440
In order to study this we needed
to develop a method to sample.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:52.140
And I discussed with Etienne
Bourgois and [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.490
who are owning Tara.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.400
This is a 36 meter
schooner which

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.240
can be equipped for
doing sampling of biology

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:06.420
and biophysical parameters.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:10.290
So we developed a complex
sampling procedure.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:13.380
So the organisms have
very different sizes.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:18.460
So if you look at viruses,
[INAUDIBLE],, bacteria,

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:22.650
and archaea, they measure
between 0.02 microns

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.127
to something like
5 microns maximum.

00:43:26.127 --> 00:43:28.460
And there are quite a lot of
them per liter of seawater.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:33.400
So in 100 liter of ocean water,
you can get enough material

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.660
to work on these organisms.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.780
But when the organisms
become larger,

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.860
there are less organisms
per liter of seawater,

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.150
so you need to collect
more water to analyze them.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:46.870
And for the larger
ones are metazoa,

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:51.190
so organism made
of multiple cells,

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:52.990
you need to collect
quite a bit of water,

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.970
like 100 liters of seawater,
to get enough material

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.530
to work with them.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:00.610
So we develop different methods.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.940
So to collect these
organisms, you

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.780
can pump water and filter it,
or collect it with bottles.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:09.030
But for the larger ones,
you have to use nets.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:11.970
So you use nets of
different mesh sizes

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:15.660
that allow to collect the
organisms by size classes.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.370
So we collected a lot of
different size classes here.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:23.130
And each of the size class
has been analyzed separately,

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:26.700
which makes it easier to
sequence the genes of look

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:32.260
at them by microscopy.

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.190
So the boat left
in September 2009.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.310
We sailed across the
Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea,

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.270
the Indian Ocean, the South
Atlantic Ocean, Antarctica,

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.580
South Pacific, North Pacific.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.590
And then we came
back to Lorient.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:50.700
And in 2013 we sailed back to
sail around the North Pole.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.640
And during all this trip, each
dot here is a sampling site.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.530
So we decided to sample that
way because of the current I

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.380
showed before.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.820
The sampling has
been very structured,

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.560
relative to the oceanography
we knew about the currents

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:09.930
and also the water masses.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.720
Because for example, in
the north of Indian Ocean,

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.000
there is a region
which is very acidic

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.330
and which is very
poor in oxygen, also,

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:21.000
as well as the East Pacific.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.610
So there are very
different water masses.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.170
And it was very
important to collect

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.270
in these different
water masses to be

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:29.790
able to correlate
the ecosystem we were

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.590
sampling with the environment.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:36.180
And the idea was to
analyze these samples using

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.270
modern technology, obviously.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.110
So we used metagenomics
to characterize--

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.880
you see, myself, although
I said that genomics is not

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.840
so interesting, we did
a lot in Tara Oceans.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:54.960
We sequenced the metagenomics.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.430
This means that each filter
we got from one station

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.170
was basically sequenced.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:04.920
So we get the DNA
sequence, the RNA sequence.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.720
And we also collected samples
to do in parallel imaging.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.940
So we could
characterize ecosystems

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.340
both at the genomic level
and at the morphology level.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.020
And we obviously had all the
environmental parameters.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.270
So all this work led
to a publication--

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:26.970
we have many more publications
since then-- but in 2015,

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:28.560
we published five
papers together,

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.800
where we showed
what we could get

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.840
from these kinds of samples.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:40.180
I'll show you now, briefly,
the data we collected.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.360
So this is viruses.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.620
So I'll show what
we found by kingdom.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.650
So this is the analyses of
the viruses around the world

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:52.350
and around the pole here.

00:46:52.350 --> 00:47:00.200
And we found something like
480,000 viral populations.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:05.480
And the interesting thing
is that only 19% of this

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.560
was known.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.370
So this is huge.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.380
I mean, it means that
there was nothing

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.480
done, basically, on
viruses before Tara

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.880
Oceans in the open ocean.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.262
And you can do a
lot with this data.

00:47:16.262 --> 00:47:18.470
And one of the things that
I found really interesting

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:22.640
is that these viral
populations cluster nicely

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.150
into five ecological zones.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:30.920
For example, the yellow ones
correspond to the population

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.460
here--

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:36.050
correspond to temperate and
tropical epipelagic water.

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:39.140
The pink one corresponds
to temperate and tropical

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.531
mesopelagic-- so
around 600 meters deep.

00:47:42.531 --> 00:47:44.460
Bathypelagic is very deep.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.730
So it's those ones.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.530
And the grey are
Antarctic region.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:50.330
And Arctic regions are in blue.

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:55.730
You see, it's amazing how these
populations cluster together.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.560
I was completely
surprised when I saw this.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:03.030
The viruses are very
constrained by the environment.

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.355
Now, for the bacteria.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.530
So these are all the stations
that have been sequenced.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:14.186
And Shinichi Sunagawa
at EMBL and then

00:48:14.186 --> 00:48:18.610
at ETH has characterized
47 million genes--

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.510
bacterium genes.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:23.240
This is huge-- a
huge number of genes.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.890
And again, using
these genes, you

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:29.510
can look at the importance
of various parameters

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:32.330
on the composition of the
genes, but also the composition

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:41.120
of the diversity of bacteria--
so the structure of ecosystems.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.790
And one of the parameters
that dominates, actually,

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:47.450
to determine what kind
of bacteria live together

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:48.500
is temperature.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.990
There is a linear relationship
between the temperature

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:55.210
and the composition of
the bacterial ecosystem.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:58.460
Now for eukaryotes,
we found something

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:04.070
like 150,000 different
genuses of eukaryotes.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:08.270
And we saturated the diversity
in the regions we went.

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:10.280
So this means that
we probably are not

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:18.140
far from the total number of
genuses in the surface ocean.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.500
But when we look at the
genes, we found something

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.730
like 116 million unigenes.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:26.750
And it doesn't saturate.

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.065
So we are far from saturation.

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:31.700
So there's much more
than 116 million unigenes

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:32.580
in the oceans--

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.740
eukaryotic.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:40.640
And we calculated each
plateau around 190 million.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.730
So this is a huge
number of genes.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.550
And one of the things
we were interested in

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:50.140
was to see how the
organisms interact.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.580
So you can, using
bioinformatics,

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.530
you can see on the
global data set,

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:57.020
you can see who
interacts with whom

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.390
and who excludes each other.

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:01.100
So there is very
little organisms

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.260
that exclude each other.

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:06.320
You see here the exclusion
rate is about 20%.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.200
And 80% of the
organisms live together.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.300
So it does mean that
they necessarily need,

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.880
but a lot of them
should interact in order

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.950
to function probably.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.140
And you can see
this using imaging.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.120
So what you see here
is, for example,

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:27.420
a ciliate, which lives in
symbiosis with another protist.

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.510
And here, lots of
different protists,

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:34.162
and each of them-- almost
no protist lives alone.

00:50:34.162 --> 00:50:35.870
Most of the time, they
live in symbiosis,

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:39.270
or at least there are organisms
interacting with them.

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:42.500
So it's extremely complex.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.970
And with this data,
which is amazing,

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:49.020
you can look at
how they interact.

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:54.650
For example, this
one, the ciliate,

00:50:54.650 --> 00:51:01.640
which has the symbiodinium
as a symbiont,

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.340
you can look at different
places in the world

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.930
and try to see
whether this is always

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:11.530
the same species of symbiodinium
and ciliate that live together.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:12.530
And you find variations.

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:14.400
So there are specific locations.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.670
The interaction
changes according

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:20.580
to where you are in the ocean.

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.730
So what I want to
get at now, just

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:28.310
to finish this
presentation, is, how

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:31.700
did life complexify
over the, probably,

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.780
the last billion years?

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.400
I mean, it comes
in pretty simple

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.964
for probably two or
three billion years.

00:51:36.964 --> 00:51:39.380
But then in the last billion
years it became very complex.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:43.940
So in order to make a simple
cell, we know we need about,

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.410
probably--

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.890
perhaps less, but--
something like 500 genes.

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.390
A human being is
made of 20,000 genes.

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:54.320
And we found in the
ocean 200 million genes.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.330
The real problem of
evolution, in my opinion,

00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:59.810
is really complexification--
how all these genes have

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:01.880
been generated-- not
only all these genes,

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.750
but how all these organisms.

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:09.410
Because as you have seen
in the previous slides,

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:12.320
the protists-- there are lots
of protists that live together.

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.690
So they form complex systems.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.710
We live with
bacteria in our gut.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:20.030
So it's a real problem.

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:22.470
I mean, we have to
understand how this happened.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:28.520
It's not only, obviously, simple
variation with point mutations,

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.830
or things like
this, and selection.

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:32.530
It's much more
complex than this.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:34.460
So we need to work
on this, I think.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:38.250
I don't know yet how,
but this is important.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:40.400
So the question is,
how far back can we

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.050
go with Tara Oceans data?

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.470
How did gene transfers,
duplications, recombinations,

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:45.970
mutations, and
cellular interactions

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.109
contribute to life
complexification?

00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:49.650
I think they are
important questions.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:51.890
How to predict evolution,
structure, and distribution

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:53.960
of planktonic ecosystems?

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.845
And another aspect I
did not talk about,

00:52:56.845 --> 00:52:59.520
but which is very important,
is that these ecosystems

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.250
have a very strong impact on
the geochemical processes that

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:05.150
shape our atmosphere.

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:09.800
And by knowing this we can
start to better understand

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:15.490
how the ocean
regulates our climate.

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:18.590
Now, I would like just to
finish on one slide, which

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.230
is a little complicated, but--

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:24.520
to relate self-organization
and evolution.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:29.180
There's a big debate between
classical evolutionary people

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:33.230
who are stuck with the idea
of variation and selection.

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:35.780
And people think
that evolution itself

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:39.230
is a self-organization
process, just as

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:40.820
what I described at
the cellular level

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.747
but at a much bigger scale.

00:53:42.747 --> 00:53:44.080
I think it works like that, too.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:48.300
But we have to find
out how to study that.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.690
So we know that
self-organization involves

00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:53.840
different principles
like collective behavior,

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.840
and reaction-diffusion--
obviously,

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.450
at the scale of
two million years,

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:00.720
it's not reaction-diffusion.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.560
But it's probably transport.

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.790
So organism interaction
and transport

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:10.400
are probably very important--
have been very important--

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.120
for evolution, at least
at the cellular level.

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:18.020
And combinatorial processes
like functional modules

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:21.020
in cells and
organism interaction

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.440
are probably also key to the
generation of complexity.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.480
Selection is
extremely important,

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.740
but it has mostly a
rule of elimination.

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:31.560
So it eliminates the
things that don't work.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.460
So I think that if we want
to go into the understanding

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:38.990
of evolutionary processes,
especially early evolution,

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:41.930
like the generation of the
complexity of life in the ocean

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.860
before we came about--

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:46.400
which is important, because
most of the regulatory networks

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:51.410
that we are built on have
been formed in the ocean--

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:54.750
we need to work on
these kind of questions.

00:54:54.750 --> 00:55:00.240
So just to finish, I would
like to thank lots of people.

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.580
So these are a part of the
people who have participated

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.920
in Tara Ocean.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.734
And these are very-- you know
Mark here-- lots of people

00:55:06.734 --> 00:55:08.150
who have been
working on in my lab

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:11.930
and with different collaborators
throughout the world.

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:13.680
I must say, being a scientist--

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.590
I know some people are
not scientists here--

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:17.480
but being a scientist
is really a chance.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:21.950
Because we meet a lot of
people and great people.

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:23.900
So it's wonderful.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:24.716
Thank you.

00:55:24.716 --> 00:55:28.604
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:36.080
- I have a question.

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.850
Wonderful talk.

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:41.430
I was interested in
virus segregation.

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:44.425
So virus are also
depending on the host.

00:55:44.425 --> 00:55:48.110
So virus segregate,
maybe, differently

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:52.130
from the other organisms
that you have found.

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:55.490
Or that means that they
can infect different hosts.

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:57.200
And the other thing
is, can you use

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.440
virus that are so sensitive
to the environment

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:06.140
and physical chemical changes as
an indicator of climate change

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.580
or changing in the oceans?

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:12.020
- So yes, viruses are actually
depending on the host.

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:14.160
And I skipped this
slide, actually.

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:20.870
But what determines the virus
population somewhere is,

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:22.240
there is a source, usually.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.900
So the viruses are produced
where there is a lot of hosts.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.760
For example, in
the South Atlantic,

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.740
there is a source of viruses
close to Benguela Upwelling,

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.950
because there are lots of
bacteria there for the phages.

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:42.910
And then we could show with
Tara how they are transported--

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:48.090
how they populate a certain
region from various regions.

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:51.410
So the hosts play a
very important role

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:53.450
here-- so global distribution.

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:57.230
Now, if we can use viruses for
climate change, I don't know.

00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:59.310
We have not looked
at this at all.

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:01.850
The only thing we know is
that all these organisms

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:04.820
are extremely sensitive
to temperature.

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:09.060
The bacteria, the eukaryotes--

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.300
a 1 degree change in
temperature changes

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.070
completely the ecosystem.

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:15.650
And you see there is this
very tight relationship

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:19.500
between temperature and
bacterial communities.

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:23.060
So I think the viruses is
probably the same, because they

00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:23.975
depend on the host.

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:30.540
- I will ask a question.

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.295
So as a physicist--

00:57:32.295 --> 00:57:34.670
and if you have questions,
please come to the microphone,

00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:36.760
but I'll ask this
question first.

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.260
- OK.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:39.250
- So just come over here.

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:39.890
Can you?

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:40.390
OK.

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:41.090
Thank you.

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.430
So anyway, as a
physicist, I'm obsessed

00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:44.655
with very accurate time.

00:57:44.655 --> 00:57:47.030
And I noticed that in some of
the processes that you were

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.279
saying were being regulated,
at least from the videos,

00:57:49.279 --> 00:57:51.530
it looked like the
periodicity was not

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:53.500
in an exact number of seconds.

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.480
And I'm just wondering whether
that was true, first of all,

00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.140
and whether it's kind of an
almost periodic cell division--

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.000
- You mean-- what was periodic?

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.820
- So you showed
the cell division

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.170
happening in the early work--

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.260
- Yeah.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.009
It did look like--

00:58:07.009 --> 00:58:07.630
yeah, yeah.

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:08.921
It's completely-- very precise.

00:58:08.921 --> 00:58:12.250
- Is it an exact interval
of time, or sort of exact?

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:12.890
- No.

00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:13.390
Mark?

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:16.340
It's very precise, I think.

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:17.778
I don't remember, but I--

00:58:17.778 --> 00:58:23.451
- In the first one,
there's a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:23.451 --> 00:58:25.816
So there's a
[INAUDIBLE] for that.

00:58:25.816 --> 00:58:27.190
- That's what I
was going to ask.

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:29.970
I was going to ask,
is there any hint

00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:33.410
in the organization
of the behavior,

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:37.939
the self-organization, in how
accurately things are timed?

00:58:37.939 --> 00:58:38.980
In other words, can you--

00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:41.385
- Essentially, we [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:49.635 --> 00:58:52.593
Then they will still
be like still clocks.

00:58:52.593 --> 00:58:59.002
So each one of them
has a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:00.481
- They're separate clocks.

00:59:00.481 --> 00:59:01.960
- Separate--

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.255
- We understand the clock now.

00:59:03.255 --> 00:59:04.796
- The clock's
distributed from there.

00:59:04.796 --> 00:59:06.724
And then you
separate [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:10.102 --> 00:59:10.685
- Fascinating.

00:59:10.685 --> 00:59:14.910
- We understand how the clock
works, more or less, now.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:16.610
OK.

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:19.170
- My question is more about
mechanics of the whole thing.

00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:21.630
And that is, it's a sailboat.

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:23.830
How much of the time is
it actually under sail,

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:25.044
and how much of time--

00:59:25.044 --> 00:59:25.710
- With the boat?

00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:27.150
- And how much of it is motored?

00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:30.300
And do the currents help
move you along, too?

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.950
- It depends.

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:38.400
In Tara Oceans, we sailed about
50% of the time with the sails.

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:44.310
In the Pacific, you sailed
about 80% with the engine, no?

00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:46.300
So in the Pacific, it
was more complicated,

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.620
so we had to use
the engine a lot.

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.810
- I have a question
about your sampling

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:54.570
technique for microorganisms.

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:58.230
Clearly you deal mostly, as far
as I can see, with the surface,

00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:59.880
with the photosphere.

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.540
What about lower depths, where
there's very little light,

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.630
different microorganisms?

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.320
- I did not get your--

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.650
- Depths of 80,
100, 200 meters--

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.770
- So we sampled at the surface.

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:18.250
And at 50, 70 meters.

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:20.920
And around 600 meters.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.340
So 600 meters is
called mesopelagic.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:29.280
So that's interesting, because
the life at the surface

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.130
is completely different
from the life at 600 meters.

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:34.350
It's not the same organisms
at all, which is normal,

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:36.420
because at the
surface they live off

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.110
the photosynthesis of the light.

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:43.890
But at 600 meters they live
off what dies at the surface

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.630
and falls down.

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:49.180
So it's a completely
different system.

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:49.680
- Thank you.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.290
And do the virus
populations mix?

01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:54.130
Or are they also stratified?

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.140
- No, they are stratified also.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:56.640
Yeah.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.542
- Thank you.

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:04.840
- My question is a
follow on to his.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.420
How deep, eventually,
do you plan

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.930
to be able to pull up
specimens, considering water

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:15.400
pressure and the
difficulties of lowering

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:22.210
collection tubes, or
whatever, into the dark depths

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.200
of the ocean?

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.670
- Yeah.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:27.880
We start out, we cannot
sample very deep.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.460
Not because of
pressure or anything.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.126
It's just because the
boat is too small.

01:01:31.126 --> 01:01:35.650
We need large machines
to collect deep.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:40.330
But there is another
boat, a big boat, which

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:43.520
was used by Spanish scientists.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.060
And in the same time as
we did this expedition,

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.710
they collected
samples very deep--

01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:50.860
4,000 meters, close
to the bottom.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.510
4,000 to 6,000 meters.

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:54.940
So it's feasible.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.910
It requires some technology,
but you can do it.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.860
- I want to come back
to the mechanisms

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.930
of self-organization.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.510
One essential
principle I thought

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:09.670
was missing in your talk
was phase separation.

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:12.340
I think it was there
in an implicit way.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.340
But phase separation is
a principle of demixing--

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.106
- Yes, absolutely.

01:02:16.106 --> 01:02:17.980
- --something that was
randomly mixed before.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.050
And doesn't that
potentially lead,

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:24.090
or is an essential
mechanism for, speciation?

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:24.750
- Aha.

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:25.880
That's a good idea.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.810
For speciation,
yes, it could be.

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:30.810
Yeah, we don't talk about
phase separation here,

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.550
but it's also
extremely important

01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:36.420
here for self-organization
processes.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.570
We could use this
concept probably for--

01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:41.070
I did not think
about this, but this

01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.950
would be very interesting
to look into this here,

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:48.242
to see whether the
species separate-- yeah,

01:02:48.242 --> 01:02:48.950
it's interesting.

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:49.450
Yeah.

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:55.540
OK.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:56.590
Thank you.

01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:59.040
- So I think we will end there.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.430
And we have a
reception downstairs.

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:04.810
So please stick
around, talk with Eric

01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:07.570
if you have further questions,
talk with the sailors

01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:10.135
if you want to know more
about life on board,

01:03:10.135 --> 01:03:12.020
the life on the high seas.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.870
And please join me in thanking
Eric for a superb lecture.

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:18.220
[APPLAUSE]
