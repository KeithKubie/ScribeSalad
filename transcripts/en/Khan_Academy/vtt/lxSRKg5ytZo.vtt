00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.650
- [Instructor] Oliver
and Theo have lived on

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.110
they're parents' sailboat
for over three years.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.110
So this version of they're,
T-H-E-Y apostrophe R-E,

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.220
this is a contraction for they are.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.750
They are.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.720
So let's see if it makes sense
if we were to replace this.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.300
We should be able to
replace the contraction

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.270
with the thing that it's contracting.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.103
So let's see.

00:00:23.103 --> 00:00:25.810
Oliver and Theo have lived on they are

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.900
parents' sailboat for over three years.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380
So this clearly does not make sense.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.910
The intent isn't to write
the contraction of they are,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.970
the intent is to write
the possessive of they.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.970
And the possessive of they is T-H-E-I-R,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.450
not T-H-E-Y apostrophe R-E.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.300
These get confused all the time.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.280
I've been guilty of it when
I've been typing really fast.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.100
My brain just kinda
says what it sounds like

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.933
instead of saying, hey, wait, wait,

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.770
I need to use one their
versus another they're.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.580
So T-H-E-I-R, so their parents,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.370
and then we this apostrophe after the S.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.700
Now this would, you put
the apostrophe after the S

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.480
is if this is a plural possessive.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.313
And this is.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.480
We're not talking about
one parent's sailboat,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.960
we're talking about
their parents' sailboats.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.663
So multiple parents' sailboats.

00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:22.480
So we would go with their parents'.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480
So this one right over here.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.570
So we definitely want to change it,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.610
we don't want to say they
are parents' sailboat.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.760
This one right over here
still says they are, they're.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.210
So rule that one out.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.000
And this one right over here,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.780
they got rid of the apostrophe.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960
There's no apostrophe right over here.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.010
And you need apostrophe,
because we're talking about,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.190
well, whose sailboat is it?

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.630
Well, it's the parents, it's the parents.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.430
Their parents' sailboat.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.910
So it needs to be a possessive, parents'.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.470
So you need the apostrophe
right over there.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.143
So rule that one out as well.
