Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.220
And today we've got DONG, things you can do
online now, guys.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.550
Let's begin with a recommendation from @catchfoot,
supercut.org.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.240
It's a reservoir of video collections.
For instance, every Steve Buscemi death on

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.359
camera.
Four minutes of people giving out 555 numbers

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:25.179
in movies, or a minute-and-a-half of vloggers
apologising for not realising videos lately.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.519
For a "in real life" supercut, check out Winter,
he's on a mission to visit every single Starbucks

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.940
in the world.
His site is a great destination for photos

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.500
of Starbucks, like lots of them.
MegaRandompeoplez recommended Depict1, a great

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.420
game where the narrator lies to you and you
have to disobey in order to move forward,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.960
never knowing what to believe.
ConfusedAshleyK has even more control in Level

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.280
Editor.
You have only a short amount of time to both

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.300
build the level and complete it.
Keep built things safe in Epic Rail, where

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.750
you have to switch rail paths to send trains
in the right direction while keeping them

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.790
from colliding.
Now, as a Tower Defence lover I have to agree

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.070
with Blackmamba329, Balloon Tower Defence
is quite fun.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:23.840
Saintsage777 reminded me of rainymood.com,
a relaxing site of continuous rain noise.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.060
I was always told to play it while listening
to the Widdler's Day and Night Dubstep remix

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.369
for the ultimate effect.
Make your own dubstep remixes with Wub Machine.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.449
The site does its best to remix whatever song
you drag in.

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:42.119
Make the beat yourself like MatthewTS22 with
this from RonWinter, the keyboard controls

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.640
all the fun sounds.
Incredibox comes via Vegemitosis and it's

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.420
a brilliant a capella song you can control
the layers of.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.540
Drag in new voices, new beat boxing, new back
up singers, etc., etc.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.680
CreatureFeatureRIz showed off Seaquence, a
site where you also control the music, but

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.949
by building little sea creatures that make
noise based on their shapes.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:14.669
Have them live together and make music together.
Now, I love ambigrams - figures that are one

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.120
thing from angle and another from a different
angle.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.190
This website makes them for you.
For instance, my first and last name makes

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.070
this one.
See, at first it says Michael, but upside

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.819
down it says Stevens.
If you still have free time left, check out

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.959
TehN1ppe.
He loops simple images and sounds over and

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.840
over and over again, but through wizardry
of compression and patience he makes them

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.239
all ten hours long.
Want more?

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.219
Zommyo pointed me to the longest video on
YouTube.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.120
It's compressed beyond all recognition but
clocks in at 596 hours long.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.480
Not long enough?
Check out the longest list of the longest

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.519
stuff at the longest domain name at long last.com.
The site catalogues the longest of almost

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.620
everything.
The longest book, longest popsicle, longest

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.250
spacewalk, longest distance walked backwards,
longest zucchini and on and on and on.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.819
And on Twitter last week I showed off one
of the YouTube comments with the most thumb-ups

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.739
ever, so follow us to stay up to date.
And, if you're not already subscribed to Vsauce2,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.820
you're missing out on half of Vsauce.
If you subscribe to Vsauce2, you get mind

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.040
blowing technology, weird people fact, more
leanbacks.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.760
It's literally twice the sauce.
So pour some all over.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.540
And as always,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.860
thanks for watching.
