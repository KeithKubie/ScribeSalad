00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:02.223
- [Narrator] We have the
graph of three functions here.

00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:04.097
And we're told that one
of them is the function F,

00:00:04.097 --> 00:00:06.596
one is its' first derivative,
and then one of them is the

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:07.429
second derivative.

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:09.451
We just don't know which one is which.

00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:11.228
And so, like always, pause
this video and see if you

00:00:11.228 --> 00:00:12.487
can figure it out.

00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:15.052
Alright, now the way I'm
going to tackle it is

00:00:15.052 --> 00:00:17.267
I'm gonna look at each of these graphs and

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.141
try to think, what would
their derivatives look like.

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:22.622
So for this first one,
we can see our derivative

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:26.346
right over here, our
slope of our tangent line.

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:29.126
It would be a little bit
negative and then it gets more

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:31.680
and more and more negative,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.885
and as we approach this vertical
asymptote, right over here,

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:37.730
it looks like it's
approaching negative infinity.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.675
So, the derivative would
actually, over here,

00:00:40.675 --> 00:00:42.913
it would be a little bit less than zero,

00:00:42.913 --> 00:00:45.379
but then it would get more
and more and more negative

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.654
and then it would approach
negative infinity.

00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:50.073
So, it would have a similar
shape, general shape,

00:00:50.073 --> 00:00:52.207
to the graph itself, at
least to the left of this

00:00:52.207 --> 00:00:53.574
vertical asymptote.

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:55.895
Now, what about to the right
of the vertical asymptote?

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.973
Right to the right of the
vertical asymptote it looks like

00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:03.322
the slope of the tangent line
is very negative, but then

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:07.707
it becomes less and
less and less negative,

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:11.874
and it looks like it is
approaching, it is approaching zero.

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:16.881
So, on this side the derivative
starts out super negative

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.934
and then it looks like it is
the derivative is going to

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:23.601
asymptote towards zero,
something like that.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.411
So, based on what I just sketched,

00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:33.895
it looks like this right
graph is a good candidate

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:36.952
for the derivative of this left graph.

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:39.175
You might say, what's
wrong with this blue graph?

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:42.030
Well this blue graph out here,
notice that it's positive.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.874
So if this were the
derivative of the left graph,

00:01:44.874 --> 00:01:47.294
then that means the left graph
would need a positive slope

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:49.321
out here, but it doesn't
have a positive slope.

00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:53.047
It's a slightly negative
slope becoming super negative.

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:55.402
And so, right here we're slightly negative

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:57.560
and then we become very negative.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.310
And so maybe this is,

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:03.702
let's call this F,

00:02:03.702 --> 00:02:05.869
and maybe this is F prime.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.417
This is F prime right over here.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.656
And now, let's look at this middle graph.

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.427
What would its derivative do?

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:20.242
So over here, our slope
is slightly negative,

00:02:20.242 --> 00:02:24.171
and then it becomes more
and more and more and more

00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.077
and more negative.

00:02:26.077 --> 00:02:28.868
And so the derivative
of this might look like,

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:31.440
it has to be slightly negative,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.519
but then it gets more and more
and more and more negative

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.028
as we approach that vertical asymptote.

00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:39.875
And then on the right side
of the vertical asymptote,

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.366
our derivative is very positive here,

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.903
and then it gets less and
less and less and less

00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:46.627
and less and less positive.

00:02:46.627 --> 00:02:50.295
And so, we start our derivative
would be very positive

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.262
and then it would get
less and less and less

00:02:52.262 --> 00:02:53.749
and less positive.

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.946
It looks like it might,
the slope might asymptoting

00:02:55.946 --> 00:03:00.920
towards zero, so our graph
might look something like that.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.438
Well the left graph right here

00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:04.500
looks a lot like what I just sketched out

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.131
as a candidate derivative
for this blue graph,

00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:08.507
for this middle graph.

00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:10.482
And so I would say that this is F,

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.281
then this is the derivative of that,

00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:14.618
which would make it F prime
and then we already established

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:16.956
that this right graph is the
derivative of the left one,

00:03:16.956 --> 00:03:18.509
so if it's the derivative of F prime,

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.389
it's not F prime itself,
it's the second derivative.

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.287
So I feel pretty good about that.

00:03:23.287 --> 00:03:24.988
And just for good measure,
we could think about

00:03:24.988 --> 00:03:27.303
what the derivative of
this graph would look like.

00:03:27.303 --> 00:03:28.944
Here the slope is slightly negative,

00:03:28.944 --> 00:03:30.470
but then it gets more and more
and more and more and more

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.831
negative, so the derivative
would have a similar shape here.

00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:38.825
And then here, our derivative
would be very positive,

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:40.992
and it gets less and
less and less and less

00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:42.492
and less positive.

00:03:43.713 --> 00:03:48.084
And so, we start very
positive and then it gets less

00:03:48.084 --> 00:03:51.840
and less and less and
less and less positive.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.007
And so as a general shape, it
actually does look a lot like

00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:00.137
this first graph.

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:03.645
But the reason why I'm not
gonna say that this first graph

00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:05.744
is the derivative of the right hand graph,

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:08.307
is because this right hand graph
was the only good candidate

00:04:08.307 --> 00:04:11.464
that we had for the derivative
of the left hand graph.

00:04:11.464 --> 00:04:14.062
And so I feel pretty good
with what we selected,

00:04:14.062 --> 00:04:16.684
that this middle one is F, the left one

00:04:16.684 --> 00:04:18.906
is the first derivative, and the right one

00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:20.640
is the second derivative.
