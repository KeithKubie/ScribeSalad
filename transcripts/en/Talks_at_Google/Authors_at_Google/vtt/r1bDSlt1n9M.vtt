00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.395
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:04.910
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
I'm Siobhan Roberts.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.250
And I am John Horton
Conway's biographer.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.935
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: And
I'm that person mentioned.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:12.446
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
John Horton Conway.

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:13.320
The book is just out.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.870
It was published on July 14.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.470
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
Bastille Day.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.710
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Yes, indeed.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.660
Nodal.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.080
There's a few
copies at the back.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.990
And we'll be happy to
sign them afterwards.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.665
And I also should say, feel free
to interrupt us at any point

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.040
if you have a
question pertaining

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.330
to what we're talking about.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.020
There's mics in the aisles.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.450
But I thought we could start
by doing a brief reading

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.539
from the book as is sort of
traditional on these occasions

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.080
because I thought
that would give you

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.490
a sampling of the book.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.160
And at once give you
a sense of the process

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.530
that poor John endured
throughout the course

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.450
of my writing the
book and the process

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.861
that I endured in
writing about poor John.

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:04.569
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
Let me just interrupt

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.610
to say I'm a bit
testy already today.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.380
So that might very
well-- I'm supposed

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.250
to read these yellow lines
on this piece of paper.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.010
You don't know which the yellow
lines are, but never mind.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.510
I do.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.645
I can see them.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:23.410
I'm also a little bit
upset, I must say-- well,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.340
more than a little bit-- at the
paranoia of Google demanding

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.010
that we produce identification.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.000
Had I known that I was
to produce identification

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.060
before being let in, I would
not have accepted the invitation

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.740
to talk today.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.285
I'm really serious.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:45.410
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: All right.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.580
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: OK.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.900
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
Thank you for that.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.430
So this is from the chapter on
the Game of Life in the book.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.590
I thought we'd throw
caution to the wind.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.730
So I'll just read a bit of an
intro to give you some context.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.480
"So all hell broke loose
with the Game of Life

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.560
when Martin Gardner, the
'Scientific American'

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.120
columnist, wrote his October
1970 column about life.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.820
In the column--"

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.620
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
Capital life.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.560
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
Capital life, yes.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.600
"In the column, Conway
issued a challenge-- $50

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.230
for the first person
to find the piece

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.430
of circuitry in the computer--
the glider gun-- that would

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.950
all but prove life universal.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.270
And the pandemonium has
continued ever since.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.510
On a local level, these days
talking about life with Conway

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.420
can cause considerable
perturbation.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.210
Without much warning, he reaches
his threshold and turns testy.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.835
It terrifies--"

00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:43.764
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: When he
already is, it gets worse.

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.180
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
"It terrifies him

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.450
that his worst nightmare
might come true,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.870
this his life will-- in the
end-- be reduced to life.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.080
When we met for a session in
the alcove at the Princeton math

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.000
department one day,
he tried to prepare me

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.810
for the hellish consequences,
i.e., the wobbly

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.247
that he was about to throw.

00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:05.830
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: I don't know
what a wobbly is, but anyway.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.960
It says here, "oh god, I
don't know whether to tell you

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.320
now or not."

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.195
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: "Oh
sure, get it over with."

00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:14.444
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: "Well,
it may be upsetting to you.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.780
It's upsetting to me actually.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.930
I lay in bed probably
about a week ago,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.820
in the early hours
of the morning,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.190
and I've decided, I
have to say, that I'm

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.420
becoming fairly disenchanted
with your biography.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.780
It's basically because
recently you've

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.460
been asking me these
questions about the Life Game.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.470
And you know something?

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.190
I hate the Life Game.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.930
I've really realized I hate
the-- what's that word?--

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.810
damned Life Game.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.912
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: "Well,
that can go in the book."

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:46.620
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
"Yeah, let me finish.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.090
So I'm scared of the
following thing happened.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.230
I'm scared of becoming
another one of these,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.750
John Conway, inventor of the
celebrated Game of Life."

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.330
How many people know about
the celebrated Game of Life?

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.880
I can't see.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.070
Oh, they all do, don't they?

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.426
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.890
"As I told you, every
time I turn to a book--

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.450
a new math book-- I look
up a certain sacred name.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.910
And it says, Conway, Game
of Life, pages 34 to 38.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.459
And that's roughly all it says.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:24.190
And it's quality assassination,
not character assassination.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.610
I did discover it.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.820
And it was part
of my little life

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.150
to have discovered it and so on.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.770
And I don't think it
should be totally excised,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.010
but it seems to be all
that I'm known for.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.770
And I wanted you to
somehow set the record

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.510
straight by not doing the
same damn thing again.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.787
I mean, god, I was quite upset.

00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:50.370
I was so terrified
that I was thinking

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.160
of saying, so to speak,
publish and be damned.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.465
I don't want anything
more to do with it."

00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:56.756
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: "May I speak?"

00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:58.464
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
"Permission to speak?

00:04:58.464 --> 00:04:59.520
No, not yet.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.890
You should appreciate something.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.140
This was never a big deal
as far as we were concerned.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.330
We met a bunch of
graduate students

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.010
at Cambridge [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.180
This was just a recreation,
a game we played.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.750
Somehow it became a bit more
important later on, or at least

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.080
it did in the eyes
of other people.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.860
I never thought of
it as very important.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.700
I still don't, by the way.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.360
I just thought of
it as a bit of fun.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.350
In a way, I felt ashamed of it.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.370
I don't think it counts in
the mathematical community,

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.410
at least in the serious
mathematical community.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.850
I don't think any of
my Princeton colleagues

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.810
thinks it's of any importance.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.772
I don't know.

00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:40.310
In a way, it doesn't
count for me.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.630
So I wasn't going to cooperate
anymore in this character

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.510
assassination.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.130
I wasn't going to answer
any more of your questions

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.580
about Life.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.180
Well, I don't mind answering
a few to tell you the truth.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.370
Just let me say--
how can I say it?

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.670
It was a genuine
part of my life.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.050
And I told you about my
[INAUDIBLE] time and so on,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.980
but I really want you to
minimize it rather than

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.000
maximize it.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.500
OK.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.645
Now speak."

00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:06.860
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: "Ha.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.840
Well, the less said, the better.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.240
That seemed the best
means of assuagement.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.200
It's a fool's errand attempting
to reason with John when

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.958
he's in a state."

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:22.394
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: And I'm
in a state now, by the way.

00:06:22.394 --> 00:06:23.810
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
So that gives you

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.500
just a sampling from the book.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.070
But now maybe to sort
of backtrack a bit

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.090
and give you some
broader context--

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.120
this process started
initially when

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.500
I was writing my first
book about Donald Coxeter.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.730
And everybody told
me I had to talk

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.950
to John Conway about Coxeter.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.700
Yes.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.010
And so it took me
awhile to track him down

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.800
because I don't think you were
really using email much then

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.340
and you weren't reliably
answering the phone.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.880
So I was going about my research
and everything was turning up

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.110
geometry.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.360
And then finally I
discovered that Conway

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.610
was going to be at math camp.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.480
I think it was in
Maine that year.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.500
And so I sought you
out at math camp.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.990
I don't know if
you remember that.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.490
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
I don't remember

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.730
any particular incident.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.890
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Right.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.342
So this is Donald Coxeter.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.300
My first book was "King
of Infinite Space-- the

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.410
Man who Saved Geometry."

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:32.710
Coxeter was a very sort of prim
and proper Edwardian gentleman.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.270
And as I said--

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.530
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Have we
got a picture of him here?

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.070
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.320
He was up on the screen there.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.990
He was known as the
Man who Saved Geometry.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.506
And then so I
sought Conway out--

00:07:42.506 --> 00:07:44.170
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: He was
one of my heroes, by the way.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:44.580
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Right.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.320
Yeah.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.050
And I sought you
out at math camp.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.755
And in contrast to Coxeter, this
is what I found essentially.

00:07:51.755 --> 00:07:54.210
You blended in so
well with the campers,

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.740
looking exquisitely filthy.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.360
And you hadn't
slept in a few days.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.800
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: I should
tell you about math camp a bit.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.730
Math camp was one
of two math camps.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:15.980
It's one for 16-, [? 17-, ?]
18-year-olds good at math,

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.740
nerds, and so on.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:25.160
And it wanders around the
United States and Canada.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.280
And I used to devote one week to
it every year and another week

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:36.350
to MathPath, which is for
13-, 14-, 15-year-olds--

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:41.292
or maybe 12-, 13-,
14-year-olds-- fooling around.

00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:42.250
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Mm-hm.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.760
And that's what you were
doing when I found you.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.260
For sure.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.302
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yeah.

00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:46.718
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
But it was great,

00:08:46.718 --> 00:08:48.220
because I got you
in your milieu.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.025
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
It's so great

00:08:49.025 --> 00:08:50.600
that I'm not programmed anymore.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.480
I don't have to read the yellow
lines on this piece of paper.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.430
Sorry.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.388
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Right.

00:08:56.388 --> 00:08:58.890
And so when I was trying to
interview you about Coxeter,

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.670
similarly I had an idea of
what I needed to accomplish.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.547
But you did tell me how much you
loved Coxeter and admired him

00:09:05.547 --> 00:09:07.630
and how you consider
yourself an honorary student.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.850
But you also told me
rather a lot about yourself

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.170
at that time and place.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.140
And so I thought, a-ha,
here is another book,

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.590
because you're such a
fabulous storyteller

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.810
and you do like to
talk about yourself.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.360
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
You mean liar?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.900
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: No, not always.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.227
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: You
caught me out in one big lie.

00:09:26.227 --> 00:09:27.060
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Ah.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.100
Well, I could read that
section from the book.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.657
Or maybe you should tell
the story about Cromwell.

00:09:31.657 --> 00:09:32.990
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: No, not yet.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.489
No.

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:34.830
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Not yet.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.800
Save that for later.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.650
Well, do you want to say a
few things about Coxeter?

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.700
You wrote him a letter.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.730
This is the letter.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.896
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Oh, yes.

00:09:46.896 --> 00:09:48.549
I wrote him a
letter when I was--

00:09:48.549 --> 00:09:50.340
I thought it was when
I was in high school,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.530
but it was apparently when I
was at university-- Cambridge

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.940
University-- possibly
in my first year.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.970
I don't exactly know.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.240
Coxeter was a wonderful
man, a geometer,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.430
living in Toronto, which is
how Siobhan got to know him.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.690
But he edited Rouse Ball's
"Mathematical Recreations,"

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.355
which I read eagerly at school--
at high school, that is to say,

00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:27.877
in Liverpool-- and then wrote
to him with various things.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.460
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: A
rather long letter.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.796
It's a five-page letter.

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:31.590
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
Five-page letter.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.900
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Yes.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.840
Rather verbose.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.830
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
Illegible to me now.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.270
But, still.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.942
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Mm-hm.

00:10:37.942 --> 00:10:40.150
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Then I
gradually got to know him.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:45.100
He's one of a number of
people that I got to know

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:50.320
and knew in the end
for about 50 years.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.250
And, you know, then people
who you know for 50 years

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.090
tend to die in their late 90s.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.753
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
He was 96, yeah.

00:10:59.753 --> 00:11:00.520
Mm-hm.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.650
And so I had met
Coxeter when he was 93.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.440
And I knew him for three years
while I was writing the book.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.490
And then the book
came out in 2006.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.402
And then I--

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.610
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: That is
her biography of Coxeter.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.010
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Yes.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:12.910
Mm-hm.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.040
And then I went to the Institute
for Advanced Study for a stint

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.620
as a Director's Visitor.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.490
And I had previously proposed to
John the idea of the biography,

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.550
but you said no, never.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.890
Why did you say no initially?

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:32.120
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Well, I was
married to a certain lady who

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.864
I thought would be infuriated by
anything I said about anything.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.280
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
Well, by then you

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.060
were divorced from
that certain lady

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.270
and married to another lady.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.675
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yes.

00:11:43.675 --> 00:11:45.927
But still--

00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:47.760
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: It all
factors in together.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.926
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: --it
doesn't stop certain ladies

00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:51.155
from-- never mind.

00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:52.113
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Right.

00:11:52.113 --> 00:11:54.089
OK.

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.380
But then you changed your mind.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.820
So when I arrived
at Princeton, I

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.780
called you up just to say hello.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.370
And you said, hey,
about that biography.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.170
So how did you change your mind?

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.330
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Well, there
was a rather strange person--

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.860
Matthew [? First-- ?]
at Princeton

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.960
who was some kind of
administrative assistant.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.200
And I told him some
story-- I forget

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.700
which one it was because I have
a number of stories that just

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.440
get embellished over
the years until they

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.480
become totally false.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.010
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
They're all in the book.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.551
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
Oh, I don't know.

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:33.950
Fortunately a few
of them aren't.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:40.200
But anyway, and
Matthew said, oh,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.990
somebody should really
write your life story.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.490
And I said, well, there's this
young woman who was going to,

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.700
but I said no.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.850
And he said, well,
why did you say no?

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.590
And I said, well--
well, I told him

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.160
about the certain lady who
would be infuriated by anything

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.560
that was said, so to speak.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.510
And he said, oh, well, look,
you can talk to your biographer

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.950
and arrange to keep
clear of anything

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.460
that might really upset her.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.790
Anyway, after some
considerable talk--

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.540
more or less an
afternoon of talk--

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.500
he persuaded me to say yes.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.450
Now Siobhan was-- this
conversation I remember-- maybe

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.680
falsely-- took place in
January of a certain year.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.790
And Siobhan was going to
come to Princeton in February

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.890
of that year and was
phoning every now and then

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.930
to make arrangements
or something.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.140
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: I might
say it was September,

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.640
but, I mean, who's
going to quibble?

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.750
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Probably.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:49.410
I said, as I remember, so
that means-- it means nothing.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:54.440
So when she did
turn up, I-- well, I

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.290
had decided to look
at her face somehow.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:03.750
And when I said I
might be prepared

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.420
to say yes or
something, I was going

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:11.540
to [INAUDIBLE] to seeing
something about her face.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.700
And I discovered
later I've never

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.580
really looked at her face.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.180
But anyway--

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.680
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: You were too
distracted defending yourself.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.013
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Passed over.

00:14:20.013 --> 00:14:22.130
So, yes, I said, in the end.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.890
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Right.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.430
And then something
interesting developed, for me,

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:32.550
in the process of talking
to you so many times.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.660
I was at the Institute
on a number of occasions,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.050
numerous visits over the course
of maybe four or five years.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.860
And I would go over
to the department

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.970
and interview John on
any number of subjects,

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:51.162
such as FRACTRAN, which was a
precursor to the Game of Life.

00:14:51.162 --> 00:14:52.120
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: No.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.790
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Well, OK,
but just let me continue.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.040
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: It wasn't.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.550
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: You
can correct that.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.630
But interviewing
you so frequently

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.350
and listening to
your stories again

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:06.630
and your fabulous way of
explaining things in such a way

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.350
that even I could grasp
the gist of things

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:14.700
or intuit an understanding-- I
realized that it would really

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.520
be a disservice if
I were to approach

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.310
the book in a traditional
way and translate my subject,

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.130
try and set it up
with a third person

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:23.985
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Did you
say it would or wouldn't?

00:15:23.985 --> 00:15:25.490
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: It
would be a disservice.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.970
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Disservice.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:26.210
OK.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.380
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.230
So instead I just
decided I needed

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.389
to capture Conway and distill
him and let him really

00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:35.430
come through on the page.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.390
And so what I ended
up doing was allowing

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:43.110
you to speak in the biography
in extended quotations.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.620
And I also convinced
my publisher

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.220
to give you your own font,
which was no small task,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.290
I may say, because it made
the production and layout

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.020
of the book more difficult.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.110
So John has his own font in
the book, comes in and out.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.370
We pass the narrative
baton back and forth.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.920
And I leave it to you
to explain things,

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.410
like the surreal numbers
and the free will theorem

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.730
and all the various
mathy gems and nerdish

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.620
delights that you're
so passionate about.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.015
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yeah.

00:16:12.015 --> 00:16:13.694
I don't know what I
can say right now.

00:16:13.694 --> 00:16:15.610
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Well,
maybe you could tell us

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.985
a bit about the surreal numbers
or the free will theorem.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.450
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yes.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.490
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
The surreals are

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.800
the thing you're most proud of.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.680
I mean, the Game of Life,
we can write that off.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.220
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: I'll
just tell you roughly

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.600
what the surreal numbers are.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.940
I suppose, more or
less, everyone here

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.400
knows what the real numbers are.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.470
So that's part of
the surreal numbers.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.940
The word surreal
wasn't chosen by me.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.590
It was chosen by
Donald Knuth, who

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.805
wrote a little book called
"The Surreal Numbers"--

00:16:49.805 --> 00:16:51.770
or called "Surreal
Numbers" actually.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:17:00.850
They form an enormous field of
numbers-- absolutely enormous--

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.089
that contains the real
field and lies above it.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.770
Hence the term surreal.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:10.579
But the term surreal also
carries the notion of bizarre

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.150
with it.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.339
And they are a
little bit bizarre.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.960
Well, quite a lot bizarre.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.700
They also include Cantor's
infinite ordinal numbers,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.530
which are not very
familiar to people.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.220
So I suppose you know
nothing about them.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.950
Cantor did a wonderful thing
in the decade-- Georg Cantor,

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.890
famous German mathematician--
did a wonderful thing

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.530
in the decade from 1870 to 1880.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.580
He founded the theory
of transfinite numbers,

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.030
or just infinite, if you
like-- past the finites.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:50.160
Everybody else stopped counting
somewhere at the finite stage.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.000
Cantor actually copied
the usual way of counting,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.420
starting at one.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.000
But it's nicer to
count starting at zero.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.045
So I'll start at zero.

00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:00.970
It doesn't make very
much difference.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.340
Zero, one, two, dot, dot, dot.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.170
Everybody stopped,
say, at 2,417,

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.900
or some other finite number.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.100
Cantor carried on,
imagining counting

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.080
an infinite collection,
getting to the end,

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.870
and then you have
a problem of what

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:23.890
the next number is after all
the finite whole numbers.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.770
And Cantor originally
called it infinity,

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.780
but it doesn't behave
like the infinity

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.560
that people know from calculus.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.190
So after a time he
rubbed a little bit

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.460
of the infinity symbol off and
took the Greek little omega

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:45.270
as his notion for the first
infinite number counting

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.840
number, omega.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.080
And then there's omega
plus 1, omega plus 2.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.300
You see, you can't
afford to go on inventing

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.620
different names all the time.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.770
You know, there are an awful
lot of finite numbers even.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.750
And so there's the
number we-- well,

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.200
in England we call
"a hundred and one."

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.580
In America, you call
"a hundred one."

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.120
Really "a hundred and one"
is a little bit nicer, or 100

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.690
plus 1, 100 plus 2, and so on.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.050
We haven't invented separate
names for all of those.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:23.640
Once we got 100, 101
is the next number.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.470
So with Cantor, omega
plus 1, omega plus 2,

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.480
dot, dot, dot, omega
plus n typically,

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.520
and then omega plus omega,
which is omega times 2.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.930
Omega times 2 plus 1,
omega [SOUND EFFECT].

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:43.820
It goes on and on and on
and on and on and on and on.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.310
They're wonderful things,
Cantor's ordinal numbers.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.270
It means counting numbers.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.320
And then I found
some other numbers.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.360
In fact, I found more numbers
than anybody else-- far

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.860
more numbers than anybody else.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.060
In particular, there's
an infinitesimal number--

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:12.010
1 over omega and so on and
omega plus pi and omega minus 1

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.470
and all sorts of other things.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.530
So it gets a bit surreal.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.640
It's so horrendously
large, this world

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.460
of numbers, that I went around
in a daydream for about six

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.170
weeks-- permanent daydream.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.910
I could see these numbers
spread out in front of me,

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.660
or at least I tried to see them.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.140
And if was a huge world--
really huge-- of numbers.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.690
And I must admit that I thought,
hm, you discovered it, John.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.910
Nobody else had ever seen it.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:50.902
I'm John, by the way.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.260
And there's a thing
about [? stat courses ?]

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.969
crossing the American continent
and seeing the Pacific finally.

00:21:03.969 --> 00:21:04.760
He was [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.400
Of all he surveyed.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.680
Well, I was [INAUDIBLE]
of all he surveyed too--

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.320
of all I surveyed,
perhaps I should say.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.280
I wondered whether Cantor
had had similar feelings.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.080
Cantor eventually-- well, he was
institutionalized several times

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.060
and died in a lunatic asylum
in Halle, which later became

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.992
part of East Germany in 1918.

00:21:28.992 --> 00:21:30.878
A wonderful man.

00:21:30.878 --> 00:21:32.240
Yeah.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.570
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: And
you said that you're

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.940
disappointed that the surreals
haven't found a broader

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.180
application so far.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.280
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: I am.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.320
You see, Cantor's
infinite numbers

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.550
have found applications really
just within mathematics,

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.326
but still applications.

00:21:51.326 --> 00:21:52.700
It's only in
mathematics that you

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.265
want to count infinite sets.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.440
So I feel that the
surreal numbers

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.405
are so natural that they will
find an application someday.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.780
The truth is I'm
probably going to be dead

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.810
when they find an application.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.590
And I don't really like that.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.820
I was very pleased
to see that you

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.460
quote Peter Sarnak in the book
as saying the surreal numbers

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.000
will be applied someday.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.020
It's just a question of when.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.540
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
When and how, yeah.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:31.950
Now you had an encounter,
shall we say, with Kurt Godel.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.140
You had read
something that he said

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.450
that gave you hope that they
might crack open the continuum

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:38.010
hypothesis.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.340
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Godel
was the famous mathematical

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.610
logician-- in fact, the
mathematical logician

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:48.380
since Aristotle.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.530
Possibly one has to go
all the way back there.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.140
But anyway, he found
a tremendous amount

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.220
about mathematical logic.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.140
And in 1940 something-- I
always thought it was 1944,

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.590
but I think it's 1947-- he
wrote a paper called "What is

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.952
the Continuum Problem?".

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:09.920
The continuum
problem was the first

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.310
of the problems--
what were they called?

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:18.440
The Hilbert problems set
forth at the beginning

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.940
of the 20th century for
mathematicians to work on.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:30.860
It was sort of solved
in a sense in that it's

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.150
known that it doesn't follow
from the other axioms of set

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.160
theory and nor
does its negative.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.950
But that's not really
saying it was solved.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.240
It was unsolved in a way.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.762
But Cantor said in this
paper in the 1940s--

00:23:47.762 --> 00:23:48.720
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Godel.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.360
Godel said, yeah.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.443
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Sorry.

00:23:50.443 --> 00:23:52.750
Godel said that
perhaps we would only

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:55.720
know the solution of
the continuum problem

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.950
when we had the correct
theory of infinitesimals.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.910
And I thought I had the correct
theory of infinitesimals.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.763
So when I met Godel-- and
I can't quite remember--

00:24:09.763 --> 00:24:11.040
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: In the '70s.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:11.840
Early 1970s, yeah.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.881
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yeah.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.950
Well, I was overawed by meeting
the man, to tell you the truth.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:24.770
But I was keen to say I seem
to have the correct theory

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.160
of infinitesimals.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.810
Now tell me how that affects
the continuum problem.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:35.270
And he said, did
I really say that?

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.550
Oh well, I was wrong.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.026
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.950
Well, it's not kind to laugh
so uproariously because it

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.200
sort of shattered me in a way.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.116
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:24:47.116 --> 00:24:48.410
But I think there's still hope.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.370
I mean, there's been
people who've tried.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:55.820
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: I mean,
yeah, I think he was wrong,

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.840
too, actually.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.820
I mean, I couldn't see any
effect of it on the thing.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.370
That's why I really asked him.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.460
I mean, I couldn't
see any relation.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:11.245
And neither could he when he saw
what the surreals were about.

00:25:11.245 --> 00:25:13.370
I think he agreed that they
were the correct theory

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.200
of infinitesimals.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.770
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Now
the other contribution

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.450
that you're very proud
of is your free will

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.734
theorem with Simon Kochen.

00:25:24.734 --> 00:25:26.400
Do you want to tell
us a bit about that?

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:26.920
And then we can
take some questions.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.003
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: That's
a very strange theorem.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:37.970
It says subject to certain
facts about physics that are not

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:46.390
contentious among
physicists that if we have

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.250
free will-- that is to
say human experimenters

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.000
have a little bit of free will.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.230
They don't have
to have very much.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.630
That so do elementary
particles have

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.880
the same amount of free will.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:04.000
It's not so terribly
clear what free will is.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.640
But I'm just going to say I
don't believe my action there

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.500
in picking up this
whatever it is

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.370
and dropping it on the
floor was determined

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:21.280
by the positions of the
particles and momentum

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.660
and so on of particles at
the time of the Big Bang.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.700
I think that's really
rather ridiculous.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.290
And that's what strict
determinism says.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:37.550
And in Newtonian
mechanics that was true.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:41.800
[INAUDIBLE] the greatest
expert on Newtonian mechanics

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.650
said in several different
places that if an Intelligence--

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:51.940
this Intelligence was spelt
with a capital I-- knew

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.325
the positions of all
positions on momentum

00:26:55.325 --> 00:26:59.740
and so on, of all particles in
the world at any time t zero,

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.480
then that Intelligence
could deduce--

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.420
had to be pretty
intelligent, by the way--

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.670
could deduce their positions and
momenta at all related times.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.680
That's the property of
Newtonian mechanics.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.560
And therefore in
Newtonian mechanics--

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.380
if we suppose the Big
Bang known at the time

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:24.130
of Newtonian mechanics--
it would be true

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:29.610
that that action of mine in
dropping the whatever it is--

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.980
the Android something
or other-- on the floor

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.440
was determined at the
time of the Big Bang.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.660
I think that's absolutely
ridiculous to suppose that.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.490
But anyway, so let me tell
you what the free will

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.350
theorem says now.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.246
I believe-- but it's
irrelevant what I believe,

00:27:50.246 --> 00:27:51.620
so I shouldn't
even have told you

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:56.300
what I believe-- that
human experiments have

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.030
the property that they
compress-- suppose I have

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.370
a little box on this table.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.380
It's got a red button
and a green button,

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.240
or button A and button
B. Then I believe

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:12.370
that I can press either button
A or button B by a free will

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.310
decision that's independent
of the entire past history

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:18.860
of the universe
before I press them.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.640
That I call one bit of free
will-- one binary digit.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.500
I can make a binary choice
independent of the past history

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.040
of the universe.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.650
If that is true and various
things about quantum mechanics

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:39.170
and relativity are true-- or
even approximately true-- then

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:44.310
it follows that a spin one
particle that I'm experimenting

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:48.070
on can emerge along
either channel [? C ?]

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.750
or channel D in a manner
independent of the past history

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.240
of the universe.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.150
That's to say if I have
a certain property,

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.940
this spin one particle has
essentially the same property.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.180
It can make a binary decision.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.270
Well, it doesn't actually
make a binary decision.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.480
It doesn't have to think,
what am I going to do?

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.340
and then do it.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.400
It just does it.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.835
It does either C or D
in a manner independent

00:29:15.835 --> 00:29:17.350
of the past history
of the universe.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.990
That's a theorem.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.170
That's the free will
theorem that I'm saying.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:26.120
It depends on some
uncontentious facts

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:31.820
about physics, which it's
probably not a good idea for me

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.390
to enumerate right now, because,
I mean, as long as you know

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.360
that they're there-- and
physicists in general,

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.692
have no problem with those.

00:29:40.692 --> 00:29:42.816
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: And the
paper can be found online.

00:29:42.816 --> 00:29:44.149
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: It can, yes.

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:49.710
Actually there's a
strong version of it--

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.640
the most recent version of it
is called the strong free will

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.140
theorem.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.780
When we numerated-- well,
one particular-- one

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.640
of these uncontentious
properties

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.910
turned out to be
pretty contentious.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.000
That's the property
that I thought

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.710
would be the least contentious.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.060
It says, roughly, that
information cannot be

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.650
transmitted faster than
a certain finite speed,

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:22.590
which you know will
be the speed of light.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:28.940
However, that gave rise
to a lot of discussion

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.820
among a certain
group of physicists.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.371
What does it mean, information?

00:30:34.371 --> 00:30:34.870
Et cetera.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.350
We thought that that would be
the least troublesome thing,

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.730
but apparently not.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:49.680
However, most physicists-- it's
slightly fringe physicists who

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.205
find it problematic.

00:30:53.205 --> 00:30:55.580
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Now I guess
we could take some questions

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.990
if there are any questions.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.907
Or we can--

00:30:57.907 --> 00:30:59.240
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Oh, come on.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.510
We can't have frightened
you that much.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.630
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
Here's a question.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:08.010
AUDIENCE: First of all, sir, I'm
sorry about the identification

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:08.679
issue.

00:31:08.679 --> 00:31:10.220
It's a shame that
the security guards

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.340
didn't realize that you were
the Conway responsible for Life.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.735
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.300
My question actually,
though, is also about Life.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.480
And I know you feel
it didn't have--

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.438
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Ah!

00:31:22.438 --> 00:31:24.790
I hate Life.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.770
AUDIENCE: But don't
you see-- do you

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.670
think that there's a
line from your work

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.720
to Wolfram's new science book?

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.620
Don't you think he was
probably inspired--

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.870
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Listen.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:40.170
This is a problem for me.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:45.990
I don't want to say anything
negative about Wolfram.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.970
And so I don't want to say
anything about Wolfram.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.425
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.010
I knew Stephen Wolfram
a long time ago.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:03.280
I met him at a conference in
[INAUDIBLE] near Marseilles

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.600
in France, and walked with
him and Norman Packard

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.870
down to the beach.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.150
several times-- a
Mediterranean beach.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.530
And we discussed [INAUDIBLE]
all sorts of things.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.770
It's not a question
of a path from me

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:25.080
to Wolfram or from Wolfram
to me or anything like that.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.370
We had enjoyable
conversations then.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.062
You and I met him
fairly recently.

00:32:32.062 --> 00:32:33.020
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Mm-hm.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:33.520
Yeah.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.850
And I spoke to him
quite a for the book.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.910
He has very good archives,
whereas John does not.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.000
So that was a real find for me.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.630
And he was generous in helping
me out with a few things.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.255
But then he would
say, well, you should

00:32:46.255 --> 00:32:47.320
ask John for his letters.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.980
And I'm like, they don't exist.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.980
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yes.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.270
Wolfram didn't believe
that anybody could

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.960
be as unsystematic as I am.

00:32:57.572 --> 00:32:58.530
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Right.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:32:59.800
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Sorry.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.047
It hasn't answered your
question, but never mind.

00:33:02.047 --> 00:33:03.630
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
That's a good answer.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:04.796
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:33:04.796 --> 00:33:06.660
Question of a similar spirit.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:11.700
If you could comment on your
thoughts about either Dennett.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.920
Daniel Dennett
has done some work

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.690
on describing free will
as an emergent property

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:20.060
of determinism in
cellular automata, which

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.280
I think is kind of
relevant to your approach.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.550
Or on Whitehead's
process metaphysics

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.710
if you're interested
in the links between--

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:31.120
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: I
haven't heard of the latter.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.460
I'd love to meet Daniel Dennett.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.880
He wrote this interesting book
called, I think, "Elbow Room."

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.410
You may be familiar with it.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.900
I think the term--
I think that he

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.690
should know about the free will
theorem, to tell you the truth.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.710
It's rather strange.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.650
And I'm finding it hard to
articulate what I'm saying.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:06.450
Probably many
people in this room

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:10.560
have heard of the property
of quantum mechanics

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.239
that it only predicts
probabilities.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.569
It does not predict exactly what
happens in a given experiment.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:27.239
However, we use--
Simon Kochen and I

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:30.870
in proving our free
will theorem-- use

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.840
a part of quantum mechanics.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.179
In some circumstances it
predicts a probability of one

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.730
that something or other happens.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:43.545
That is really an absolute
prediction in a certain sense.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.949
However, what it predicts
is a relationship

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:56.270
between observations,
not a single observation.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:00.580
If you observe a
spin one particle,

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.307
work out what its
squared component of spin

00:35:03.307 --> 00:35:05.900
is in three
perpendicular directions,

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.000
you always get two
ones and a zero.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.650
And therefore if, for
instance, you just observe

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:16.060
two of those three directions
and see that two ones, then

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.650
the third direction you know
is a zero without looking.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.305
Equally, if you see a one and a
zero for two of the directions,

00:35:23.305 --> 00:35:24.680
you know that the
third direction

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.634
is a one without looking.

00:35:26.634 --> 00:35:27.550
So those are certain--

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.320
Oh, look, there is-- sorry.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.870
Look.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:35.185
There is a rather
remarkable model.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.820
Hm.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.170
I don't know.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:44.880
I feel it's a lost
cause if I try

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:50.159
to give some argument about
the free will theorem to you.

00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:52.200
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Well,
that's a good [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.400
I know-- I think
Daniel Dennett has

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.470
seen the paper because
I certainly spoke

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.920
to him a fair bit about it.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.420
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
Well, I haven't.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.300
And I'd love to.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.490
It sort of contradicts some of
the things he says in the book.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:04.840
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Right.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.006
Yeah, you two should
definitely have a conversation.

00:36:07.006 --> 00:36:08.400
That would be nice.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.520
Another question.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you
both for coming today.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.840
I was wondering if
you could flick back

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.010
to the very first slide.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.890
So there was a
photograph of yourself

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:18.385
quite a long time ago with
some electronic equipment.

00:36:18.385 --> 00:36:22.870
And there was a circular display
and a rectangular object-- here

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:23.830
it is-- on the table.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.080
And so we were just wondering
before the talk started,

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.197
what is this device that you
have here in front of you?

00:36:29.197 --> 00:36:31.030
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: I
can't actually see it.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.680
It seems--

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.200
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Oh, I'm
looking at an old PDP screen.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:36.700
Yes.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.620
OK.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.330
Yes.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:45.930
That was shortly after Life
came out and became very popular

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:46.430
and so on.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:56.100
The British "Sunday Times"
newspaper came and interviewed

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.200
me and a bunch of other
people at Cambridge

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.200
who were involved
in the Life Game.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:11.720
This was a PDP 7
or PDP 8 machine,

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.400
which was the first time
we actually programmed

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.730
Life on a computer
to see what happened.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.740
People regard it now as
a sort of computer game.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.920
We actually played it with
[INAUDIBLE] on Go boards.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:32.600
And this was the first time
that it became a computer game.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.725
And I was just
looking at the screen.

00:37:36.725 --> 00:37:38.600
AUDIENCE: What was the
input-output mechanism

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.904
to program the initial stage
and that sort of thing?

00:37:41.904 --> 00:37:43.820
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: I
don't honestly remember.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.820
You could, in some way,
set any number of cells

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:52.630
to be what you wanted them to
be and then press the button.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.460
And it moved on.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.090
This is a sort of typical
newspaper photograph.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:01.326
I mean, it's-- what do I mean?

00:38:01.326 --> 00:38:03.310
They take photographs
which are sort

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.430
of staged where you're
holding something and looking

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.032
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:10.032 --> 00:38:12.115
Well, you know what newspaper
photographs are like

00:38:12.115 --> 00:38:12.250
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.208
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Right.

00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:14.225
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.100
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Yes?

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.706
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming also.

00:38:16.706 --> 00:38:18.330
Getting back to the
free will theorem--

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:19.900
I forget if it's
in the paper itself

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.275
or in some of the interviews
you did around it-- you drew

00:38:22.275 --> 00:38:25.640
a distinction between the
idea of not being determined

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.690
by the past and not
being-- even in principle

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.349
predictable-- but a distinction
between that and randomness.

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:32.015
And I was unable to
find any place where

00:38:32.015 --> 00:38:33.600
you expanded on that
distinction. [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.599
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yes.

00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:36.530
I will be happy
to expand on it--

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.510
very much so-- Because
this is the one thing

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:42.030
that Simon Kochen and I--
you must not think it's

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.260
just my theorem.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.410
Simon Kochen is a colleague
of mine at Princeton.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:52.400
There's one thing that Simon
and I have discovered that seems

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.620
to have been totally new.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.760
And in particular,
Einstein got it wrong.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.570
That's something when you find
some way in which you can beat

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:06.620
Einstein, it's pretty good.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.160
So let me tell you what it is.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.100
In the free will theorem itself,
in the first version of it,

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:20.860
we prove that subject--
well, I stated it

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.590
before that if human
experimenters have

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.960
free will-- one
bit of free will,

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.610
they can make one
binary decision-- then

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:32.210
elementary particles, in
particular spin one particle,

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:36.030
has the same kind of free will.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:40.200
And that just means
independence of past history.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.380
You can make this decision
independent of past history.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:50.850
Well, now-- OK.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:56.970
That implies, by an argument I
call the backgammon argument,

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:02.972
that even-- how can I say it?

00:40:02.972 --> 00:40:08.600
Even if the world is
deterministic but based

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.340
on random numbers,
then still that

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.700
will not simulate the world.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:21.820
I mean, straight off it says the
world cannot be deterministic.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.160
The physical experiments
cannot be deterministic.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.980
But now people
have always opposed

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.680
to determinism randomness.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.150
OK?

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:37.200
But randomness doesn't cut it.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.614
If you suppose-- I mean,
it's easily-- I'm sorry.

00:40:41.614 --> 00:40:43.280
I'm finding it's
really rather difficult

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.250
to articulate what I'm saying.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:51.510
But even if you suppose that
the world operates according

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:57.280
to deterministic laws, but
that God is playing dice,

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.610
so to speak, and
those dice affect

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:08.240
what particles are doing, that's
not a sufficient explanation.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:14.690
The universe cannot be operated
or simulated by deterministic

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:19.150
laws plus random numbers
injected into the universe.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.870
AUDIENCE: Is there
proof of that?

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:22.420
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yes, and I
will give you the proof of it.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.130
And you can follow
the proof of it.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.650
Here is the way I believe
backgammon tournaments were

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.500
conducted at one time.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.980
What you need to
know about backgammon

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.140
is comparatively small.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:42.210
It is a game played with dice.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.450
And whether a move is legal
or not depends on what

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:48.310
the dice [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:51.170
And backgammon
tournaments used to be

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.820
conducted in the
following way, I believe.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:01.210
Well, you have, say, 50 tables
at which people-- at each table

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:05.300
two opponents are sitting
ready to move things.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:11.700
And the tournament director
says, the first throw is,

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.700
let us say a three and a five.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:23.100
And at 50 tables the person who
is first to move at that table

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.370
makes a move-- legal--
for a three and a five.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:30.710
And then the tournament
director says, the second throw

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.730
is double six.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.520
And then at the 50
tables the other player

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.590
makes a move-- legal--
for double six.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:40.780
So I hope you understand
the situation.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:46.130
Now suppose instead
of doing that,

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.060
instead of throwing
the dice-- sorry,

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.160
perhaps I should
say my model so far

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.880
has been the tournament
director throws the dice

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.910
and says the first throw is a
five and a three or whatever.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.750
But instead of doing that,
does it make any difference--

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.790
I'm going to say it obviously
doesn't-- if the tournament

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.710
director sits up in his
hotel room the night before

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:13.700
and throws the dice and records
a five and a three then throws

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.310
them again and records double
six and so on, and then just

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:20.810
reads them out on the next
day when the tournament takes

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:21.890
place?

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.500
That doesn't make
any difference.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.200
I hope people will see that that
doesn't make any difference.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:28.700
OK.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.590
So suppose God sat
up in his hotel room

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:39.150
the night before the universe
was constructed-- or started--

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.790
and threw the dice.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:46.270
All dice throwing can be
treated as past history.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.320
OK?

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.210
So do you understand?

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.400
I mean, so--

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] a
deterministic universe

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.660
with random [? oracles ?]
is really still

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.250
just a deterministic universe
because the [? oracles ?] might

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.460
as well have been preloaded.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.459
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yes.

00:44:01.459 --> 00:44:04.160
I mean, the random
numbers can be

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.470
thrown before the
universe starts--

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:10.380
or really independently
of time, I mean.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:16.680
And so the proof of the
original free will theorem,

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.470
which says that
the universe can't

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:28.850
be simulated by
deterministic laws in terms--

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:33.230
and depending only
on past history now

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:36.230
says it can't be simulated
by deterministic laws

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:40.885
depending on past history and
random numbers-- God's dice.

00:44:40.885 --> 00:44:42.510
AUDIENCE: Because
those are effectively

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.202
part of past history.

00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:43.685
They might [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:43.685 --> 00:44:44.360
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yeah.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.250
You can treat them as
part of past history

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.630
with-- I hope you see it.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.715
Nobody else seems to have
made that rather trivial

00:44:50.715 --> 00:44:52.690
observation.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:59.920
And you see, so here's this
famous saying of Einstein,

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.695
I cannot believe that God
plays dice with the universe.

00:45:05.181 --> 00:45:07.680
Well, it doesn't matter if God
plays dice with the universe.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.845
It makes no difference.

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:23.200
So, yes, the opposite of
deterministic is not random.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:23.930
It's free.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.615
And I don't quite
know what free is,

00:45:29.615 --> 00:45:36.029
but it's not the same
as random because I know

00:45:36.029 --> 00:45:37.320
something about what random is.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.790
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Next question.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.290
AUDIENCE: I'm sure you were
asked a lot of questions

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:44.914
throughout the whole
biography process.

00:45:44.914 --> 00:45:46.940
So I was wondering which
questions you thought

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.320
were the most effective in
understanding the way that you

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.094
think about the world
and if you could

00:45:51.094 --> 00:45:53.260
give a brief answer to maybe
one of those questions.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.050
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
That's to me, is it?

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:55.925
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Yes.

00:45:55.925 --> 00:45:58.700
Which of my questions were
most effective in eliciting

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.980
a description of how you
think about the world?

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.680
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
I don't know.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.900
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: I tend
to circle around and ask

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.670
a lot of questions
again and again,

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:15.700
trying to follow my curiosity
and dig around here and there.

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:20.540
It's a very messy process.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.510
So I don't know if
I would've put--

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.710
I think, for me, what
really illuminated

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:31.360
it was letting John
talk and trying

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.400
to capture that
to whatever degree

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.120
I thought would be
understandable to a fairly

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.640
broad audience.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.240
And you are famous for
being able to explain things

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.530
to any audience really and
grabbing somebody on the street

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.020
and buttonholing
them and telling them

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.380
about the free will theorem
because you want everybody

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.150
to know and understand it.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:56.530
So I think it was less
questions-- or not so much

00:46:56.530 --> 00:47:00.400
questions as trying
to paint the picture.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.390
Show, don't tell.

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:03.820
So show the man in action.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.490
And so I think you really
do get a sense of how

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:10.140
John is in the world in the
book because I'm portraying it.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.460
I'm not trying to
explain it myself.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:13.770
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yeah.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:15.280
While you've been
talking, I've been

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.880
trying to answer the
lady's question myself.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.140
And I can't do it.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.860
I really don't know which
has been most effective.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.180
I suppose the reader of
the book is the person

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.470
to answer that question.

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.400
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Hm.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.930
I think most people find that
you speaking in your own font

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.830
does work, which
was a bit of a risk.

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:42.630
And my editor was calling
it experimental for a while.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.550
She was quite scared
of the whole thing

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:45.910
because it's unconventional.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:48.380
You're supposed to put
quotes in quotation marks

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.479
and the narrator is supposed
to maintain total control.

00:47:51.479 --> 00:47:53.270
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: A
number of my-- sorry.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.710
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: No, no.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.460
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: A
number of my friends

00:47:55.460 --> 00:48:01.070
who have read the book say,
oh, she's caught you exactly.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:05.140
So I mean, that's--
well, of course,

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.910
she caught me by just standing
her damn tape recorder

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:14.780
on the arm of the-- we sat
together in two adjacent chairs

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:19.000
whose arms had a little flat
surface and she put her damn

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.120
tape recorder in between
and switched it on.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:28.310
And so she actually got
my words, all right.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:31.110
Of course that meant,
I suppose, that she

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:35.720
was probing and prodding
in the right places

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.984
to get these words to come out.

00:48:39.984 --> 00:48:42.400
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: But you like
to talk, and I'm a listener.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.850
So it was the perfect
match made in heaven.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.180
John talks and talks and talks.

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:49.352
And you're interesting,
so I was happy to listen

00:48:49.352 --> 00:48:50.185
for hours and hours.

00:48:50.185 --> 00:48:51.830
I have hundreds of
hours of interviews.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:52.829
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yes.

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:54.876
How many hours, do you
think, all together?

00:48:54.876 --> 00:48:56.542
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
Easily several hundred.

00:48:56.542 --> 00:48:56.974
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Really?

00:48:56.974 --> 00:48:58.515
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
Yeah, I would think.

00:48:58.515 --> 00:49:01.001
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
I was guessing 300.

00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:02.500
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.120
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
Yeah, it seems so long.

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.078
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Scary.

00:49:05.078 --> 00:49:07.730
I know far too
much about you now.

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:11.349
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yeah,
you do know certain things.

00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:12.640
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Next question.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.860
AUDIENCE: So when
I was growing up,

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.490
my parents had this
rather colorful book--

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:22.105
in both meanings of word-- red
cover with a white illustration

00:49:22.105 --> 00:49:22.605
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:22.605 --> 00:49:24.310
And I read that when
I was growing up.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.670
I was around 11, didn't
understand most of it,

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.470
but it felt very
interesting in general.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.316
And when I read it
again a few years later

00:49:31.316 --> 00:49:32.690
when I was an
undergraduate and I

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:34.650
knew what mathematical
rigor was,

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:36.900
and I discovered
all sorts of things

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.550
that were even more interesting
that I didn't learn before.

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:42.160
And when I read it
again a few years later

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.530
when I was a graduate student--

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:44.580
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
And what book is this?

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:44.930
Sorry.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:45.471
Say it again.

00:49:45.471 --> 00:49:47.150
AUDIENCE: So this
is "Winning Ways."

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.050
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
"Winning Ways."

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.839
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:48.839 --> 00:49:50.380
And at every level
that I've read it,

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.660
I've read it a few times.

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:56.230
And every time it's
interesting and every time I

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.235
find out a bit more.

00:49:57.235 --> 00:49:58.610
And the question
is basically, is

00:49:58.610 --> 00:49:59.901
this sort of thing intentional?

00:49:59.901 --> 00:50:03.130
Was it designed to be
accessible at all levels?

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:05.815
Or did it just sort
of fall out that way?

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.905
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: This is
a book about children's games

00:50:11.905 --> 00:50:13.960
really.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.840
And so let me proceed
for a little bit

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.620
without attempting to answer
your question because I

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:22.110
have to describe what
the book is like.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:26.100
This is a book that Elwyn
Berlekamp, Richard Guy,

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:30.860
and I wrote about how to
play children's games.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.480
Incidentally, I would love to
play Dots and Boxes with any

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:40.760
of you later on to show you how
good the book is, so to speak.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.430
It does really give us
information about how

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:45.470
to play children's games.

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:47.400
Why children's games?

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.330
Well, because if you
take grown-up games,

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:52.890
like chess and Go
and so on, there's

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:57.340
really no hope of
getting a theory out,

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:58.900
whereas with
children's games you

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:04.420
can quite often get a rigorous
theory that tells you how

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.730
to win and if you're winning.

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:15.290
And it's surprisingly
subtle, as I think

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.200
this gentleman made clear.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:24.990
I don't know how it--
whether this effect you're

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:27.810
saying of-- I mean, I'm
pleased to hear your comments.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.060
Actually, in a way, I'm
displeased as well because--

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.351
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:34.010
--we tried to write
it so that you could

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:35.530
understand it straight away.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:39.110
And if indeed it's true that
you have to come back to it

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:43.975
and come back to it, it's
not exactly a compliment.

00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:45.350
AUDIENCE: When I
was 12, I didn't

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:48.769
know what a class was or
[INAUDIBLE] theory was.

00:51:48.769 --> 00:51:49.810
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yeah.

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:52.490
No, I'm not complaining really.

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:54.360
I mean, things are
as they are anyway,

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.969
not as we'd like them to be.

00:51:56.969 --> 00:51:59.010
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: But in
a way that sort of nicely

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:04.250
captures you in that you are--
you're very sophisticated,

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.295
but you're also very
childish all rolled into one.

00:52:07.295 --> 00:52:08.670
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
I'm childish?

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.850
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Childish,
juvenile, but yet,

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:17.020
a very refined intellectual.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.020
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yes.

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:23.400
Actually I remember
telling Siobhan not

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.010
to romanticize complexity.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.740
The great discoveries,
at least in my subject,

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:37.800
are not made by doing
complicated things.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.700
They are the
discoveries that tell

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:44.150
you very, very simple things
that people haven't really

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:45.740
noticed.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:52.990
Actually the case I just
mentioned before of randomness

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:56.080
not cutting it, so to speak,
in the free will theorem

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.490
is an instance of this.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:02.300
Look, that's a very, very
simple observation, OK?

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.180
Einstein didn't make it.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.610
Isn't that fantastic?

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:11.860
I feel so proud that we
made this observation which

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.780
I can explain to this
audience quite easily.

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:19.070
Einstein didn't get it.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:21.860
It's absolutely fantastic.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.230
Einstein made lots of
simple observations.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:28.200
Einstein's observations were
not-- he wasn't terribly good

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.420
at mathematics, as he says
himself in certain places.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:36.120
He didn't know certain
abstract theories.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:40.520
But he thought in a
very, very simple way.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.644
This is just one of
the simple things

00:53:42.644 --> 00:53:43.810
that Einstein didn't notice.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.300
Actually it may be the only one.

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.880
I don't know.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:54.565
So, I mean, it's hard to
make new simple discoveries.

00:53:54.565 --> 00:53:57.760
It really is.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:01.170
When you make them, of course,
everybody understands them.

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:03.229
I hope.

00:54:03.229 --> 00:54:05.770
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: So maybe we'll
take a couple more questions.

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:07.024
And then--

00:54:07.024 --> 00:54:07.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.126
My question is more
on building on that

00:54:10.126 --> 00:54:14.760
thought that there are some
discoveries that you keep

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.210
figuring out as you
go through your day

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:19.380
while playing some
game, say tic-tac-toe.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.560
And the first time I'd
realized when I was a kid,

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.800
oh, this can be
won all the time.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.380
That's the basic that
a child first learns.

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:32.260
And then some games you can
count plus 11 each time, plus 1

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:32.760
to 10.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.385
Then you realize if
you start with one,

00:54:34.385 --> 00:54:35.560
that you'll always win.

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.960
And there are certain
games, but they actually

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.750
[INAUDIBLE] game [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.780
But they don't really
cut into applications

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.840
that you also mentioned
that hopefully you're

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.980
seeing hopefully
before-- in your lifetime

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.770
you would like to see some
application of the theory.

00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:54.990
So what are the
theories you think

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:59.100
will actually be most
profound in a decade or two?

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.690
And then you'll be
really proud of those.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:04.250
JOHN HORTON CONWAY:
It's hard to say.

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:07.350
I mean, I'd like to
get back, in a way,

00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:10.330
to the surreal numbers, because
the surreal numbers were

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:14.160
an application of playing games.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.310
At one time the
British Go champion

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:21.000
was a member of the Cambridge
University mathematics

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.320
department.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.440
Many of you will
know the game of Go.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.370
Many of you will not probably.

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:31.760
But I tried to
understand-- he brought

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.410
in various friends of his
and they played Go games.

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:37.490
And in Cambridge
people would stand

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:40.730
around kibitzing or
asking each other what

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:42.960
this move-- why this move
was better than that move

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.380
and so on.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:50.080
I tried to understand these
comments and never did.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:54.260
Let me say I never understood
much about Go anyway.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:59.580
But I did notice that
near the end of the game,

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:04.960
Go broke up into a
sum of smaller games.

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.310
And I had been
meaning to analyze

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:15.300
the notion of sum of smaller
games for quite some time.

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:19.110
And that prompted me
to actually do it.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:22.760
And then I discovered,
in particular,

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.810
that some games
behaved like numbers.

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.600
I now say [? were ?] numbers.

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:34.810
And notice that you've
got a simpler development

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:41.030
of the theory of real numbers
by just regarding them as games.

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:44.050
There's an application
of childish game

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:45.890
theory to numbers.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.905
But it didn't stop
at the real numbers.

00:56:51.905 --> 00:56:55.830
It went on to the
surreal numbers.

00:56:55.830 --> 00:57:05.770
And that's a lovely thing
for me because I like-- well,

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:08.660
in England we say taking the
[? mickey ?] out of people.

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:11.800
I mean, it means-- I suppose
it means taking the microphone,

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.600
but I'm not sure.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:17.110
It means making fun of
people who are particularly

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:19.960
pompous or something.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:28.220
And here is this serious
theory of the foundations

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.340
of the real numbers
and everything

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:34.560
which was developed in the 19th
century by people with beards.

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:42.120
And it came out-- I mean,
this is a simpler theory

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.700
than that that came
out of studying

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:50.020
childish games in a way
that people hadn't thought

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.730
was worthwhile before.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:54.110
So there's an application.

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:57.730
It's not quite what
you're talking about.

00:57:57.730 --> 00:58:00.395
In fact, it's an application--
you were talking about sort

00:58:00.395 --> 00:58:02.940
of [INAUDIBLE] [? implies ?]
[? C, ?] B applied to C.

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:08.830
This is A applied to
B. But it's amazing.

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:14.910
I find mathematics-- I've
always found mathematics

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:17.540
really astonishing
because I don't

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.490
know where it all comes from.

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:26.150
I don't know what the ontology
of mathematical ideas is.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:32.990
Where is two or three or omega?

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:39.370
Wherever they are, it's a place
that has a certain stability.

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:43.630
I like to compare
numbers to cats.

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:47.580
Well, you see, there's
no doubt that cats exist.

00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.690
And part of the reason
I'm sure about that

00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:56.530
is that when you push
a cat, it pushes back.

00:58:56.530 --> 00:59:00.570
It doesn't want to go in
the direction you push it.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:04.300
It wants to do its own thing.

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.980
The same is true of numbers.

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:10.200
I mean, you can't make
numbers do what they don't

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.567
want to do in a certain sense.

00:59:12.567 --> 00:59:15.150
Of course, numbers are different
to cats in some other senses.

00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:16.272
I realize that.

00:59:16.272 --> 00:59:16.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:22.770
When you're a
little toddler, you

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:27.470
scream to your
mother about things.

00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.530
I don't know.

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:31.670
And your mother responds.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:35.470
Your father might
respond too, but anyway.

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:38.740
You don't scream at the wall.

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:42.300
The wall interferes with
your natural progression.

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:46.347
You just can't walk through
walls, but you don't try.

00:59:46.347 --> 00:59:48.930
And you don't scream at the wall
in order [INAUDIBLE] let you.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:56.400
What I'm trying to
say is obstinacy

00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.205
of things is some kind of
mark of real existence.

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.360
OK.

01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:15.000
Well, I don't know.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.920
I've been worried
about the sense

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.390
in which mathematical notions
exist for a very long time--

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:27.470
ever since I was about 10
probably-- but with gradually

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:30.416
increasing knowledge
and [? abilities ?]

01:00:30.416 --> 01:00:34.730
and so on of the way in
which things [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:35.940
How do they exist?

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.390
I mean, they seem to.

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:38.710
And the existence--

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:42.600
People are very confused.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.022
They think that things
like two are concepts.

01:00:47.022 --> 01:00:48.310
They aren't.

01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:52.150
A concept means something
we conceive in our heads.

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:56.310
Well, two was there a long time
before there were any people

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.790
to conceive things.

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:01.250
The statement that Mars has
two satellites-- they're

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:05.060
called Phobos and
Deimos now-- was true

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.980
long before there were
any humans to conceive.

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:14.050
So abstract things are
not the same as concepts.

01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:19.170
A unicorn isn't the same as
the concept of a unicorn.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:21.800
The concept of a unicorn exists.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.020
Unicorns don't.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.080
The concept of a horse exists.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.180
Horses do too.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.970
Well, I don't understand it.

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.760
I've been thinking about
it for a long, long time

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.920
and at different
degrees of depth.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.240
You see, when things
get a little bit more

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:48.540
abstract or a little bit
more infinite or something,

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:52.100
the problems are still the same.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:02:00.690
Omega, this infinite number
I spoke of, it exists.

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:07.170
It's not so easy to see
how its existence differs

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:11.710
from the existence of two, but--

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:13.019
My.

01:02:13.019 --> 01:02:13.560
I don't know.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.060
I'm sorry.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.160
I'm just going to lapse
into incomprehensibility.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.152
I'd better just stop.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:20.610
SIOBHAN ROBERTS:
Well, maybe that's

01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:21.905
a good place to conclude.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:22.946
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: Yeah.

01:02:22.946 --> 01:02:23.600
OK.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.120
Now listen--

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.411
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: We can break--

01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:28.037
JOHN HORTON CONWAY: --come and
play Dots and Boxes with me.

01:02:28.037 --> 01:02:29.620
SIOBHAN ROBERTS: Or
we could-- I think

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.020
you're probably willing to
also take a few more questions.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.500
We could maybe give people a
chance to disperse if you want.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.875
But if you have
more questions, I

01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:37.702
think we'd be happy
to receive them.

01:02:37.702 --> 01:02:39.160
Thank you all very
much for coming.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.510
And thank you for having us.

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:43.860
[APPLAUSE]
