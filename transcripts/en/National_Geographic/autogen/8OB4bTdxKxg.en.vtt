what I have seen the leopard trying to

00:24:24.039 --> 00:24:24.049
what I have seen the leopard trying to
 

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:26.529

00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919
capitalize to catch these porcupines if
 

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:36.430
capitalize to catch these porcupines if
not that they try to see if they can

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440
not that they try to see if they can
 

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.950
not that they try to see if they can
have an opportunity to turn the occupy

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960
have an opportunity to turn the occupy
 

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.999
have an opportunity to turn the occupy
and so that they can catch them so but

00:24:42.999 --> 00:24:43.009
and so that they can catch them so but
 

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:44.950
and so that they can catch them so but
the leopard has to be very hungry to go

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960
the leopard has to be very hungry to go
 

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.119
the leopard has to be very hungry to go

after the porcupine
 

00:24:46.129 --> 00:24:48.220
after the porcupine
I don't think a leopard which has got

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:48.230
I don't think a leopard which has got
 

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.989
I don't think a leopard which has got
quite a little food can get quite a lot

00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:49.999
quite a little food can get quite a lot
 

00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:52.930
quite a little food can get quite a lot
of motivation to go after the pack of

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080
 

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.720
so there's very fresh tracks of the

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:08.730
so there's very fresh tracks of the
 

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.669
so there's very fresh tracks of the
elephants here we might be lucky with

00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679
elephants here we might be lucky with
 

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:27.260
elephants here we might be lucky with
the elephants in this area

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:27.270
 

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.260
Paul the animals are so very much

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:31.270
Paul the animals are so very much
 

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.980
Paul the animals are so very much
unpredictable and I will give you a very

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:34.990
unpredictable and I will give you a very
 

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.020
unpredictable and I will give you a very
good example maybe this is something you

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:37.030
good example maybe this is something you
 

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.990
good example maybe this is something you
have here before not long time ago we

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000
have here before not long time ago we
 

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.770
have here before not long time ago we
have witnessed a female leopard which

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:43.780
have witnessed a female leopard which
 

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.400
have witnessed a female leopard which
was killed by tenganan so Okubo and

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:47.410
was killed by tenganan so Okubo and
 

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.180
was killed by tenganan so Okubo and
Kalama the interaction they can be very

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:51.190
Kalama the interaction they can be very
 

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.360
Kalama the interaction they can be very
much unpredictable so if they meet the

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:54.370
much unpredictable so if they meet the
 

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.340
much unpredictable so if they meet the
chances of Okamura to take action

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:56.350
chances of Okamura to take action
 

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.770
chances of Okamura to take action
against Kalama they are also very much

00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:58.780
against Kalama they are also very much
 

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:05.940
against Kalama they are also very much
hi so normally we see the females

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:05.950
hi so normally we see the females
 

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.030
hi so normally we see the females
fighting the same sex and we see the

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.040
fighting the same sex and we see the
 

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.310
fighting the same sex and we see the
males against the same sex but it is

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320
males against the same sex but it is
 

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.740
males against the same sex but it is
very much rare to find that a male is

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:13.750
very much rare to find that a male is
 

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:18.840
very much rare to find that a male is
killing a female so that is why it's

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:18.850
killing a female so that is why it's
 

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.420
killing a female so that is why it's
important sometimes to consider the

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:21.430
important sometimes to consider the
 

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.450
important sometimes to consider the
behavior of animals we are seeing rather

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:24.460
behavior of animals we are seeing rather
 

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.880
behavior of animals we are seeing rather
than just focusing on the text books

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:26.890
than just focusing on the text books
 

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.550
than just focusing on the text books
because the text books sometimes they do

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:29.560
because the text books sometimes they do
 

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.980
because the text books sometimes they do
contradict what we are seeing here out

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:31.990
contradict what we are seeing here out
 

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.920
contradict what we are seeing here out
in the world so sometimes we talk about

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:34.930
in the world so sometimes we talk about
 

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.110
in the world so sometimes we talk about
what we are witnessing which is

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120
what we are witnessing which is
 

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.480
what we are witnessing which is
completely different from what we are

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:39.490
completely different from what we are
 

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.970
completely different from what we are
reading on this different menus we are

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:41.980
reading on this different menus we are
 

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.850
reading on this different menus we are
studying most of the time so there is

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:44.860
studying most of the time so there is
 

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.890
studying most of the time so there is
quite a lot of things that are not yet

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:46.900
quite a lot of things that are not yet
 

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.710
quite a lot of things that are not yet
discovered on these animals and some of

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720
discovered on these animals and some of
 

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.360
discovered on these animals and some of
these discoveries because we are sparing

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:51.370
these discoveries because we are sparing
 

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.550
these discoveries because we are sparing
much time with these animals we see

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:53.560
much time with these animals we see
 

00:26:53.560 --> 00:27:12.850
much time with these animals we see
things which are totally unusual

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:12.860
 

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.389

was convinced otherwise anyway it turns
 

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.030
was convinced otherwise anyway it turns
out that an entire family of rodents has

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040
out that an entire family of rodents has
 

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.820
out that an entire family of rodents has
moved in underneath of the tent and as a

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:16.830
moved in underneath of the tent and as a
 

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.930
moved in underneath of the tent and as a
result we now have large holes in the

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940
result we now have large holes in the
 

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.300
result we now have large holes in the
form of tunnels that move all the way

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:23.310
form of tunnels that move all the way
 

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.389

through the floor of the test meaning

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399
through the floor of the test meaning
 

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:28.040
through the floor of the test meaning
that if jean dre falls over it's

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.050
that if jean dre falls over it's
 

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:29.990
that if jean dre falls over it's
probably not his fault at least in this

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000
probably not his fault at least in this
 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.450
probably not his fault at least in this
particular case it's because the chair

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.460
particular case it's because the chair
 

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.960
particular case it's because the chair
goes over backwards yeah exactly exactly

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:34.970
goes over backwards yeah exactly exactly
 

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:37.129
goes over backwards yeah exactly exactly

underneath our tent we haven't quite
 

00:34:42.359 --> 00:34:43.890
underneath our tent we haven't quite
figured out it

00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:43.900
figured out it
 

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.390
figured out it
actually what it is we're going to do

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:45.400
actually what it is we're going to do
 

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.770
actually what it is we're going to do
about it but while we sort of

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:46.780
about it but while we sort of
 

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.980
about it but while we sort of
problem-solve and brainstorm that we see

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:49.990
problem-solve and brainstorm that we see
 

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:53.340
problem-solve and brainstorm that we see
amazing things on our live safaris we

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:53.350
amazing things on our live safaris we
 

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.950
amazing things on our live safaris we
see lions we see lepers we see elephants

see lions we see lepers we see elephants
 

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.100

excited about is grass now we try and

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:08.260
excited about is grass now we try and
 

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.950

meter out the chests that we have about

meter out the chests that we have about
 

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.660
meter out the chests that we have about
grass because sometimes it gets so

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:12.670
grass because sometimes it gets so

overwhelmingly exciting that people
actually can't take it and sometimes we

actually can't take it and sometimes we
 

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.590
actually can't take it and sometimes we
get reports of or viewers fainting when

get reports of or viewers fainting when
 

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.720
get reports of or viewers fainting when
we overdo the grass segments but today

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:21.730
we overdo the grass segments but today
 

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:24.060
we overdo the grass segments but today
we're going to take that risk because

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.070
we're going to take that risk because
 

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:26.490
we're going to take that risk because

opportunity to tell you all about
 

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.310
opportunity to tell you all about
grasses is relatively limited because

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320
grasses is relatively limited because

grasses is relatively limited because
once they disappear then I have to tell

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:46.810
once they disappear then I have to tell
 

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.840
once they disappear then I have to tell
you there's not one among us who can

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:48.850
you there's not one among us who can
 

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.190
you there's not one among us who can

of grass and another it is only at this
 

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.480
of grass and another it is only at this

know when we have a whole host of
different grasses here what shall we do

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000
different grasses here what shall we do
 

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.030
different grasses here what shall we do
with them how can we make this slightly

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040
with them how can we make this slightly
 

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.520
with them how can we make this slightly
more exciting and I thought well I do

the easiest of all of them I'm not going
to tell you what it is and I will only

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:40.150
to tell you what it is and I will only
 

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.690
to tell you what it is and I will only
tell you what each grass species is in

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:42.700
tell you what each grass species is in
 

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.599

the next segment that I do how does that
sound so we're going to have a look at

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680
sound so we're going to have a look at

fact what it has in common with the
 

01:31:55.150 --> 01:31:57.450

other two grasses would mean that it is

other two grasses would mean that it is
 

01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:00.170
other two grasses would mean that it is
in fact almost the complete opposite of

01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:07.530
something known as pioneer species I
make me write that pretty certain I can

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:14.850
 

01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:16.110
okay

01:33:16.110 --> 01:33:16.120
okay
 

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.840
okay
pioneer grass you can think about what

01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:26.580
across to our current Leopard pioneer
who's pioneered his way all the way into

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:26.590
who's pioneered his way all the way into
 

01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:36.610
who's pioneered his way all the way into
the center of jummah over the last year

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:36.620
 

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:39.890
nevermind you're not going anywhere okay

01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:39.900
nevermind you're not going anywhere okay
 

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:41.270
nevermind you're not going anywhere okay
pioneer species

01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280
pioneer species
 

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.930
pioneer species
so what pioneer species means is

01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:43.940
so what pioneer species means is
 

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:46.610
so what pioneer species means is
essentially in an area like this like

01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:46.620
essentially in an area like this like
 

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:49.850
essentially in an area like this like
outside our beloved tent it's an area

01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:49.860
outside our beloved tent it's an area
 

01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:51.470
outside our beloved tent it's an area
where the soil has been disturbed

01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480
where the soil has been disturbed
 

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.690
where the soil has been disturbed
through various reasons whether it's

01:33:53.690 --> 01:33:53.700
through various reasons whether it's
 

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:56.270
through various reasons whether it's
foot traffic or in this particular case

01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280
foot traffic or in this particular case
 

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:59.240
foot traffic or in this particular case
probably because of the quite rocky soil

01:33:59.240 --> 01:33:59.250
probably because of the quite rocky soil
 

01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:02.150
probably because of the quite rocky soil
so quite a thin soil layer and a

01:34:02.150 --> 01:34:02.160
so quite a thin soil layer and a
 

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.100
so quite a thin soil layer and a
drainage line just over there so

01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:04.110
drainage line just over there so
 

01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:05.420
drainage line just over there so
basically what's happened is loss of

quarantine and washed down and as a
consequence taken away a lot of the

consequence taken away a lot of the
 

01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:18.290
consequence taken away a lot of the
nutrient-rich soils now pioneer grasses

01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:18.300
nutrient-rich soils now pioneer grasses
 

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:20.690
nutrient-rich soils now pioneer grasses

specialize in this kind of environment
and that's why you always find these

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:22.590
and that's why you always find these
 

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:25.460
and that's why you always find these

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:39.650
shouldn't really be around here too much
 

01:34:39.650 --> 01:34:42.980
shouldn't really be around here too much
but we do occasionally see black Jack's

01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:42.990
but we do occasionally see black Jack's
 

01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:44.750
but we do occasionally see black Jack's
but it's not black jack something that

but it's not black jack something that
 

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.900

black jack so while you think about it
 

01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:52.430
black jack so while you think about it

that isn't in very good condition
grasses that capitalize on that and

just lost another big piece there and
 

01:36:07.469 --> 01:36:11.870
just lost another big piece there and
that piece might invite the hyenas as I

01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880
that piece might invite the hyenas as I
 

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:14.449
that piece might invite the hyenas as I
saw a big piece just falling down and a

01:36:14.449 --> 01:36:14.459
saw a big piece just falling down and a
 

01:36:14.459 --> 01:36:19.790
saw a big piece just falling down and a

few minutes ago you can see it's going
 

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.879
few minutes ago you can see it's going
down that to go and take what is just

01:36:22.879 --> 01:36:22.889
down that to go and take what is just
 

01:36:22.889 --> 01:36:28.219
down that to go and take what is just
lost look at that he doesn't know what

lost look at that he doesn't know what
 

01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:30.770
lost look at that he doesn't know what
what what to do but I can see that he's

01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780
what what to do but I can see that he's
 

01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.229
what what to do but I can see that he's
got the two minds look at him now coming

01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239
got the two minds look at him now coming
 

01:36:33.239 --> 01:36:36.620
got the two minds look at him now coming
down he just lost a piece there you can

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:36.630
down he just lost a piece there you can
 

01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:39.290
down he just lost a piece there you can
see things are coming out from the date

01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300
see things are coming out from the date
 

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:49.810

the porcupine

01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:49.820
 

01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:52.120
but he might pick up some of the pieces

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:52.130
but he might pick up some of the pieces
 

01:36:52.130 --> 01:37:06.560
but he might pick up some of the pieces
and get them back again up into the tree

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:06.570
 

01:37:06.570 --> 01:37:09.330
let's hope we doesn't feed in there as

01:37:09.330 --> 01:37:09.340
let's hope we doesn't feed in there as
 

01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:12.120
let's hope we doesn't feed in there as
it is not a nice place we can't see him

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:12.130
it is not a nice place we can't see him
 

01:37:12.130 --> 01:37:14.189
it is not a nice place we can't see him
nicely but you can see that the stomach

01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:14.199
nicely but you can see that the stomach
 

01:37:14.199 --> 01:37:17.160
nicely but you can see that the stomach
is open the occupying is now excluding

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:17.170
is open the occupying is now excluding
 

01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:22.410
is open the occupying is now excluding
things from the stomach I up there you

01:37:22.410 --> 01:37:22.420
things from the stomach I up there you
 

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:24.060
things from the stomach I up there you
can see all the fluids are starting to

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:24.070
can see all the fluids are starting to
 

01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:26.640
can see all the fluids are starting to
come down there you can see the things

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:26.650
come down there you can see the things
 

01:37:26.650 --> 01:37:28.140
come down there you can see the things
coming from this time are coming out

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:28.150
coming from this time are coming out
 

01:37:28.150 --> 01:37:37.200
coming from this time are coming out
look at that so those are the things

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:37.210
look at that so those are the things
 

01:37:37.210 --> 01:37:38.910
look at that so those are the things
which are coming down at the moment from

01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:38.920
which are coming down at the moment from
 

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:47.990
which are coming down at the moment from
the stomach

01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000
 

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.180
so I can see that here way is he's

01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:50.190
so I can see that here way is he's
 

01:37:50.190 --> 01:37:52.900
so I can see that here way is he's
trying to feed now on the pieces that

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:52.910
trying to feed now on the pieces that
 

01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:55.910
trying to feed now on the pieces that
fell on the ground and you can see he's

01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920
fell on the ground and you can see he's
 

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.340
fell on the ground and you can see he's
even going down at the moment so he

01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:58.350
even going down at the moment so he
 

01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:00.740
even going down at the moment so he
doesn't want any of his competitor to

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:00.750
doesn't want any of his competitor to
 

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:13.620
doesn't want any of his competitor to
come here and get anything

01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:13.630
 

01:38:13.630 --> 01:38:18.240
so the hyenas are not here at all but

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:18.250
so the hyenas are not here at all but
 

01:38:18.250 --> 01:38:20.820
so the hyenas are not here at all but
maybe because now the stomach is open

01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:20.830
maybe because now the stomach is open
 

01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:23.010
maybe because now the stomach is open
they might pick up the signal and come

01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:23.020
they might pick up the signal and come
 

01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.820
they might pick up the signal and come
to this port this is not very far away

01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:26.830

from the hyena den the Jew Monday
they're just about three four minutes

01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:32.380
they're just about three four minutes
 

01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:38.100
they're just about three four minutes
away from here so we're just going to be

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:38.110
away from here so we're just going to be
 

01:38:38.110 --> 01:38:41.370

here until he goes back again high up

01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:41.380
here until he goes back again high up
 

01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:44.070
here until he goes back again high up
into the tree and carry on feeding I can

01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080
into the tree and carry on feeding I can
 

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.930
into the tree and carry on feeding I can
see that at the moment he's feeding on

01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:45.940
see that at the moment he's feeding on
 

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:48.090
see that at the moment he's feeding on
the ground and it's not easy for us to

01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:48.100
the ground and it's not easy for us to
 

01:38:48.100 --> 01:39:27.320
the ground and it's not easy for us to
access him

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:27.330
 

01:39:27.330 --> 01:39:29.620
so you can see that it was a big piece

01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:29.630
so you can see that it was a big piece
 

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:31.940
so you can see that it was a big piece
which is on the ground there because

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:31.950
which is on the ground there because
 

01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:33.920
which is on the ground there because

just keep feeding the battling with
those quills you can see how it is

01:39:41.110 --> 01:39:41.120
those quills you can see how it is
 

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.340
those quills you can see how it is
moving the head that is battling with

into the tree and he is just lying down
 

02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:39.770
into the tree and he is just lying down
here very much next he knows that his

02:24:39.770 --> 02:24:39.780
here very much next he knows that his
 

02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:49.500

Okumura alone a porcupine is way much
 

02:25:19.851 --> 02:25:21.581
Okumura alone a porcupine is way much
bigger if we look at that porcupine

02:25:21.581 --> 02:25:21.591
bigger if we look at that porcupine
 

02:25:21.591 --> 02:25:24.131
bigger if we look at that porcupine
there you can see there is quite a lot

02:25:24.131 --> 02:25:24.141
there you can see there is quite a lot
 

02:25:24.141 --> 02:25:27.251
there you can see there is quite a lot
of meat available on that porcupine so

02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:27.261
of meat available on that porcupine so

small so I think here the efforts versus
 

02:25:39.021 --> 02:25:41.440
small so I think here the efforts versus

are managing a natural system and we
 

02:27:49.561 --> 02:27:52.280
are managing a natural system and we

environment because when shining the
 

02:27:54.061 --> 02:27:56.840
environment because when shining the
artificial lights sometimes we can make

02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:56.850
artificial lights sometimes we can make
 

02:27:56.850 --> 02:28:00.380
artificial lights sometimes we can make
the predator visible by the prey and we
