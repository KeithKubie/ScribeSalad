VINAYAK LOHANI: Thanks
so much for coming here

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.035
and for giving an opportunity
to do be here at Google.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:13.390
What we'll do is that
we'll start with a video

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.650
because that's
very visual, and I

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.080
think lots of things-- it will
give an idea about our work.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.830
And after that, I'll run
through a quick presentation,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.253
and then we can have a Q&amp;A. So
I'll just start with this film.

00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:42.640
NARRATOR: Kolkata-- a
densely populated metropolis

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.630
on the banks of the Ganges,
sustaining the livelihood

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.580
of millions, a city that
has blended modernization

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.370
with glorious history,
life on the move,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.595
a city with a global outlook.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:18.276
The other face of globalized
Kolkata-- a grim truth

00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:22.910
mired in poverty, helplessness,
and abhorrent living

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.410
conditions.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.540
Lives filled with misery
without any hope for salvation.

FEMALE SPEAKER:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:18.930
-Within these dark
lanes of Kolkata,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.180
a man searching for
the truth of life,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.730
listening to his inner voice,
a man thinking beyond himself,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.100
wanting to help deprived human
beings rejected by the society,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.600
having a vision for providing
them a grand, big family.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.100

FEMALE SPEAKER:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.490
-This man has been
looking after hundreds

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.590
of children from
deprived families

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.780
by giving them quality education
and inculcating in them

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.900
high moral values.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.670
VINAYAK LOHANI: One
day it struck me

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.900
that I should start a shelter
home for children, children

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.920
from very difficult
backgrounds, and to whom

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.940
I could dedicate my whole life.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.520
I could bring them up as my own
younger brothers and younger

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.090
sisters.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.980
So in that spirit, as
a guardian to them,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.770
I can live my whole life.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.770
When I decided to
start the shelter home,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.960
I was first looking for land
where I could start and then do

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.790
some construction in that land.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.520
But even a small
piece of land was

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.990
costing so much that it was just
beyond any kind of imagination

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.610
that I had.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.390
So I decided to start
in a rented building.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.250
I therefore saw a few
buildings and finally zeroed

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.390
on a rented building,
which was nearby

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.340
on campus and rent of which
was around 12,000 rupees.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.700
So I started taking lectures
for [? NBS ?] parents

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.660
and some coaching and
students in Kolkata.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.500
And through that, I
could meet this rent.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.660
NARRATOR: The financial
position of Parivaar

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.320
started improving as
it gained popularity

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.660
within his family,
friends, and colleagues.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.100
His mother, an ardent believer
in the goodness of people,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.990
was the first donor of Parivaar.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.450
Within a year, Vinayak
had enough funds

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.452
to buy two acres of land at 24
Parganas and to start Parivaar.

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:10.160
VINAYAK LOHANI: So in
this way I started.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.327
The first three
children I brought

00:06:12.327 --> 00:06:16.000
from a village
around 20 kilometers

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.280
from Kolkata from extremely
deprived backgrounds.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.250
And with that, after 15 days,
another 10 children came.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.070
So at the end of
say, two months,

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.380
I had around 30
children already.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.340
I then began to write
email appeals-- first

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.990
to IIM, Kolkata [INAUDIBLE]
because [INAUDIBLE] I

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.222
had access to.

00:06:43.222 --> 00:06:45.180
Though I had written to
more than 1,000 people,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.430
percentage-wise a very
small percentage responded.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.470
But still, number-wise it
was around 20, 25 people who

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.844
responded, which was
very encouraging to me

00:06:55.844 --> 00:07:00.010
because I realized that when I'm
just starting this work, even

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.706
at this stage there are people
who are showing confidence

00:07:02.706 --> 00:07:04.540
in me, showing trust in me.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.470
NARRATOR: As the number
of children grew,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.590
Vinayak realized that Parivaar
should have its own school

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.830
to cater to the unique need
of and ideal development

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.555
of the children at Parivaar.

00:07:16.555 --> 00:07:20.470
Amar Bharat Vidyapeeth is
affiliated to the West Bengal

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.880
Board of Education
and runs classes

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.110
till the high-school level.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.400
This ensures that the children
have a recognized certificate

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.800
to continue higher education on
the way to their career paths.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.590
The Vidyapeeth
teaches the children

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.440
to be proficient in three
languages-- Bengali, English,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.136
and Hindi.

00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:41.594
VINAYAK LOHANI: So
all our children

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:43.430
till grade 10 studied here.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.590
And in grade 11, 12, and for
graduation-- in colleges--

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.700
They attend some
outside institutions,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.790
which have the stream
they want to study.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.220
NARRATOR: Every
child at Parivaar

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.800
is able to aspire
for a brighter future

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.460
based on the quality education
and life skills they receive

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.200
at Parivaar.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.710
The initial focus on children
from urban and rural areas

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.250
was expanded to include
children of highly impoverished

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.460
tribal areas, where even two
square meals were not available

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.962
and malnutrition was rampant.

00:08:18.962 --> 00:08:20.420
RAMESH BIHOR:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:40.120
VINAYAK LOHANI: At
Parivaar, we have

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.000
residential children
from around 14,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.724
15 different districts, around
12 districts in West Bengal,

00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:53.131
two districts in Jharkhand,
and a few pockets in Bihar

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:55.880
and Chhattisgarh also.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.580
NARRATOR: Every year, Parivaar
screens more than 1,500 cases

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.440
of needy children for admission.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.040
These children are in
the age group of 5 to 10.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.920
Parivaar has a detailed
pre-admission screening

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.300
process, which
includes a site visit

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.600
to determine that the child is
extremely needy and vulnerable

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.540
and in need of long-term
residential support.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.370
One of the criteria
in selecting the child

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.300
is to determine that there
is a minimal possibility

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.962
of a dropout of the
child from Parivaar.

00:09:27.962 --> 00:09:29.670
VINAYAK LOHANI: We
ensure that we are not

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.450
looking for a short-term
stay at Parivaar--

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.800
just for, say, a
couple of years or so--

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.820
but for a long-term
transformation.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.440
So if a child is admitted
at the age of five,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.580
our aim is start their
higher education, which

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.310
could be graduation and
after that, a job placement.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.242
Until that level, the
child will be at Parivaar.

00:09:53.242 --> 00:09:55.990
NARRATOR: Most NGO and
government-run shelters

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.800
support the children until
they attain the age of 18.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.880
The support is withdrawn
after the child turns 18.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.860
Parivaar has no such age limit.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.870
VINAYAK LOHANI: I think that
just like in a family how

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:14.992
a family supports a child to
the last possible conclusion,

00:10:14.992 --> 00:10:16.200
it could be higher education.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.130
It could be job
placement, depending

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.720
on the potential of
that child, giving

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.200
all kinds of
opportunities to make

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.990
the most of their potential.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:31.044
So this was my vision,
that just like a family,

00:10:31.044 --> 00:10:35.920
Parivaar will also hand-hold the
child until the last conclusive

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:42.320
stage, which does full justice
to his or her potential.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.470
NARRATOR: Parivaar is now
West Bengal's largest free

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.290
residential institution,
a home to more than 1,000

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.080
less-privileged children
served by a team of deeply

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.150
committed, 170-plus
full-time staff.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.250
Parivaar has two
campuses furnished

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.200
with dorm-like
housing, a school which

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.010
has its own library,
computer lab, dining

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:15.820
halls, medical rooms, recreation
halls, playfields, etc.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.390
Here, every child is
seen as a project.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.880
And there is a high
degree of adherence

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.240
to an individualized plan
of action for each child.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.310
Most children, when
admitted into Parivaar,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:42.050
are without any exposure
to letters on numerals.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.920
Parivaar has devised a
structured bridging program

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.920
for children between
the ages of 5 and 10,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.150
whereby these
children are provided

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.980
tutoring for 6 to 12 months to
bring their education levels

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.717
at par with their age group.

00:11:55.717 --> 00:11:57.633
VINAYAK LOHANI: I think
this is very important

00:11:57.633 --> 00:12:01.450
because this correction has to
be done in the initial phase

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:01.950
itself.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.870
At the age of 15, nobody would
want to sit in grade six.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.843
So the backlog has to be
minimized at the starting point

00:12:09.843 --> 00:12:13.760
itself so that when
they are 10 or 11

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.000
they are actually in
grades 4, or 5, or 6.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.820
After the bridging,
the children are

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.160
admitted into our own in-campus
school Amar Bharat Vidyapeeth.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.360
NARRATOR: After school
hours, special tutors

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.960
help the children in enhancing
their academic performances.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.050
Children who had no
opportunity of going to school,

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.890
whose nutrition,
safety, and well-being

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.010
were also under question, now
start aspiring to be teachers,

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.590
to be engineers, to be
doctors, and to enter

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.961
many such other careers.

00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:49.590
A high happiness quotient
maintained in the family

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.600
is the reason for the negligible
dropout rate at Parivaar.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.510
The atmosphere around Parivaar
lends itself to self esteem

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:03.006
and creates hope amongst
the resident children.

00:13:03.006 --> 00:13:07.010
100% of the children of Parivaar
appearing for the board exam

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.320
clear the exam
with decent scores.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.490
VINAYAK LOHANI: The emotional
and psychological nurturing

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.860
of each child, I think that
that is of a very high level.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.770
And that, I believe, is the
most important achievement

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.730
of Parivaar.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.020
Now, second is that
the aspiration level

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.153
of the children completely
changes, because their esteem

00:13:28.153 --> 00:13:31.170
need here is really fulfilled.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:36.080
The self-respect and the respect
from others that they get here

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.930
from our Seva
Bharatis, just like

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.070
in a family, how you are
sensitively dealt with.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.830
NARRATOR: A full-time
staff member of Parivaar

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.110
is fondly referred
to as a Seva Bharati,

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.560
meaning the one who is
devoted to an ideal service.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.490
The Seva Bharatis cater to all
the needs of the boys as well

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.280
as the girls.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.705
SANDHYA NAG:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:14:26.095 --> 00:14:28.470
NARRATOR: The children from
the early batches of Parivaar

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.190
are now getting ready to
plunge into the competitive

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.670
professional world.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.130
Some are working as interns in
industry and corporate offices,

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.660
while others are
strengthening their resumes

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.950
by gaining work experience.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.280
Parivaar goes beyond
providing good education.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.140
It also guides the children
in their choice of a career.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.990
They are set on a
path on which they

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.510
would be able to create
a niche for themselves,

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.000
one conforming to the values
instilled during their stay

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.807
at Parivaar.

00:14:56.807 --> 00:14:57.932
FIROZ: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.250
NARRATOR: Every child has
a potential that needs

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.010
an opportunity for development.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.530
If they are provided the
right kind of opportunity

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.810
and the right kind
of nurturing, they

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.247
have a tremendous
potential to do well.

00:15:24.247 --> 00:15:25.580
NIMAI SAHA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:07.990
NARRATOR: Parivaar is
expanding like a juggernaut,

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.840
in popularity and in resources.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.490
It is now the largest free
residential institution

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.060
in the state of West Bengal.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.960
Vinayak is actively working on
expanding the current Parivaar

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.030
facility from accommodating
1,000 children

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.648
to 3,000 children.

00:16:25.648 --> 00:16:26.148
PROF.

00:16:26.148 --> 00:16:28.064
SOUGATA RAY: For the
last three or four years,

00:16:28.064 --> 00:16:31.585
Vinayak had spent a lot of time
in building this kind of tier

00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:33.060
of leadership.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.410
And now we are very comfortable.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.480
That's why that even
if Vinayak is not there

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.170
for several weeks in Parivaar,
Parivaar runs absolutely

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.924
smoothly, because the
next line of leadership

00:16:43.924 --> 00:16:46.394
are perfectly in place.

00:16:46.394 --> 00:16:48.685
NARRATOR: Inspired by the
teachings of selfless service

00:16:48.685 --> 00:16:51.710
by Sri Rama Krishna,
Swami Vivekananda,

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.240
Vinayak Lohani is
helping transform

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.970
the lives of hundreds
of destitute children,

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:03.220
not only of West Bengal, but
also those from the surrounding

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.024
states like Jharkhand,
Bihar, and Chhattisgarh.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:15.000
Parivaar, his vision, is
now a dream fulfilled.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.319
This tireless journey of
determination and dedication

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.771
would provide a
role model for many.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.950
VINAYAK LOHANI: So I'll
just spend 10 minutes

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:45.070
before we take questions on
like as the film also showed,

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.265
so basically,
Parivaar's emphasis

00:17:47.265 --> 00:17:50.540
is on the overall
caretaking of children

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.080
from destitute backgrounds.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.320
It's a non-denominational
organization,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.275
so the only criteria is the high
neediness level of children.

00:17:59.275 --> 00:18:02.410
And our core
inspiration has been

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:06.520
through the great spiritual
and humanistic teacher

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.700
in 19th century, the
Swami Vivekananda, whose

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.210
core theme was essential
divinity of man

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.480
and therefore service
to human beings

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.580
the highest form of
spiritual practice.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.520
So when I just passed out of
IIM, at that time, [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.838
and I wanted to actually
live this kind of philosophy.

00:18:29.838 --> 00:18:35.140
So at that time, also, one thing
was that, in social sector,

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.540
lots of things called
for a very high degree

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.735
of technical expertise.

00:18:39.735 --> 00:18:43.616
They were domains like working
with farmers in downtrodden

00:18:43.616 --> 00:18:47.560
areas , or environmental
issues, or many such things.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.000
And I didn't have
any such thing.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.230
So I asked myself,
then, what do I have?

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:55.610
I don't have any technical
expertise of such domains.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:19:00.310
So I just thought that basic
human emotions, which are very,

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.411
very universal-- love and care.

00:19:02.411 --> 00:19:04.410
So these basics [INAUDIBLE],
and I thought that,

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.050
let me start the work,
which is a manifestation

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.340
of these basic human values.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.680
So my work did not start
with any cerebral motivation

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.710
or intellectual ideas.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.370
There was no grand
idea involved.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.930
I mean, I always say that
the most simple thing,

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.120
really speaking what
we have been doing.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.540
Even an unlettered woman in
the most remote area in India

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.560
may be bringing up her children
with her utmost care and love.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.760
So the idea was to manifest
these values, this sentiment.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.810
So the whole organization
built on that spirit.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.080
So all the processes which
happen at the organization

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.850
got built up.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:47.020
They bore the stamp of
these guiding sentiments

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.240
of loving caring.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:58.082
Now, so this is our mission--
changing lives permanently

00:19:58.082 --> 00:20:00.560
of such children, homeless,
family-less children, highly

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.430
vulnerable children, so children
from backgrounds like orphans,

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.520
street children, girl children
from mass prostitution areas,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.360
whose mothers are already--
They were victimized

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.550
at some point in time and
starting fresh in prostitution.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.480
And they, themselves,
are very vulnerable

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.845
to being pushed into that
thing, because there's

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:23.056
a very high degree of
generation-to-generation

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:27.390
continuity in prostitution,
organized prostitution.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.510
So these were our domains.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.890
And then later on, from very
impoverished tribal areas,

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.430
particularly those
which were affected

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:40.350
by the Naxal movement of extreme
left-wing, violent movements.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.600
There are pockets in
[INAUDIBLE] in eastern India.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.090
So this was the thing.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:51.120
So in three children just
in a rented building,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.940
I did not have any funds.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.920
I did not look for any kind of
funding support, formal funding

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.420
support.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.440
I just started in my own way.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.140
I did not have a job, because
I did not take up a job.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.410
But some part-time,
I used to give

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.630
for just earning that
much, which could start,

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.410
which would help
me in starting this

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.930
and in this way, in a
rented building with friends

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.320
supporting, in that manner.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.370
So actually, a huge degree
of individual support,

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.230
actually 75%, 80% of support
is through individuals.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:31.630
And only I guess 20% through
institutional donors like, say,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.050
corporates or funding
agencies, et cetera.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.050
I always believed that
all the work in the world

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.340
is done by individuals.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.470
So I always had a huge faith
in individual goodness.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.610
Even institutional
support that we get

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.710
is as a result of championing
or some individual supporter

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.230
with internalized vision.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.980
So that approach and
belief continues.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.890
In this way, from tutoring
three all these years

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.090
are-- the residential
institution

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.269
has come up in this way.

00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:02.810
And in next three
years, actually, we

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.400
are going for a
faster scaling now

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.020
that our processes are
all set, and leadership

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.890
at many different levels.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.950
Operationally speaking,
Parivaar is now on an autopilot.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.860
So even my involvement,
operationally speaking,

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.070
is not required to that extent.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.910
So all other tiers of
leadership and management

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:24.680
have been created.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.440
So we are looking for
a faster expansion

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.760
in the next few years, because
need for such a service

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.290
is huge in India.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:41.300
Now, this is basically like
West Bengal and Jharkhand.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.290
These are the primary bases
from where we have children.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.660
We created our field networks
in these 14, 15 districts

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.870
and some other pockets in
neighboring states-- Bihar,

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.669
[INAUDIBLE], Chhattisgarh.

00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:53.710
Statewise it's like this.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.280
So immediate portion
is from West Bengal

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.880
and then some tribal
districts in Jharkhand,

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.535
impoverished districts.

00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:07.130
Now, like the film
also mentioned,

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.750
so we screen a
large number of kids

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.770
which are brought to our
notice through diverse facets,

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.426
through field groups, local
NGOs, local self-government

00:23:16.426 --> 00:23:20.080
like, say, panchayats,
or municipal authorities,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.640
or government department of,
say, child welfare or police.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.550
So all these, actually,
are primary referees

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.160
of cases and upon which
we do a very detailed site

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.450
visit and a neediness analysis
because our capacity of intake

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.250
at any point in time is limited.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.320
And the cases which come to our
attention far outnumber that,

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.930
so it's really on the
basis of neediness.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.120
And at the same
time, we also try

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:53.220
to assess that there are no
chance of dropout in that case.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.430
So we just ensure during
our pre-admission exercise

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:00.420
and dialogue with the
referring party-- it could

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.640
be the relative or folks of
the village of the child--

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.500
that how desperate
and motivated they

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.320
are to see the child
into such a system

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.540
of long-term transformation.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.090
So very often, I am
asked this question

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.910
of how do you motivate
the folks of the child,

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.800
and I answer it in this
way-- that we do not

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.220
have to motivate.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.440
They have to motivate
us how desperately they

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.800
need such a service, because
another demand of such

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.570
is service is anyway huge.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.530
And so neediness and,
at the same time,

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.030
minimal chance of
dropout from the program

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.530
these are our main
criteria while

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.350
short-listing for
admitting into Parivaar.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:43.900
So children are admitted
during the age of 4 to 10.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.080
That's the entry point.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.750
And when, in case
of siblings, we

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.560
take all the siblings so that
the family bonding continues.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.610
So you have a large
number of sets

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:59.190
of siblings, four brothers and
sisters, or three, like that.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.830
So all of them,
together, progress.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.440
And there is a
considerable degree

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.630
of rootedness with
their background,

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.564
like through our own field
visits to their areas,

00:25:11.564 --> 00:25:14.720
or we invite
periodically [INAUDIBLE],

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.210
all the arrangements.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:21.290
So from far-off places, 300,
400 miles, the relatives

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.010
or religious continue
to come to Parivaar.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.920
So that ensures that
the children also

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.110
have the rootedness
with their earlier

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.430
community or background.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.690
That remains intact.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.670
So this also, I'm
very often asked,

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:41.510
that such a-- since there is
a very, very drastic shift,

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.370
so how do the children
themselves adjust to this?

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.315
But my experience has been
that they themselves take it

00:25:48.315 --> 00:25:49.670
in a very, very positive way.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.200
So rather than de-rooting
from their past,

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.650
it's actually an
enhanced motivation

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.160
to do-- conclude something,
give back, and actually impact

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.130
their own local
communities, once they

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.850
are in a position to do so.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.880
So it's like this.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.520
So education-wise,
also, younger children--

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.650
those who do not have a
backlog, who are, say,

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:16.210
like around five or six-- they
start with the earlier grades.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.140
And those who are
slightly older, say,

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.600
8, 9, 10, almost
everyone at Parivaar

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.086
is without any
exposure to education.

00:26:25.086 --> 00:26:27.660
So such children, who have a
huge backlog in terms of age,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.530
they are taken through fast
learning bridging program

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:34.210
and then admitted to a
grade on par with their age.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.580
So this is like our own school.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.820
And after that, under
our care, only children

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.770
continue to-- like
just from a family,

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.850
how kids at an
outside institution.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.260
So after, they are living.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.700
Since teams become very
diverse, some kids actually

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.970
go for sciences,
some after that,

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.200
into engineering, computer.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.930
We have kids in computer
science, engineering,

00:26:55.930 --> 00:27:00.041
and, say, nursing, or it could
be other medical or some skill

00:27:00.041 --> 00:27:01.040
in a vocational program.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.800
We have a large-scale
vocational program also

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:09.160
for children who are
academically not that bright,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.360
but that also ensures
a career, which

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.640
also has an upward
mobility possibility

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.180
through skilled programs.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.580
In India these days, actually,
a huge amount of thing

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.550
is being done in the
skill space, which was not

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.860
the case a few years back.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.370
That was a tremendous-- it
was a macro-level change,

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.930
and we are also getting benefit.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.580
A few years back, I also
used to anxiety about this,

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.860
like about what about the
kids who are not doing well

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.530
academically or who have,
say, some kind of learning

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.420
disability or slow learners.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.930
But a huge amount of vibrancy
is there in the last few years

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.550
at the national skill level
and corporation coming

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:53.390
and lots of courses in
blue collar space, which

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:58.030
ensures a sure placement and
placement in organized sector.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.150
Earlier the skills space
was very disorganized.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.360
It's becoming increasingly
more organized now.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.660
So that's a good thing,
nationally speaking.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.040
So these are also
supplementary-- we

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:14.330
have a lot of supplementary
support to education

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.510
so that children to do well,
just like how in a family

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.410
all the processes which
are there in a family

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.360
are in some form
replicated at our end.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.230
So just like in a family, how
parents or older siblings would

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.430
guide, or tutor,
or mentor the kids,

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:33.100
we have our own
systems of doing that.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.820
So it's basically right from,
you could say, KG to PG,

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.100
also secondary out
into [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:44.780
graduation handholding,
and through a placement.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.680
And actually, even after that,
they need a lot of support.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.850
Like our kids, earliest kids,
are now getting into jobs.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.920
So suppose they are in a city.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.050
They have got a job
in Kolkata city.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.960
So we have to ensure
that we do this stay.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.649
And initially maybe one
year, one and a half year,

00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:01.690
all that kind of support.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.750
Maybe they have to take
a rental condition.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.400
They have to give a deposit
for that, and all that.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.247
So it's just like
having-- until they

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.590
are completely on their own.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.680
So it's like how a
family would support.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.960
Parivaar is actually a family
in the garb of an institution.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.176
So skills and vocational are
something which I talked about.

00:29:25.176 --> 00:29:29.880
So a number of courses, say,
hardware, computer hardware,

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:35.440
networking, electronics,
consumer goods servicing,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.460
beautician, BPO, hotel
manager and hospitality,

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.590
a number of huge area
of such skilled programs

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:47.830
we run in collaboration also
with some specialist agencies,

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.910
which are doing that and which
ensure a placement after that,

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.380
guaranteed placement.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.740
Now, in all of this, this
is the most important aspect

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.630
of Parivaar, even more
important than the education,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:06.080
because in a residential
center, but in a family,

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.480
as you can imagine, many
of you will be parents.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.605
So the responsibility
of parenting

00:30:11.605 --> 00:30:13.430
and the same
responsibility we have.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:17.550
So on health issues,
on overall care-taking.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:22.670
So we have [INAUDIBLE]
system and very personalized.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.640
So lots of children, when
they come to Parivaar,

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.470
they have huge malnourishment,
and supplements

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.600
have to be given to them.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.960
So it's very, very
individualized.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.000
Individualized health
charts are there.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.340
Medical files are
there for all children.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.462
Visual medical
histories are there

00:30:40.462 --> 00:30:43.030
right from the time
they enter Parivaar.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:47.300
We have a medical staff,
resident medical staff,

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.373
comprising nurses, paramedical
staff, et cetera, ambulances,

00:30:50.373 --> 00:30:53.454
and everything,
arrangements with hospitals,

00:30:53.454 --> 00:30:56.710
tie-ups with hospitals,
group insurance

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.670
for the whole children, so
all those kinds of things.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:04.170
These are developments things,
which the film also depicted.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:07.770
So I think the like
the immediate success

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.040
point of Parivaar is,
actually, ensuring

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.660
that there is a
really high degree

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.110
of emotional and
psychological nourishment.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.390
Academically and
educationally, I still

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.080
feel that we have
a long way to go,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.180
because so many more
things we have to do.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.020
And there are
constraints of HR there,

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.250
like our location, why
that's far from the city.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.224
So there may be
concerns outside,

00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:33.390
and we'll grapple with that.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:37.250
But nothing stops us
from making Parivaar

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.510
a very, very high degree of
emotionally nourishing place.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.870
So that has been the
case, right from day

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.380
one when we were very,
very low on resources.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.380
So it's about the environment.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:54.800
So we have our own
[INAUDIBLE], working staff who

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.580
actually stay on the campus.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.680
I have always lived
with the kids.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.285
That has been my family.

00:32:01.285 --> 00:32:03.635
So when I started,
I also decided

00:32:03.635 --> 00:32:06.670
that I will not have any
other thing in my life.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.060
So you know that
simplified my life.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.040
So as a result, I
never got married even.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.450
And my parents were
at some other place

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.920
so didn't have much of a social
obligation outside Parivaar.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.930
So it was like this.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.270
So this has been my
family And for a tier

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.260
of the resident people
who live at Parivaar

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.480
and call it their family.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.790
And in addition, we have our
own 90 more daytime staff

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.340
for our daytime roles.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.990
It could be teaching,
tutoring, all these things.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.200
So lots of things.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:47.410
You could say on fun and
joy and happiness quotient

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:49.500
enhancements.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.970
So all the things
you can imagine

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:56.275
which happen in a household--
celebrations, festivities,

00:32:56.275 --> 00:32:59.420
excursions, carnivals,
culturally--

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.616
a huge amount of cultural
events, et cetera.

00:33:03.616 --> 00:33:05.880
Infrastructure-wise, right
from a rented building,

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.600
then I, for the first
time, took to [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.794
Now it became our own,
nearly 20 acres of land

00:33:11.794 --> 00:33:16.144
now and in two campuses.

00:33:16.144 --> 00:33:17.310
We have an immediate campus.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.499
One is for-- both are in
the same locality, actually,

00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:21.790
and are adjacent to each other.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.520
One is for the girls.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.170
And there, primarily, we have
our women resident staff.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.670
It's very, very
difficult, actually,

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.850
to manage a girls'
residential home.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.350
And people would not
venture into doing that.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.825
There are very, very few
girls' residential institutions

00:33:37.825 --> 00:33:40.520
in India, whereas they
are the most vulnerable.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.490
Reason is that it's
very, very difficult

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.200
to find resident women,
which you need for a girls'

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.610
residential institute.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:51.810
You can get males who could
work in India on campus.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:52.592
They can stay.

00:33:52.592 --> 00:33:57.020
But usually our candidates
for having resident women

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.240
is maybe women who are
not married, et cetera.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.703
I mean, the social
customs are maybe--

00:34:03.703 --> 00:34:07.984
in India it's usually like
married men can go out, get

00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:10.159
some other place,
and stay at resident

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.960
or in overnight hall, but
very hard to find women.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.409
So that has always
been a constant.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:18.310
But right from the
beginning, I was

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:23.920
dissuaded from actually
working and starting

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.130
the girls' residentialship.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.505
Only women's social
entrepreneurs

00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:27.850
have done that mostly in India.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:31.679
But I was very, very sure,
right from the beginning that

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:35.300
we'll have both girls'
institution as well as boys'.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.179
And we had a common residential
institution for at least

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:40.699
first six, seven years.

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:43.020
And after that only
we were in a position

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:47.100
to have different institutions.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.580
Actually, having
common is, in fact,

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.909
not-- some guidelines are
also there in the government,

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:55.850
that you are not
allowed to do that.

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:59.660
But somehow, we managed
to see that period.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.410
So these are some very wonderful
cases-- particularly these

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.950
three, because these
three, after graduation,

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.650
are also working at Parivaar.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:15.460
They chose to actually
give back for-- at least

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.040
for the next three,
four years at Parivaar.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.970
So they are in very key roles.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.620
Firoz he was like-- 10
years back you can see.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.600
And now he's in an important
position in our finance

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.560
accounting department.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.010
Suman now is looking after child
admissions administrative role.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.715
Ten years back, he, himself,
was a-- 11 years back

00:35:37.715 --> 00:35:40.190
got admitted to Parivaar.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:44.960
And Shubham, again, from a very
vulnerable, traffic-prone area.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.250
His sisters were
also-- well, you

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.130
could say victims
of trafficking.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.640
And from there, he was-- all
the siblings were admitted.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.970
He's now a science teacher
in higher grades, mathematics

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:59.010
and in the sciences.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:02.770
So this kind of a
spirit of-- actually

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.550
there are many children who
are-- since they've come out

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.480
of this system only, and
they carry this vision

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.560
and philosophy of Parivaar.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.590
So I am very-- this
was my dream, actually,

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.160
that the future
leaders of Parivaar

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.740
should include in a major
way the children who

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.750
have come through Parivaar.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.340
That was the legacy
I wanted to leave.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.420
So it's actually turning
out in that manner only.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.983
Now, in tribal areas
also we outreached

00:36:30.983 --> 00:36:34.960
and created a field network.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.280
In and around Kolkata,
our institution

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.670
has become well known so
cases on their own come to us.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:43.420
But there are so many areas
which are almost cut off

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.610
from the rest of the country.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:51.100
These are Naxal-affected
areas, and even police

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.290
doesn't enter into these areas.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:56.525
So here, we actually outreach
created field network

00:36:56.525 --> 00:37:00.410
through local-- holding
community meetings.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:05.110
I remember in one Naxal
tribal area in 2007

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.490
when during late evening
when nobody ventures

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:10.000
because there are these mines.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.380
It's got mines, which are
placed and a bomb blast,

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.790
kids get blasted there.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.740
So but still, we ventured there.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.290
And like in any random
interior village,

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:25.250
I then brought-- the village
elders I brought to Parivaar.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:28.430
I said they'd be our
guest for, say, one week.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.830
And in every village, there are
some respected village elders.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:36.030
They are also from
the same community,

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.550
but they are kind of opinion
leaders in that area.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.400
So we just brought them.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.910
And they stayed at
Parivaar and then went back

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.170
and spread the word.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.750
So in areas where
nobody knew us,

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:48.550
these kind of
approaches also we took.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:53.050
And then after that, all these
relatives of the children

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.420
became our local volunteers.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.680
They are our field workers.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.170
We don't have recruited
staff for all that.

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:02.579
All these relatives of the
children from far-flung area,

00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:04.120
they themselves are
a contact person.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.460
They do, then, the
primary referencing

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.340
of more children in that
region, and all the liaisoning

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.120
part with the area.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.320
These are two main
tribes-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.620
and [INAUDIBLE] We do a
lot of other things here.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:19.000
Like around 3,000 other
children's education,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.540
we support through
various field groups which

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.790
we have created in this field.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.940
And so this, Parivaar,
its main aspect

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:29.240
is the residential instrument,
a lot of other ancillary support

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.730
activity does.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.410
So 3,000 children's
education, we

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:38.720
do a food stock scheme,
some 600, 700 households

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.220
are covered.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.000
And around 15,000,
20,000 kilograms

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.360
of [INAUDIBLE] every month
are fed into interior areas.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.060
These are starvation areas.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.775
And there are times when
there is a family in condition

00:38:51.775 --> 00:38:52.620
of starvation.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.020
Deaths even happen
in many such areas.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.060
So all this, also, we do.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.320
Since we are integrated
into those field areas.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.452
So these commitments,
also, we have to fulfill.

00:39:03.452 --> 00:39:09.370
Like here, it's [INAUDIBLE]
to additional 2,600 boys

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.450
and all outside Parivaar
from this local area.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:15.810
Monthly food stock scheme--
this is for elderly.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.050
And there are other
families in the tribal area.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:19.470
But elderly are
uncared for women

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:23.160
who are begging on the
streets, like that, with no one

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:23.970
to take care of.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:29.850
So particularly, elderly uncared
women-- medical support, food

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.920
stock support, and in
general Parivaar acts

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.350
as a guardian of the
entire local area

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.500
in case of any exigency.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.530
So ours is the
door they'll knock

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:42.310
for any kind of
exigency support.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.800
Future-- this is how
we will be scaling.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.270
We may start a
similar institution

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.400
in the next few
years, and possibly

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.600
in Jharkhand, Madhya
Pradesh, or Chhattisgarh.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.630
These are also on our radar.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.200
But at the same
location, itself,

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.260
we are scaling
three or four times.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.160
We have land, et cetera,
for 3,000, 4,000 children.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.436
So that will happen
at our area itself,

00:40:03.436 --> 00:40:07.870
present area with Bengal near
Kolkata, but at the same time

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:12.010
in some other states where
we have a local village base.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:18.740
So finally speaking, Parivaar--
a continuous fest of joy

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.320
and learning.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.710
This is what Parivaar is.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:25.040
And the central
government, particularly,

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.740
has recognized our work--
government of India.

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:32.850
And they've inducted me into
also-- three-fourths in point--

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.300
the ministerial communities.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.620
Like I am on the
HRD's ministry, which

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.160
is the education
ministry in India's apex

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.030
advisory body for developing
the education policy.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:50.560
Similarly, in Ministry of Women
and Child, it's advisory board.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.590
In Ministry of
Finance, the aspect

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.707
of finance ministry which deals
with NGOs in general, like they

00:40:56.707 --> 00:41:01.480
are taxation and regulations
which should guide the NGO

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.830
sector, So all on that also.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:09.310
So it's like this--
a few years back

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.420
Parivaar was elected
the best child welfare

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.510
institution in
the entire country

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.660
by the president of India.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:19.108
Now, these are just
a few tables, OPEX,

00:41:19.108 --> 00:41:24.590
and per child it comes to
around in Indian rupees

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.570
be close to 440 rupees
annually per child,

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:31.840
which is around US $650
US for a resident child.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.997
And you can see that nearly
half of it-- at least 40% to 45%

00:41:35.997 --> 00:41:37.330
is the funding component itself.

00:41:39.985 --> 00:41:42.440
So it's like this.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:48.970
And our OPEX it's around
Indian rupee crore,

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:52.510
which now the exchange
rates have gone up already.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.250
So now it's around
US $800,000 a year.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.730
It was $1 million, but due to
the exchange rate in dollar

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.820
it comes to $800,000 USD.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.540
And we have to do a lot
of infrastructure buildup.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.960
So around half a million
dollars each year,

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.470
we expend on infrastructure
buildup for scaling

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.660
up, for creating the residential
work, and all infrastructure

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:16.310
facility for the kids.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:20.720
So nearly $1.5 million
we raise, and primarily,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.160
as I said, through individuals.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.790
It's like this.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:29.340
So this is-- I stop here, and
I can take some questions now.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.606
We have, I think, 15 minutes.

00:42:31.606 --> 00:42:35.850
Yeah, so other
than that, I also,

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:41.140
now, work a lot on the network
level of particularly young

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.020
social entrepreneurs.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.990
So I also convened, along
with some other friends.

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:50.000
We have a very significant
philanthropic platform

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.810
called Caring Friends.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:57.500
So it has more than 25 very good
grassroots organizations there.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.990
So I do a lot of support and,
actually, access to funding,

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.696
et cetera, for those
organizations as well.

00:43:05.696 --> 00:43:09.280
And mentoring young social
entrepreneurs, particularly

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.021
those who have left some
kind of [INAUDIBLE] careers

00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:14.570
and are venturing into
this, because in India, it's

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:18.450
still a very, very--
it's insecure and full

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:19.320
of uncertainty.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.100
It's perceived as
that, actually.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.480
So just to give them
a feeling that we

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.620
are with you and ensuring a
sense of security, etc cetera.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.012
I mean, initially
it's particular

00:43:31.012 --> 00:43:32.220
to such social entrepreneurs.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.370
And so a number of such
organizations here,

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:35.030
hand-holding.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.390
So we have these caring,
friendly individuals here with

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:39.640
us, along with Parivaar's.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.640
Yeah, we can-- yeah.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.319
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:47.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thanks a
lot for coming, Vinayak.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.486
This was very inspirational.

00:43:48.486 --> 00:43:49.360
VINAYAK LOHANI: Thank you.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.693
FEMALE SPEAKER: I have a
question around-- so obviously,

00:43:51.693 --> 00:43:54.540
you have had the privilege
to go to an IIT, an IIM,

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.190
and have that type of education.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.060
And because of that--
or I'd rather say,

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.230
despite of that-- you
chose to do something that

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.610
was coming from your heart.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.540
And you really
followed that calling.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.570
What are you doing
with these children?

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:07.940
What type of education
are you providing them

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.731
to do the same that you did?

00:44:09.731 --> 00:44:11.230
And you mentioned
a couple of cases,

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:13.580
where kids are helping
out at the school

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.410
after they're graduating,
or once they're old enough.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.210
But how do you
make sure that they

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.380
have that sense of
gratitude and give back

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.770
to where they came from, rather
than aspire for great careers

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:25.912
in, let's say, the
US or anywhere else.

00:44:25.912 --> 00:44:28.120
VINAYAK LOHANI: There's
nothing wrong with aspiring--

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: There's
nothing wrong with it.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.100
I mean, we would welcome them.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.205
VINAYAK LOHANI: My work is
supported by such people, who

00:44:34.205 --> 00:44:35.600
aspired for their careers.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.555
So I would be the last person
to say anything against that.

00:44:38.555 --> 00:44:42.690
And here, as far as kids
at Parivaar are concerned,

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:45.090
it's like-- you know in
the environment, gratitude

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:49.012
I always feel is the most
basic human sentiment.

00:44:49.012 --> 00:44:51.050
Every human being
should have that.

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:53.144
I am very, very grateful
to Parivaar children

00:44:53.144 --> 00:44:56.640
that I got an opportunity to--
so it's a common sentiment

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.620
that everyone should have.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.250
But it can't be forced
down your throat.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:06.040
So we are giving opportunities
through that first, let

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.590
them manifest their potential.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:12.330
And I am sure that
with the kind of values

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:15.950
which the environment
at Parivaar had,

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.790
naturally it will
have its effect.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:23.230
But we don't-- like as far
as this value of education is

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:26.620
concerned, I don't believe in a
moral science kind of classroom

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:27.270
kind of thing.

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.430
I always think that--
Swami Vivekananda once

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.290
said that if you want
to ever teach anyone

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:35.860
to be good, if you want
to reform John Doe,

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.750
live with John Doe.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.510
And if you have any of the
fire of purity, he'll catch it.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.100
So it's like this.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:47.780
It's about living with-- living
and through your own life.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:52.010
I think children are quick
learners of how elders

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:55.330
are behaving, etc cetera,
however so you may philosophize

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.560
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.560
So this is like first
giving them chance,

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.000
and I'm sure that those
things happen, naturally.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.980
MALE SPEAKER: What can
we Googlers and experts

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.860
do to help social
enterprises in India?

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.410
VINAYAK LOHANI:
The first thing is

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:13.960
about engaging with social
enterprises, greater

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.140
degree of engagement.

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.880
First to ensure
[INAUDIBLE] experience

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.580
of visiting organizations.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:24.657
And in a very remote way, it
may be difficult, not so easy.

00:46:24.657 --> 00:46:26.365
Like I am very often
asked this question,

00:46:26.365 --> 00:46:31.110
that we do not know how the--
if we make a donation, how

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.120
it will get utilized.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.550
Actually, it's not
that difficult.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.760
It's actually kind of a
lazy way of engagement,

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.770
because of which these
kind of things come.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:44.610
For example, there are direct
grass-root organizations.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:47.180
People generally do
through intermediaries,

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.350
or through funding
agency, and then they

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.050
are extending support.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.429
So one doesn't know.

00:46:52.429 --> 00:46:53.970
But directly there
are organizations.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.560
There are-- like
our friends here,

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.370
these two are also
engaging with a number

00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:00.330
of-- [INAUDIBLE] is a Googler.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:02.852
So they are engaging
directly, visiting

00:47:02.852 --> 00:47:05.060
a number of organizations
in India when they go back.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.890
So actually, through
direct engagement,

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.510
you get a much better exposure.

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.550
You get ideas of how to help.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.190
It could be at the
level of ideas.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.700
He has done, for example, a
lot for many organizations

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:21.470
while being at the US and
also when he was in India.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:25.290
So it's like one has to
engage, first come and touch,

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.310
and that needs some
kind of an effort.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.460
You have to get out of your
comfort zone for doing that.

00:47:32.604 --> 00:47:34.395
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
for stopping in today.

00:47:34.395 --> 00:47:35.843
VINAYAK LOHANI: Yeah, thank you.

00:47:35.843 --> 00:47:37.340
MALE SPEAKER: And it's
exciting to see what you said.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.640
I had two questions.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.980
The first one is-- I think
you partly answered that.

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.790
Based on what you
presented, it looks

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:46.249
like there is a need for
some kind of a venture,

00:47:46.249 --> 00:47:48.790
that there is a need for some
kind of funding as you scale up

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:49.830
your operations.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:53.780
And secondly, you also
mentioned that people over here

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.760
can actually engage
more in a real sense.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.500
What are some
other things that--

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.060
besides these two, what are
some of the immediate needs that

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.447
are on the top of your mind?

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:04.280
That's one question.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.446
And the second question,
which is sort of unrelated,

00:48:06.446 --> 00:48:07.910
is how is the
government helping?

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.600
Are you getting
help, positive help?

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.100
Thank you.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.202
VINAYAK LOHANI: So I'll just
take the second part first.

00:48:14.202 --> 00:48:18.372
The government--
financial funding support

00:48:18.372 --> 00:48:21.280
from government in India
happens in a different way.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.660
Government has a number
of social welfare schemes.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.100
And if we run those
schemes directly

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:30.300
under those parameters, in the
sense that you are kind of-- I

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.020
would use the analogy of
being a subcontractor, so

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.840
a subcontractor of
government schemes.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.190
If you run, then you
get those kind of funds.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.220
But in programs or
organizations or initiatives

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.440
which have been designed, which
are not commissioned projects

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:51.190
but are designed by some
entrepreneurs or founder

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:55.400
and under your own design
parameter you want to do,

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.650
then you don't have access
to those government funds.

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:03.210
And even if you have, there is a
huge amount of loss of autonomy

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:06.410
by taking government
funds in India.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:09.460
And government in
India is also--

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.676
we have to understand
that there is

00:49:11.676 --> 00:49:13.050
a state government
in each state,

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:15.180
and it's government of India.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.730
And usually, the
social way is you

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:19.030
have to deal with the state
government, local state

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:22.020
government, through channels
of local bureaucracy,

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:25.250
local, say, panchayat system.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:29.440
There's a huge amount of
political interference there.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:34.080
So that's not--
when I started, I

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.460
didn't think that
was an answer to go

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.010
and building your organization.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:38.930
You lose control.

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:40.930
But when you are in a
position of strength,

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.937
then you can really
start dealing a bit more

00:49:43.937 --> 00:49:44.770
with the government.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:47.960
So now we are like-- some
kind of access we have.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.670
For example, there
is a provision

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:53.400
of MPLAD for a member of
Parliament's local area

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:53.960
development.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.590
So that doesn't come through
the ministerial departments,

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.920
purely discretionary of
the member of Parliament.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.330
So a good member of
Parliament, there are a few,

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:07.030
like-- I mean, particularly
in the Rajya Sabha, which is

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.280
the House of Elders in India.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.320
And there are
president-nominated MPs there.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.170
So those are people who are
not from the political system.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:16.160
I mean, [INAUDIBLE]
was in their own field.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.310
So a few of them have
actually supported us.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.140
So there is also
government funding,

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.940
where it doesn't come through
the conventional route.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:27.490
So about that, it's
a choice one has

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:32.510
to make about loss of
autonomy and access to funds.

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:35.130
Then about this, yeah.

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.660
Your first part,
Parivaar is scaling up.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:43.340
So financial support would need
for that will always remain.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.670
But there are so many
other ways of engaging.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:48.770
Like from the US itself,
many of our supporters--

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.770
for example, who have a
little bit more grown up kids.

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:56.120
So we have a kid's exchange
program, for example.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.350
Not exchange-- their
kids, only come

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:02.500
and staying for a
few weeks, and it's

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:06.230
like-- living and sharing with.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.400
I don't use the
volunteering for that,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.030
but just living and sharing.

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:13.630
So a lot of cross-cultural
learning for both our kids

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.470
as well as those
who are visiting.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:20.210
That has been a very
successful thing at our end.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:24.140
So many diverse fields
of engagement are there.

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:29.310
And as I said,
that I-- today I am

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:33.800
representing not just in my
own work but sector as a whole.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.740
There are so many
other good initiatives.

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.740
But right now, there is a
very, very divested thing,

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:42.880
you know, famine in Marathwada
region in Maharashtra

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.290
where 10 farmers each day
are committing suicide.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:48.250
I am also urging most
of my supporters,

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.930
actually, to extend
support there.

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:54.040
So one of our [INAUDIBLE]
mentored by us,

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:58.790
actually, is actually
doing a lot there.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.440
So many situations
are there when caring.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.320
So I think you should
have an engagement

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.850
with the whole ecosystem
of organizations,

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:11.130
in fact, all the
various domains.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.120
It's just like how
in a stock market,

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.970
you follow a number
of stocks, OK?

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:19.830
Their positions and their
stories change over time.

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:21.665
So similarly, as
for the engagement

00:52:21.665 --> 00:52:23.400
in social sector in
India is concerned,

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.020
I think that should be the way.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.408
Yeah, yeah.

00:52:27.408 --> 00:52:29.074
MALE SPEAKER: Can we
have flyers in case

00:52:29.074 --> 00:52:30.920
we want to get involved.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.610
VINAYAK LOHANI: Yeah, this whole
Caring Friend network, also we

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:37.912
have so far 25 organizations--
25 best organizations in India,

00:52:37.912 --> 00:52:40.084
we have literature here today.

00:52:40.084 --> 00:52:41.750
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I
have two questions.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:46.080
One is, when-- you took a path
that was off the beaten track,

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:46.580
right?

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.580
What was the reaction
of your parents?

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.690
And then secondly,
as you were growing,

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.210
did politicians,
or local police,

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:55.460
or anybody get in the way?

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.462
VINAYAK LOHANI: Yeah.

00:52:56.462 --> 00:53:01.000
So now, first thing was that
I did not belong to Kolkata.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.395
In fact, I did not
know anyone in Kolkata.

00:53:03.395 --> 00:53:04.710
And I started there.

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:06.900
So I had to learn
the local language,

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.560
integrated myself with the
local culture, all that.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.790
And I had come to Kolkata
only for doing my [INAUDIBLE],

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:17.780
but I got caught up in such
a company of people who were

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.920
related to these kind of thing.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.930
So I used to visit organizations
and volunteer, and all that.

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:25.210
So that got me going.

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:28.990
Otherwise, maybe
that would-- there

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:32.230
are so many things against
me, odds are against me there

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:33.260
in that area.

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.770
But the momentum and the mind
inspiration got built up there.

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:39.860
So at that time, I never
discussed this with my family.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:43.520
I never gave them a chance
to register their views.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.230
So I never got to
know of their views,

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:48.690
because I never went back
home for many years, actually.

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:52.279
And they-- like some
of my little sister,

00:53:52.279 --> 00:53:53.570
or other relative used to come.

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:57.000
So slowly, my-- my mother
was actually very supportive.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.970
My father, being a
more practical person,

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:00.940
he was worried.

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.390
And he didn't trust me enough.

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:04.223
He thought that I
am a-- I mean, he

00:54:04.223 --> 00:54:05.910
had the image of
an immature kid.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:09.490
So he thought that I'll
mess up everything.

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:12.340
But in course of
time there, I think,

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.900
became very good friends.

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.560
So I have their blessings.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.730
MALE SPEAKER: And
all of us wish really

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:19.814
best for you and Parivaar.

00:54:19.814 --> 00:54:20.896
VINAYAK LOHANI: Thank you.

00:54:20.896 --> 00:54:21.430
Thank you.

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:22.980
