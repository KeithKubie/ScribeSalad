00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.874
Ming: Good afternoon, my friends.
My name is Ming, and I'm the _____ fellow

00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:08.460
of Google.
I'm just delighted today to have my friend

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.050
here, Dr. Sylvia Lafair.
Sylvia is the president of Creative Energy

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.110
Options, a global consulting company, focused
on optimizing workplace relationships.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.199
Sylvia is also the author of this book, "Don't
Bring It To Work: Breaking the family patterns

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.020
that limit success," which takes a fascinating
look at how our relationships at home make

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.850
us who we are at work and how to identify
and work with these family patterns.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.989
She will be exploring this topic with us in
the next hour.

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.039
And personally, I hope her next book will
be, "Don't Bring This Accent to Work.”

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.129
But that will be next year.
Sylvia's articles have been published in the

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.190
Business Week, the Wall Street Journal Online,
and Time.com.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:01.550
And, in person, I just find Sylvia to be a
delightful bundle of positive, loving energy,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.860
and that's who she is.
And it's just a delight to be in her presence.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.740
And, my friends, let's welcome Dr. Sylvia
Lafair.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.740
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.320
Sylvia Lafair: I'll use this, and thank you.
And the compliment is sent back.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.840
He's an amazing guy, and I'm sure most of
you know that.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.240
So it's just a delight to be here with all
of you.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.180
And what we're going to do is start with something.
Now, I'm going to give you an idea of what

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.390
I would like.
And then, you can decide what you want to

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.750
do, okay?
So take a minute.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.390
In a minute, I'm going to ask you to come
up to get something.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.690
You don't know what it is, but I'm going to
offer you something.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.770
So think about it.
Is it worth it to come up front, or do you

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.440
like to stay in your seat?
So. Okay.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.700
On the count of three -- and the first person
up here is going to get a surprise.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.099
Who? I'm not telling what it is.
No, not you.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.290
[laughter]
And not you.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.370
Okay. First one up here.
Perfect. All right.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.540
So what's your name?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.540
Noel: Noel.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.749
Sylvia Lafair: Noel. All right.
So, before I give you a surprise -- and I

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:27.090
hope you'll like it -- tell me, what was it
that made you be able to get up in front of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.580
the group and just come up here?

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:36.230
Noel: The last time someone asked for volunteers,
I didn't get up and lost out on something

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.230
nice.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.430
Sylvia Lafair: Uh-huh. Okay.
So we're learning about patterns.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.650
I don't know how far this is going to go.
So. What you're going to get is a copy of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.900
my book, and I'll sign it after, okay?
I hope you like it. Okay.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.750
So I just want you to think about getting
up, walking up in front of the room, not knowing

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.219
why.
And we're going to be talking about patterns.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:09.310
Patterns are things that repeat and repeat.
And the interesting things about patterns

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.249
is the only constant in these happens to be
us, okay?

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:19.939
So some people are -- and I loved what you
just said Noel -- he missed out last time,

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.319
so he decided to do it differently this time.
Some people will sit toward the back of the

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.430
room, and some sit toward the front of the
room.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.380
And if you'll notice, there's a pattern almost
everywhere that -- other than Ming right now

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.650
 -- the front row is almost always empty,
which I think is kind of interesting.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.769
I think we learned that when we went to school.
You know, better to sort of hold back a little,

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.319
because you didn't want to get too much attention.
C'mon in gentlemen.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:58.439
And what we're going to do now is look at
how these patterns that are so deeply embedded

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:04.120
in our nervous systems play out at work.
So first I'd like to just say a little bit

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.569
about how I got into doing what I'm doing
now.

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.199
And second time you're going to hear this
story, but sorry.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:17.040
My husband who's here with me -- Herb -- and
I started a personal development center years

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.890
ago.
And you can tell by his gray hair that it's

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.350
years ago.
Anyway, what happened was that one day a gentleman

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.480
who had been in one of our programs -- we
did a lot of work with families -- said, "Will

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.070
you come work with senior management?”
And I said, "Why?”

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.910
And he said, "They're fighting.”
And I said, "So what?" And he said, "But,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.320
get it, Sylvia.
You work with families.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.440
They have to get along; we have to get along.
Make sense?”

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.100
So we did a lot of thinking about it, and
said, "Okay.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.190
There are shared interests through genetics:
The family.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.750
Better families get along than not.
There are shared interests through economics,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.790
the workplace.
And so better if people at work get along.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.340
We can be more innovative, more creative,
there's less tension, there's more fun.”

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.760
So we decided to go in and work with his senior
team, and -- miracles of miracles, or I wouldn't

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.850
be standing here today -- things did get better.
So we began to research the place that is,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.230
I think, the most exciting place -- and you
folks are in obviously one of the most innovative

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.280
places up here at Google where you have to
begin to have to think out of the box, think

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.220
new thoughts, think innovation, think that
there are different ways to do things.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:44.740
We began to go touch-and-go to find out what
the criteria is and what to bring to work

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.220
and what not to bring to work.
So here we go.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.260
You see this picture?
Everybody has a variation on that picture

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.610
somewhere.
Somewhere for each of us, there's a picture

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:05.000
of a family.
And what's interesting is, when you look at

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.440
the office -- and you're not at a dinner table
 -- you're at an office meeting table, the

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.460
same behaviors apply.
The original organization we all joined was

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.050
the family.
Whether you liked it or not, you signed on.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.180
And what happens is, what we learned in that
family is what we bring into the workplace.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:36.590
It's where we learned about fairness.
It's where we learned about being the star

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.050
or the one who, you know, everybody picks
on.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:47.830
It's where we learned about honesty and integrity.
And it's a very interesting thing when we

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.251
take what we learn there and bring it into
the workplace.

00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:56.650
So what we're going to do is look at some
of the patterns.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:03.970
Now, what we've done is, we have pulled together
13 patterns that we see that are very available

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.341
in families and are also very prevalent in
the workplace.

00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.410
There are more.
You can have more than one.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.620
We're usually a combination of three and four.
There's usually one or two that seem to signify

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.150
us.
And when people talk about things, you'll

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:26.120
know that usually we can see them on others
before we see it on themselves.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.170
We're going to look at how to diminish conflict.
You can't ever get away from conflict.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.940
Conflict is just the name of life, but we
can diminish it.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:42.490
And what we can do once we learn some of these
rules is, we can shorten the time that we

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:48.050
have to be upset with each other, and we can
do better with the depth of the upset that

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.160
we have to have with each other.
So that's what we're going to do.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.460
And then, we're going to look at systems -- relationships.
We are individuals and we're also part of

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.430
a system.
And we're always part of a system somewhere

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:08.320
or another.
So we have to look at both aspects of that.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.820
Okay. So, patterns.
Rather than ask, I'm going to give you the

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.889
answer right now.
There are things that repeat over and over.

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:21.380
And I'd like to give you a few really quick
take-aways from this.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:27.050
One of the big take-aways is, as you listen
to yourself and listen to others and you hear

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:34.620
the words, 'Always' or 'Never', know that
you've entered the land of patterns.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.690
We had a gal who years ago worked with us.
And when she was interviewed -- she was going

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:45.380
to report directly to me -- she said, "I never
get along with male bosses.”

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.810
And I thought, "Okay. I hear that.”
She was going to be reporting to me.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.400
Later, she reported to one of the other men
in our company, and guess what?

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.200
She was right.
She finally self-selected out.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:06.820
But she never got along with male bosses.
So you begin to say, "Where do we get all

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:12.360
these 'Always' and 'Never' from?”
They start from when we're very little.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.250
And we have what we call "Self-fulfilling
Prophecies" that we begin to work with.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:24.670
So patterns, where do they begin? They begin
in the family, they begin in our culture,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:32.090
and they come out of crises.
And what happens is, when we begin to search

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:38.960
in a personal-growth kind of way in coaching
 -- and this kind of stuff in the workplace

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.420
is very valid.
These are valid questions to ask "How did

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.240
I get to be who I am?
What is it that is keeping me from ultimate

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.640
success?
Or, What is it that I'm doing that really

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.050
is helping others?" And those are the kinds
of questions that you want to ask yourselves.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.040
You want to look at your teammates and maybe
have dialogues with them around it.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.740
So we're going to look at family for a minute.
As I said, it's the original organization

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.910
into which you were born.
A lot of the things you do become came from

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.400
there, not good or bad -- passed down through
the generations.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.430
And it's also part of your genetic memory.
And I want to give you an example of genetic

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.870
memory.
Who here grew up in the middle of the country,

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.710
in the US, away from water? Anybody?
Where? Ohio.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.310
How far were you from the ocean?

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.830
&gt;&gt; A long way.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.380
Sylvia Lafair: A long way.
So you couldn't get up in the morning and

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.570
say, "We're going to go to the beach just
for the afternoon and come back.”

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.910
Somebody else, I saw.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.910
&gt;&gt; Colorado River.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:46.760
Sylvia Lafair: Okay. So now, think about this.
If you're a kid, and your family is saying,

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.760
"We're going to go take a trip, and we're
going to see the ocean." Different here.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.930
You can get there pretty quickly.
The ocean's a big deal.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.730
Now, it's a big piece of water -- big, exciting
place.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:05.300
So it's really talked up, and you get to wherever
you're going to go -- California beach, Florida

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.230
beach -- and everybody's excited, and they're
telling you -- you're two, three years old

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.560
 –
"Oh, the ocean's big. It's beautiful. There

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.600
are waves. There's sand.”
You get there and it's a rainy day and you

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.610
can't go on the beach.
It's a bummer.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.710
And your parents are saying -- or whoever
you go with, caretakers -- "Oh, this is terrible.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.160
It's not fair.”
You have to go back to the motel room.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.110
And you're sitting there kind of watching
the same cartoons you've seen.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:36.660
And you're very frustrated.
That's a memory that goes into your nervous

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.080
system.
It's called a 'mem.'

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.210
What happens is, fast forward 20 years later,
and you're going to the beach.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:51.230
You maybe have moved from Colorado or Ohio
and you're going to the beach and it's a really

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:56.279
pretty day.
The problem is, inside you're feeling sad

00:11:56.279 --> 00:12:02.160
or depressed.
Well, instead of Prozac, go back and think

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.080
about, "Where did this begin?”
Sometimes you're going to find the answers;

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.500
sometimes you're not.
So just asking the question is the good place

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.690
to start.
But what happens is, these are the kinds of

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:19.170
things that go into our genetic memory.
And once we can scoot back -- and there are

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.170
lots of ways to do it.
And there are lots of quizzes you can do that

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.640
you can find answers to.
So you begin to look at that.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.399
So now we're going to look at culture patterns.
And culture patterns are on many levels.

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:38.820
One is the area of the country or the world
in which you grew up.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:44.700
There are cultural norms that are there.
It's also the time in which you grew up.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:51.160
And they will, in many ways, determine how
you see, think, be, about what you're watching.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:58.149
I was just at a meeting in Philadelphia from
the Governor's Conference for Women, and one

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:01.971
of the gals was interesting.
She was saying, "Remember when we used to

00:13:01.971 --> 00:13:05.720
talk about the 'glass ceiling' and the 'old
boy's club'?”

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.360
She said, "If you notice, we're breaking that
model now.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.740
And people aren't talking about it the way
they used to.”

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.110
That's a culture change.
But these patterns are embedded in us.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:20.790
The other is about 'inclusion' and 'exclusion.'
So there's some really deep thinking you can

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:27.690
do about Where and How these patterns started.
And what we call these 'patterns' -- the cultural

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:34.520
patterns -- are what they become not.
As in "am not," "cannot," "should not," "will

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.649
not," or "not like me.”
And they get played out in the workplace.

00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:42.270
And we're going to talk about that in more
detail in a minute.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:48.899
Crises patterns we call "Split-second hardening
of the emotions.”

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:53.910
So, who here remembers where they were on
September 11th, 2001?

00:13:53.910 --> 00:14:00.360
As I'm saying that, can you get a memory of
what it felt like?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.520
Yeah. I'll bet everybody in here, there's
a sense of inhaling, of hard-to-breathe.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:12.730
And our retreat center is just a couple of
hours from New York, and I remember that afternoon

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:18.149
saying, "I have to go help.”
You couldn't get out, couldn't get into New

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:24.910
York, even if I wanted to, but there was a
sense in me of saying, "I can't just sit here

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.620
with watching what's going on.
I have to help.”

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:33.620
But I couldn't help.
Excuse me? Yeah.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.820
And we had just started one of our Leadership
Programs, and the group couldn't get in.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.750
We had a refrigerator filled with food.
And nobody could get in.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.700
We couldn't get out.
But what happened that was so powerful is,

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:52.490
it locked in for me a memory that was how
I started to put this together with the workplace.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.600
My father died very suddenly of a heart attack
when I was 14.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.550
And on a Saturday night, my parents had gone
out to the movies and Sunday, we were planning

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.839
a funeral.
And it was pretty shocking.

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:10.399
Now, I did a lot of personal work around this,
but fast forward 20 years.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:16.779
And we had an assistant who was wonderful.
We loved her; name was Lisa.

00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:21.360
One day she walked into the office with a
big grin on her face, and she said, "Could

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.250
I see you?”
And she came into the office.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.330
I didn't like the grin. It was too big. It
was too happy.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.140
I knew there was something there, and I wasn't
sure.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.260
And, you know, we said, "What is it?”
She said, "Well, do you remember I said if

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:40.050
 -- when my check from the IRS comes back
 -- if I got a certain amount of money, I

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:44.269
was going to go back to school?”
And I said, "Yes?”

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:47.721
"So I got even more than that, and I'm going
to go back to school.

00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:51.490
So I just want to tell you, I can stay for
another month.”

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.680
And I have to tell you.
This is when I began to see how this plays

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.899
out at work.
In a very mature way as a leader of a company,

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:03.110
I burst into tears and said, "You can't do
that.”

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:08.850
And it was fascinating.
And my husband was with me since we work together.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:13.050
And he said, "Sylvia, how can you stop somebody
from going back to school?”

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:17.899
But I was in another place.
So we asked Lisa to leave, and he said to

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:22.220
me, "You know, I know Lisa's great.
But, you know, there's something else going

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.779
on here?”
And we sat for awhile, and I was able to track

00:16:26.779 --> 00:16:32.300
back that, when my father died, I mean, nobody
asked me.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.860
It was sudden.
It was hardening of the emotions.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:41.230
And here was Lisa saying to me, "I'm leaving.
I'm not asking your permission.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:45.080
I want you to be happy.”
It was certainly a much more joyful way to

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.399
be than it would have been the other way.
But what happened was, I began to understand

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:52.600
that we do bring our families to work with
us.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:17:00.040
We bring everything that happened to us before
we came into the workplace in this space.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.419
And as I saw that connection, we started to
connect more and more dots that came with

00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:08.140
this.
Now the good news here was, we called Lisa

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.209
back.
I apologized.

00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:16.280
I told her, you know, that I was really upset
about something that had nothing to do with

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.030
her.
And for me, one of the things that was very

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:24.780
positive and healing was that I was able to
say, "I would like to be the head of the committee

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.410
for your farewell party.”
So it was different than what happened when

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.400
I was a kid.
So, we planned a really fun party.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.980
And Lisa went off, and she has remained a
friend of ours all these years.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:43.549
Those are the dots you begin to connect.
So it's family, culture, crises.

00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:47.150
We all have aspects of all of that for each
of us.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:53.799
And we have to look at what's going on there.
So Albert Einstein had a great definition

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:56.790
of insanity.
I'm sure many of you know this one.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:01.059
"Doing the same things over and over and expecting
different results.”

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:03.241
Is that familiar?
Do we all do it?

00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:10.390
Am I seeing heads shaking in here? Yeah.
So what we're teaching is the way out.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:16.650
And "OUT" stands for "Observing, Understanding,
and then Transforming.”

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.580
And you need to put some elbow grease in this.
This is not an easy thing to do, but it is

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.890
doable.
Okay, the way OUT, as I said.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:33.460
It's those moments that you have where you
go, "Aha, I never thought of it that way before.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.460
Now, I see another way.
Okay, I'm going to look more deeply." And

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:45.020
we have lots of questions on our website.
You can take a pattern quiz to find out what

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.730
your basic patterns are.
And you can even call the office, and they'll

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:53.420
go over the results with you.
So you can get a sense of where this is locked

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:59.150
in you and what to do about it.
So I'd like to look at each of us.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:04.750
We all were given a deck of cards.
And think about it, you know, the deck of

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.860
cards that Billy Joel's kids were given are
different than the deck of cards that Billy,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.299
the kids -- and I hear he had a lot of kids
 -- his kids were given.

00:19:13.299 --> 00:19:16.841
And we all really have to look at "What is
our deck of cards?”

00:19:16.841 --> 00:19:20.740
It's not good or bad.
It's just the deck of cards that we were given.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.750
And in that deck of cards, there are all kinds
of patterns that show up.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:31.900
So some of the patterns -- and I just would
like to go over this quickly with you is -- the

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.970
"Clown.”
Now, I'm not going to ask you to raise your

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:39.630
hand if you see yourself as a clown.
But, anybody know a clown? Somebody at work?

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.549
Okay.
I see one hand going up over there.

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:48.530
How do you know that that person is a clown?
What do they do or show?

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:53.930
&gt;&gt; The way they interact they make everything
a joke of.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:20:00.960
Sylvia Lafair: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You'll see a lot of these patterns playing

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.350
out in meetings, okay?
Because we've all taken on roles in our families

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:11.540
and we usually have those roles that come
out in the workplace.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:17.021
So the clown is somebody, you're in a meeting,
it's kind of tense, and somebody will make

00:20:17.021 --> 00:20:20.220
a joke.
And what happens is, it deflects things.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:25.299
You stop thinking about what was going on
for the minute, and you go back to either

00:20:25.299 --> 00:20:29.710
laughing at the joke or rolling your eyes
thinking, "Gosh, that was really a dumb joke.”

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:36.990
Now, what happens is often, those who are
in the "clown" category grew up in families

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:42.211
where they were there to help make jokes to
lighten up the load in the family.

00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:46.169
It's interesting.
Jim Carrey was being interviewed on Larry

00:20:46.169 --> 00:20:49.809
King Live one night, and Larry King said to
him, "Were you always funny?”

00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:54.160
And he said, "You know, Larry?
I learned how to be funny as a kid, because

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.390
I had a mother who was ill all the time.
So I would come home from school and I would

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:04.230
put shows on for her and I would do dances.
I would do anything to make her laugh.”

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:10.970
And he said, "It just carried on into my life.”
Now, what happens a lot with clowns is, if

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.720
they can begin to understand what they're
doing, they can turn into humorists.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.580
The difference between a clown and a humorist
is timing.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:26.549
Humorists will put the joke in at the moment
when it has an effect that's really positive.

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:30.480
Clowns will do something so they can deflect
the tension from people.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:37.530
And you know, you have an officemate who's
a clown who may remind you of your dad who

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:43.799
was a clown or a brother who was a clown.
So somewhere, there's a connection that goes

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:47.549
one way or the other.
The Avoider.

00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:52.370
Anybody here know an avoider?
They're the "Gotta Go" guy or gal?

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:57.260
They're the ones in meetings, when it gets
tense, who will look at their watch and say,

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:02.680
"Oops. I have a meeting. I have to call India.”
And you say, "Well, it's two o'clock in the

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.160
morning there.”
And they say, "Oh well, they'll be up anyway.”

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.950
They'll do anything to get out of the meeting,
because they want to get away from the tension.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:16.860
And sometimes, we have sisters who were the
kind who avoided everything.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:21.559
Or a mother or a father or a brother.
It doesn't matter, but somewhere -- and often

00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:27.720
there was in those families a lot of tension
that developed when they were kids.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.160
And they learned, "Conflicts don't get handled,
so you got to go.”

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:41.290
And it can be a difficult time for that.
Victims. We all know those who are saying,

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:46.840
"It's always my fault.
Why me? I did it. You know, I'm going to get

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.350
in trouble.
I'm the one. I'm the one. I'm the one."

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.780
And sometimes it reminds you of, you know,
you're officemate.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.480
And then you can look back, and maybe it's
an aunt in your family who was always playing

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.580
the victim.
But these are the kinds of things in every

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.880
deck of cards.
Here's the good news/bad news.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:11.210
We are some of these patterns, A.
B, all the people around us are other patterns.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:18.930
So what we want to learn is how to understand
these patterns and how to transform them.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:26.400
Now, what I'd like to do is, talk about today
and the economy we're living in.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:33.260
And here's basically what happens.
When stress -- this is really the key right

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:40.020
here -- when stress hits the hot button, we're
all prone to go back to these patterns that

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:45.340
we learned as kids.
And so, if you walk around and say about one

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:51.160
of your officemates, "He or she is acting
like a baby," you're right.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:57.950
It's not good or bad; it's a natural tendency.
Anxiety and stress kick in and will make us

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.580
go to these places.
Does that make sense?

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.450
I see some heads shaking.
Yeah? Make sense? Okay.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:12.090
So we have to learn how to get out of it.
Now, here's what I see happening today in

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.710
this economy.
We call it the "FDIC.”

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.240
It's kind of an insurance policy if you begin
to look at this.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.860
It can help you learn about yourself and about
others that you're talking about.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:31.700
First of all, there's a concept called "Flooding.”
And 'flooding' means, saying the same thing

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:38.539
over and over, getting louder and louder,
thinking the louder you are, the more they'll

00:24:38.539 --> 00:24:40.190
hear you.
Doesn't work.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:45.830
But that's what we do when we flood.
Until the volume is so strong and the emotion

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.130
is so strong, everybody wants to get away
from you.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:56.880
And I have to admit, that's my pattern.
That's my pattern; I must admit it.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.240
And what happens is, those who have that kind
of pattern are usually the superachievers,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:08.730
the ones who have to be tops, best, and if
they can't be, the anxiety gets to be too

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:14.110
much, and they get upset.
The "Persecutor" is the one who's poking a

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:18.720
finger and saying, "you, you, you," and they
get louder and louder as they're doing it.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.179
And the "Drama Queen" or "King.”
And what I'd like you to know is, gentlemen,

00:25:24.179 --> 00:25:27.360
there are as many drama kings as there are
drama queens.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:33.950
I happen to be in that venue, and so when
I get upset, I've learned how to stop it quicker.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.900
Remember, you're not going to ever not have
conflict.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:42.789
But you're also going to be able to take a
deep breath and say, "It doesn't have to go

00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:46.720
as long, and it doesn't have to be as deep.”
So there you go.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.520
Drama Queen, Drama King.
Stamp your feet.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.179
Get louder and louder.
Superachiever, same thing.

00:25:53.179 --> 00:25:57.929
Get louder and louder to get your point across.
Persecutor. Get louder and louder.

00:25:57.929 --> 00:26:02.010
The next one is "Deflecting.”
And deflecting is very different.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.820
Deflecting is like the clown we talked about.
And you'll be in a meeting and it's tense.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.440
And somebody will say, "See that bird that
just flew by the window?”

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.549
And everybody's head turns toward the bird,
right?

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:19.170
But it doesn't help make things change.
It just means that we're all looking at the

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:23.630
bird.
So deflectors block conversations.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:30.720
They prevent conflict from coming to completion,
and when we're in there, they'll keep saying,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.590
"Oh, there's the bird.
The bird's on the tree.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:37.990
Oh, the bird moved over there.”
And you're going, "Who cares?!" But that's

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.750
what you're watching.
And the patterns that do that often are The

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.240
Rebel.
And there are also positives about some of

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.320
these.
But often the rebel is the one who's saying,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:53.450
"It's not working. It's not working.”
And they often go into HR very quickly.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:58.610
Or they say, "I have a lawyer.
And my lawyer said," and everybody gets kind

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.450
of nervous.
The Clown, as we talked about.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:06.419
The Procrastinator, who's always saying, "Tomorrow
and tomorrow and tomorrow.”

00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:11.549
That's deflecting.
Now, we all have a primary way of doing this.

00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:14.520
It's not good or not bad.
We need to know what it is.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.600
And again, if you can take the quiz and find
out, you're in a better place for that.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.630
"Indulging" is a little bit different.
It's sort of like that addictive quality of

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:28.570
wallowing in the details.
And a perfect example was a gal who -- we

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:33.721
were in a meeting -- and she brought in a
brochure, and she said -- she had three different

00:27:33.721 --> 00:27:36.799
brochures.
She said, "Which color green do you like better?”

00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:42.270
Everybody said, "It's the same green,"
"No, no, no. This green's different than this

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.289
has more yellow that has more blue.
Which green do you like better?”

00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:49.080
And it was again, "Who cares?! Just get the
work done.”

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:55.820
But in indulging, you keep saying the same
things over and over again.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.730
And you want to keep going deeper and engaging
people in the conversation.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:07.240
And you end up holding people captive.
So Indulgers are the ones who are Pleasers,

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:13.570
and they say "Yes" to everything.
And the Martyrs who come in early, leave late.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.950
You know, they usually want something from
you.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:20.150
It's either your first born child or your
new car, but you know, they're there wanting

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:25.350
things from you.
The Rescuer, who will jump in and save.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.690
And the Victim is an Indulger, "Poor me. Poor
me. Poor me.”

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:35.179
The fourth -- and the final part of these
four that we all do when we're really under

00:28:35.179 --> 00:28:39.610
stress -- is, compartmentalize.
And that is we only see one aspect of what's

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:43.850
going on.
And there was a group we were working with,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:48.429
and they had a project that had to be done.
And they said, "We'll be here till midnight,

00:28:48.429 --> 00:28:50.970
and that's okay.”
And about four o'clock, one of the guys said,

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.890
"All right, I'm going.”
And they said, "Where?”

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.110
And he said, "To the gym. I'm out of here.”
They said, "Well, wait a minute.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.620
You've got to get this done.”
And "No, no, no. I'm going, I'm going.”

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.580
And he couldn't see that he really needed
to be there to finish.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:12.460
So what happens is, they get tidbits of information
and then they have to leave.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.710
It's too much.
They can't see the whole thing.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:21.860
So the Avoider, "Got to go" guy.
The Denier, "What problem?”

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:26.620
And the Splitter, who says "Well, you know,
this guy tells me one thing and I'll believe

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.850
that.
And this other guy tells me something else

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:33.250
and I'll believe that.”
And you never get anything fully completed.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:39.701
So what happens is, in all these patterns,
they begin to talk to each other.

00:29:39.701 --> 00:29:47.809
So I'm going to give you a few quick clues.
If you're with a Superachiever, and you know

00:29:47.809 --> 00:29:50.601
them, you know who they are, "Me, me, me.
I'm the first one.”

00:29:50.601 --> 00:29:56.610
The best way to talk with them is to say something
like, "I know you're really good at what you

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.350
do.”
They won't hear you unless they're acknowledged.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:03.659
"I know you're really good at what you do.”
So that's where you start.

00:30:03.659 --> 00:30:08.559
The next thing is "So and so, Nancy, needs
some help with this.

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:14.330
And I'll bet that you can help her with it.”
Now, Superachievers don't like to help anybody

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.809
else.
They like to do it themselves and they like

00:30:16.809 --> 00:30:23.390
to get the awards and they like to be recognized.
But if you begin to cross this bridge into

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.260
the helping area.
That's what -- one of the things we were talking

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:35.120
about at lunch was moving toward altruism
and helpfulness, you know, and compassion.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:39.470
We can move in that direction.
We can help each other with this.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:45.870
So first, make sure you tell them that, yes,
by goodness, you know, they're really good.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:51.179
And then say, "With all your good skills,
here's how you can help.”

00:30:51.179 --> 00:30:58.261
And that really is a shape-shifter.
With an Avoider, who becomes an Initiator

00:30:58.261 --> 00:31:06.050
is to say, "If you can stay here with me and
help us through this" -- and these words often

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.740
work -- "it would mean a lot.”
Just those words, "it would mean a lot," usually

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.230
get an avoider to stand still.
And that's what we have to do.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:20.580
So we begin to look at all these patterns
and how they talk to each other.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:28.610
And then, begin to look at the way to observe,
to understand, and to transform.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:34.990
So here's what I'd like you to do right now
is, just on your right hand, I'm going to

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:39.940
go through some of the patterns.
And if that's you, just put a little pressure

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.770
on that hand, okay?
And on your left hand, if it's somebody you

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:50.200
know, okay?
I'm just curious to see what you come up with.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.350
So Superachiever. Are you one?
You're not going to have to stand up and say,

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.850
"Hello, my name is, and I'm a superachiever.”
I promise you that.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.289
But you're just going to get an idea of where
you fit in this.

00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:07.610
So Superachiever, "Me, me, me. I'm the first.
I'm the best.”

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:16.200
Okay? Do you know one, or are you one?
Next, is the Pleaser.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:23.070
And the Pleaser only knows the word 'Yes.'
'No' is a very hard word for them to say.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:28.990
They don't mean 'yes' all the time, but that's
how they say it, because 'no' would be to

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.710
hurt or disapoint somebody, and that's too
big a risk.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.070
So hand, are you a Pleaser, or do you know
a Pleaser?

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:43.669
Okay? Another one that I mentioned was a Denier.
That's somebody who never sees a problem.

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:48.240
We had a big thing here -- and I don't want
to go into politics -- but a year ago right

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.419
around now, there were a lot of people saying,
"What problem with the economy?

00:32:53.419 --> 00:32:57.700
There's no problem with the economy.”
We had a lot of people doing that when there

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.880
was a problem.
Deniers are going, "Everything's fine." They

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.380
can see people grimacing, but they'll still
say, "There's no problem here.”

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.960
Do you know a Denier, or are you a Denier,
okay?

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.500
Two more.
Another one would be the Martyr.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.630
The one who says, "I'm always doing everything
for everybody.”

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:24.060
Do you do that, or do you know somebody who
does that, okay?

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.909
One more would be the Procrastinator.
That's the person who says, "It'll be done

00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:29.760
tomorrow.
I promise it'll be done.”

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:35.350
And then, tomorrow comes and they say, "Well,
I need another day." Procrastinator.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:42.950
Do you know one, or are you one? So on the
hand -- the left hand -- which was you, how

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:50.350
many people had more than three?
Let me see your hands up in the air.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:56.230
That you saw yourself in any of these.
Oh, yourself was your right hand; I'm sorry.

00:33:56.230 --> 00:34:04.570
How many saw themselves in any of these patterns?
Okay. How many saw a lot of other people with

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:10.140
the left hand?
Uh-huh. And some of you didn't see the patterns

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:14.790
at all is what I'm getting.
Okay. How many of you didn't see the patterns

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:19.589
on yourself or anybody else?
We're just not getting hands up with that.

00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:25.909
Okay. All right.
One of the things that is really good to do

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:32.609
is to begin to notice when you're in the different
situations how you're saying 'always' and

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:39.710
'never.' How you're saying, "This is the way
that person is." and how annoyed that gets

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:44.500
you.
And how you say, "Oh, this is me, you know,

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:49.260
I have that tendency.”
So those are the things I'd like you to take

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:54.000
with you and look at.
And here's the good news: The patterns can

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.480
be transformed, okay?
So the Superachiever, once they get it, becomes

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:06.220
a creative collaborator.
And one of the pharmaceutical groups we worked

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:10.550
with -- there was a brilliant scientist.
She had a team, and everybody on her team

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.339
was 'stupid'.
Everybody was, I mean, "stupid, stupid, stupid.”

00:35:14.339 --> 00:35:18.119
And I said to her one day, "When is it going
to be my turn to be 'stupid'?”

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:22.160
And she said, "No, no, that won't happen.”
And I said, "Till I say something you don't

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.770
like, and then I'll go in the 'stupid' category.”
She finally was able to understand that her

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:32.570
need to be first was bigger than it was to
work with the team.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:39.430
And once she began to understand that, change
came, and she had a team that could work together.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:43.990
But she had to begin to say to them, "Look,
I don't want to be this way anymore and I

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:47.070
need some help with it.”
She did it through some coaching, and she

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:51.260
did it by having some honest conversations
with her team.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:57.380
The Rebel -- rather than having the same "I
have a lawyer" -- becomes a community builder,

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.250
and says, "Wait a minute.
There has to be a better way to do this, and

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:07.510
let's all work together to get it done.”
The Procrastinator becomes a Realizer.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:12.190
And that means somebody who gets the work
done, who makes the work happen.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:19.130
The Clown, as I said, becomes a Humorist.
And that's -- Mark Twain kind of had the market

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.839
on that.
It's being able to say something in the right

00:36:22.839 --> 00:36:28.080
time that will get a laugh, but not something
that deflects everything.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.170
The Persecutor, who's always pointing their
finger, "You, you, you," can point it up and

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:37.849
become a visionary and say, "We can work together
and find a better way.”

00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:43.140
The Persecutor is always looking at a Victim.
And the Victim, instead of saying, "Me, me,

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.180
me.
Blah, blah, blah." is saying, "I'm going to

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:52.380
find a new way," and they become explorers.
The Rescuer, who's always jumping in to save

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:58.790
the Victim, becomes a mentor.
And the Mentor asks questions, rather than

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:03.050
simply says, "I'll take care of it for you,
and I'll help you with it.”

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:14.520
The Drama Queen or King becomes a good storyteller.
And that's where I learned how to take some

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:21.300
of my drama -- what happened, and how I understood
this is one day, in the morning, I was stamping

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.359
my foot and somebody said, "Man, that's enough
drama for a week.”

00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:27.930
And I thought, "Well that's just what they
have to say.”

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:33.599
And later that day, I was with my team, and
they said, "A little too much drama.”

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:37.580
And then, later that day, one of my daughters
and I were talking, and she said, "You know,

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:41.099
mom. Too much drama.
I think I'll talk to you another day.”

00:37:41.099 --> 00:37:46.501
And I went, "Woe, the only constant in there
is me." And that's how these patterns started

00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:53.140
to develop and how we began to work with them.
The Martyr becomes an Integrator, and instead

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:58.990
of saying, "I'll carry that very heavy rock
up that very steep hill alone," the Martyr

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:04.390
begins to say, "Okay, you do that. You do
that. You do that, and we'll all get it up

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.320
together.”
The Pleaser learns how to become a Truth Teller.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.440
The Pleaser -- we were in a meeting, and it
was very interesting.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.540
The owner of this company wanted to buy another
business.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.490
He had a thing about buying businesses.
And he would always turn to his general manager,

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:25.920
and say, "Take care of it." And we were together
with him in a senior meeting.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.920
And he said, "Oh, I just thought of another
business to buy," and it got really quiet.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.240
And he said, "What do you think?”
And it got even quieter.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:40.390
And finally, she turned to him, and she said,
"You know, my tendency is to be a Pleaser,

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:45.020
and I can't do it anymore.
And if you want to buy the business, that's

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.760
up to you.
But the problem here is, I won't be able to

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.251
participate. It's too much.
It's going to be too much on me and too much

00:38:52.251 --> 00:38:56.359
on the team."
Well, needless to say, it was very, very quiet

00:38:56.359 --> 00:39:01.270
in that room.
Very quiet for a long time.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.530
It was probably sixty seconds, but it felt
like about two years.

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:10.040
And then, the owner of the company said, "You've
never said that before.”

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:16.530
And she said, "I'm just now learning how to
say the word 'no,' where it's appropriate.”

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.570
What happened is, she became a bit of a hero
for the group.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:26.020
And it wasn't a mutiny against the boss.
She and the boss had a discussion, and she

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:30.140
said, "Everybody's afraid to say to you, This
isn't working.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.920
And I'm not willing to do it anymore.
My health is at stake.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.040
The team's health is at stake.
We're not going to do it.”

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:43.490
And she had a practice -- the word N-O, 'no,'
is a hard one for pleasers to say -- but she

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.859
became a Truth Teller, and you could see it
in her life.

00:39:46.859 --> 00:39:50.190
And six months later, the company was at a
whole new place.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:55.090
They did not buy -- he did not buy that business
by the way, and it was probably one of the

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:59.020
best decisions that he made.
And, you know, he was able to acknowledge

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:04.330
her in a team meeting later.
It was a pretty powerful kind of thing.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:10.490
The Avoider becomes the Initiator, who says,
"No, instead of me running from the conflict,

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:14.220
I'm going to sit here and make sure we talk
about it.”

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:19.810
The Denier becomes a Trust Builder by saying,
"There is a problem and we have to face it

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:26.280
and we're going to dig down and find solutions.”
And the Splitter, who goes from one to the

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:31.710
other, becomes a Peace Maker saying, "Listen.
We have to stop all the office politics and

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:36.349
the gossip and talk together and work together
and be together.”

00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:43.480
And so, in between where it says the pattern
and the transformation, there's a lot of elbow

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.020
grease.
That's where the work is.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:51.030
That's what I call 'strength-training.' I
believe it's really important for everybody

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:56.970
in business to understand these and to make
a commitment -- not to change the other person

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:00.410
out there, because it's not possible -- but
to change ourselves.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:07.270
Because in changing ourselves, what we do
is, we begin to process of making a shift

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:13.829
for the whole team and for ourselves.
And yeah, my husband Herb just wanted me to

00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:18.730
remind you that one of the things we teach
is that "Work is not a Rehab Facility.”

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:24.540
So if there are places where there isn't a
capacity to breakthrough, that's okay too.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:31.550
Sometimes people have to self-select out or
be offered the way out to find out in another

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:37.960
situation what they're going to do.
These are what we call pattern-aware leaders.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:43.450
These are people who have looked inside and
have made changes for themselves and, in doing

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:47.650
that, others have changed.
So Martin Luther King has been an incredible

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:52.710
community builder.
Nelson Mandela, an integrator.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:56.710
Abraham Lincoln -- and if you haven't read,
"Team of Rivals," even though it's a very

00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:00.550
thick book.
It's an incredible book of the brilliance

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:06.210
of becoming a community builder.
Eleanor Roosevelt was an integrator.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:12.079
She -- at a time that women in the culture
of the times didn't have a lot of say -- said,

00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:18.470
"Wait a minute. I will stand up and say what
needs to be said and not just have tea parties.”

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:23.579
And the Dalai Lama is obviously an incredible
peace maker.

00:42:23.579 --> 00:42:30.720
So that's kind of the grand scheme overview.
And I'd love to open this up to questions,

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.300
comments.
I know I've thrown a lot at you in a short

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:40.109
time, but I really wanted to get across the
idea that, "These are in us, and if we can

00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:46.680
transform them, we can move to next levels
of really positiveness in our work and who

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.210
we are.”
So thank you so much, and Any questions anybody

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.470
has? Thank you.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.359
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:42:54.359 --> 00:43:08.040
Q So I'm wondering if there are any patterns
and themes in how people can recognize their

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.530
own patterns when they're operating.
I know sometimes it's just so default for

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:19.400
us, but maybe there are some tips or recommendations
you have there? Sylvia: What you can do -- we,

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:25.390
in our leadership program, we ask people to
do this -- is to, at the end of each day,

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:34.391
jot down places where you were really annoyed,
where somebody really bothered you.

00:43:34.391 --> 00:43:38.470
Now, it always start with "out there.”
Which is okay.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:44.580
But if you do that, and keep this for a couple
of weeks, you'll begin to see the dots connecting.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:49.000
You know, it's interesting.
Did you ever sit in a meeting, and two people

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.650
could say, "Tomorrow's Tuesday.”
And the first person who says it, you go,

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.690
"Okay, tomorrow's Tuesday.”
The second person who says it, you go, "Can't

00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:01.980
they ever just keep their mouth shut?”
So you begin to say, "What is it about that

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:06.630
person or that moment that bothered me, and
it didn't in the other one?”

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:10.869
But if you begin to jot this thing down -- jot
these down.

00:44:10.869 --> 00:44:17.250
Your task is to connect the dots.
They're connectible.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:22.030
We've done this now for 20 years, and thus,
the book has come out.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:30.150
And you can really begin to see how the same
situation or the same person on different

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:36.020
days really starts to get you.
The other thing is really trust your gut.

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:42.589
We have an internal mechanism in our solar
plexus right around here that, you know, you

00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:46.829
can call it the B S Detector.
We think it's in here, but it's really down

00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:50.480
here.
And if you're in a situation that really starts

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:56.020
to bother you, bother you, bother you, and
you feel that tightening in you, just jot

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:59.740
it down.
You don't have to write long dissertations.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:03.150
A couple of sentences.
And do it for a month.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:07.730
And I promise you, you'll begin to see your
own patterns showing up.

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:13.570
What we've also found is, in teams, when people
begin to understand this, they can help each

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.950
other.
You know, and it's not finger-pointing, saying,

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:20.970
"Oh, you are a --" We're not meant to emblazon
these patterns on our foreheads.

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:25.310
We're not the patterns.
It is just a part of who we are.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:29.220
So did that help?
Go ahead.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:35.160
Q As you were talking, also when we think
 -- I don't know if you've read any of Debbie

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.869
Ford's work -- about sort of shadow processes
of the personality.

00:45:36.869 --> 00:45:41.550
And one thing she recommends is looking for
where that lives in you.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.630
So really identifying How do I show up as
an Avoider?

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:48.060
Or, How do I show up as a Denier? as a way
in.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.721
Sylvia Lafair: That's good and Debbie Ford's
work is really good.

00:45:52.721 --> 00:45:56.190
One of the things you can look -- you can
call this the "shadow side" if you want -- these

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.510
patterns.
And the transformed -- or what we call the

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:04.589
"healthy opposites.”
And once you begin to look at that, what I

00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:09.400
have found is people usually do better if
they're looking out there first, because it's

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.119
just our human nature.
And then, bring it inside and say, "Wait a

00:46:13.119 --> 00:46:16.670
minute.
If so and so is really bothering me day after

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:20.460
day after day, what part am I playing in this?”
And then start to turn it.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:32.089
So that was a really good question.
Anybody else?

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:35.549
Questions?

00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:39.020
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:50.290
Sylvia Lafair: Excellent. Yeah.
It's called -- I'm going to repeat it, but

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:55.359
it's called "The Battle of the Patterns.”
And sometimes the patterns we have are very

00:46:55.359 --> 00:47:03.060
intense -- and they do -- one other person
will just drive us absolutely up the wall.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.890
Here's a part.
You can take it offline, the question is Do

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:10.869
you have to do it in front of the whole team?
Or, Can you take it offline and work with

00:47:10.869 --> 00:47:14.109
it?
Is that one of the questions you're asking?

00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:15.109
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:25.210
Sylvia Lafair: Yeah. Oh sure.
Well then, let me put it this way.

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:28.420
There's always resolution.
It may not be in the time frame you like,

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.220
but there always -- it could take longer.
I'll give you an example.

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:36.750
As a Drama Queen -- and I'm married to an
Avoider -- I mean, some of the stuff we've

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:41.849
done would be Comedy Central.
You know, I'm going, "Ba, ba ba, ba ba, ba

00:47:41.849 --> 00:47:42.849
ba.”
And my husband's going, "Got to go.”

00:47:42.849 --> 00:47:46.450
And we work together.
So there you go.

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:50.220
And he'd be going out the door, and I'm following
him saying, "You can't leave.”

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:56.250
And he's going, "That drama is too much.”
So what happened is, one of the things he

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.770
learned -- we won't talk about me at the moment
 -- was to be an initiator.

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:03.140
And what happened is, he would then say, "We're
in the middle of this.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:09.220
We're going to sit down and talk about it.”
And I'm there with my mouth open going, "No,

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.940
you're supposed to leave.
We can't talk about this.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:18.450
Then I can't do my Drama Queen.”
What happens is, one person has to make the

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:23.940
decision to make the change.
Now, the change is internal. It is ours.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:27.680
It's what we're talking about.
It's what Dan Goleman talks about when he

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.540
talks about emotional intelligence.
Ultimately the change is ours to make.

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:40.589
It is also possible to make it together.
So I believe people do need to go offline

00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:43.730
who are driving each other crazy and talk
about it.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:49.720
The way it stops is, whoever the first one
is to own the pattern -- literally own it

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:56.329
 -- we do a process called 'Pep Talk,' which
stands for "Pattern and Counterprocess," where

00:48:56.329 --> 00:49:01.040
it's almost like a big sumo wrestler in the
sky, and you have to tackle this thing to

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:07.090
the ground.
Two people together can make agreements on

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:10.890
how they're going to behave differently in
the next meeting, and the next meeting you

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:16.329
see changes that are incredible.
Often you'll need a facilitator to help if

00:49:16.329 --> 00:49:21.710
it gets to be too much.
But once you begin -- as I talked about this

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:27.010
gal who said, as a Pleaser, she was turning
into a Truth Teller -- it changed the whole

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:31.730
context of the team, because other people
then were able to speak up and say what they

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:38.020
need to.
What I'm suggesting is that the ultimate thing

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:43.000
we need to be doing now is learning how to
tell the truth and have the courage to stand

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:51.970
with it and not be afraid.
And as we do that, other people become very

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:58.250
 -- it's very appealing.
And so what happens at that point is the dialogue

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:02.390
begins, and it's different.
So, does that help? Anybody else?

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:04.319
Questions? Comments? Thoughts?
[pause]

00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:16.250
I know you have a question.
[laughter]

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:20.541
Find one.

00:50:20.541 --> 00:50:23.440
Q I have so many questions.
I'll just ask the one that comes to my mind

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.500
immediately which is You did this work as
a family therapist before corporate therapist

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.400
of some sort.
I'm wondering what the differences are like,

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:35.380
between 'at home' and 'at work' that we can
learn from.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:41.359
Sylvia Lafair: That's very good.
It began working with families.

00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:47.710
I will tell you, I find working in the business
world faster, more effective, than I ever

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:52.099
did with families, which is -- it was a surprise
to me too.

00:50:52.099 --> 00:50:58.110
Because I was used to usually dissatisfied
spouses dragging in their partner who would

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:01.869
sit there going, "How long 'til I get out
of here?"

00:51:01.869 --> 00:51:07.650
Whereas, at work, there is this yearning to
be the best, do the best, find a way to what's

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:12.230
next, and I have found people listen more
quickly.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:18.910
And it's a little safer to have a discussion
with a colleague who's upset than with your

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:24.839
husband or wife who's upset.
And what happens there is, it gets translated

00:51:24.839 --> 00:51:29.130
back home.
We've had a lot of people -- spouses, partners

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:32.150
 -- call up and say, "Thank you."
And I'd say, "For what?”

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:37.040
And they'd say, "I don't know what you're
doing, but so and so is really asking better

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.869
questions, being nicer.”
The biggest thing in this is learning how

00:51:40.869 --> 00:51:44.480
to ask the questions that will forward the
dialogue.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:49.180
But I have found in the workplace it moves
much more quickly.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:55.060
And when people on teams are beginning to
see really, really, good successes, and people

00:51:55.060 --> 00:52:00.200
are working together in a more effective manner
without, you know, sitting in meetings.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.670
And if you're not rolling your eyes in meetings,
sometimes internally you're rolling your eyes

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:08.910
in meetings, you know.
We all do that.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:15.529
And we have a little video -- we didn't bring
for this, because it's too short a presentation

00:52:15.529 --> 00:52:19.490
 -- of what goes on in meetings that are not
seen.

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:24.089
And we showed this, and somebody said -- I
said -- "This is what a meeting really looks

00:52:24.089 --> 00:52:26.240
like.”
And people were throwing spit balls at each

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.869
other, combing their hair and on their cell
phones and complaining.

00:52:29.869 --> 00:52:34.530
And I said, "Is this really a meeting?”
And we had taken a group that we worked with

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:38.440
for a long time, and we said, "Play out what
you think is going on internally.”

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:45.250
And it's pretty funny when you see it, because
you can be sitting in the room behaving very

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:51.310
properly, but your mind isn't there.
Now, I'll give you one that was very powerful,

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:55.390
and it changed this guy's personal life as
well as his business life.

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:58.531
We were doing best practices, and he stood
up.

00:52:58.531 --> 00:53:03.450
We were sitting at a big table, and there
were about 20 people and he stood up and he

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:08.300
started going on and on about how wonderful
he was and all these great successes he had

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:10.869
had.
And I looked around the room.

00:53:10.869 --> 00:53:16.400
Nobody was there.
I mean people were out shopping in their minds,

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.710
you know.
Somebody was saying, "I have to call and see

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:22.770
how the kids are doing." Somebody else was
figuring out some equation that they were

00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:26.800
working on in their mind.
And finally, I stopped it.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.590
I happened to be running the meeting, and
I said to him -- and I'm offering this to

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:34.319
you.
It's a pretty powerful sentence.

00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:40.910
All I said to him is, "What is your intention?”
Trust me. Everybody came back in the room

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:44.900
at that moment.
They stopped buying their cars outside.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.650
They stopped going to the market.
The room -- all eyes were on this guy.

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:50.960
His name was Jerry.
It was very quiet.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:55.860
I didn't know what he was going to say.
And finally, he looked around the room, and

00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:01.470
he said, "I apologize."
He said, "I was grandstanding.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:05.010
And my intention was to just show you how
really good I am.

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:10.430
And it went to overkill.”
So I did what good facilitators do.

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:17.190
I took a break.
And I watched when we took the break how many

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:22.819
people made a beeline to pat him on the back
or shake his hand or thank him, because he

00:54:22.819 --> 00:54:25.760
did what?
He told the truth.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.560
And when we came back after the break, we
didn't spend time going into "What did you

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.990
think of what happened?”
It wasn't appropriate or necessary.

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:38.329
We went on to "What's next?”
The rest of that afternoon they were kick-ass

00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:44.170
in terms of coming up with new, creative ideas,
because there was something so enlivening

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:49.210
about the fact that, in a few seconds, he
told the truth, owned his pattern.

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:53.160
You know, he didn't stand there and say, "I'm
a Superachiever.”

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.900
He said, " I was grandstanding.”
You don't have to use the names of these patterns

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.880
as much.
You just have to begin to be conscious of

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.740
it.
And he became a bit of a hero for the rest

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:05.069
of that year.
People were going to him and really asking

00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:13.420
him about how he was doing what he was doing
once he was able to own it.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:19.329
So then he took that home.
And what happened was, his wife called and

00:55:19.329 --> 00:55:24.500
said, "I don't hear him talking, 'me me me'
and 'How great I am' anymore, you know.

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:28.609
He's become more of a collaborator.”
So good question. Thank you.

00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:34.270
Anybody else? Thoughts?

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:39.619
Q So, so far, you've covered a lot of dysfunctional
behaviors.

00:55:39.619 --> 00:55:44.100
You start with a team that's in trouble or
family that's in trouble and to find the patterns

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.920
of this disfunction and try to address and
make things better.

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:56.680
What if my team has no disfunction? It's special.
And, rather than focus on the negative of

00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:00.000
all the disfunction and try to cure them,
where are some of the patterns that we could

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.670
look for to actually nurture and get to the
next level?

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:09.640
Sylvia Lafair: Yeah. Beautiful.
The patterns -- and they seem all to be in

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:16.910
the neocortex -- are the patterns of altruism
of sharing of higher-level communication.

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:24.780
This book that was written was about finding
out the patterns that aren't working, that

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:30.589
we don't need to bring to work anymore, and
to move out of the lower parts of the brain.

00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:37.540
But I think that once you get a team that
really is helpful, and you begin to continuously

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:45.220
acknowledge that, there's tools we have -- I
can't go into now, but -- for even heightening

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:51.240
the innovative, creative part of working together.
The 'aha' part of it.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.910
And once we breakthrough -- obviously, you're
very lucky, and you've done good work, and

00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:02.380
have a good team -- that's where we're headed.
We're headed to teams that work together.

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:06.060
This one team that we worked with -- the one
I told you did this "How to have a meeting"

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:11.829
that was really kind of crazy -- they were
winning awards in their company all over the

00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:15.310
place.
And we started getting a lot of calls, and

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:21.730
I would say, "What do you want?”
And they'd say, "We want to be like ABC team.”

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:25.099
And I go, "Why?”
And some of them said, "Because they're bringing

00:57:25.099 --> 00:57:29.630
in so much money, and they're so good at sales
and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.”

00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:32.900
Couple groups that called said, "We watched
them at some of the meetings.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:37.230
They really like each other.
We see it when they go out to dinner.

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:40.040
We see it at breaks.
That's what we want.”

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:43.130
Those were the ones we chose to do more of
the work with.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:48.270
The funny thing is, at end of the year, there
was more competition for the higher levels

00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:52.250
of success in sales, because these other groups
were getting there too.

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:55.190
So you just keep going, and you do lots of
acknowledging.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:58:01.960
So that's a very good question.
Well, I see our time is up.

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:08.599
Oh, I'm move the slide.
So you can take the quiz on our website, send

00:58:08.599 --> 00:58:14.710
it to a friend, and you can get a consultation
that will help you dig more deeply into where

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:21.130
the pattern comes from and then decide what
you want to do with it. And that's it.

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.601
Thanks to everyone. Thank you.

00:58:23.601 --> 00:58:23.729
