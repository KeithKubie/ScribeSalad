1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,070
The problem is when I tell them
I, the problem I had, dude,

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:09,000
the problem I have with
be an entertainment before
they give you questions to

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:12,000
ask and you have to ask them or
literally it could be your job.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,340
So they float out like a
bunch of real dumb ones.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,000
Did they give you any room to like, oh
yeah, you could do whatever you want,

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,430
but there'll be like, hey,
you gotta ask this question.

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:23,880
And it's like if somebody just got
divorced, you gotta be like, Hey man,

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,370
what happened in divorced? Oh, and it
sucks. You got to ask women that. Yeah,

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,080
that's why I stopped doing
it, man. I couldn't one time.
Uh, what's her name? Uh,

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,340
and uh, God, what's her name? Uh,
she, she was in devil's wear Prada,

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,990
not a Meryl Streep,
but, and Anne Hathaway.

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,060
So they gave me the dumbest question
as Anne Hathaway, she, Kim Kardashian,

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,650
Kanye West were on the cover of vogue.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,720
And right before that it
was Anne Hathaway. And so
they told me, they go, hey,

15
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,060
why don't you ask her what
she thinks about the cover?

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,290
Because everybody was like, oh, this is
bull crap that Kim Kardashian was on it.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,530
I asked Anne Hathaway that
question and she goes, well,

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,860
you know I don't run the magazine so it
really doesn't matter to me. I'm like,

19
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:10,470
fine. So I've finished the question.
I'm walking down the stairs and killed.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,400
Then I hear, she goes, why the
fuck would he ask me that question?

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,650
I don't give a shit
who's on that magazine.

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,850
And I was about to turn back around cause
I kinda got mad. But now I was like,

23
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:24,240
man, she's fucking right. That was a dumb
ass question. If you could say, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:27,960
They made me ask you a question.
I just too late and it was too late.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,890
I just feel so stupid
asking those questions.

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,920
Series like winding you up like a little
robot. Click, click, click, get out there.

27
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:39,000
Ask the question, don't ask. Oh,
they get so trouble. Oh yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,140
They threatened your job with it.

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,660
Well that's why those shows
are always so canned. You know,

30
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:46,920
when you have people talking to as
entertainers and everything, so canned,

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,660
it just seems so inauthentic.

32
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,410
Like they wanted me to ask
my first interview ever was
with Jennifer Aniston and

33
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:56,400
Marley and me. And this is right
after she broke up with Brad Pitt.

34
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,080
They want you to ask about
proud. They wanted me to ask
about, and I was like, no,

35
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:05,820
I can't do that to tell them no, no.
I, I, no, it was my first gay you too.

36
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,110
So no, I didn't. So I said, what if
I figure out a different way to ask?

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,270
So I found, so what I, they
were like, whatever you get,
we need a clip. You know?

38
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,950
And this was when I was at e entertainment
and this was my first big shoot ever,

39
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:22,230
Jennifer Aniston. And they were
like, you're going to go out there.

40
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:27,140
So it was Marley and me. So she just
broke up with Brad Pitt. So I go, uh,

41
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,500
since the movie's about a dog, I
go, what's the, uh, what's the, um,

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,000
what's the similarities
between a dog and a man?

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,330
And she labs and gives a great answer
about you. No one will be around,

44
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:45,800
but a dog is always forever. You
know, like men could treat you wrong.

45
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,450
So I got a great answer from it and
I didn't have to ask about prep.

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,160
And that's the thing is if you find a
smart way to ask it, you can ask it.

47
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:57,780
But they just sometimes want you to be
just so brutal. It's, it's, I can't,

48
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,140
because they don't have to do it and
they don't keep the relationships.

49
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,390
They don't care about the,
exactly. And they just don't,

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,350
they don't even care about you.

51
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,190
You're a little trained person that they
send out a little monkey. Hey Patterson,

52
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,150
little person listened to me as a
person. You have to listen. The,

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,300
the person who signs the paper.
Yeah,

54
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,160
it's the send you off and give
you little fucking direction. Oh,

55
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,150
it's the grossest,

56
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,030
I mean it was amazing because I got
to build relationships with people,

57
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,940
but like good for you for recognizing it.
Oh,

58
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,480
100% a hundred I knew they were doing
so once, you may not even be that,

59
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:36,190
but I recognize you've got
to get out of that. Oh, 100%
it's, I, I, my soul couldn't.

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,073
I couldn't,

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,350
I couldn't ask people about them breaking
up or something tragic happening in

62
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,860
their lives. Like, how are you doing now?

63
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:46,330
Is running to some of them TMZ dudes
that feel bad. I'm like, look, Bro,

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,840
I feel bad too,
but I'm not talking to you like this.

65
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,760
There's nothing good ever comes out of
these. Like it's no disrespect to you.

66
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,910
I know you're doing a job. I'd probably
do the same job if I was in your place.

67
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,390
If I was a kid when I was a kid of TMZ
was around it. I take that job. Yeah,

68
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,510
we're going to do is just try to ask them
famous too. Funny question, but it was,

69
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,630
it's just like, it's not the
way to discuss things. No.

70
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:09,820
I discuss things and you're coming out
of the airport or you're on your way to a

71
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:12,520
fucking restaurant somewhere and someone's
takes a camera in your face. Like,

72
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:16,630
come on. Well, I wasn't doing that. I was,
I was. We were going to junk it. No, no.

73
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,310
We're talking about TMC. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. But I mean, there's these,

74
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,200
these junkets are a
brutal assault on reality.

75
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,040
This, you're saying the same thing
over and over and over again.

76
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:30,970
You asked you in this sense,

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,470
everyone asks you the same question and
they'll tell. So tell us about this show.

78
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,370
Michael, you play, uh,

79
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,540
play Michael Yo real name.

80
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,980
This is crazy.
