00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.254
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:05.420
EMILY FLETCHER: Hi, friends.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.057
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:08.640
I am really excited
about the turnout.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.149
We weren't really sure how
many people we would have.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.690
I like that we're
standing room only.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.200
And hello to our friends
who are watching online.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.860
So this talk is
titled "Why Meditation

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.340
is the New Caffeine."

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.510
And I love that these
two words are even

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.310
being used in the
same conversation

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.140
because why would any
of us drink caffeine?

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.720
Because we want to get
more done in less time.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.880
So it leads me to believe
that meditation is really

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.190
starting to be thought of, now,
as a productivity tool, which

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.690
is exciting to me because this
has been my mission with Ziva

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.390
Meditation is to re-brand
meditation as a productivity

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.190
tool.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.840
So before we start,
I want us to get

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.090
on the same page on
a few vocab words.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.640
Remember, like, we're in
third grade, just vocab.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.940
So Ziva is a Sanskrit
word that means bliss.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.110
It's one of the many Sanskrit
words that mean bliss.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.526
It's also a Hebrew
name that means

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:57.450
one who is radiant or kind.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.290
And since bliss,
radiance, and kindness

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.270
are very common side
effects of meditation,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.470
it felt like a good fit.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.886
Plus, I thought
it would look good

00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:06.270
on a t-shirt, which it does.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.160
And PS, when I say the word
bliss, I don't mean happiness.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.027
When I say bliss, I mean a
calm, quiet inner contentedness.

00:01:13.027 --> 00:01:15.110
It's the piece of you that
knows that everything's

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.610
going to be OK.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.640
And it's possible to experience
bliss even when you're sad,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.877
even when you're angry.

00:01:20.877 --> 00:01:22.960
Bliss is sort of like this
background piece of you

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.797
that knows that it's all
going to work out just fine.

00:01:25.797 --> 00:01:28.130
So the word meditation, though,
is a little bit trickier

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.370
to define because we all
have our idea of what

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.917
we think meditation is.

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.000
The word meditation is
sort of like the word food.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You know, so we're all
enjoying our lunch today,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.660
and so just like
different types of food

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.270
will do different
things to the body,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.650
different types of meditation
will do different things

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.075
to your brain and
nervous system.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:46.450
So one of the things we're
going to cover in today's talk

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.410
is the differences between
the two most popular styles

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.557
of meditation and how they
affect the brain differently.

00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:55.390
But I'm really just
thrilled that we're even

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.160
talking about meditation and
caffeine in the same sentence.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.035
So today, we'll cover
that-- why meditation's

00:02:00.035 --> 00:02:03.200
the new caffeine, the two most
popular styles of meditation

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.290
and how they affect
the brain differently,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.102
when stress is
actually good for you.

00:02:07.102 --> 00:02:09.060
Stress is getting sort
of a bad rap these days.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.539
We're going to talk about
when it's good for you.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.600
And then, also, how
to not let your goals

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.301
get in the way of your success.

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.800
I'm going to take
a shot in the dark

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.360
and guess that most of you
guys are overachievers,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.600
in this room, and
very ambitious,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.930
and goals and results-oriented.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.920
So yes.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.920
So before we talk about why
meditation is the new caffeine,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.600
I think that we have to
look a little bit deeper

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.810
into what caffeine does
to our nervous system

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.550
and what meditation does
to our nervous system

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.770
because interestingly, there
are quite a few similarities.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.590
Both will make you
feel more energetic.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.710
Both can make you
more productive.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.870
You have to do both
of them every day.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.202
You have to stop the inertia
of your day, to do both.

00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:55.160
So you know, Jerry Seinfeld
has been practicing

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.640
the same style of meditation
that I teach for 40 years.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.782
And he likens it to a cellphone
charger for your mind and body.

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:03.740
He's like, you meditate,
and on the other side,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.270
you come out more
refreshed, more recharged.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.930
So this is what it can feel
like, after we drink caffeine.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.540
So as I was preparing
for this talk,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.450
I did quite a bit of
research on exactly what

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.700
caffeine is doing to the body.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.246
And some of the
things surprised me.

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:19.870
I thought that caffeine
was just simply

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.930
a stimulant, that it
just sort of stimulated

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.420
your nervous system and
that's the reason that you

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.253
got more productive.

00:03:24.253 --> 00:03:26.200
But it's not as simple as that.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.460
Molecularly, caffeine is very
similar to a chemical called

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.770
adenosine.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.972
Now, adenosine is the thing
that your brain produces

00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:35.180
throughout the day-- which
is what makes you sleepy--

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.690
and is the thing
that cues you to go

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.420
to bed at the end of the night.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.247
So when you ingest caffeine,
these caffeine molecules

00:03:42.247 --> 00:03:43.830
are very similar to
adenosine, so they

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.270
block your brain's
adenosine receptors.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.550
So it disallows your brain
from knowing that you're tired,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.120
which is why you're
able to do more.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.870
You know, mid-afternoon,
you're like, oof,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.670
I've got to take a nap.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.630
But you're like, I don't
have time to take a nap,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.171
so let me drink some
coffee, instead.

00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:58.050
And then you're
able to power out.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.452
Sounds good so far, right?

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:01.410
But now we've got to talk
about the differences

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.850
between meditation and caffeine.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.630
Caffeine is essentially
artificially hijacking

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.760
your nervous system.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.290
It's disallowing you from
feeling how tired you

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.480
are because that caffeine
is mimicking that adenosine

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.250
and blocking those receptors
in your brain, which is not

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.329
that bad for you,
in and of itself.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.390
It's not hurting you
while it's happening.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.520
But the other thing
that caffeine does

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.500
is that it stimulates more
neural activity in the brain.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.360
And when your pituitary
gland notices this increase

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.310
in neural activity,
it thinks that there's

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.120
some sort of an
emergency happening.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.150
And so it triggers
your adrenal glands

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.030
to start releasing adrenalin.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.750
And as you guys probably
know, adrenaline

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.170
is the number one
stress chemical

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.670
that gets released in your body
when you launch into a fight

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.180
or flight stress reaction.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.399
So basically, caffeine will
make you more productive.

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:50.940
It will make you
feel more energized.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.655
But there's quite a cost
that you have to pay.

00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:54.610
There's quite a price that
you have to pay for that.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.160
And really, that's
the come down.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.312
So you drink too
much coffee, and you

00:04:57.312 --> 00:04:59.050
start to get the
nervous shakes, right?

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.120
Or afterwards, you
feel even more tired

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.840
than you were
before you started?

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.040
This is really the
price that we pay.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.330
I liken the human
body to a casino--

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.830
you can cheat it
for a little while.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.450
You can come out ahead
for a little while,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.970
but ultimately,
the house is always

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.900
going to win because
your body is,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.140
in fact, a perfect accountant.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.930
So now let's talk
about what meditation

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.110
is doing to the body.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.610
Excuse me.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.210
I think I have a little
adrenalin going right now.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.960
I talk really fast
about meditation,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.520
and you get a little dry mouth.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.530
So meditation will also
make you more productive.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.800
And it will also energize you.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.190
But it does it very
differently than caffeine does.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.190
What meditation does is
that it gives your body

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.500
rest that is arguably
somewhere between two

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.230
to five times deeper than sleep.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.890
So this is not an
insignificant point.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.270
When you meditate,
you're giving your body

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.440
rest that is somewhere
between two to five times

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.240
deeper than sleep.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.510
And when you give your
body that deep rest,

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.150
you're essentially de-exciting
your nervous system.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.155
And when you de-excite
something, you create order.

00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:02.030
When you create order
in your nervous system,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.280
then all of those stresses
that we've been picking up,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.870
through our decades
of overachieving,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.930
can start to leave the building.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.760
So imagine that you have a
pot of water on the stove.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.970
If you turn up the heat
on that pot of water,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.800
and you excite the
molecules, they're

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.300
going to start to
move very quickly.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.180
And if you're trying to
extract something out

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.620
of that pot of boiling water, so
you have like a grain of rice--

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.350
PS, the grain of rice
represents stress

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.000
in this analogy-- you're
trying to pull that stress out

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.959
of the pot of water.

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:28.250
When it's excited and the
molecules are moving quickly,

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.040
it's very hard to do that.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.090
When you meditate, you
de-excite the body.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.040
So it's like cooling
down that water.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.150
It's de-exciting the
molecules in that water.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.780
So imagine it was almost frozen.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.990
It would be sort of slushy,
and you could easily

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.490
go in and detect that rice
and pull it out of the water.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.990
Same thing with
stress in our body--

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.120
we meditate, we give
our body that deep rest,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.230
de-excite our nervous system,
and it's easier for stress

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.550
to leave the body,
which is one of the ways

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.850
that meditation makes
us more productive.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.310
Contrary to popular
belief, your stress

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.860
is not helping you in the
productivity or performance

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.360
department.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.010
I'll talk more about
that in a moment.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.690
But what I'm
interested in right now

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.012
is really talking
about the rest.

00:07:07.012 --> 00:07:08.970
If you're resting two to
five times deeper than

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.970
sleep when you meditate,
then when you come out

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.710
of that meditation, then you
are, in fact, more awake.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.720
A 20 minute meditation
is basically

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.420
the equivalent of doing an
hour or an hour and a half nap,

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.099
but you don't have
the sleep hangover.

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:23.265
So you go into meditation,
give your body that rest,

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:25.270
and when you come out,
you're more awake.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.510
You are, in fact,
more conscious.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.270
And a few of the attributes
of having more consciousness

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.930
are the ability to
hold many things

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.440
in one awareness,
the ability to detect

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.320
subtlety-- subtle differences
in things-- and the ability

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.580
to detect themes, all
of which are going

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.990
to make you more productive,
but in a sustainable way

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.020
versus the way caffeine does it,
which is just costing your body

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.410
a little bit more.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.500
Now, PS, I should
say that I'm not here

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.660
to, like, give anybody
any rules or be like,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.590
put away that coffee.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.964
You're like, damnit, why did
I bring coffee to this talk?

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.480
My personal philosophy
on drugs are

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.350
that if the pros outweigh
the cons, then enjoy.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.277
Right?

00:08:04.277 --> 00:08:05.860
But I just think we
have to understand

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.990
what the pros and
what the cons are

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.550
and what they're costing us.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.720
Oh, and PS, there
are some monks that

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.910
have been experimenting
with coffee and meditation

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.220
for hundreds if not
thousands of years.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.210
Some people report that I'll
drink coffee before I meditate,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.490
and it proves to be a really
fascinating experience.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.680
Now, this is dependent
almost entirely

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.359
on what kind of meditation
that you practice,

00:08:29.359 --> 00:08:30.775
which leads me to
our second point

00:08:30.775 --> 00:08:32.358
that we're going to
cover today, which

00:08:32.358 --> 00:08:34.169
is the differences
between the two most

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.255
popular styles of meditation.

00:08:36.255 --> 00:08:37.880
I noticed we've got
some new people in.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.879
So just by a show of
hands, how many of you guys

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:42.430
have tried meditation before?

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.929
Great.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:43.650
Amazing.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.990
And how many of you guys have
a daily meditation practice?

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.490
Great.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.259
I love it.

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:50.050
Who here has tried
meditation and hated it?

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.360
I know I did.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:51.860
OK.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.070
Awesome.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.403
I'm still down that you're here.

00:08:53.403 --> 00:08:55.195
Way to give it another shot.

00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:57.570
And then we talked about who's
drinking coffee every day.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.230
Almost everyone.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.471
Right?

00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:58.713
Yeah.

00:08:58.713 --> 00:08:59.213
OK.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.960
There's two styles of meditation
that are the most popular

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.050
and the most common,
right now, in the West.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.280
One of them is mindfulness.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.350
Has anyone here heard of
mindfulness meditation?

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.850
Yeah.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.070
So, and that's a lot of what's
happening here at Google.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.234
You know, Chade-Meng Tan,
or Meng, as he's known,

00:09:16.234 --> 00:09:17.650
you guys probably
know who he is--

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.330
he started an initiative here
called Search Inside Yourself,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.320
which I think is-- oh,
hello, that wasn't me--

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.780
which is actually a great title.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.510
And it's a
mindfulness-based training.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.079
I had the great, good fortune
of meeting with Meng last year,

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:34.870
when he was just starting
the Search Inside

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.790
Yourself training.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.790
There's mindfulness, which is
basically a directed attentions

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.590
type of meditation.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.000
And then there's a non-directed
attentions type of meditation.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.670
And this is what I teach.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.240
It's basically a self-induced
transcendence style.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.560
So we've got mindfulness.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.620
And then we've got a
self-induced transcendence

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.320
style of meditation.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.540
Now, mindfulness is more
of a waking state practice.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.820
It's generally taught over
the course of eight weeks.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.580
You meet once a week
for eight weeks.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.590
And it can be quite gentle.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.812
And the results are a bit more
gradual because it's something

00:10:08.812 --> 00:10:10.770
that you're integrating
into your waking state.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.050
It's basically the practice
of bringing yourself back

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.280
into the now.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.780
So if you're
walking, you're like,

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.240
here I am, walking, I'm walking,
I am walking, I'm sitting,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.690
I am sitting, I am-- here I
am, sit-- I'm washing dishes,

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.190
here I am washing
dishes, I'm really

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.690
feeling the water
flowing over my hands.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.420
And this sounds very simple.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.930
But if you think about how
much we're multitasking

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.510
and how much information
our brains are ingesting

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.770
all of the time,
largely due to you guys,

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.170
this idea of doing
one thing at a time

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.950
actually becomes quite novel.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.980
We actually have to start
to retrain ourselves

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.140
to single-task,
which, I would argue,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.530
gives you more computing
power for the task at hand.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.880
Now mindfulness is derivative
of a monastic practice.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.310
It was originally
developed for monks.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.310
And this was news to
me because I always

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.810
thought that whatever
monks were practicing

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.500
must be much more powerful
than what people like

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.580
us would practice because
they're monks, right?

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.520
So they must be, like,
levitating or floating

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.050
or, like, gaining enlightenment
on their first day.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.850
But it's actually the opposite.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.000
If you're a monk, then your
contribution to society

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.600
is meditating.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.346
You have the time to
meditate, basically, all day.

00:11:18.346 --> 00:11:20.220
If you're walking, it's
a walking meditation.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.420
If you're gardening, it's
a gardening meditation.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.060
And this is their
contribution to society,

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.270
whereas something that we
might practice is different.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.292
Now, in India, you're either a
monk or you're a householder.

00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:34.000
And it doesn't do you
any good to pretend

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.541
to be a monk if
you're a householder.

00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:37.490
And when I say householder,
I basically mean,

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.600
so we have a job and a
family and stuff to do.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.460
So if you are a householder,
you have less time

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.484
in your day with
which to meditate,

00:11:47.484 --> 00:11:48.900
which actually
means that you need

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.380
to practice something that
is a bit more powerful.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.588
You have less time in the
day with which to meditate,

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.410
so you need to really
go in and clean house

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.730
so that you can deliver that
fulfillment to your day.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.920
So you're like, y'all, I've got
stuff to do-- all I can do is,

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.190
like, come in, I've got
to answer some emails,

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.648
and eat my lunch while I listen
to this meditation caffeine

00:12:03.648 --> 00:12:05.930
talk, and hopefully, it'll
make me get more done.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.590
And ultimately, it will.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.010
Point of the story is that all
meditation is good for you.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.270
But there are two main
branches, and they

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.960
come from different
styles of meditation.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.660
Now, obviously I'm
biased, OK, because I

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.830
teach this self-induced
transcendence

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.120
style of meditation, and
it's totally changed my life.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.220
So I'd love to say that this
was a non-biased account

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.470
of the differences between
the two, but spoiler alert,

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.107
it's 100% biased.

00:12:35.107 --> 00:12:37.190
But this self-induced
transcendence style-- you're

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.290
basically accessing a fourth
state of consciousness,

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.380
different than waking, different
than sleeping, and different

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.940
than dreaming, where the right
and left parts of your brain

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.769
start to function in unison.

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:50.310
Now, the good news
is that regardless

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.150
of what style of meditation
you're practicing,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.510
they are both going to
have a lot of benefits.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.240
One is the ability to be more
present in the right now.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.460
Two is that it actually--
both styles of meditation

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.146
are going to
increase the strength

00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:04.770
and, really, the
thickness of something

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.990
called the corpus callosum.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.890
Now, the corpus callosum is
this thin strip of white matter

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.240
that connects the gray matter.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.710
It is the bridge between the
right and left hemispheres

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.380
of your brain.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.290
So we've known for a long time
that meditators have thicker

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.360
corpus callosums
than non-meditators,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.510
but we weren't able to prove
if it was causal or correlated.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.310
Now, because we have
advances in neuroscience,

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.660
we now know that the
longer you meditate,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.110
the thicker this
corpus callosum gets.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.680
Cool party trick, but who cares?

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.720
Why would anyone want
a fat corpus callosum?

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.550
Well, everyone should.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.480
And here's why.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.480
Here's a Cliff's Notes
version of the difference

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.340
between the right
and left brains.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.500
Your left brain is in charge
of the past and the future.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.410
It's in charge of
language, critical thought,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.190
analytical thought, math,
balancing your checkbooks-- all

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.240
really important activities,
but for most of us,

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.531
we've been taking our left
brain to the gym, especially

00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:56.760
you guys.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.810
Just think, take action,
achieve, make money,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.560
so you can be happy
in the future--

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.750
really working out this
past, future muscle.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.750
Meanwhile, our poor little
right brains are atrophy.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.810
Now, your right brain
is the piece of you

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.890
that's in charge
of the right now.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.830
It's the piece of you that
is in charge of intuition,

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.410
inspiration, creativity,
music, connectedness.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.990
And it is the place that you
get your creative problem

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.200
solving ideas.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.570
It is the place where
you get those downloads.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.840
So I think that any conversation
about productivity, especially

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.860
in a field where innovation
is currency, then meditation

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.010
has to be a part of
that conversation

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.760
because while we have been
valuing this left brain

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.570
analytical part of our
mind for far too long,

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.970
it's gotten out of balance.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.735
You know, if you look at
a human brain, it's 50/50.

00:14:41.735 --> 00:14:43.610
And I don't think that
nature makes mistakes.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:44.984
I don't think that
nature gave us

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:48.609
50/50 of a brain if it
wanted us to use 90/10.

00:14:48.609 --> 00:14:50.400
So all we're doing when
we're meditating is

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.024
that we're taking
our brain to the gym.

00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:53.930
You're strengthening
this corpus callosum,

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.800
which is going to
allow you to come up

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.110
with these creative
problem solving ideas,

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.121
even when you're in a
high stress situation.

00:15:00.121 --> 00:15:01.870
So your boss is yelling
at you, and you've

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.780
got a really short
deadline-- instead

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.886
of going into panic mode
and fight or flight,

00:15:05.886 --> 00:15:07.510
you're going to be
able to still access

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:12.311
this whole other realm of
creativity and inspiration.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:13.310
Sounds pretty good, huh?

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.930
Call me crazy, but I
don't think that stress

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.640
makes you more productive.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.015
A lot of people
say that it does.

00:15:29.015 --> 00:15:31.220
I teach a lot of CEOs, and
I teach a lot of actors,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.170
and they have two
different stories.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.420
My CEO clients will say,
Emily, I need my stress,

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.190
I need my angst, that
is the thing that

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.135
gives me my competitive edge.

00:15:39.135 --> 00:15:40.580
No, it is not.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.040
That is just false.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.680
And I'm going to explain
why, in just a moment.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.790
And with my actor clients, they
say, Emily, I need my stress,

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.650
I need my angst because this
is where I get my creativity,

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.770
this is where I
draw from my work.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:53.270
Nope.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.010
No, it is not.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.900
You get your creativity from
this right part of your brain.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.320
We think our ideas are our own.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.760
Our ego gets involved, and
it's like, it's my idea.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.260
Nope.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.676
You're just
downloading that thing

00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:05.640
from this beautiful,
creative cloud in the sky.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.400
Getting a little
altruistic for Google.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.410
I'm going to move on.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.150
Let's move on to our
third point which

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.930
is when can stress
actually serve you?

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.430
When can stress actually
be good for you?

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.780
Stress is getting sort
of a bad rap, these days.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.430
It's being called the Black
Plague of our century.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.830
And I don't think that that
is an over-exaggeration.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.490
I would agree with
that statement.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.280
However, there are times
that stress is good for you,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.613
and I'm going to get into those.

00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:32.750
But first, we've got to
understand how and why stress

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.702
affects our body in
the way that it does.

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.160
And in order to
understand that, we

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.037
have to go back in time
a few thousand years

00:16:38.037 --> 00:16:40.370
and say we're, like, hunting
and gathering in the woods.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.870
I don't know why this is the
move for hunting and gathering,

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.870
but just go with it.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.890
So say we're hunting
and gathering,

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.930
and out of nowhere,
this saber-toothed tiger

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.940
jumps out at you and
with the intent to kill.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.870
So your body is going to launch
into a series of chemical

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.870
reactions.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.810
First, your digestion is going
to flood with acid to shut down

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.140
digestion because it takes a lot
of energy to digest your food

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.550
and you need all hands
on deck to fight or flee

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.280
this predatory attack.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.425
That same acid will
then seep into your skin

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:08.550
so that you don't taste
very good if you get bitten

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.310
into by that tiger.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.319
Your blood will start
to thicken and coagulate

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.880
so that if you get bitten
into, you don't bleed to death.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.069
Your vision will go
from here to here

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.440
so that you're not distracted
from your opponent.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.119
Your bladder and
bowels will evacuate

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.494
so that you're
light on your feet

00:17:22.494 --> 00:17:23.720
so you could fight or flee.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.430
So the nervous poos you
get before an audition

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.410
or like a-- or you guys
don't have auditions,

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.160
but like a presentation,
that's your body trying

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.190
to protect you.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.330
Your heart rate will increase.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:33.830
See?

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.580
People are laughing
because they identify.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.180
Your heart rate will increase.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.320
Your cortisol levels
will increase.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.172
And your immune system
will go to the back burner

00:17:44.172 --> 00:17:46.130
because who cares if
you're going to get cancer

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.740
if you're about to
be killed by a tiger?

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.420
Again, we need all hands
on deck to fight or flee

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.080
this predatory attack.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.330
So this series of chemical
reactions is very good for you.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.275
It is very useful if your
demands are predatory attacks.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.540
Now, I don't know when
the last time any of you

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.390
guys got attacked
by a tiger was.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.632
But my guess is it
wasn't very recently.

00:18:08.632 --> 00:18:10.840
Now, obviously, there are
some high demand situations

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.500
where it's good for your
body to get stressed.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.240
If you get into a car
accident, or if you

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.610
get jumped in the back
alleyway, or if you

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.490
need to lift a
car off of a baby,

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.320
these are all great times for
your body to get stressed.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.410
And this series of
chemical reactions

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:24.700
is really going to serve you.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.780
It's actually not bad
for your body to get

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:32.570
stressed-- it is toxic for
your body to stay stressed.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.490
This fight or flight
thing-- yes, great.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.990
It's good for it to happen.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.480
But then, if it's a
few thousand years ago,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.870
and you're actually
engaging in fighting a tiger

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.920
or outrunning a
tiger, then you get

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.731
to burn off those
stress chemicals.

00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:46.480
And this is why a lot
of people say to me,

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.430
well, Emily, exercise
is my meditation.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.150
No, it's not.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.750
Exercise is exercise.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.042
Meditation is meditation.

00:18:54.042 --> 00:18:56.250
They do very different things
to your nervous system.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.110
When you exercise, you
excite your nervous system.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.170
You increase your
metabolic rate.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.070
When you meditate, you
de-excite your nervous system,

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.350
and you decrease
your metabolic rate.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.920
Now, exercise is great for you.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.580
When you get in the treadmill
and you start running,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.371
you can outrun that
tiger, you can burn off

00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:13.405
the stress chemicals from today.

00:19:13.405 --> 00:19:15.530
You get in a boxing ring,
you can fight that tiger,

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.984
and you can burn off the
stress chemicals from today.

00:19:17.984 --> 00:19:20.400
But if you want to handle the
dog that barked in your face

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.420
when you were seven or the fight
that your parents got in when

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.180
you were 10, then
you actually have

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.629
to de-excite your
nervous system.

00:19:25.629 --> 00:19:27.045
So basically, what
I'm saying here

00:19:27.045 --> 00:19:29.610
is that exercise can handle the
stress happening that you're

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.810
picking up on each
new day, provided

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.370
that you're
exercising every day.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.340
If you want to handle
the backlog of stresses

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.506
that you've been accumulating
so that you can really

00:19:37.506 --> 00:19:39.510
start to perform at
100%, in this case,

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.150
we need to de-excite
the nervous system

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.850
and create order so we
can get that right side

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:44.680
of the boiling pot.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.940
So everyone clear on that, about
when stress is good for you?

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.844
When you're actually in a
life threatening situation.

00:19:55.844 --> 00:19:57.260
And it's good for
it to have them,

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.260
but if it stays in your body
over a long period of time,

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.340
it can do any number of
terrible things to you.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.850
It's basically the equivalent
of pouring acid in your body.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.780
Every time you get
stressed, every stressy

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.620
thought that you
have, it creates

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.670
adrenaline and cortisol, which
are acidic stress chemicals.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.940
So it's like putting a penny
into a thing of Coca Cola

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.280
or a thing of hydrochloric acid.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.099
It's going to break
down prematurely.

00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:19.140
Same thing with our body.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.620
If you're stressed, your body
is going to age much faster than

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.080
if you are alkaline,
which is what?

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.290
When you meditate,
your brain produces

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.090
dopamine and serotonin, which
are bliss chemicals, which

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.540
are more alkaline in nature,
which can actually slow down

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.070
the aging process.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.310
Any questions, so far?

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.470
I've talked really fast.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.600
And I've already covered
the first three points.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.130
Any questions or
comments or disagreements

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.450
about any of that, so far?

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.902
Yeah.

00:20:45.902 --> 00:20:48.806
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you
talked about how meditation

00:20:48.806 --> 00:20:50.258
strengthens the [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:50.258 --> 00:20:50.742
EMILY FLETCHER: Mhm.

00:20:50.742 --> 00:20:52.283
AUDIENCE: Does
meditation do anything

00:20:52.283 --> 00:20:56.080
to beef up the actual
[INAUDIBLE] right brain?

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.050
EMILY FLETCHER: Yes.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.070
Yes, it does.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:01.775
So I went to this neuroscience
conference, last year.

00:21:01.775 --> 00:21:03.150
And I was so
excited because I've

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.024
been studying these,
like, beautiful, flowery

00:21:05.024 --> 00:21:06.608
Vedic analogies for
about eight years.

00:21:06.608 --> 00:21:08.940
But I finally got to go to
this neuroscience conference,

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.070
and I got to see, on the
gross manifest level, what

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.310
meditation is
doing to the brain.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:18.150
So if you look at a scan of
a waking state non-meditator,

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.660
imagine that there's four
quadrants in the brain.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.160
In your waking state, these
two quadrants light up.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.180
And then, when you
meditate, these go dark.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.969
And these two light up.

00:21:26.969 --> 00:21:28.510
So basically, when
you're meditating,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.260
you have a different brain than
you do in your waking state.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.650
Well, cool party trick.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.700
But how is that going
to help me do more?

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.530
Well what happens is that
over time of waking state,

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.630
meditation, waking
state, meditation,

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.610
waking state, meditation,
what starts to happen

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.520
is that all four quadrants
start to light up

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.670
at the same time, regardless
of whether you're in meditation

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.420
or in your waking state.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.380
So you know, it's basically
like these neurons

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.390
are firing in the different
parts of the brain.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.680
And after enough times
of going back and forth

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.970
between the states
of consciousness,

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.470
the brain starts firing
on all cylinders.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.776
My meditation teacher
says that, you know,

00:22:03.776 --> 00:22:06.340
we're saying that we use
somewhere between 3% and 10%

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.264
of our brain capacity.

00:22:07.264 --> 00:22:09.680
My teacher says that the very
fact that we're arguing over

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.430
whether it's 3% or 10% suggests
that it's more like 3%.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.710
I'm fascinated to see
this new movie, "Lucy."

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.960
It's probably going to be
pretty-- well, I don't know.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.668
Maybe it's great.

00:22:18.668 --> 00:22:20.829
I don't know, but I'm
fascinated to see it.

00:22:20.829 --> 00:22:22.120
Does that answer your question?

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.376
EMILY FLETCHER: Great.

00:22:23.376 --> 00:22:24.970
What other questions
do you have?

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.580
Yes?

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.770
AUDIENCE: So sometimes when I'll
introduce people to meditation,

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.680
one of their big objections is
sort of like with your clients,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.040
when they say, I
don't want to let

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.993
go of my anxiety or my stress
because that's the edge that

00:22:40.993 --> 00:22:42.447
keeps me motivated
and productive.

00:22:42.447 --> 00:22:43.280
EMILY FLETCHER: Mhm.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.635
AUDIENCE: So like
how we usually want

00:22:44.635 --> 00:22:46.885
to address that, when people
are worried about letting

00:22:46.885 --> 00:22:49.040
go of the thing that's
pushing them forward?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.410
EMILY FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.490
It's a great question.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.710
And I think it's a
really valid concern

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.780
because if you spent your
whole life only being motivated

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.980
by adrenaline and only
being driven by anxiety

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.820
or competition, then
it's terrifying to lose

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.520
that because you don't know
what's going to motivate you.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.810
Now, the beautiful
thing that I have found

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.935
is that as you start
meditating, you start actually

00:23:07.935 --> 00:23:09.590
wanting to move
towards the positive.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.780
You start being inspired by
and motivated by creativity

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.852
and creation for the
sake of innovation.

00:23:15.852 --> 00:23:17.560
But that's hard to
communicate to someone

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.680
who hasn't had that
visceral experience yet.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.152
So here's my analogy, and
please forgive me, y'all.

00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:24.360
I'm a really good tap dancer.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.670
I am not a technician.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.320
But here goes.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.950
Let's imagine that the
brain is a computer.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:30.700
OK?

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.885
And let's say that
you have 10 million--

00:23:32.885 --> 00:23:34.760
I don't even know if
this is possible-- let's

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.980
say you have 10 million open
windows on this computer, which

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.260
is, PS, by the time
you're 20 years old,

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.890
you have something
like 10 million

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.950
precognitive commitments
in your brain,

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.200
which basically means that
any time that you've gotten

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.830
stressed, it's left a little
open window in your brain.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.614
So let's say that Hulu and
GChat and YouTube and Facebook

00:23:53.614 --> 00:23:56.030
and Vimeo, and Vine-- you've
got all of these things open,

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.070
and you're like, whew, maybe
I should get back to work,

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.417
maybe I should write an email.

00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:01.250
And you go to write an
email, and the cursor

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.615
is like 20 spaces behind.

00:24:02.615 --> 00:24:04.480
You're like, bleaugh,
stupid computer,

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.790
can't even type an email.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.760
Well, the computer is more than
capable of typing an email,

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.360
but you're spending so much of
that computing power running

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.080
those 10 million open
windows from the past

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.390
that you're robbing yourself
of your full potential

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.160
for the right now.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.430
And every problem gets
solved in the right now.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.580
Also, all of your
bliss and fulfillment

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.250
is experienced in the right now.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.740
Eckhart Tolle wrote a whole book
about it, "The Power of Now."

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.750
So I liken it, really, to
an overworked computer-- too

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.520
many windows open
on the computer,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.310
and you're robbing yourself
of your full performance

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.930
capabilities.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.580
It's basically like
your body's so busy

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.640
preparing for this
imaginary tiger attack

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.420
that you don't have
all of your resources

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.440
available for whatever
your task at hand is.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.736
Does that make sense?

00:24:48.736 --> 00:24:49.235
Great.

00:24:49.235 --> 00:24:49.981
Yes?

00:24:49.981 --> 00:24:52.887
AUDIENCE: I don't know
what [INAUDIBLE]--

00:24:52.887 --> 00:24:53.970
EMILY FLETCHER: Let's see.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.278
Maybe it'll be a segue.

00:24:55.278 --> 00:24:57.768
AUDIENCE: But I'm curious
about the specific topics

00:24:57.768 --> 00:25:02.250
that you have. [INAUDIBLE]
examples [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.740
these would be the mindfulness
because I think [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.420
EMILY FLETCHER: Yes, I am.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.503
Thank you for asking that.

00:25:10.503 --> 00:25:12.170
And I didn't mention
that, but yes.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.920
I have one more topic
to cover, and then I

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.660
want to actually walk you
through a mindfulness guided

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.701
visualization, which will
be-- it'll be a directed focus

00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:20.200
attention.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.640
We'll all be guiding
you through the things

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.240
that you can bring
your attention on.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.031
And then we'll practice--
don't be scared--

00:25:25.031 --> 00:25:27.190
and we'll practice a five
minute silent meditation.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:28.920
Then I'm going to give
you some tools to try out.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.378
And I like to call it the M
word technique because it's not

00:25:31.378 --> 00:25:33.590
quite meditation.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.196
This self-induced transcendence
style of meditation--

00:25:36.196 --> 00:25:37.570
again, I'm biased,
but I liken it

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:38.930
to the Porsche of meditations.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.210
It is fast, it is powerful, and
I think it makes you sexier.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:46.240
Call me crazy, but I don't think
that stress makes you sexy.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.208
And so, if you
really want to learn,

00:25:49.208 --> 00:25:51.582
it's recommended that you,
like, kind of do the whole kit

00:25:51.582 --> 00:25:53.150
and caboodle-- that you
get the key to the car

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.570
and get the driving
instructions, at the same time.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.860
I do have a course
happening this week,

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.276
which we'll talk
about, but I want

00:25:58.276 --> 00:25:59.720
to give you guys a taste of it.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.580
And during it, don't try
to be an expert meditator.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.770
Don't try to get it right.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.840
Just notice what the
experience is like for you

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.340
and whether you want to fight
or flee during the meditation,

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.340
itself.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.970
I'm also going to teach you
guys a breathing technique.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.750
And it's super simple,
but it actually

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.760
helps to integrate the right
and left parts of the brain.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.040
It's an alternate
nostril breathing,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.706
so we'll all look
really silly together.

00:26:19.706 --> 00:26:22.749
But it helps to oxygenate the
blood and oxygenate the organs.

00:26:22.749 --> 00:26:24.790
And it'll help to balance
the right and left part

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:25.080
of the brain.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.025
And even, you know, you could,
like, put a little folder up

00:26:27.025 --> 00:26:28.941
at your cubicle, or in
your office, and do it.

00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:31.240
And that would be
like a little shot,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.230
a little meditation shot
for your mid-afternoon.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.915
Good.

00:26:35.915 --> 00:26:38.040
So this will be our final
point, before we actually

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.740
try some meditation.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.590
And it is how to not
let your goals get

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.490
in the way of your
success because again, I

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.710
imagine that you guys are
all very ambitious, very

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.390
results-oriented, very
career and goal-oriented,

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.140
which is great.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.290
However, the trick here is
that we can have a tendency

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:01.070
to delay our happiness or
delay our self care until we've

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.206
accomplished that
one final thing,

00:27:03.206 --> 00:27:05.580
just until we get that one
more zero in our bank account,

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.090
and we just finish
this one project,

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.080
or I just hire this
one more employee,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.620
then I'll start
going to the gym.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.890
I'm going to start meditating
as soon as I finish

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.210
this giant project that
my boss needs from me,

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.820
I am going to take a
vacation as soon as I make

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.960
this amount of money, and that
the main themes that we delay

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.230
our happiness for
are money, education,

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.990
and romantic relationships.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.120
We think, well, as soon
as I have enough zeros,

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.200
then I'll be happy-- as soon
as I have the perfect job,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.741
then I will be happy-- as soon
as I have the perfect partner,

00:27:35.741 --> 00:27:36.810
then I will be happy.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.390
But as Carrie
Bradshaw so eloquently

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.840
said in "Sex and
the City," you're

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.130
only going to have two out of
the three in New York City.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.095
You're either going to
have the perfect boyfriend,

00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:44.610
or the perfect job,
and no apartment,

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.890
or the perfect apartment,
perfect job, but no boyfriend,

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.140
but you're never going to
have three out of the three.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.760
So if you're waiting to
have all three to be happy,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.400
it's going to be a
really long wait.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.440
My analogy, here,
is like, imagine

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.960
that you're sitting at
the bottom of a mountain,

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.820
and you're looking
at this mountain

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.620
that you want to climb.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.880
You're like, OK, I'm going
to do it because once

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.210
I get the top of
this mountain, then

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.430
I will have achieved success.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.751
Then I can be proud of myself.

00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:07.750
Then I will have validated
myself to my parents,

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.874
and they can justify that
expensive college tuition

00:28:09.874 --> 00:28:11.110
that they paid for.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.940
So we start climbing
the mountain.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.740
And then we get to
the top of a mountain,

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.000
and we're still not happy.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.570
We still don't have the ability
to access this present moment

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:19.310
awareness.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.957
And now we've proven to ourself
that we can climb the mountain.

00:28:21.957 --> 00:28:23.665
And now we see all of
the other mountains

00:28:23.665 --> 00:28:24.834
that we have yet to climb.

00:28:24.834 --> 00:28:26.500
So then we think, oh,
well, my happiness

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.410
must be at the top of
this next mountain.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.535
So we start climbing again.

00:28:29.535 --> 00:28:31.826
Get to the top of this
mountain, you're like, oh, crap,

00:28:31.826 --> 00:28:32.800
I'm still not happy.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.760
More and more mountains
that we can climb.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.410
And so this can sort
of go on indefinitely.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.010
So I would suggest that instead
of waiting until you finish

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.030
your To Do list to
be happy, instead

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.310
of waiting until you've
accomplished all of your goals

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.650
to give yourself permission
to take care of yourself,

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.500
what if you start taking
care of yourself now?

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.380
What if you give yourself access
to your bliss and fulfillment

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.180
inside of you, start
your day with that,

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.240
and then use your To Do
list, use your desires

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.780
as an indicator of how
and where to deliver

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.750
your gifts to the world?

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.020
Sounds a little hippy dippy.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.330
Sounds a little esoteric.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.449
But just try it out,
and see what happens.

00:29:08.449 --> 00:29:09.990
My personal experience,
and what I've

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.705
seen from my over 700 clients
that I've taught to meditate,

00:29:12.705 --> 00:29:15.080
is that when you start to
approach life and this attitude

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.400
of what can I give,
then life starts

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.700
giving you a lot more back.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.050
Instead of going into life
with like a what can I get

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.060
and being needly attached
to, well, this person

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.250
has to show up, or else--
or I have to get this job,

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.125
or else-- or you have
to ask me to marry you,

00:29:28.125 --> 00:29:29.990
or else-- or I have
to get this job,

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.660
or I'm not good enough,
this-- it's very hard for life

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.840
to show up when you've got a
death grip on your desires.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:41.140
And if you insert a meditation
practice or some really solid

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.020
self care and stress
relieving techniques

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.500
into your day,
every day, then you

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.120
are quite innocently and
quite spontaneously going

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.580
to start approaching your life
from a place of fulfillment--

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.130
what can I give to this
versus what can I get.

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.810
And what happens is this
beautiful, reciprocal

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:57.690
upward spiral.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.260
Should we try some meditation?

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:02.760
Yeah.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.300
Any questions before
we try some meditation?

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:06.800
Great.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.380
Yes?

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.206
AUDIENCE: Before, you contrasted
[INAUDIBLE] meditations.

00:30:10.206 --> 00:30:11.299
So where does yoga fit in?

00:30:11.299 --> 00:30:12.090
EMILY FLETCHER: Ah.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.130
Thanks for asking.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:18.040
So I think I teach Vedic
meditation, V-E-D-I-C.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.130
It comes from the Sanskrit word,
Veda, which means knowledge.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.220
Knowledge of what?

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.570
Knowledge of nature.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.440
So it's basically
like using natural law

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.450
to help us get to
where we want to go.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.970
You know, you
de-excite your body,

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:35.580
you start to access the place
from which we get our desires.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.420
Yoga-- so Vedic meditation
comes from the Vedas.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.210
The Vedas is an ancient
body of knowledge,

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.247
like 5 or 6,000 years old.

00:30:42.247 --> 00:30:44.080
And the Vedas are the
same body of knowledge

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.160
that give us yoga,
acupuncture, feng shui,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.000
and Ayurvedic medicine,
Ayurvedic cooking.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.410
They all come from the same
ancient body of knowledge.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:55.215
So yoga is basically,
you know, those series of

00:30:55.215 --> 00:30:57.340
poses that you move through.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.800
It's called an asana practice.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.790
And asana is a Sanskrit
word that means seat.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.614
So if you take a yoga class,
I mean, there's chair pose,

00:31:04.614 --> 00:31:06.280
but then there's all
those other asanas.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.740
And they're all called seat.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.660
So why is that?

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.450
Ardha candraasana, Trikonasana.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:15.290
So all of them, each asana,
somewhere in the word,

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.730
has the word seat.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:17.290
Why is that?

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.420
Because each of those
poses is preparing the body

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.190
to become a seat
for consciousness

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.630
to come and sit in.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:26.220
And actually, yoga was
designed for teenage boys who

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.645
couldn't sit still and meditate.

00:31:27.645 --> 00:31:29.770
So they would move them
through this asana practice

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:30.780
so that they could meditate.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.930
So yoga was actually
designed to prepare the body

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.180
for meditation, which I think
is so beautiful because yoga,

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.200
obviously, has gotten
so popular in the West,

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.850
and I think it's really paved
the way for this new meditation

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.810
awakening that is happening.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.260
But I think that the combination
of yoga and meditation,

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.360
specifically this style,
is really beautiful.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.250
Thanks for asking.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:52.270
Yes?

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] coffee.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.429
Now, how about food?

00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:55.220
EMILY FLETCHER: OK.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.084
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] relation
between the [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:59.084 --> 00:31:59.607
meditation?

00:31:59.607 --> 00:32:00.440
EMILY FLETCHER: Yes.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.149
There is.

00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:02.440
Basically, we're just a giant--

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:03.960
EMILY FLETCHER: What's that?

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.300
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could repeat the question.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:05.550
EMILY FLETCHER: Yes.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.860
So the question was, we
talked about the relationship

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.026
between caffeine and
meditation, but he

00:32:10.026 --> 00:32:11.400
was asking about
the relationship

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.359
between food and meditation.

00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:15.025
Does the type of food
and when you food,

00:32:15.025 --> 00:32:17.300
will that impact your
meditation and impact

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.980
the quality of the meditation?

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.630
And the answer is absolutely.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.160
It's very similar-- the
impact of food and caffeine--

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.130
because when you eat food, your
metabolic rate has to increase,

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:28.910
and then the food gets
turned into energy.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.220
So if you eat a big meal and
then sit down to meditate,

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.280
you're not going to digest
your food very effectively,

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.800
and you're not going to have
a very fascinating meditation.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.810
So it's really ideal
to meditate first thing

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.060
in the morning, before
breakfast, and then again,

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.770
somewhere mid-afternoon,
before your evening meal.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.809
Now, and the type of
food matters quite a lot.

00:32:45.809 --> 00:32:47.600
You know, again, we're
just chemistry sets,

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.860
so any chemical that you
put into your chemistry set

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.660
is going to affect
your chemistry.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.770
And there's a whole
beautiful science

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.320
around this, called Ayurveda.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.660
And Ayurveda is basically
using your food and meditation

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.430
and exercises as a way
of balancing your body

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.190
or balancing your-- I call it
a Dosha, which is a body type.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:07.940
And if you're interested,
I can definitely

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.100
give you some more
information on that.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.700
Mhm.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.200
Great.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:11.700
Yes?

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.565
AUDIENCE: So I really
like your distinction

00:33:13.565 --> 00:33:16.800
between happiness and goal
achieving and all of that,

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.417
because we [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:20.417 --> 00:33:21.250
EMILY FLETCHER: Mhm.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.974
AUDIENCE: So and you
also say that goals--

00:33:23.974 --> 00:33:25.640
you can become a goal
achiever, but does

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.880
that-- it's just a
never-ending hill.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.224
We just keep on climbing it.

00:33:29.224 --> 00:33:31.918
So it almost seems
like happiness

00:33:31.918 --> 00:33:34.810
is completely separate
from achieving goals.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.750
You don't even need
the goals to be happy.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.092
That's the feeling I get.

00:33:38.092 --> 00:33:39.828
And then you tie
it to, like, you

00:33:39.828 --> 00:33:42.556
think it's the more important
need than achieving goals?

00:33:42.556 --> 00:33:44.540
But do we even get to be happy?

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.508
Like, what if I'm
completely selfish?

00:33:48.508 --> 00:33:49.960
All I care about is myself.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.415
But can I not be happy?

00:33:51.415 --> 00:33:52.870
Or am I being
completely selfish?

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.760
EMILY FLETCHER: I think
that's such a great question.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.260
And I think, at the end of the
day, all of us are selfish.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.010
And most people
come to meditation

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.589
for very selfish reasons.

00:34:00.589 --> 00:34:02.880
We come to meditation because
we want to get more done.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.920
We want to look better.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.420
You know?

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.610
We want to not
get sick as often.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.159
We want to be more creative.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:11.719
So great-- I don't really
care what selfish reason

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:13.600
people come to meditation for.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.320
But what starts to
happen over time

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.850
is that you're
filling yourself up

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.550
from this inexhaustible source.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.414
The cellphone charger analogy
that Jerry Seinfeld uses

00:34:22.414 --> 00:34:24.664
is very apt because if
you're plugging-- you know,

00:34:24.664 --> 00:34:26.330
we just think that
this electricity just

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.770
comes from-- like, there's
just endless and limitless

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.694
because for us, in our
lifetime, it has been.

00:34:30.694 --> 00:34:32.860
So, but basically, this is
what meditation is doing.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:36.060
It's allowing you to plug in
to this inexhaustible source.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.751
And if you fill
your reservoir up

00:34:37.751 --> 00:34:39.375
with bliss and
fulfilment and happiness

00:34:39.375 --> 00:34:42.239
and adaptation energy
every day, twice a day,

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.070
then it's going to
start to overflow.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.969
Like your vessel's actually
going to start to get bigger.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:47.480
But you're going
to actually need

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.800
places to give that fulfillment.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.570
And so it's going
to be quite innocent

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.510
and quite spontaneous
is that you're

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.550
going to look for
places to help people.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.040
But it won't feel
like martyrdom.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:57.540
It won't.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.480
It'll actually feel
selfish because it's

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.622
going to make you feel better.

00:35:01.622 --> 00:35:04.027
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:04.027 --> 00:35:05.311
EMILY FLETCHER: Yeah.

00:35:05.311 --> 00:35:07.394
AUDIENCE: I think, when
you enter into meditation,

00:35:07.394 --> 00:35:10.280
how do you kind
of track progress?

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.185
I know it sounds--

00:35:11.185 --> 00:35:11.976
EMILY FLETCHER: Oh.

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:14.267
AUDIENCE: How do you know
whether you're doing it right

00:35:14.267 --> 00:35:16.777
or when you're
ready [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:16.777 --> 00:35:18.360
EMILY FLETCHER: It's
a great question.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.360
The question was, how do
you track your progress

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.090
as a meditator?

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.290
How do you know if you're
ready for the next step?

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:26.500
And different styles of
meditation are different.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.810
And also, different
people are different.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.430
So you know, if you haven't
had a very high demand,

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:34.500
high stress life, and you're
learning at 70 years old,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.280
your unstressing
process is probably

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.730
going to be quite intense.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.480
I teach kids to
meditate sometimes.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.750
And actually, the youngest
I've ever taught is four.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.064
And he was nailing it.

00:35:43.064 --> 00:35:44.480
He just did this
meditation thing,

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.090
and afterwards, he was like, I
really enjoyed my meditation.

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.700
Did you enjoy yours?

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.040
And he was so into it
because kids already

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.640
have access to this creativity.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.989
Their right brains are--
they're still alive.

00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:58.155
So different people will
have different experiences.

00:35:58.155 --> 00:35:59.412
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:59.412 --> 00:36:01.120
EMILY FLETCHER: We
just die a slow death.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.560
The older we get, the
more stressed we get.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.420
But, so everyone is different.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.910
However, you know, there's
these awesome companies, now,

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.972
that have these body data
monitoring bracelets.

00:36:10.972 --> 00:36:12.596
So I actually recommend
that, you know,

00:36:12.596 --> 00:36:15.012
if people have enough time
between coming to my intro talk

00:36:15.012 --> 00:36:16.880
and taking my four-day
course, I recommend

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.790
that they get one of those
fit bits or the Up Jawbone

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.570
bracelets.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.530
And basically, these things can
track how deep your sleep is

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.044
and how much activity
you have during the day,

00:36:27.044 --> 00:36:29.210
and checking your heart
rate, your body temperature,

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:31.376
and how much movement you
have throughout the night.

00:36:31.376 --> 00:36:33.530
So it can actually tell
you how deep your sleep is.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:37.550
And I have a kind of cool
story from a client in LA.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.870
He had one of those bracelets.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.240
And his sleeping pattern,
before he took my course,

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.090
it used to go light, medium,
deep, wake up for 18 minutes,

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:49.030
light, medium, deep, wake up
for 18 minutes, medium, wake up.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.100
And that took him about
eight or nine hours.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.280
And then the bracelet broke.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.680
And he took the
meditation class.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.107
And then he got it back.

00:36:55.107 --> 00:36:56.940
And then, after about
10 days of meditating,

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.360
he tracked his sleep again.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.910
And his sleep pattern
went light, medium, deep,

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:04.210
for six hours, medium,
light, wake up.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:07.200
So he actually shaved three
hours off of his sleeping time.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.550
But he would wake up
rested because his sleep

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.070
became more efficient.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.570
So this is one of
the main arguments

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:14.950
I make to people who say, I
don't have time to meditate.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.200
The practice that I teach
is 20 minutes, twice a day,

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.010
so it's a 40 minute investment.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.810
Well, if you're shaving
even one hour off

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.940
of your sleep at night, because
your sleep is more efficient,

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.630
then you're already
in the black.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:25.450
Right?

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.531
The return investment is already
higher than what you're making.

00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:31.030
And that's not even to speak
of the increase in productivity

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.045
or the happiness or any
of that kind of things.

00:37:34.045 --> 00:37:36.780
And so it's different
for everyone,

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.020
but there actually
are physical things

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.720
that you can plug
into your phone

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.690
and track your own progress.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.670
But ultimately, it's do I have
a little bit more patience?

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.230
Do I have a little bit more joy?

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.174
Are my listening skills
a little bit better?

00:37:50.174 --> 00:37:51.840
Am I enjoying my life
a little bit more?

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.409
Do I feel like I have a
little bit more to give?

00:37:54.409 --> 00:37:55.950
We want to judge
the meditation based

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.290
on how we're performing
in our waking state,

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:00.610
not how many or few
thoughts we have

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.320
when we meditate, which
leads me to the number one

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.090
misconception of
meditation, which

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:07.150
I think is important
to talk about because

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.960
without solid
meditation training,

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.210
and because there's so many
misconceptions about it,

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:13.600
most of us go into a
meditation practice, thinking,

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.260
well, I have to give my
mind a command to stop.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.520
So then it looks like this.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.190
OK, brain, stop thinking.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.940
I'm hungry.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.200
Well, that was a thought.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.350
Now I'm thinking about
how I'm thinking.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:23.790
Oh, crap.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:24.670
Now I'm thinking
about how I'm thinking

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.270
about how I'm thinking.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.070
And I quit.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.520
And I can never meditate
because my brain is too crazy.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.750
And I hear this all the time.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.730
You're like, Emily, I get it,
meditation is so good for you,

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.521
everybody talks about
it, but I can't do it

00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:37.609
because my mind is crazy.

00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:40.150
We all think that we're the most
stressed person in the land.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.240
We all think that we're the
busiest person in the land.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.760
But the truth is that giving
your mind a command to stop

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.130
is impossible.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.080
No one can give their
mind a command to stop.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.900
The mind thinks
involuntarily, just

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.300
like the heart
beats involuntarily.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.810
So if you judge
yourself at how good you

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.200
are at giving your
body a command

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.501
to stop an involuntary
action, then you're

00:39:03.501 --> 00:39:05.000
always going to
feel like a failure,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.907
and you're going to quit
in like one weekend.

00:39:06.907 --> 00:39:08.490
And this is a big
part of what I teach

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.130
in my course is that
I give you permission

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:11.670
and let you know that
thoughts are not the enemy.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.295
Thoughts during
meditation are actually

00:39:13.295 --> 00:39:16.970
an indicator that stress
is leaving the body.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.580
So yes.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.500
Did that answer your question?

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.400
Great.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.050
All right.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.720
Let's go ahead and
dive in because I

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.480
don't want to keep
you guys late.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.146
I want to give you
at least five minutes

00:39:28.146 --> 00:39:30.280
to go to your next
1 o'clock meeting.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.424
So let's try a
little meditation.

00:39:32.424 --> 00:39:34.590
So we'll start with this
alternate nostril breathing

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.260
technique.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.176
And then I'll give you
a guided visualization,

00:39:37.176 --> 00:39:40.990
and we'll try just a few
minutes of a silent practice.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.996
So if you have
phones or computers,

00:39:42.996 --> 00:39:44.620
you want to put those
things on silent.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.120
That would be swell.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.630
And we'll all take
our right hand.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.630
And don't worry-- we'll
all look silly together.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.070
And just close
your right nostril.

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.070
And exhale through
your left nostril.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:57.704
And then inhale
through your left.

00:39:57.704 --> 00:39:58.370
And then switch.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:00.140
Close your left nostril
with your ring finger.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.390
And exhale through your right.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.139
Good.

00:40:05.139 --> 00:40:06.180
Inhale through the right.

00:40:09.269 --> 00:40:11.060
And then switch, closing
the right nostril,

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.185
exhaling through your left.

00:40:15.664 --> 00:40:16.830
And inhale through the left.

00:40:19.925 --> 00:40:21.800
And then switching,
closing the left nostril,

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.925
exhaling through the right.

00:40:22.925 --> 00:40:25.510
So this will be our pattern--
out, in on one side, and out,

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.270
in on the other.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:27.936
And you can go ahead
and close your eyes

00:40:27.936 --> 00:40:30.502
and start to do this
in your own time.

00:40:30.502 --> 00:40:32.460
What I'm interested in
is that when you inhale,

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.950
you fill your lungs all the
way to their full capacity,

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.350
and that when you
exhale, you completely

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.600
empty your lungs to the
very bottom of your exhale.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.770
And you'll start to notice is
that at the top of your inhale,

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.522
there's a little, tiny space
before you begin the exhale.

00:40:51.522 --> 00:40:53.730
And you don't have to force
that or push it, but just

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.200
allow yourself to float
there for even instance.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.200
And then the same thing.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.658
At the bottom of
the exhale, you'll

00:40:59.658 --> 00:41:02.140
notice that there's
a tiny little space.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.640
Allow yourself to notice that,
and float there at the bottom

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.980
before you begin the inhale.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.850
Let's try this for
a few more cycles.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.570
But now I want you to
imagine that on the inhale,

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:18.720
that you're bringing this
breath and this energy up

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.260
through the base of your
spine, letting it travel up

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.540
through your spine, and
then exhaling, and sending

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.623
that breath and that energy
out through the middle

00:41:26.623 --> 00:41:28.520
of your forehead.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:41.090
This is creating a beautiful
cycle of breath and energy,

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.430
really enjoying
the full expansion

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.075
of your lungs and
the full exhale.

00:41:47.534 --> 00:41:49.700
As you're inhaling, imagining
that breath and energy

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.283
coming up through the base and
traveling up through your spine

00:41:52.283 --> 00:41:55.000
and then sending that energy
and that creative energy out

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.500
through the middle
of your forehead.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.510
And the next time you come to
an exhale on the left side,

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.740
you can keep your eyes
closed, but gently

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.920
drop your hands into your lap.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.200
And I'll walk you through
a guided visualization,

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.600
or a mindfulness exercise.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.380
So as you inhale, it
could be a gentle inhale,

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.100
but I want you to notice
the most predominant sound

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.680
you can detect right now.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.705
So I just want you to
hear what you're hearing.

00:42:36.705 --> 00:42:37.580
It might be my voice.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.730
It might be the air conditioner.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:39.940
It might be your
neighbors breath.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.731
But just notice the
most predominant sound.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.960
And on your next breath, see
if you can shift your awareness

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.180
to the most subtle sound.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.980
It could be the sound
of your own breath,

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.271
or maybe your hair rustling
against your neck, or maybe

00:42:58.271 --> 00:42:59.530
a sound far away in the city.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.220
Now, keeping the eyes
closed, on your next breath,

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.759
I want you to shift your
attention to your sight.

00:43:13.759 --> 00:43:15.300
So even with your
eyes closed, I want

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.864
you to see what you're seeing.

00:43:16.864 --> 00:43:19.530
Perhaps you can notice the cells
floating in front of your eyes,

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.460
or perhaps you can see where
the light is streaming in

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.530
through your eyelids.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.340
But just allow yourself
to see what you're seeing.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.560
This technique is called
come to your senses.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.060
We're going to work through
all five of our senses,

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.280
noticing the most predominant
and the most subtle.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.630
And on your next inhale,
allow your awareness

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:46.111
to gently rest on the most
predominant tactile sensation.

00:43:46.111 --> 00:43:47.610
For most of us,
since we're sitting,

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:50.590
it'll probably be
your bum in the chair.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.910
Or perhaps you have
a pain in your knee,

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.944
or you have a tickle
in your throat.

00:43:54.944 --> 00:43:57.443
Just notice whatever that most
predominant tactile sensation

00:43:57.443 --> 00:43:57.943
is.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:10.707
And on your next inhale, see if
you can notice the most subtle.

00:44:10.707 --> 00:44:12.540
This might be as subtle
as the breath coming

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.770
in and out of your nostrils.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:18.460
It might be as subtle as the
hair on the back of your neck.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.997
Really tuning your
attention to the more subtle

00:44:20.997 --> 00:44:21.830
physical sensations.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.500
And now, on your
next breath, I want

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.200
you to taste what
you're tasting.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.600
Even though you're not
eating anything currently,

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.300
perhaps you can
taste your mouth wash

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.950
from this morning or the coffee
that you drink beforehand

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:45.590
or the lunch that you had.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.495
Maybe your mouth
tastes acidic or dry,

00:44:47.495 --> 00:44:50.165
but just noticing that most
predominant taste sensation.

00:44:55.977 --> 00:44:57.435
And on your next
inhale, see if you

00:44:57.435 --> 00:44:59.268
can shift your awareness
to the most subtle.

00:45:03.311 --> 00:45:05.310
And if you're not tasting
anything, that's fine.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:06.860
Just notice that.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.851
There's no right or wrong here.

00:45:09.851 --> 00:45:11.350
Now, on your next
inhale, I want you

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.692
to smell what you're smelling.

00:45:12.692 --> 00:45:15.150
I want you to smell the most
predominant smell in the room.

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:18.050
It might be your own hairspray
or your neighbor's lunch

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.511
or who knows.

00:45:19.511 --> 00:45:22.010
But just allow yourself to smell
the most predominant smell.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:28.892
And now, shift it
to the most subtle.

00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:31.100
So maybe it's the fact that
you don't smell anything,

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.308
or how does this room smell
different than your home?

00:45:38.331 --> 00:45:38.830
Really good.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:40.040
And on your next
breath, I want you

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.740
to see if you can
allow your awareness

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.780
to rest on all five
senses at the same time.

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.430
So enjoying your sense of
hearing, your sense of touch,

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:50.460
your sense of sight,
your sense of taste,

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.960
and your sense of smell,
all simultaneously.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.760
Awakening all five
senses in the body,

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.940
jettisoning yourself
into your right brain

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.034
and therefore,
into the right now.

00:46:01.034 --> 00:46:03.450
And the truth is, if you can
bring yourself into the right

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.310
now, the truth is you are fine.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.601
Every single one of us
are drowning in abundance.

00:46:07.601 --> 00:46:09.600
You have a place to sleep,
you have food to eat,

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.115
you have people who love you.

00:46:11.115 --> 00:46:13.960
We just need to bring our
awareness into the right now.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.930
So now, take a nice, deep
inhale, and just exhaling

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.930
any extraneous stress.

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.630
I want you to try
a silent meditation

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.125
for just a few minutes.

00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:29.330
And very easily, very gently,
I want you to silently repeat

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:31.750
the word one, in your mind.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:34.482
So you're going to use this
word, one, almost as a mantra.

00:46:34.482 --> 00:46:36.690
And you're absolutely allowed
to have other thoughts.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:39.549
You don't even have to focus
on it or concentrate on it.

00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:41.840
You're just going to allow
it to be there as an anchor.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:45.280
Just very easily, lightly
allowing this word to happen,

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.780
almost like an echo of an idea
in the background of your mind.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.280
We'll be here for
about three minutes.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.464
And then I'll ease
you out of it.

00:46:53.464 --> 00:46:55.130
So don't try and be
a perfect meditator.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.540
Don't try to stop your
mind from thinking.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.450
Just easily, lightly
thinking the word one.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:59.950
And keeping the eyes closed, but
letting go of the word inside,

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:03.120
keep the eyes closed
for just a few seconds.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.910
Allowing ourselves
to easily, lightly,

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:09.330
gently start to float back
up to the waking state.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:12.085
Bringing our awareness into
the room and into our bodies.

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:16.630
It's always important
to take a few seconds

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:20.129
at the end of your meditation,
with your eyes closed.

00:48:20.129 --> 00:48:21.920
This is so you don't
shock your optic nerve

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.820
or shock your brain.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.010
And you just give yourself
a little transition time

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:29.540
so that you can go back
to work totally refreshed.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.810
Sometimes I like to use this
time as a time for gratitude.

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:35.410
Sounds like a silly practice,
but if you train your brain

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:37.922
to look for what's
going right, then you're

00:48:37.922 --> 00:48:39.380
putting your
attention on the thing

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.640
that you want to grow,
instead of training your brain

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.705
to look for problems to solve,
which only makes more problems.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:58.340
And taking a nice, deep
inhale, and exhaling any extra,

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.250
whenever you're ready,
in your own time,

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.970
we can start to very easily,
gently open the eyes.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.270
Thank you guys so much
for being here today.

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:19.228
I really appreciate it.

00:49:19.228 --> 00:49:21.110
You guys were an
amazing, amazing crowd,

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.470
so receptive and attentive.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:26.040
I'm going to stick around if
you guys have any questions.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.970
I'm going to give you
at least a minute or two

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:29.810
to get to your next meeting.

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:30.810
I do have cards up here.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:32.040
This is my amazing
assistant, Sarah.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.730
So if you guys have questions
or are interested in joining,

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.480
I have a course starting
here in New York.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.630
I have a meditation
center on 38th and 8th.

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.080
And I have a meditation class
starting this Wednesday.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.600
It's two hours a
day for four days,

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.058
and then you're an
expert meditator

00:49:43.058 --> 00:49:45.370
and you have the practice
to take with you for life.

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:46.660
So if you're interested in
learning more about that,

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.451
you can meet Sarah.

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:48.850
And there is also
business cards.

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:50.210
And there's a place, if you
want, to put your email.

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:53.060
If you want to get some
more video goodness from me

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.690
or be kept in the loop, I
would love to stay in touch.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.180
So I'll stick around over
here, if have any questions.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.680
But thank you, thank
you, thank you.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.630
Have a beautiful day.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:02.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: And thank you,
Nina, for organizing this.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:03.530
Yay.

00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:05.380
Thanks, Matt.
