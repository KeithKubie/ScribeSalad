00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.650
Let's imagine we
have a huge cloud

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.470
of hydrogen atoms
floating in space.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.240
Huge, and when I say huge
cloud, huge both in distance

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.360
and in mass.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.720
If you were to combine
all of the hydrogen atoms,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.000
it would just be this
really, really massive thing.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.830
So you have this huge cloud.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.510
Well, we know that gravity
would make the atoms actually

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.650
attracted to each other.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.100
It's-- we normally don't think
about the gravity of atoms.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.620
But it would slowly
affect these atoms.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.380
And they would slowly
draw close to each other.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.630
It would slowly condense.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.640
They'd slowly move
towards the center

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.650
of mass of all of the atoms.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.180
They'd slowly move in.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.860
So if we fast
forward, this cloud's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.245
going to get denser and denser.

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:48.420
And the hydrogen atoms
are going to start

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.300
bumping into each other and
rubbing up against each other

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.280
and interacting with each other.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.100
And so it's going to get
denser and denser and denser.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.430
Now remember, it's a huge
mass of hydrogen atoms.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.760
So the temperature is going up.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.430
And it'll-- they'll
keep condensing.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.870
They'll just keep
condensing and condensing

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.980
until something really
interesting happens.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.677
So let's imagine that they've
gotten really dense here

00:01:12.677 --> 00:01:13.260
in the center.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.550
And there's a bunch of
hydrogen atoms all over.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.310
It's really dense.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.600
I could never draw the
actual number of atoms here.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.058
This is really to
give you an idea.

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:28.026
There's a huge amount of
inward pressure from gravity,

00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:29.400
from everything
that wants to get

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.540
to that center of mass
of our entire cloud.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.900
The temperature here is
approaching 10 million Kelvin.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.780
And at that point,
something neat happens.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.680
And to kind of realize the
neat thing that's happening,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.390
let's remember what a
hydrogen atom looks like.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.010
A hydrogen-- and
even more, I'm just

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.390
going to focus on
the hydrogen nucleus.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.900
So the hydrogen
nucleus is a proton.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.691
If you want to think
about a hydrogen atom,

00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:57.200
it also has an electron orbiting
around or floating around.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.930
And let's draw another
hydrogen atom over here.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.050
And obviously this
distance isn't to scale.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.127
This distance is
also not to scale.

00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:05.835
Atoms are actually--
the nucleus of atoms

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:07.980
are actually much,
much, much, much smaller

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.199
than the actual
radius of an atom.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.290
And so is the electron.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.222
But anyway, this just
gives you an idea.

00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:14.680
So we know from
the Coulomb forces,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.480
from electromagnetic forces,
that these two positively

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.970
charged nucleuses will
not want to get anywhere

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.300
near each other.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.520
But we do know from our-- from
what we learned about the four

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.260
forces-- that if they did get
close enough to each other,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.540
that if they did get-- if
somehow under huge temperatures

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.300
and huge pressures you were able
to get these two protons close

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.210
enough to each other,
then all of a sudden,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.130
the strong force will overtake.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.790
It's much stronger
than the Coulomb force.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.800
And then these two
hydrogens will actually--

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.040
these nucleuses would actually
fuse-- or is it nuclei?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.750
Well, anyway, they would
actually fuse together.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.570
And so that is what
actually happens

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.360
once this gets hot
and dense enough.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.830
You now have enough pressure
and enough temperature

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.620
to overcome the
Coulomb force and bring

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.480
these protons close enough
to each other for fusion

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.186
to occur, for fusion ignition.

00:03:12.186 --> 00:03:14.310
And the reason why-- and
I want to be very careful.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.020
It's not ignition.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.894
It's not combustion in
the traditional sense.

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:20.910
It's not like you're
burning a carbon molecule

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.390
in the presence of oxygen.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.460
It's not combustion.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.085
It's ignition.

00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:25.710
And the reason why
it's called ignition

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.880
is because when two
of these protons,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.760
or two of the nucleuses
fuse, the resulting nucleus

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.064
has a slightly smaller mass.

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:36.480
And so in the first
stage of this,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.120
you actually have two protons
under enough pressure--

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.990
obviously, this would not happen
with just the Coulomb forces--

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.781
with enough pressure
they get close enough.

00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:51.150
And then the strong interaction
actually keeps them together.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.830
One of these guys
degrades into a neutron.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.460
And the resulting mass
of the combined protons

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.860
is lower than the mass
of each of the original.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.520
By a little bit, but
that little bit of mass

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.270
results in a lot of
energy-- plus energy.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.960
And this energy is why
we call it ignition.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.019
And so what this energy
does is it provides

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.839
a little bit of
outward pressure,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.420
so that this thing
doesn't keep collapsing.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.130
So once you get pressure
enough, the fusion occurs.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.260
And then that energy
provides outward pressure

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.880
to balance what is now a star.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.660
So now we are at
where we actually

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.800
have the ignition at the center.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.050
We have-- and we still have all
of the other molecules trying

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.520
to get in providing the pressure
for this fusion ignition.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.300
Now, what is the hydrogen
being fused into?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.580
Well, in the first step of
the reaction-- and I'm just

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.640
kind of doing the most basic
type of fusion that happens

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.020
in stars-- the hydrogen
gets fused into deuterium.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.442
I have trouble spelling.

00:05:01.442 --> 00:05:03.400
Which is another way of
calling heavy hydrogen.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.775
This is still
hydrogen because it

00:05:04.775 --> 00:05:07.200
has one proton and
one neutron now.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.100
It is not helium yet.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.290
This does not have two-- it
does not have two protons.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.520
But then the deuterium
keeps fusing.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.010
And then we eventually
end up with helium.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.100
And we can even see that
on the periodic table.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.480
Oh, I lost my periodic table.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.938
Well, I'll show
you the next video.

00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:30.040
But we know hydrogen
in its atomic state

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.320
has an atomic number of 1.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.560
And it also has a mass of 1.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.000
It only has one
nucleon in its nucleus.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.080
But it's being fused.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.210
It goes to hydrogen-2,
which is deuterium,

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.590
which is one neutron, one proton
in its nucleus, two nucleons.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.350
And then that
eventually gets fused--

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.475
and I'm not going into the
detail of the reaction--

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.320
into helium.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.040
And by definition, helium has
two protons and two neutrons.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.280
So it has-- or we're
talking about helium-4,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.590
in particular, that
isotope of helium--

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.350
it has an atomic mass of 4.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.420
And this process
releases a ton of energy.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.740
Because the atomic mass of
the helium that gets produced

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.220
is slightly lower than
four times the atomic mass

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.440
of each of the
constituent hydrogens.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.740
So all of this energy, all this
energy from the fusion-- but it

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.900
needs super high pressure, super
high temperatures to happen--

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.820
keeps the star from collapsing.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.510
And once a star
is in this stage,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.346
once it is using hydrogen--
it is fusing hydrogen

00:06:35.346 --> 00:06:37.470
in its core, where the
pressure and the temperature

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.350
is the most, to form helium--
it is now in its main sequence.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.870
This is now a main
sequence star.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.770
And that's actually where
the sun is right now.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.580
Now there's questions of,
well, what if there just

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.304
wasn't enough mass to get
to this level over here?

00:06:56.304 --> 00:06:57.720
And there actually
are things that

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.630
never get to quite
that threshold

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.985
to fuse all the way into helium.

00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:02.610
There are a few things
that don't quite

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.090
make the threshold of stars
that only fuse to this level.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.839
So they are generating
some of their heat.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.580
Or there are even
smaller objects

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.280
that just get to
the point there's

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.600
a huge temperature and pressure,
but fusion is not actually

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.042
occurring inside of the core.

00:07:15.042 --> 00:07:17.000
And something like Jupiter
would be an example.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.074
And you could go several
masses above Jupiter

00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:21.490
where you get
something like that.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.156
So you have to reach
a certain threshold

00:07:23.156 --> 00:07:25.470
where the mass, where the
pressure and the temperature

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.470
due to the heavy mass,
get so large that you

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.770
start this fusion.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.960
And-- but the smaller you
are above that threshold,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.830
the slower the
fusion will occur.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.570
But if you're super
massive, the fusion

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.680
will occur really, really fast.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.700
So that's the general idea
of just how stars get formed

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.370
and why they don't
collapse on themselves

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.640
and why they are
these kind of balls

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.954
of fusion reactions
existing in the universe.

00:07:48.954 --> 00:07:50.370
In the next few
videos, we'll talk

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.120
about what happens once that
hydrogen fuel in the core

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.878
starts to run out.
