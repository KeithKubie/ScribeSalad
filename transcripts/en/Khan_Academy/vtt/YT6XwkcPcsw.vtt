00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.220
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.800
we'd expressed our line
integral around the boundary

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.120
of our surface.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.090
So this is f.dr where our
path is this boundary right

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.750
over here-- this path c.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.780
We had expressed it
in terms of a line

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.360
integral around this boundary--
around path c1-- which

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.160
is the boundary of
region R. And the reason

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.990
why this is going
to be valuable to us

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.080
is now we can directly apply
Green's Theorem to this

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.760
to turn this into a double
integral over this region

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.990
right over here-- the region
that it is actually bounding.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.230
So let's actually do that.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.510
We're just applying
Green's Theorem here.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.947
So Green's Theorem.

00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:46.030
And actually, let me box
this off right over here.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.571
This was just
something that we wrote

00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:50.010
to remind ourselves
in the last video.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.170
So let me just box it
off right over here.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.260
But when you apply
Green's Theorem,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.760
you get that this is going
to be the exact same thing

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.310
as the double integral
over the region

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.440
that c1 bounds-- that
region, R, that's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.319
in our xy plane-- of the
partial of this with respect

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:16.620
to x of this business.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.790
So I'll do that in
that same green color.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.800
Q plus R times the partial
of z with respect to y

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.330
minus the partial
with respect to y

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.772
of P plus R times the partial
of z with respect to x.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.280
And then, dA, little
differential of our region.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.780
dA.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.910
And so let's actually
calculate this right here.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.370
You take the partials of
each of these expressions.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.000
And we'll see that if we
expand them and then simplify,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.958
we'll get something very
similar-- or actually,

00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.040
hopefully, identical--
to this right over here.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.500
And that'll show that this line
integral for this special case

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.210
is the same thing as this
surface integral, which

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.330
will prove Stokes' theorem
for this special case.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.260
So let's do it.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.780
So let's just apply the
partial derivative operator.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.280
So first we want to take the
partial derivative with respect

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.070
to Q.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.570
And we need to remind
ourselves-- and we did this way

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.640
up here where we first thought
about it-- we saw that P, Q,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.230
and R, they're each
functions of x, y, and z.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.550
So we're assuming that's
how they're represented.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.801
And if z was not a
function of x, then,

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:36.050
if we were to take the partial
of Q with respect to x,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.980
we would just write it as a
partial of Q with respect to x.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.270
But we know that we've
assumed that z is itself

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.980
a function of x and y.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.250
So if we're taking the partial
with respect to x over here,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.550
we have to think
first-- Well, how

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.970
can Q directly change
with respect to x?

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.550
And then, how can it change
due to something else changing

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.100
due to x?

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.590
And so that other thing that
could change due to x is z. y

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.980
is independent of x, but
z is a function of x.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.234
So let's keep that in mind.

00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:07.650
So we're really going to do
the multi-variable chain rule.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.570
So when we try to take the
derivative of this part,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.330
of this whole function
with respect to x,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.000
we have to think about--
How will Q change directly

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.410
with respect to x?

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.820
And to that, we have to add how
Q could change due to changes

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.740
in other variables
due to changes in x.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.197
And the only other
variable that Q

00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:28.280
is a function of that could
change due to a change

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.010
in x is z.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.420
So Q could also change to z
because z has changed due to x.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.400
So the operator here is
the partial with respect

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.860
to x plus the partial
of Q with respect

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.220
to z times the partial
of z with respect to x.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.620
If we rewrote Q so that
z was substituted with

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.465
x's and y's-- because it is a
function of x and y's-- then we

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.840
would just have to write this
first term right over here.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.500
But we're assuming
this is expressed

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.170
as a function of x, y, and z.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.480
And z itself is a function of x.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.850
And so that's why we had to use
the multi-variable chain rule.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.380
Now, let's move
to the next part.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.710
And both of these might
have some x's in them.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.170
So we have to use the
product rule right over here.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.050
So first, we can take the
derivative of r with respect

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.890
to x.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.822
And then, multiply
that times z sub y.

00:04:21.822 --> 00:04:23.780
Then, we have to take
the derivative of z sub y

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.770
with respect to x and
multiply that times R.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.660
So this is going to be plus.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.830
If we take the derivative
of this with respect

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.230
to x, same exact logic-- R
can change directly due to x,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.080
and it can change due to y.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.470
And that could change due
to z and multiply that times

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.160
how z could change due to x.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.750
Once again, you could view this
as the multi-variable chain

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.969
rule in action here.

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.510
But of course, we
take the derivative

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.980
of the first term
times the second term.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.665
And I'll do the second
term in magenta.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.670
So the partial of z with
respect to y plus the derivative

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.624
of the second term--
which is the partial of z

00:05:04.624 --> 00:05:06.540
with respect to y, and
then taking the partial

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.500
of that with respect to
x, which we could just

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.760
write as that--
times the first term.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.300
So that's the
partial with respect

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.960
to x of all of this
business right over here.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.070
And then, we need to
subtract the partial

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.320
of this with respect to y.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.720
And we're going to use
the exact same logic.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.510
So then, we're
going to subtract--

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.100
and I'll put it in
parentheses like that.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.100
So P could change
directly due to y.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.720
I will circle P. Let
me do it with a color

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.180
that I haven't used yet.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.770
P could change
directly due to y.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.750
So we could say the partial
of P with respect to y,

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.150
but it could also change due
to z changing because of y.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.570
So plus the partial
with respect to z times

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.976
the partial of z
with respect to y--

00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:58.670
and I'll do R maybe
in that same color--

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.454
plus the derivative of R.

00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:02.620
Well, we already figured
that, but actually now it's

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.700
with respect to x,
not with respect to y.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.749
You have to be careful.

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:07.790
So it's going to be the
partial of R with respect

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.060
to y plus the partial
of R with respect to z

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.820
times the partial of z
with respect to y times

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:23.304
z sub x plus-- now,
we take the derivative

00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:24.970
of the second term
times the first term.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.800
The derivative of the partial
of z with respect to x, then

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.015
with respect to y,
is going to be z.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:42.360
And then we're going to
multiply that times R.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.010
And now, let's see if
we can expand this out.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.340
And hopefully, things simplify.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.650
And just a reminder,
I'm just working

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.233
on the inside of
this double integral.

00:06:49.233 --> 00:06:53.630
I'll rewrite the double
integral and the dA

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.044
once I get this all
cleaned up a little bit.

00:06:56.044 --> 00:06:57.460
So let me rewrite
it a little bit.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.540
So this is equal to
the partial of Q.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.660
I'll try to color-code
it the same way.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.070
And this is really just
algebra at this point.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.670
The partial of Q with
respect to x plus the partial

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.260
of Q with respect to z times
the partial of z with respect

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.210
to x plus the partial
of R with respect

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.850
to x times the partial
of z with respect to y.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.640
And then plus the partial
of R with respect to z

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.190
times the partial
of z with respect

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.680
to x times the partial
of z with respect to y.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.030
And then we have this
term right over here--

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:40.380
which I'll just do in
purple-- plus the partial of z

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.170
with respect to y, and
then respect to x, times R.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.680
And now, we're going to subtract
all of this business right

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.320
over here.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.890
I'll do it in the blue.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.420
Minus the partial
of P with respect

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:00.280
to y minus the partial of
P with respect to z times

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.090
the partial of z
with respect to y.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.910
And then we're going
to subtract from that.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.380
Minus the partial
of r with respect

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.400
to y times-- we want to
distribute this-- times

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.439
the partial of z with respect
to x minus the partial of R.

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:18.730
This gets a little bit tedious.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.890
But hopefully, it'll get
us to where we need to go.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.150
The partial of R with respect
to z times the partial of z

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:29.710
with respect to y times the
partial of z with respect to x.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.141
And then, finally, this
term right over here

00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:34.390
minus this-- because we have
that negative out there--

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.280
minus the partial
of z with respect

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:43.030
to y, then with respect to x,
and then with respect to yR.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.010
Now, let's see if we
can simplify things.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.090
So the first thing-- this
and this look to be the same.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.840
We just can commute the order
in which we actually multiply.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.490
But these are the
exact same term.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.320
So that is going to
cancel out with that.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:03.150
And because we
assumed way up here

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.845
that we have continuous second
derivatives of the function

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:08.030
z-- z is a function
of x and y, that that

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:13.340
is equal to that-- we can
now say that these two

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.970
right over here are going to
be the negatives of each other

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.410
or that they are
going to cancel out.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.550
And so this simplified
things a good bit.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.344
And let's see if
I can group terms

00:09:23.344 --> 00:09:25.010
in a way that might
start to make sense.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.551
And actually, I'm
going to try to see

00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:28.420
if I can make them
similar to this.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.277
So I have all the terms that
have a z sub x and the z sub y

00:09:32.277 --> 00:09:33.360
and then the rest of them.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.860
So z sub x I'll do in blue.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.970
So you have the terms
that have a z sub x in it.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.610
So you have this
term right over here

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.900
and this term right over here.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.270
And we can factor
out the z sub x.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.770
And we get the partial
of z with respect

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.330
to x times the partial
of Q with respect

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.400
to z minus the partial
of R with respect to y.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.582
And then, let's do
the-- and I want

00:09:57.582 --> 00:09:59.470
to get the colors
the same way, too.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.910
I did yellow next.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.150
Plus, I have all the
terms of the partial of z

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.150
with respect to y.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.470
So it's that term and
that term right over here.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.700
So it becomes plus the
partial of z with respect to y

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.110
times the partial
of R with respect

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.250
to x minus the partial
of p with respect to z.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.410
And then we have
these last two terms.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.700
And I used the color
green up there,

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.730
so I'll use the
color green again.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.440
So for these two
terms, I'll just

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.750
write plus the partial
of Q with respect

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:35.850
to x minus the partial
of P with respect to y.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.750
So our double integrals
have kind of-- I

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.390
can't really say
simplified-- but we

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.270
can rewrite it like this.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:47.370
And we don't want to forget
this was all a simplification

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.526
of our double integral
over the region dA.

00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:52.150
This is what we have
been able to using

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.270
Green's theorem and the
multi-variable chain rule

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.460
and whatever else.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.070
We've been able to
say that that line

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.861
integral around the
boundary of our surface

00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:00.430
is the same thing as this.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:04.010
And now, we can compare that to
what our surface integral was.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.570
So let's see if I have space.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.580
So copy.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.052
And then, let me see if I have
space up here to paste it.

00:11:11.052 --> 00:11:13.260
Well, it doesn't look like
I actually have much space

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.730
to paste it, although
I'll try anyway.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.890
So if I paste it, you see
that they are identical.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.080
They are identical.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.100
Our line integral is
identical to this.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.070
We get the exact same thing.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:32.100
So our line integral,
f.dr, around this path c

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.940
simplified to this and our
surface integral simplified

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.440
to this.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.710
So using the
assumptions we had, they

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.710
both simplified
to the same thing.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.740
So now we know, for
this special case,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.660
our line integral is equal
to our surface integral.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.801
And we are done.
