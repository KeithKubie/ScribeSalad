COLE BUNZEL: My dissertation’s title is
“The Escalation of Enmity: The Origins and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.260
Evolution of Militant Wahhabism.”

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.100

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.591
COLE BUNZEL: Wahhabism is an Islamic revivalist
movement that begins in the mid 18th century

00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:20.170
in, what is today, Saudi Arabia.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.990
It was a highly militant and aggressive and
exclusivist movement that deemed the majority

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.189
of the world's Muslims to be infidels.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.420
BERNARD HAYKEL: He's incredibly imaginative,
resourceful, intrepid.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.570
The topic that he is working on is not only
intellectually difficult to write about and

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.680
to understand-- it spans three centuries of
intellectual and political history-- but it's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.969
also very difficult to get the primary sources,
to do the work.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.310
COLE BUNZEL: A lot of it is luck, a lot of
it is persistence.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.960
I spent more than two years trying to get
access to one manuscript, in Riyadh, in an

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.880
archive, which, eventually, I was able to
do.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.860
Also, just spending time in cafes with ordinary
folks, you build contacts and eventually,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.720
I met enough people who are from this northern
region in Saudi Arabia.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.860
And they actually drove me there and opened
up the private libraries of the region for

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.860
me.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.020
BERNARD HAYKEL: He just goes and he finds
like these shiny objects, all over the world,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.240
that I had never thought existed.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.370
And there are people who think, or who thought,
that they had seen everything.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.721
And then all this stuff is unearthed by Cole.

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:39.600
COLE BUNZEL: Professor Haykel and I, we are
co-teaching a seminar for undergraduates that's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.800
titled Jihadism in the Modern Middle East.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.760
BERNARD HAYKEL: Bringing together a faculty
member with a graduate student to teach has

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.190
been really wonderful.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.570
And also, the students can see in him someone
that they can aspire to be like.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.310
They can attain the level of expertise and
scholarship that he has attained.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.360
COLE BUNZEL: Professor Haykel has been a wonderful
adviser.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.820
He's helped me in basically every dimension
of my studies, here at Princeton.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.780
He's helped me learn Arabic better.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.409
He's helped me understand Wahhabi theology
better.

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.569
He's helped me gain access to Saudi Arabia.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.640
Basically, can't imagine being able to do
what I've done without my adviser.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.840
