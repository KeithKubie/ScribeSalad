00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.350
Randy Adams has had profound hearing loss
since he was a child.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.530
Here at Emory University Hospital Midtown,
he’s learning how to

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.820
recognize sounds for the first time through
the use of a high-tech

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.840
hearing device called a cochlear implant.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.130
Randy speaks through an interpreter.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.820
“I can hear it and I can feel it in the
ear.”

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.360
As the technology evolves, cochlear implants
may one day be able

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.820
to relay more nuanced sounds, like music.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.180
Still, even today, the

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.770
device offers a much wider auditory window
than conventional

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.280
hearing aids are capable of delivering.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.480
“Can you hear me?”

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.140
“A little bit but you have a low voice.”

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.320
“So good to hear your voice."

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.460
(keys jingle)

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.060
“Soft.  Not very loud."

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.480
"Yes,  it’s very quiet.”

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.140
The cochlear implant is not an instant fix
and must be fine-tuned

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.190
as the patient learns to optimize its use.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.750
“It takes time.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.391
And everybody’s different in

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.620
how much benefit that
that they get.”

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.900
Cochlear implants have two parts: an audio
processor, which is worn on

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.310
the head and the implant, which is surgically
placed in the inner ear.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.950
“We make an incision here.”

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.679
“It’s typically an outpatient surgery—takes
a couple of hours

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.700
and these people can come and go home the
same day.”

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.990
Unlike a standard hearing aid, which only
makes sounds louder,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.069
a cochlear implant uses electrodes to stimulate
the spiral cavity

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.060
of the inner ear called the cochlea.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.579
“These electrodes which are placed in the
inner-ear—in the cochlear

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.179
they actually send electric signals to those
cells in the inner-ear

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.679
and those signals and then transmitted through
the cochlear nerve to

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.310
your brain and it’s like hearing.”

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.869
Like his dad, the Adam’s young son Maxwell
is also deaf.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:56.869
He got his

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.819
first cochlear implant at 10 months old.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.080
“And if children are implanted by 12 months
old, they do very well.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.919
They develop speech almost normally.”

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:10.220
After his son’s procedure, Randy was inspired
to get his own implant.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.959
“So far, he seems to be hearing just fine
with his implant.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.150
Last month he finally learned how to say daddy
and recognize my voice.”

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.680
Randy will undergo speech therapy, but progress
will be more difficult

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.209
for him than his son.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.099
“We still have more to learn.”

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.550
But still he’s betting that the implant
will enhance his life.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.189
“Hopefully with the cochlear implant things
will improve and we’ll

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.380
find a better career and better job opportunities.”

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.860
“He sounds so cute when he’s laughing.”

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.280
“I can’t wait.”
