00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
In today's video,

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.400
we're doing a few more
experiments with the ink removed

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.938
from ballpoint pens.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.260
[Music]

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.000
A while back,
we took 1000 ballpoint pens,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.800
and removed all
of the ink from them,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.800
and collected it.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
And we still have probably
800 pens worth of that ink.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200
Maybe a little less,
but we've got quite a bit.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.300
This is just a pool of pen ink,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.040
and since we did that, we asked
what we could do with it,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.405
and we had several responses.

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:34.000
So today we've got
five common requests,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.300
and we're going to try them out,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.350
and see what happens
with our pen ink.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.288
I still think
my idea was the best.

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:41.700
Your idea was to paint
your nails with it.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.280
I'm just painting my nails.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.100
With what?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.740
Pen ink.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.700
She's thrilled.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.200
I'm not going to paint
my nails with pen ink,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.500
but here's hoping
that works out for you.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.880
I guess it's a really cool
metallic black coppery color.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.250
It's beautiful.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.463
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:02.763
We've got five suggestions

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:04.620
of things to try
with ballpoint pen ink.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.080
We're going to go
through the one by one,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.300
and see what the results are.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.200
Let's go through our comments
one at a time.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.600
Our first comment comes
from Charlene McClintock,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.410
who asks us to do a test to see
if pen ink is magnetic.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.113
Calli has a very
powerful magnet in her hands.

00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:20.300
Let's show the power

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.500
of that magnet off
a little bit for a second.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.800
I'm pretty sure this magnet has
a 100 pound pull strength,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.164
which means if it's
on a flat piece of metal

00:01:31.164 --> 00:01:32.400
that is attracted to,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.774
it takes a 100 pounds pulling
it straight away from it.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.940
Obviously, the way

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.958
to remove it without that much
for us is to use leverage,

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.900
twist it at an angle,
pull it off.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.400
So very powerful magnet.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.900
Let's see if it wants to do
anything at all to our ink.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.500
It's not sticking to my nails.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.200
The nails...

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.380
No effect.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.757
That is a very very
thin layer of the ink.

00:01:52.757 --> 00:01:53.600
That is true.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.111
This is probably like less
than a drop of ink guys.

00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:59.500
This stuff has
great coating power.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.880
This however is
about a cup of ink.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.500
So let's see
if we get any result.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.986
I'm going to start by putting it
on the side of the glass.

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:08.600
So it doesn't just
stick to our magnet

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.500
if it's magnetic.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.460
Anything?

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.900
Can you feel it pull it all?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.000
Nope, I feel no pull.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200
I see no ripples in ink.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.400
Without the glass,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.200
in case the glass is what's
causing the lack of magnetism.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.100
Well, whatever is in this ink
that's making it metallic,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.300
it's apparently not magnetic.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.300
It does look metallic,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.100
and maybe they're actually
is real metal in ink.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.700
I don't know the full
chemical composition of ink.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.500
But not all metals are magnetic.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.920
The three elemental metals

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.010
that are attracted
to magnets are iron,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.396
nickel, and cobalt,
and some of their alloys.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.420
Steel for example is an alloy
of iron and carbon,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.350
and sometimes other things,

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.480
that usually is
attracted to magnets.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.500
Thank you for your suggestion.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.400
It would have been
really cool if it were,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.500
because that would've been

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.400
like a really cheap
source of ferrofluid.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.180
No magnetism here.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.556
Alright, so for
our next comment,

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:04.000
we have got one
from mamasboy -99.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.600
How would electricity
work in the pen ink?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.400
So you can see,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.549
when I touch the two
metal pieces together,

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.400
it's a very bright little light
that we've got there.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.400
Put something in
the way of that,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.640
like my tongue.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.000
Lights up a tiny bit.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Not as much.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.463
Not as much.

00:03:21.463 --> 00:03:22.700
So there's something in the way.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.600
Alright, so first as
a comparison control test,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.540
just regular water.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.800
So here's how bright
it is without anything.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.500
And then in the water.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.800
Very light glow.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.740
Now, pure water

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.800
distilled water probably
would give us no result.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.965
But this is tap water,

00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:45.000
it's got minerals
in it, imperfections.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.615
But now we're adding salt,

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:49.200
which hopefully will
make it even better.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.749
Well, that's quite a bit--

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:52.300
Yeah.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.800
Okay.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.000
Still not as bright as
the wires touching however.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.240
Let's try the ink.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.300
And into the ink.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.640
[Music]

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.380
There actually is
a tiny tiny little purple.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.560
Oh, you're very--

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.900
Are you sure it's
not a reflection?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.500
Yeah.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.300
So you can see

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.800
that the wires are about
two inches apart in ink,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.240
and that's giving
us an extremely low,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.440
but not nothing glow on our LED.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.700
It's much worse than salt water,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.320
and it's actually worse
than non saltwater.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.000
So mamasboy -99,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.100
we do have conductivity
through the ink,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.000
but so little
that it barely counts.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.440
Our next comment request
comes from Icey Paw,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.400
who says, try putting
dry ice into pen ink.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.740
I'm just going to dip it,
and see what happens.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.340
[Music]

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.700
That did not stick.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.048
Sticking to the plier.

00:04:50.048 --> 00:04:52.500
Yeah, the pliers
are getting stuck to it.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.100
But look at that,
it's actually--

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.200
Oh, it's freezing
ink in streams.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.700
Here.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.760
Try and-- Try and let's see
if we can like capture--

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.900
Pliers it together.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.180
Oh, that's weird.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.900
So odd.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.550
Because it's still
a liquid, guys.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.732
We're just freezing it.

00:05:06.732 --> 00:05:08.872
The bottom, where it's
actually in contact,

00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:09.699
I think is...

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:09.972
Yes.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.200
Started to freeze.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.900
Oh no.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.340
See it like that.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.800
Sucked my glove immediately.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.100
See if I can flip it over.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.480
No, it's stuck in my hand.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.200
Oh no.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.700
This is weird,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.200
because it's like partly frozen
so it's like gummy.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.660
 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.000
This part starting to dull.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.738
It's actually...

00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:32.200
Oh, it is.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.704
Look at that.

00:05:32.704 --> 00:05:33.268
You're actually--

00:05:33.268 --> 00:05:35.460
&gt;&gt; You frozen the ink.
&gt;&gt; Frozen all the way through.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.920
All right, I'm going to try
and pull it off of that.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.300
Oh my goodness.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.200
Look at that.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.400
It's just a chunk.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.500
Okay, I'm gonna
destroy my gloves,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.000
but that's fun.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.040
Clay is a really
good description, but it's--

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.700
Except it's
melting into sticky--

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.820
If you were to mix clay
and slime, but it's...

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.900
It has this give of like a gummy
candy almost, except it's--

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.300
It is warming up rapidly,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.200
and quickly just
destroying my gloves.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.220
Yeah.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.300
This elastic texture

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.323
is not something
that I was expecting,

00:06:09.323 --> 00:06:11.080
but my goodness, it's fun.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.420
[Music]

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.400
I win.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400
Did you get it out?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.060
I did.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.260
Good.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.600
Well, I think we should progress
to mixing even more dry ice in.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.500
That was the comment,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.570
is try putting dry ice
into the pen ink.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.380
We've done everything,
but that so...

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.280
So here it goes.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.630
Yeah.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.430
Dry ice.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.440
[Music]

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.440
Yes.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.400
That's kind of what I
was hoping it would have do.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.300
So I got some pretty
good shots blowing bubbles

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.700
into the ink last time, but now,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.400
as it seals up over the dry ice,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.700
it just makes its own bubbles
as the dry ice tries to expand.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.199
So while Nate plays with that,
we've got another common request.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.200
I apologize if I
butcher this name.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.040
I believe it as Ha Seung Jung,
mix it with soap,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.600
and then blow ink bubbles.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.594
It's so cold now
from the dry ice,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.200
that we still got
this pulled taffy consistency.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.000
Yeah, you can already see

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.100
that there's like this cool
gold sheen happening.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.340
Okay.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.600
So if anybody ever wants to make
their own homemade galaxies,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.900
ink and dish soap.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.636
We are going to try
and blow ink bubbles,

00:07:23.636 --> 00:07:26.100
but this may be
a little too viscous.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.900
This is just ink and soap,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.490
so we've added a little bit
of water to this one.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.800
Let's see what we can do.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.900
[Music]

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.620
Well.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.120
That's a nice bubble.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.040
It's pretty though.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.700
So ink and soap together,

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.101
not really making bubbles,
but this ink, soap,

00:07:51.101 --> 00:07:52.260
and water is.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.880
With that weird mixture
that Nate's got,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.700
it really just looks
like he's blowing blood bubbles.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.540
That's freaking cool.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.000
Well now, I'm going
to start popping bubbles,

00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:07.467
because I don't want them
to expand up out of the cup.

00:08:07.467 --> 00:08:08.597
Here. Wait, hang on.

00:08:08.597 --> 00:08:10.200
This was an awesome idea.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.700
It didn't go quite
the way we planned,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.140
but it was still cool.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.600
Our last request
is from OLIVERS758,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.300
who asks if we
can dehydrate the pen ink.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.808
We've got two things
we're going to try.

00:08:20.808 --> 00:08:23.720
One, we're gonna throw some ink
in our Dehydro-tron,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.880
little dehydrating machine
we've used before,

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.100
and the other is the reason
that this has been

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.180
on the counter the whole time,
is this is our freeze-dryer.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.600
And we're going
to see what happens

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.120
if we freeze dry ink.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.540
We don't know
how this is going to go.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.800
We don't know how far
this is going to expand.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.100
So we're just going

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.000
to do a small amount
in a very large jar,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.080
and hope it contains it.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.000
You may remember,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.200
when we first
vacuumed some ink,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.460
it bubble up a lot,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.600
and the clear sides of the cup
that it was in just turned

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.000
completely black immediately,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.700
and then you couldn't really see
what was happening

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.700
inside anymore.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.100
There's a decent chance the same
thing is going to happen here.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.970
We've seen some liquids
bubble up a lot.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.500
Will ink do the same thing?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.382
We're not sure.

00:09:03.382 --> 00:09:05.900
We've seen how rigid it gets
when it gets cold,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.176
and the freeze dryer
does get very cold.

00:09:08.176 --> 00:09:11.000
It might be enough to stop it
from moving at all.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.812
We can see...

00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:13.500
We can look at it after 24,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.680
and see if we think
it's doing well.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.100
Side benefit, we're testing
out what happens

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.400
if you put a GoPro
in a freeze dryer.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:21.900
It may not survive.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.600
And I know the burning
question you all had,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.900
did my nail
survive this experiment?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.500
Yes. They did.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.800
Our ink has been run
through the freeze dryer

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.700
and the dehydrator
for about a day and a half now.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.300
Coming up on two days
at this point actually,

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.040
and we think

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.840
that at least one
of them is finished.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.080
It's gonna be very cold.

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:46.127
First off...

00:09:46.905 --> 00:09:48.905
See if our GoPro survived.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.799
Sorry little GoPro.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.300
I mean, the battery is almost
certainly dead at this point.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.900
It's very cold GoPro.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.800
I just wonder if we
can even turn it on again.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.140
That would be a fun experiment.

00:09:58.147 --> 00:09:59.500
We'll see if this lived.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.300
Okay.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.500
This is my new
favorite thing ever.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.220
[Music]

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.320
Wow.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.210
So obviously, this part
is all very very dry.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.864
This is very cold to hold.

00:10:11.864 --> 00:10:13.900
You can see if it's frosting up.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.600
Still getting ink marks.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.300
This might be the prettiest
stained glass thing ever.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.800
It's kind of going gummy.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.900
Interesting.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:27.838
Okay, around the edges.

00:10:27.838 --> 00:10:29.992
It's still a little squishy.

00:10:29.992 --> 00:10:32.212
That's some fairly warm water.

00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:33.100
Not too hot.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.700
We don't want to risk breaking
the cup or anything like that.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.800
This is from our internal GoPro,

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.300
which apparently did survive
its trip through

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.888
the vacuum chamber-- Whoop!

00:10:41.888 --> 00:10:43.200
And there goes the ink.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.300
That's amazing.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.800
It explodes.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.100
Which is funny,
because like it doesn't look

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.800
like there's any air
bubbles in ink.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.400
But it's just sitting
there for a while,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.300
but apparently, there's enough
that degases in low pressure,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.370
that it just creates
all of those bubbles.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.412
Like obviously,
a ton of bubbles.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.433
That was insane.

00:11:03.433 --> 00:11:07.200
And you can see what it's done
to our perfectly clear glass.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.140
Wow.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.260
At this point,
the glass is warmed back up.

00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:13.709
It's not frozen there.

00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:16.413
This is the same powdery
dry ice substance here.

00:11:16.413 --> 00:11:18.300
However, down at the bottom...

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.119
Now that you've warmed
it back up.

00:11:20.119 --> 00:11:21.707
Yeah, it was frozen in there,

00:11:21.707 --> 00:11:24.518
and we saw with the dry ice
how it gets really thick

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.840
when it freezes.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.380
But now, this is warmed back up.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.800
Alright, so we've exhausted
just about everything

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.969
that we can do with
the freeze dried ink.

00:11:32.969 --> 00:11:34.000
Now, we want to see

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.900
what happened to
our dehydrated ink.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.700
[Music]

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.380
Well, that's cool.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.978
You can see all of the places

00:11:41.978 --> 00:11:44.800
where the ink hasn't dried
yet of my handprint.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.980
What's in here?

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.520
Okay, seems fairly liquid.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.000
This is our common request,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.100
asking if we could
dehydrate the ink.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.100
It is very thoroughly
become inundated with the ink.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.711
That's now the rest of our ink.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.180
Yes.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:00.900
And the freeze-dried.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.626
Yeah, this is
the rest of our ink,

00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:04.300
and everything was freeze-dried.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.480
So you can still see like
the viscosity here, but now,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.900
if I do the same thing to
what we put in the dehydrator...

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.280
It's a--

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.560
It's a little gumier.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.140
It does look

00:12:16.143 --> 00:12:18.912
like it's sticking
a little bit more.

00:12:18.912 --> 00:12:20.554
But that's about it.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.280
It's still, it's still ink.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.940
In our first video

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.580
where we took the ink
out of a thousand pens,

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:26.427
there were dozens,

00:12:26.427 --> 00:12:28.210
and possibly hundreds
of comments saying

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.750
that instead of taking the ink
out of the thousand pens,

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.800
we should have just
bought the ink online,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.040
and you can buy ink online.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.740
But it's not this kind of ink.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.140
Pen ink that you buy online
is much much thinner.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.900
It's designed for
like a quill pen,

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.453
or a fountain pen
that you dip into the ink,

00:12:43.453 --> 00:12:44.708
or you refill a well,

00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:46.920
and then you try
and draw with that.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.400
It's not the same thing.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.900
This would not work
in a fountain pen.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.900
This stuff is as thick
as corn syrup,

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.579
and this is not the consistency

00:12:55.579 --> 00:12:57.741
that you normally have
in a bottle of ink.

00:12:57.741 --> 00:13:00.800
So while, it would have been
easier to buy a bottle of ink,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.357
it's just completely different.

00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:04.960
We wouldn't have learned
what's inside ballpoint pens.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.125
We wouldn't really know
anything about that ink,

00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:08.600
because it's just too different.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.660
Another thing to mention is
that when it comes to India ink,

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.560
the reason people like it
is the quality of the...

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.400
Honestly, the blackness
of the color.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.200
It's very very dark,
and there's no shine to it.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.500
Ballpoint pen ink is usually
known for having the sort

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.500
of metallic quality.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.500
You're not going to get
that with India ink,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.610
or true India ink.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.050
Guys, that's it for today.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.351
But you know,
the fun doesn't end.

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:30.757
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:13:30.757 --> 00:13:32.872
That box up at the top
will take you to our last video.

00:13:32.872 --> 00:13:33.997
You should go check that out.

00:13:33.997 --> 00:13:35.301
The other box
is going to show you

00:13:35.301 --> 00:13:37.087
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:13:37.087 --> 00:13:38.600
If you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.957
you'll be subscribed
to the channel.

00:13:39.957 --> 00:13:41.179
So you never miss
out on a video.

00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:42.269
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:43.500
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.480
Talk to you then.
