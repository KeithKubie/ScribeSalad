00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.640
What does justice look like in America?

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.640
It's about literal generations of poverty

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.760
being attacked

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.480
because people cannot afford their freedom.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.480
Almost half a million people

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.160
are sitting in a jail cell tonight,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.840
and they haven't been found guilty of any crime.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.080
Here, people are actually being held solely because

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.720
they cannot afford to pay.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.240
That's the only reason.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.320
This is cash bail.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.640
$500, $1,000, $5,000.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.300
In communities where

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.920
families are one check away from devastation,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.680
bail is devastation.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.920
In this three-part series from AJ+,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.480
we'll look at how bail rips families apart.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.520
I'm just a regular mom, and they threw me into jail

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.000
like I was a hardened criminal.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.200
How the for-profit bail industry breeds distrust.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.680
These people are lost children.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.040
They're gonna hide, they're gonna run.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.680
And the disruptors,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.120
who are reimagining what public safety should look like.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.200
Simply having money

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.720
does not make you a better human being.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.960
It's just purely a wealth-based detention scheme.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.240
Full stop.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.040
There is a war on Black people

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.980
and in order for us to love each other well,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.760
we have to fight for our freedom.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.160
In America, we shouldn't have to buy our freedom

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.160
but that's exactly what bail forces us to do.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.300
Ok, picture this.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.120
You're driving down the street.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.880
You make an illegal U-turn.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.880
A cop pulls up your record.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.400
You've got a warrant for not paying

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.140
some speeding tickets.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.120
You get booked.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.320
A judge uses what's called a bail schedule

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.240
to set a predetermined amount

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.680
of $500 based on the alleged crime.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.160
If you can post it, you walk out.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.880
If not, you sit in jail until trial.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.120
But what if you can't afford it?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.600
Take a look.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.460
Most of the people in jail right now across the U.S.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.140
haven't been found guilty of any crime.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.840
In the eyes of the law, they're innocent.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.640
That's more people than some countries have

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.920
in their jails and prisons, combined.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.520
My name is Montague Simmons

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.180
and I am a bail reform activist in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.000
These people are in jail

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
because they can't pay to get out.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.740
It's kind of backwards.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.720
First you get punished,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.460
and then at the end of your jail time

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.840
they figure out if you actually did it.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.680
Bail has been sold to us as like the solution, but it's not.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.100
It's the problem.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.120
It's what's keeping our jails so swollen.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.560
This is Mary Moreno.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.320
She's an organizer in Houston, Texas

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.480
who helps bail people out of jail who can't afford it.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.000
Money shouldn't be the deciding factor [of]

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.360
whether you're in jail or not.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.900
They say, "How can you not have $500?"

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.200
But a lot of people don't have $500, right?

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.720
The American justice system is actually rigged

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.840
to favor the rich.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.720
And being rich can mean

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.420
different things to different people.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.640
40% of Americans can't afford to come up with

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.760
$400 in an emergency.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.820
So imagine you're this woman

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.680
who had to come up with $2,000.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.600
You're a grandmother in Texas.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.380
You're babysitting your grandson.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.200
He runs out into the street.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.160
Nothing bad happens, but a driver calls the cops.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.800
You get booked.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.480
Your bail is set at $2,000.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.800
You can't afford that,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.400
so you sit in jail for two weeks

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.540
until a community group advocates for your release.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.440
It wasn't anything, right?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.280
Children run into the street all the time.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.080
This police officer, when he arrived,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.460
he sees a criminal.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.760
And he's like, "I'm gonna take you to jail."

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.420
Instead of like, "How can I help you?"

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.760
Black and brown folks are policed

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.620
both more harshly and more frequently

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.360
than their white counterparts.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.360
And the system just builds from there.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.360
Blake Strode represents people who are

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.560
targeted and criminalized by the legal system.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.820
Once you've labeled someone as a criminal

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.440
they're sort of in a sub-human category.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.320
Shows like "Law &amp; Order," they're popular because they

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.880
feed into this notion that we already believe

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.680
about good and bad.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.560
You've never seen an episode that focused

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.900
on the ways in which implicit bias determines

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.680
who's getting policed in the first place.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.520
You'll never see an episode that talks about

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.200
rampant use of force in a poor, Black community;

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.360
disparities in sentencing and charging.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.700
You also never see the cost in people's lives.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.700
Here's what he means.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.340
You're a mom of seven kids.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.480
You're accused of stealing two beers.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.860
You get booked.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.220
A judge sets bail at $15,000.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.380
You can't pay, so you spend nine months in jail.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.960
You lose your job.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.980
You miss your grandmother's funeral.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.900
And you get separated from your kids.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.100
People who cannot afford bail

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.120
experience these

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.880
catastrophic

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.520
setbacks that are just incredibly hard

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.820
to come out of.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.100
That's Z Gorley.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.280
They lead media efforts at a law firm

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.560
in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.280
The central theme I hear from people

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.240
impacted by cash bail is loss.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.420
Loss of time with their children,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.460
with their brothers and sisters,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.540
with their parents.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.400
You have this system that is operating in

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.520
all elements of a person's life

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.380
in a systemically racist way.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.680
From the use of force at that initial arrest,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.840
the charges, the sentencing

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.840
and then the conditions that people are held in.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.600
So, let's break that down.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.080
And the amount they have to pay

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.680
can be totally unrealistic.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.320
The median bail for a felony is $10,000.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.240
The median annual income

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.720
for someone who's arrested?

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.440
$19,000.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.280
Bail has absolutely nothing to do with the thing

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.420
we're taught in like grade school,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.440
which is that you're innocent until proven guilty.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.900
It's just purely a wealth-based detention scheme.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.760
Full stop.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.480
And people will say,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.240
"Oh, they were only there for a few weeks or a few days."

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.520
In fact, spending just three days in jail

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.220
can actually start to change the legal outcome of cases.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.380
You can't help collect evidence.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.820
You can't meet with your attorney as often

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.880
as you may want to, or may need to.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.780
Pre-trial detention can lead people to

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.360
plead guilty to a crime they didn't commit.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.920
Meet Judge Darrell Jordan of Harris County, Texas.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.400
He's helping to reform the bail system there.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.060
It's a plea bargain system

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.720
instead of a criminal justice system.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.560
Remember, the vast majority of cases in the U.S.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.600
never make it to trial.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.160
You see, prosecutors know that people

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.420
just want to go home.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.760
When you have to make a decision:

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.780
"Do I plead this case and go home

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.160
or stay here and fight it,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.380
and risk losing everything that I have?"

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.760
Most people are going to take the conviction.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.100
In a perfect world,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.660
you'd get arrested and tried on the same day.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.620
But in reality, it can take so much longer than that.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.400
So bondsmen, like J.L. McEntire,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.000
offer you another way out.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.240
The purpose of the bond industry is to make money.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.260
Here's how it works.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.360
We get a call.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.000
Your son was booked.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.480
The judge sets bail at $100,000.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.840
You sign a contract

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.740
guaranteeing he'll show up in court.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.280
Your bond fee is $10,000.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.460
It could be more, it could be less.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.840
And we get him out of jail.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.060
We refer to ourselves as the grease

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.640
that keeps the wheels of the

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.200
criminal justice system moving.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.680
Ken Good is an attorney

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.520
for the Texas bail bonds industry.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.980
These people are lost children.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.540
They need somebody there to hold their hand

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.480
and explain to them ...

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.480
This is the process.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.180
This is what we need to do to get you back on track.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.520
We will come and get you. We'll take you to the court.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.160
And yes, there's a ton of babysitting involved.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.280
But that's what we do.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.340
That's what we've been doing for 200 years.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.120
So, the for-profit bail industry is built on

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.840
this really shaky, disproven myth:

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.560
that people won't come back to court

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.120
unless they have money to lose.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.700
But policy changes have shown

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.680
that people do come back.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.660
Take Washington, DC for example.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.760
The District got rid of cash bail in 1992.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.600
Since then, they've had a 90% response rate

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.340
for people who are let go.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.600
People want to go back to their lives.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.600
They want to be with their families and friends,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.600
their church, their community.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.720
It's not like they have an endless amount of resources

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.520
to just up and move and start a whole new life.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.120
I think that there are people who really

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.240
believe that the whole problem is we have poor people

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.120
and they should not be held accountable

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.960
because they're poor.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.960
I was raised in a very small town.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.260
We were poor.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.280
And we were always taught that

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.680
if you work hard, you can

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.240
overcome.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.240
There's almost an expectation in this

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.000
'pull yourself up by your bootstraps' society

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.180
that the person just needs to do it themselves.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.720
They just need to get their life together.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.020
But what no one is talking about

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.520
is this overarching,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.060
oppressive system.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.380
Let's break that cycle. Let's help people.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.400
So instead of like investing in incarceration,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.720
let's invest in mental health,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720
in housing,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.040
in drug addiction recovery.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.200
And get this:

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.600
Letting people go

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.260
is actually so much cheaper

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.560
than keeping them locked up.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.400
Right now, taxpayers in Harris County, Texas

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.680
spend $87, every day, for each inmate behind bars.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.480
But to release them with services and reminders

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.480
about showing back up to court?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.000
That costs just 83 cents a day.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.440
Instead we want to criminalize them,

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.520
lock them up

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.440
and throw away the key.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.040
And so, jail populations just keep growing.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.260
Between 1999 and 2014,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.820
the number of people held in jail before trial

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.340
accounted for 99% of the total growth.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.480
The bail system is functioning

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.040
just as it was always intended to.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.440
You can peel back the pages of history,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.840
going back to slavery,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.160
what happened after [the] Civil War

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.600
and black codes and Jim Crow.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.640
Now, we're in the new Jim Crow.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.420
As America continues this struggle

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.920
for civil rights and for human rights,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.960
and the Movement for Black Lives,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.160
it's almost like with every push forward,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.000
there is a socially conservative

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.120
push backwards.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.720
What are all those waves accomplishing?

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.360
They are accomplishing

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.200
the engineering of black invisibility.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.700
We often think about young black men

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.360
being the ones behind bars,

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.640
but women are becoming a critical group

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.960
who are locked up and forgotten.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.380
I lost my apartment. I lost my job.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.180
I had to rebuild everything.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.360
And I'm still rebuilding.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.220
In part two of our series,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.100
we'll take a look at women whose lives

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.460
have been irreversibly impacted by the bail system.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.320
I just want answers.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.240
I want to know why and how

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.820
the system failed my mother.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.160
Hey guys, it's Angie.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.000
Thanks for watching.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.600
Do you know somebody who's been

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.720
impacted by cash bail?

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.160
We want to hear your stories.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.000
