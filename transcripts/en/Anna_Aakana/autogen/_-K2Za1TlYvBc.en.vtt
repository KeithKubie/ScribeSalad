00:00:00.257 --> 00:00:03.050
I think one of the most challenging aspects of life

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.100
is this concept of "self."

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.283
Who am I?

00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:07.641
Am I what I do?

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:08.948
Who I hang out with?

00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:10.468
Where I spend my time?

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:14.251
When I was younger, I was looking
for myself in all the wrong places.

00:00:14.492 --> 00:00:18.479
So..I'm in this bag of mushrooms.

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:23.449
I did a lot of experimental things
in my "journey" for self discovery..

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.819
Where are the pockets?

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.162
Where am I supposed to..

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:29.781
That's not safe.

00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:32.219
Ultimately, I realized that there's
no shortcuts.

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.074
If you want to find out who you are,

00:00:34.074 --> 00:00:36.251
then you have to spend time with yourself.

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:41.904
So, I went on a 5-day silent
meditation retreat in Joshua tree,

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:45.590
and it was hard! Oh, it was so
hard! It was like,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.479
you couldn't talk, and it was

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.219
from 5:00AM to 9:00PM

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.842
just, straight-up meditation..

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:53.872
half-hour increments of sitting meditation

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:55.509
and walking meditation.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:57.071
Ugh, so hard..

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:58.189
And I wasn't a saint.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.801
I went crazy around day 2

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.856
and I went on this online shopping spree

00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:03.721
on my phone.
"Tell me I'm real."

00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:05.418
And I ended up calling a friend because

00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:09.418
I couldn't bear just being in the
silence of my own thoughts.

00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:12.071
On the last day, we had to gather around

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.819
in a semi circle

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.089
and we each had to say in one word

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:19.393
our experience of the..the entire ordeal.

00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:20.879
And so people were saying things like,

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:22.979
"Love." "Friendship." "Trust."

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.009
And when it came to me, I said,

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.041
"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."

00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:31.658
And everyone just broke into laughter.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.158
And I was like, "This is me."

00:01:34.158 --> 00:01:35.949
Right there, in that moment,

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:37.750
that was me.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.602
And more importantly..

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:40.842
I like me.

00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:43.071
Aaand I'll see you next Monday.

00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:44.634
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:47.721
Ew, your balls are weird!

00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:51.175
They look like they're scabby from neutering..

00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:52.507
You're all scabbyballs!

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:53.007
