00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:11.935
Let's divide 518 by-- so we're
going to divide it by 0.7.

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:15.040
So we're dividing this
whole number by a decimal.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.352
So we could also
write this as 518

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:23.560
divided-- let me write a
little bit bigger than that,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.143
since we have to do
some work with it.

00:00:25.143 --> 00:00:29.710
518 divided by-- I'll
do the division sign

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.780
in white-- divided by 0.7.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.384
So the first thing we do, since
we have this decimal here,

00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:41.550
we're dividing by a decimal.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.796
So try to turn this into
a whole number somehow.

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:45.920
Well, the best way to turn
this into a whole number

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.550
is to multiply this by 10, which
is essentially multiplying,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.900
shifting the decimal
point over to the right.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.150
So this would become a 7.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.630
But we can't just do that only
for what we're dividing by.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.650
We also have to do
that to the 518,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.240
so that a value does not change.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.840
So we need to multiply
both of these times 10.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.370
So if we move the decimal
over to the right with the 0.7

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.380
to turn into a 7, we also
need to move the decimal over

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.214
to the right for 518.

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:14.630
Now, you're probably
saying, well,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.690
I don't see a decimal in 518.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.540
Well, there is one.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.170
You just didn't have to write
it, because it's 518.00--

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.690
and we can add as many
zeroes as we want.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.950
So if we move the decimal to
the right, it becomes 5,180.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.630
So really what we're saying
is 518 divided by 0.7

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:49.220
is the same thing as
5,180 divided by 7.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.550
Notice all we did by moving the
decimal one place to the right,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.690
is we multiplied
both of these numbers

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.100
by 10, which is
not going to change

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.970
the actual value of the decimal.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.520
One other way of
thinking about this,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.280
if you wanted to write
this as a fraction,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.170
this is the same
thing as 518 over 0.7.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.440
You multiply both the numerator
and denominator by 10,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:25.440
you will get 5,180 over 7.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.940
So let's clean this
up a little bit,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.930
just so we remember what we did.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.130
So we moved the decimal
over to the right, one.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.320
So now this is just a 7.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.922
The decimal is there.

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:37.380
In fact, we really don't have
to write the decimal anymore.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.760
It's just a 7.0-- you
could imagine 7.0,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.920
so we can just
write this as a 7.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.120
And then the 518, the
decimal is now out here.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.600
So this is 5,180.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.590
And let's increase the
sign right over here.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.650
Now, this is just a straight-up
long division problem.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.060
How many times does 7 go into 5?

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.365
Well, it goes 0 times.

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:04.340
0 times 7-- actually, let's
just cut to the chase.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.070
7 doesn't go into 5.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.150
It does go into 51.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.600
7 times 7 is 49.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.050
So it goes 7 times.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.510
7 times 7 is 49.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.060
Subtract 51 minus 49 is 2.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.780
And now we can
bring down this 8.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.490
7 goes into 28 four times.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.080
4 times 7 is 28.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.570
Subtract, you get a 0.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.210
Now we can bring down another 0.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.860
We want at least get
to the decimal place.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.660
So we bring down another
0 right over here.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.160
When I say get to
the decimal place,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.610
we could put the
decimal place up

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.985
here too, just to
make sure we're

00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:45.025
keeping track of the
right place values

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:47.150
or that we can have the
decimal in the right place.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.660
So notice, I'm very particular.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.010
When I'm doing 7 goes into 51,
I put the 7 right above the 1

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.130
in the 51's place.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.520
When I'm saying 7
goes into 28, I'm

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.520
putting the 4 right above
the 8 in this one's place

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.900
when we're doing the division.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.960
So now we say how many
times does 7 go into 0?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.560
Well, it goes 0 times.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.490
0 times 7 is 0.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.684
Subtract, you have no remainder.

00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:12.100
So we could keep going, and
we'll just keep getting zeroes

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.880
like this.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.598
But we see that this
is equal to 740.
