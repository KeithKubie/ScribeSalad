00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.600
- [Voiceover] So the last video,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.837
we studied the circumstance

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:06.466
where I had a 70% free throw probability.

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.966
I have a 70% chance of
making any free throw,

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.033
which is actually higher

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.933
than my actual free throw probability,

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.533
which might be a surprise to you.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.766
But we said in that circumstance,

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.233
if it's a 70% chance of making it,

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.369
well, that means that
you have a one minus 70%,

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.233
or 30%, chance of missing.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.433
And we said if you took six attempts,

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.400
the probability of you getting exactly,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.866
making two of the baskets,

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.333
exactly two scores ...

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.833
I called them "scores"
instead of "making it,"

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.533
just because I wanted "making" and "miss"

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.534
to have different
letters in that video ...

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:36.933
We said, well, there's six
choose two different ways

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:41.067
of making two, exactly two
out of the six free throws,

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:43.633
and then the probability
of any one of those ways

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.566
is going to be making it twice,

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.433
which is 0.7 squared,

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.900
and missing it four times,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.266
so 0.3 to the fourth power.

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:54.869
This was just one particular situation,

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:56.133
but we could generalize

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.200
based on the logic that
we had in that video.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.433
In fact, let's do that.

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.168
So if I were to generalize it,

00:01:01.168 --> 00:01:03.233
if I were to say the probability,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.168
the probability ...

00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:06.566
It's the exact same logic

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.066
of exactly ...

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.300
Exactly ...

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.433
Now let's say k ...

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.033
Let me do this in a color,
an interesting color.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.000
So let me do it in this
orangeish-brown color.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.367
K shots,

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:23.300
or exactly k scores ...

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.133
I'll call making a free throw a score.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.733
We'll just assume you got a point for it.

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.133
So exactly two k scores ...

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:35.833
in n attempts ...

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.801
Let's just say in n attempts.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.135
In n, and let me go back
to that green color.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.267
N attempts ...

00:01:45.574 --> 00:01:47.975
N attempts

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:51.368
is going to be equal to ...

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.533
Well, how many ways can
you pick k things out of n,

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:56.933
or n choose k?

00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.366
N choose k ...

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.768
N choose k.

00:02:04.617 --> 00:02:06.200
Actually, let's just
generalize it even more.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.533
Let's just say that you have,

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:09.966
your free throw probability is p.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.500
So let's say p is ...

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.770
So for this situation right over here,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.233
since we generalized it fully,

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:20.633
let's say that p is the
probability of making a free throw.

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:21.933
Actually, since I already have a p here,

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:25.466
let me just say f is
equal to the probability

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:28.033
of making

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:30.733
a free throw.

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.666
Or you could say, your
probability of scoring,

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:34.966
if you call a score making a free throw.

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:37.167
So if f is your probability
of making a free throw ...

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:38.866
So if you want n scores,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.333
then this is going to be ...

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:42.433
This is going to be ...

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:45.499
Well, it's going to be f to the n power,

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.133
and then you're going to have ...

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.000
and then you're going to
miss the remainder ...

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.766
Sorry, f to the k power,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.233
because you're making exactly k scores.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.333
So f to the k power,

00:02:57.602 --> 00:02:58.933
and then the remainder,

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:00.900
so the n minus k attempts,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.066
you're going to miss it.

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:04.333
It's going to be that
probability of missing,

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:07.433
and the probability of missing
is going to be one minus f,

00:03:07.868 --> 00:03:08.824
so it's going to be

00:03:09.347 --> 00:03:12.700
times one minus f

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:15.967
to the n minus k power.

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:20.333
To the n minus k power.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.400
And just, if you like, or I encourage you,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.200
pause the video

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.866
and just make sure you
understand the parallels

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:28.411
between this example where I had ...

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.633
f was 70%, our f was 70%.

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:33.800
One minus f ...

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.366
Or f was .7 and one minus f would be .3,

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:38.601
and we were seeing,

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:42.167
how do we get two scores in six attempts?

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:44.868
And here we're saying,
k scores in n attempts.

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:47.767
This is just a general
way to think about it.

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:52.201
The whole reason why I'm
setting this up this way is,

00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:53.901
it's interesting to now think

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:56.066
about the probability distribution

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:58.900
for a random variable that's defined

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.533
by the number of scores
in your n attempts,

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.667
or the number of scores
in your six attempts.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.963
And actually, since I've
been pushing the limit,

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:09.533
or I've been doing longer
videos than I intend to,

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:11.366
I will do that in the next video.
