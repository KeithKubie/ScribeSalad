well I've been traveling around the
 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.980
well I've been traveling around the
world looking at some of the more

world looking at some of the more
 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.380
world looking at some of the more
extraordinary ants and I'm often asked

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390
extraordinary ants and I'm often asked
 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.970
extraordinary ants and I'm often asked
about the parallels between ants and

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
about the parallels between ants and
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.250
about the parallels between ants and
humans are there any well it turns out

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
humans are there any well it turns out
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.580
humans are there any well it turns out
there are a reason that is so is that

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
there are a reason that is so is that
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.919
there are a reason that is so is that
ants like humans can have societies in

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
ants like humans can have societies in
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.700
ants like humans can have societies in
the millions

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
the millions
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.250

that's far larger even than a bumblebee

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
that's far larger even than a bumblebee
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.210

ant colony like a human society depends
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.099
ant colony like a human society depends
on its size I've found so the amount of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
on its size I've found so the amount of
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.320
on its size I've found so the amount of
information flowing through the colony

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330
information flowing through the colony
 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.139
information flowing through the colony
the communications the control of the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
the communications the control of the
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.110

self-reliance declines as colonies get

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
self-reliance declines as colonies get
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830
self-reliance declines as colonies get
bigger and more division of labor occurs

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
bigger and more division of labor occurs
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840
bigger and more division of labor occurs
there can be teams and assembly lines

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
there can be teams and assembly lines
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.270
there can be teams and assembly lines
that form in bigger societies there's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
that form in bigger societies there's
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549

transit emerge and large ant societies

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
transit emerge and large ant societies
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.920
transit emerge and large ant societies
even features of the market economy come

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
even features of the market economy come
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.779
even features of the market economy come
out in the larger ant societies one

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
out in the larger ant societies one

thing that's unique between humans and
 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.160
thing that's unique between humans and
ants is a capacity for warfare which

ants is a capacity for warfare which
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.549
ants is a capacity for warfare which
emerges in the large societies of ants

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
emerges in the large societies of ants
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.250
emerges in the large societies of ants
so there's more risk-taking in general

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
so there's more risk-taking in general
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.160
so there's more risk-taking in general
as societies get bigger so I've gone

mentioned but some of the really cool

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
mentioned but some of the really cool
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.219

bigger things seem to accelerate and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
bigger things seem to accelerate and
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.280
bigger things seem to accelerate and
turns out ants show the same patterns so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
turns out ants show the same patterns so
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.630
turns out ants show the same patterns so
I've been around the world looking and

Ecuador looking for the more obscure
ants and this requires that they be very

get bigger why is that well you have

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960
get bigger why is that well you have
 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.260

are individuals flowing past each other
 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.290
are individuals flowing past each other
all the time and they actually are

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300
all the time and they actually are
 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.720
all the time and they actually are
taking in information about what all the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730
taking in information about what all the
 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.390
taking in information about what all the
other ants are doing as they pass by so

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400
other ants are doing as they pass by so
 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.280
other ants are doing as they pass by so
an ant might discover that a lot of

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290
an ant might discover that a lot of
 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.199

workers are out there collecting food

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209
workers are out there collecting food
 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.440
workers are out there collecting food
and maybe not enough or taking out the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450
and maybe not enough or taking out the
 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.360
and maybe not enough or taking out the
trash and so it may decide what to do
