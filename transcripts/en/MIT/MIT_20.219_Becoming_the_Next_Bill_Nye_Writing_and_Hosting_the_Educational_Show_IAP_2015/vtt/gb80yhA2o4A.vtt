YULIYA KLOCHAN: I'm
doing very well.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.800
I'm very excited.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.000
INTERVIEWER: Are you
excited, nervous?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.625
YULIYA KLOCHAN: Yeah,
I'm very excited.

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:12.420
It's my first red
carpet premier,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.690
which is what I think it is.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.889
INTERVIEWER: What was the
hardest thing about this class?

00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:20.680
YULIYA KLOCHAN: The
beginning was difficult

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.520
because there was a lot
of work you had to do,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.360
and for me it kind of made
me realize what I know

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.050
and don't know.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.880
So just getting rid of
all the misconceptions

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.050
I had about filmmaking,
script writing,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.066
and all else was difficult.

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.586
INTERVIEWER: Do you feel like
you want to keep doing this,

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:45.693
or are you going to try to
take the things in the class

00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:47.492
and apply it to non-video stuff?

00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:49.200
YULIYA KLOCHAN: I'm
definitely interested

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.240
in educational resources.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.040
So video, I think, is
one of the best mediums

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.185
to convey excitement about
science and mathematics.

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:02.721
So this is definitely something
that will be important in life.

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.709
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:15.945
[LAUGHTER] How would
you describe this class

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:18.650
to someone who's
never taken it before?

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.030
YULIYA KLOCHAN: You
have a month to learn

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.840
how to make an
educational video,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.450
and then you get to write,
produce, direct, and create it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.125
all.

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:32.025
INTERVIEWER: Any words
of advice for people

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.867
who have never done it before?

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:36.950
YULIYA KLOCHAN: Don't think
it's going to be easy.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.460
Just always think
that it's going

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.970
to be harder than you expected.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.670
And put work into it.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.170
INTERVIEWER: Thank
you very much.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.720
YULIYA KLOCHAN: Thank you.
