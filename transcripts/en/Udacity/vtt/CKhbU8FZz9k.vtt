Let’s begin to answer this question, “What is motion?”

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, let’s say motion is changing position.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If something’s position or location is staying the same, well, it’s not moving.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, position is an important concept, important enough to be written in red.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Actually, it’s not just position that’s important, it is this idea of changing position

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which actually leads us to the next concept, velocity or speed,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which measures how quickly an object’s position changes over time.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, for example, let’s say we have two objects, A and B, and this one’s position changes

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
from here to here and object B’s position changes from here to here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I want to know which object move faster.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Was it object A, object B, or can we not tell from the information I’ve given you?

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Think about this one, it may not be as obvious as it seems at first.
