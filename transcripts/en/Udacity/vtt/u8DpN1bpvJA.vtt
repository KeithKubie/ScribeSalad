00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.145
When we multiply two number together and get zero, then we know that one of the

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:09.832
numbers, a or b, must equal zero. This is called the Zero-Product Property.

00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:13.686
Let's use that knowledge and try and answer this question. What would the

00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:18.814
product be of all of these binomials? And if all these variables are confusing

00:00:18.814 --> 00:00:23.463
to you, just remember that all of these are numbers. Write your answer here.
