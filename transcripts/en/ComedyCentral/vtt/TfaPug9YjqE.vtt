00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.930
Well, Pete, you just recently
moved to Los Angeles

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.120
after living in New York
for a bazillion years.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.190
For 12 years and all my New York
friends are like,

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.420
"Doesn't L.A. suck?"

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.220
And I'm like, no, it's the best.
It's-

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.630
Yeah, you're loving it.
It's so nice.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.830
New York is a great place
to live

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.070
if you wanna
get better at comedy,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.350
but L.A. is a great place
to live

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.050
if you wanna
get worse at comedy.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.040
Guys, can we just get back
to talking about dicks

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.450

Let's talk about them.
Jimmy Carr is here.

You've already
heard him already.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.320
So, Nikki, surrounded
by four men.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.000
This feels like a night out
for you, doesn't it? Come.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.890
This is so exciting for me.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.880
I love this crew in here.
Jimmy Carr is here.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.610
Let's see if I'm funny

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.040
before anyone's thinking
about buying a ticket.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.240
You're the funniest.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.560
How have you been?
What are you talking about?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.770
And you know that you are.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.220
Jimmy, how you doing
this morning with your honey?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.570
I got drunk last night.
I found a bar in New York.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.280
Well, my friend found a bar.
Where you can still smoke.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.620
What?

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.420
There's a bar in New York,
it's called Hudson and Books.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.340
Is it Hudson and Books?
Let me look it up. At the -

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.820
Are they not going to
be excited

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.040
that you're saying
this out loud?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.290
Like are they
going to be busted?

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.500
Going to get raided?

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.530
There are two licenses
in New York for bars

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.840
that were cigar bars
originally,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.490
and they couldn't take
the licenses away

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.730
when they changed the law.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.750
And there very small little
places, but it alarmingly funny.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.190
It's almost like
owning a time machine.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.830
I walked in there at like,
whatever it was.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.220
It was late.
A plane.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.500
Or a what?
Or a plane.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.000
That's the funny part is like
wow, that's so quaint and new.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.920
It's like that's
every bar in Oklahoma.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.460
Oh, yeah that's a good point.
Yeah.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.230
It's middle America cosplay.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.490
Can you still smoke in Oklahoma?

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.860
There's definitely
certain states

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.130
where there's indoor smoking.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.410
Missouri.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.740
There's a lot of states
where they'll just eat the fines

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.130
because people won't go to
their bar if they can't smoke.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.990
Like, in Indiana there's bars
where people do that.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.380
I don't know whether to believe
you

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.480
because you have
wolves on your shirt.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.630
Believe me more then. You think
I don't know about Indiana?

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.760
I would normally be giving you
spare change.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.450
So you went to this bar
last night...?

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.680
Yeah, I went to a bar.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.990
Like, late night?

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.640
I've got a friend
that was filming a thing.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.090
I was filming a thing.
So we went drinking-

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.540
Who is your famous friend?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.230
Russell Crowe. We went drinking.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.990
Oh, I had a feeling it was
something like that.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.200
Yeah, it was fun though.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.400
Cool.
Pretty fun night.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.490
So we drank some very good
whiskey and tequila

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.320
and I feel a bit,
little bit...

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.580
I can't believe you're here.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.710
I imagine you only smoke
out of a pipe.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.480
Oh yeah. 100%. 100%.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.760
Like a chimney sweet.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.970
Yeah.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.680
Wait, a second.
You were out until how late?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.910
4 in the morning?

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.040
3 now. We're open till 3.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.330
Oh my god.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.680
I like a late night drink.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.010
I don't drink much.
I don't want to drink...

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.230
I don't want to get
kind of blackout.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.480
What does that mean
you don't drink much?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.730
How often do you drink?

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.930
Cause your tee-total now, right?

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.150
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.160
I gave up drinking for about
12 or 13 years.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.410
Shut up.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.210
Actually when I started
doing comedy.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.150
So I used to drink
at college quite a lot.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.680
And I was drinking afterwards,
but I wasn't happy.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.110
I think drinking when
you're not happy is the worst.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.750
And then I just started
doing comedy,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.780
and I just really
want to do this.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.660
And I kind of thought
I'd come to a light.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.120
I was about 26
when I started doing comedy,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.820
and I went, oh I better
really focus on this.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.220
And it was enough fun that
I didn't need anything else.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.210
And then when comedy started
not being fun anymore,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.560
you're like,
[inaudible] back into this.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.960
I kind of just thought,
I've done alright. I'll be okay.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.980
I love that.
I'm coming up on seven years,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.900
December 9
of not drinking alcohol.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.420
So what was the thing?
What was the low point?

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.450
I felt the same way.
I wasn't happy.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.370
I saw everyone's careers
that I wanted around me

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.410
who were successful people
in comedy and I realized,

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.950
oh they all don't have
a drinking problem.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.130
Either they don't drink
because they did have a problem.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.640
Or they just don't
drink that much

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.970
and it's not something
that interferes

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.210
with their live
every single night.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.440
And so...

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.710
Were you drinking
every single night?

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.770
Kinda! Yeah because I could.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.460
I'd at least have
a couple drinks

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.900
because you just can,
and I was out every night.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.190
It's a weird thing, as well.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.090
It took me years
to kind of like...

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.760
sort of, when I started
drinking again

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.230
you kind of go to a comedy club
and do a set.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.350
And then you kind of never
have to buy another drink.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.800
You never. That's the thing,
it's free.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.390
It's a weird thing when you go
no money is changing hands.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.730
And there's something
about me that's going,

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.040
well this is good, isn't it?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.280
It's awesome.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.550
Think of all the money you lost

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.930
not getting free drinks
for those years.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.570
Ahh.
Whoa.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.740
If you don't drink, they should
just hand you money.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.510
Like extra money.
Somebody had a joke about that.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.730
That's amazing.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.170
Every time you go to the bar,
every couple...

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.400
they hand me seven dollars.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.980
After not, when you're not
drinking as a single woman

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.560
and guys are like,
can I buy you a drink.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.230
I'm always like, no.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.550
Give me like a Starbucks
gift card.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.490
Something? Seven dollars.
That would get me two coffees

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.210
that I would really
enjoy down the road.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.440
A cup of soup?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.890
That's bad though
because after a couple of drinks

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.120
you can sleep with a guy.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.790
But if we gives you $14
you really feel like a budget

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.990
[inaudible].

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.840
I would love that.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.230
Nicky Glazer,
budget [inaudible].

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.400
That could be the new
special title right now.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.870
I'm, listen,
I'm workshopping some.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.340
Thank you.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.130
So yeah, it was just,
I got to that point.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.930
But let me ask you.
What was the point where you go,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.270
I'm going to have that
first drink after 13...

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.590
12 or 13 years?

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.930
I built a house. I built a house
in London where I live.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.930
And we put a bar in it,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.660
and so I had a bar
and I thought, this is mental.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.100
I'm going to have a drink.
And I kind of had a thing where,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.540
the last couple years
of not drinking,

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.900
I would have like
a Guinness at Christmas.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.060
Like at the end of the last gig,
I'd have like a Guinness.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.380
I quite like it. Quite like
just having that one drink.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.730
Kind of slightly
fetishistically.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.940
Not getting drunk,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.360
but just having one drink
is like a lovely thing.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.590
Edgy.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.800
What a relatable story,
by the way.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.660
I'm starting to have...
wow, I'm a very wealthy man.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.840
I'm starting to ...
very wealthy.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.080
I'm starting to experiment
with drugs now.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.240
Like in my mid-forties,
I'm starting to go,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.730
oh, actually
I'm terrible at relaxing.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.260
I've got not capacity
to sit home and do nothing.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.070
So I'm just starting
to kind of use marijuana

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.710
now for the first time.
I love it.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.430
It's great.
It's terrific.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.440
It's a very interesting thing
if you've never done drugs.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.980
I've always been
sort of quite anti.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.260
Edibles? Do you do edibles?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.120
Yeah, I can't really smoke.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.310
I feel like I'm in
an Oscar Wilde play.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.240
I feel like there's something
about me with a cigarette.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.110
Oh, hello.
[inaudible] fancy here.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.840
I think you would look cool
with a joint. I don't like...

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.610
If you think I'd look cool,
you need to get laid.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.620
[crosstalk]
You're not wrong.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.950
That's a red flag.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.180
You're not wrong.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.880
When did you last get ...
get ...

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.410
Get stuffed? Um ...

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.980
When did you last get...
Get Stuffed With Nikki Glaser

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.370
is another great title
for a show.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.850
I love to get cummed in.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.150
I know. I did say
that earlier today.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.620
It was a ...

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.919
Well, we've got a finale
for the show, fellas.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.750
It was, what morning?

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.040
It was Wednesday night.
A week ago.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.240
Well, that's all from us.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.730
We're just going to
watch it dribble out.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.000
One week ago.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.570
One week ago?
One week ago.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.270
One week ago.
Okay.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.590
Is that when I went to LA?
I don't even remember.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.860
Yeah, no Tuesday night.
Yeah, it was Tuesday night.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.060
A Tuesday night.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.290
Yes, it was a Tuesday night.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.889
Well, we all know the best sex
is Tuesday night sex.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.590
And how are the tacos?
Did it sit well?

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.939
Did you have the tacos first?
The Taco Tuesday?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.520
Oh. It was late...

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.780
Did you fuck a Mexican dude

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.330
just because you thought,
it's Tuesday?

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.840
There's so many things
that you're hitting on

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.540
that I want to talk about.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.130
I had gotten into town
really late at night,

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.720
and I just climbed into bed

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.160
and we just banged it out
real quick.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.480
It was just a quick
one-and-done.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.040
I didn't even think,
I was really going to ...

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.990
I was like not
in the mood, really,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.690
and then it was one of
those ones that it was like,

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.630
I didn't know
I was in the mood so much.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.280
I think if I guy's not on
the mood, that's a problem.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.030
I believe thumbing in a softie
is the expression.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.410
It's like trying to play pool
with a bit of rope.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.970
If you're picking a lock with
a marshmallow, that's an issue.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.190
But if a lady's not in the mood,
you can just use,

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.450
I believe they call it
Australian charm, don't they?

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.910
Or saliva.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.190
Yeah, Australian charm.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.370
Oh, okay. Yes, exactly.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.230
It's that easy, isn't it?

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.560
But that's the thing,
I thought going into it

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.490
because I hadn't seen this guy
in a while, and I was like,

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.020
I'm really really tired
and like not into it -

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.300
I never get

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.849
[inaudible] twice.
I'm amazed you'd seen it before.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.940
I'm assuming she fucked her
Uber driver.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.320
You ever fucked
an Uber driver?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.520
Um, no.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.740
The fact you're having to think
about it

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.940
tells me every thing
I need to know.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.200
Well, I was just thinking
have I ever had sex

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.380
with someone who has driven for
Uber but not my Uber driver.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.770
But not like,
you haven't met a guy ...

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.050
that would be fun.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.770
No, no, Jimmy. I think you think
of me in a different way.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.020
you know what that is?
That's the sixth star.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.180
That's how they refer to it.
Oh, she gave me the sixth star.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.459
Yeah, so it was
just one of those...

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.730
I told him afterwards, I didn't
know how much I needed...

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.200
It was like he found
a pressure point

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.160
and just like dug into
with his elbow.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.060
It's one of those massages that
was just like, oh Jesus Christ.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.030
Like, I didn't know
that it hurt.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.850
It hurt good. I don't know
what I'm trying to say here.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.130
It hurt good?

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.600
Wait, this is a sex thing?

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.400
I think she's trying to write
a Madonna song from the 80s.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.630
I had sex and it felt...

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.490
I think she's trying to rewrite
Like a Virgin live.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.640
Like I was overly
sensitive to it.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.820
Where I was just like,
whoa I didn't see that coming

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.610
and I was just like,
it was so quick like I didn't...

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.820
You didn't see it coming?

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.040
I didn't see it coming.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.450
Well, you like to be
cummed in, so...

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.940
I didn't see... yeah, exactly.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.970
They had a cervical camera
so she could watch it later.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.020
And he didn't - we were
not doing cumming in

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.350
because I'm not on the pill,

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.730
so it's always got to be out
and it's no unsatisfying.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.000
We were talking
about that before.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.790
You guys had been
pulling it out?

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.470
He pulled it out, yep.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.020
Sorry, you're having
unprotected sex.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.310
Yep.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.540
And he's just pulling out?

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.870
Yep.
Because you're on the pill.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.930
Oh, you know, like have you
ever seen the Teenage Mom show?

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.620
Listen ...

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.500
Do not take any sexual advice
from this lady.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.980
That's crazy.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.560
We've used the pull-out method
only for years now, and ...

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.950
Pre-cum is really, Nikki Glaser.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.710
I know, but I'm probably barren
is what I'm thinking

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.990
because I've never had a scare.
Never anything.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.960
Like, I'm not ...
never been pregnant,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.840
and I've been having risky...

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.430
The pull-out method
is not good to do.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.630
Let me see it.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:22.420
Let me just do a quick exam.
I've never been pregnant.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.490
I've had things where
I thought I was pregnant,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.750
but I've always just known,
you're not pregnant, bitch.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.100
You're just late because you've
been eating weird or whatever.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.720
I think you should start
a family.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.020
Yeah, I'm going to go there.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.350
I think you should start
a family right now.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.820
No interest.
I would be a great mom.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.660
Oh, I didn't think so, but ...

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.820
No, I just think you're running
out of things

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.160
to talk about
in your comedy specials.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.430
I think you should
have a family.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.630
You think you'd be a great-

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.910
That is not wrong.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.130
You think you'd be a great mum?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.330
Oh yeah.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.600
I think I know someone who is
going to start drinking again.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.810
That's the thing.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.830
Mommy needs a livener.
Get Mommy's special juice.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.760
Get Mommy's special juice.
You have to Uber to school.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.860
Jimmy.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.290
That Uber driver's cute.
Tell him I like him.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.490
Jimmy. When you started drinking
again, how quickly did it...

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.870
You've had to have some night
where you're like, oh god.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.810
What did I do?
All those things that...

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.800
I've quit drinking
because I hate those nights.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.670
I hate nights
where I blacked out.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.230
Where I can't really
piece together.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.590
I've sent texts I don't want.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.440
I've written tweets
I don't care for.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.390
And I just have
that anxiety...

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.890
The hangover's terrible.
Is the hangover ...?

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.110
I occasionally get
the beer fear.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.970
I occasionally get
the kind of thing

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.570
the next morning of going,
oh, I'm the worst.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.520
But I tend to just get
that a lot from travel.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.270
I get that more from traveling
than I do from drinking.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.530
It's exacerbated
maybe slightly from drink.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.890
But actually,
I just get the fears

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.210
sometimes when I'd be traveling.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.780
I've done about
40 countries this year

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.310
and I find if I get
my circadian rhythms about,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.010
I get depressed.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.480
And the drinking is like,
you maybe have a drink

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.380
to take the edge off
trying to get to sleep.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.160
And then that's more the thing,
rather than the...

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.420
because you still get
the everyone hates me thing now,

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.330
I imagine?

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.180
Have you listened back
to the show?

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:17.660
Have you not been on Twitter?
Come on, Nikki... Come on.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.160
But no, I sometimes
get that thing,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.520
and I think it's
unrelated to drinking.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.750
I think that hangover
thing of like,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.950
I don't mind having a hangover

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.670
and feeling a bit
dehydrated or whatever.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.150
Not a biggie.
I'll deal with that.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.810
But that kind of depression
the next day, thinking,

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.510
oh my god.
The anxiety thing.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.080
I suffer more with anxiety
now than I ever have.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.400
I think it's kind
of travel-wise.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.010
I think it's all to do with ...
I think you're right.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.640
And that's why I'm kind of
interested in marijuana

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.290
for that deeper sleep.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.020
Not really to get high.
I just want to sleep.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.220
They actually say that..

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.460
That's why I take it.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.750
It's bad.
It's worse for your sleep.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.330
They say that it messes up
your REM sleep.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.370
I took 10 milligrams last night

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.260
and woke up just glued
to the bed.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.450
I slept eight hours,
but it felt like three.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.610
I can't get up.
That's why I don't do it.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.080
I can't smoke before I go to bed

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.550
because the smoking high
only lasts

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.349
for three or four hours,
and then I wake up like, ahhhh.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.920
Edible keeps me asleep
the whole night,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.360
but then it's not good sleep.
I'm bad at sleeping.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.710
That's another reason
I can't drink.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.940
Do you do melatonin?

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.160
A little bit.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.670
I've started doing a little bit
of melatonin.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.060
Melatonin is the best.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.060
Yeah, two milligrams a day,
every day.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.300
It's really great.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.600
Two? Wow I do 10.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.730
No, my girlfriend was doing
like 80 milligrams at a day.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.010
They were 10 milligram pills
and she would just, gulp.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.470
And she learned
apparently there is a curve,

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.530
an effectiveness curve that
she was overshooting by a mile.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.730
So now she's back down
to like less than 10.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.040
But I did a thing
in Australia this year

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.750
where I flew to Australia
twice in January,

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.540
which is from London
a bold

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.930
[inaudible]
flight.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.780
So got there,
and went, right, sleep.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.380
I'll take some Valium.
So, I was given some Valium.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.580
Took some Valium

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.650
and then I basically
had nothing left in my system.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.350
I didn't realize it strips
all the serotonin from you.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.630
So I took all this stuff
on the jet lag as well,

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.920
and was kind of
wandering Australia

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.210
as well going,
I think...

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.420
I'll kill myself.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.240
Yeah, we're all going to die,
aren't we?

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.990
Australia is bleak.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.889
Which way does London
go to Australia?

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.230
It's direct? Does it go over
one of the poles or something?

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.600
No, there is one direct flight
into Perth,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.850
but then the downside
is you arrive in Perth.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.380
Burn on wherever Perth.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.080
Yeah, get fucked, Perth.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.480
God bless you American
and you're lack of ...

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.389
Tim Minchin's from Perth.
There's good people from Perth.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.030
So it's kind of a, you fly,

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.300
maybe Hong Kong or Singapore
on the way.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.120
But I think you're right.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.490
Like, all these things
we attribute

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.900
to that's why I feel bad.
It's really...

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.670
the drinking
is messing up your sleep,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.510
and the sleep is what's
really causing you to be...

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.640
the lack of sleep
or the circadian rhythms

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.040
being all messed up
is what causes it.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.370
Well, it's an interesting thing
is that with something like AA

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.230
where people deal
with the drinking problem

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.780
rather than what's
causing them to drink.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.560
Like, actually good therapy
and I think a lot of this stuff

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.230
with like you know DMT
and people doing Iowaska

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.490
or whatever to kind of push
through whatever that thing

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.720
is that's making...

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.660
you know, and there's two very
different types of drinking.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.460
There's problem-drinking,
and there's just - hey, listen.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.810
I went out for a drink
with some friends

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.680
and we had a lot of fun.
It was great.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.660
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.530
I mean, people drink
because they're sad

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.230
and they want to numb out.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.380
That's when you have
a drinking problem,

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.000
and that's the same way
I eat sometimes.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.970
Like, last night I just got home
and I was like,

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.550
I'm feeling things
I don't want to feel.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.500
And I'm just going to stuff
my face until I feel sick.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.700
And it's...

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.310
I'm doing the same thing
that I used to do with drinking.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.930
And part of me is like,
why don't I just get drunk?

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.230
What's your go-to food?

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.450
I eat really healthy stuff

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.430
because I just want to eat
everything and eat...

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.330
I want an excuse to be able to
eat forever and ever and ever,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.840
and so I'll just eat
like veggies and hummus.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.050
She's vegan.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.250
And so, I'll...

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.520
Oh, have you been
to the Butcher's Daughter?

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.720
That place in New York.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.700
They've got a couple
of locations.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.470
Are you making a joke?
Is that vegan?

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.900
No, no, it's vegan, right?
It's vegan.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.310
I thought he was going to fuck
with you.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.160
No, game-changingly good
vegan food.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.510
I went there once.
It was very good.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.720
I'm vegan most of the time.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.550
Yeah, it's the way to be.
For sure.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.470
But it's ... yeah, I binge
on like really healthy stuff.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.160
But I will make myself sick.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.390
People go,
all you eat is salads.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.430
I go, you don't understand
the amounts I can put away.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.020
And when I'm going on,
an emotional binge...

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.770
I feel like I'm talking
to a crazy person now.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.670
The idea that
you're binging on salad.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.770
I mean... that's not a thing.
That's not comfort eating.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.350
It really is. I love salad.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.400
I crave it.
I love healthy foods,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.450
and I eat disgusting amounts
of them where you'd be-

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.440
I'll eat... I'll literally
eat 3000 calories of a salad.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.840
This is, no. Whoa, whoa,
whoa time out.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.050
Comfort eating is ...

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.280
That's insane.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.180
So I can eat for hours. Hours!

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.810
Whereas someone
who's eating a cake

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.110
can only eat that cake
for 15 minutes.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.710
However long it takes you
to stuff a cake in your face.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.290
I can have the same
amount of calories

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:54.020
that that cake is over hours
and I can eat the whole time.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.590
Because then I prolong...
it's like, I used to drink.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.420
I used to drink vodka sodas

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.660
and I would do
a little bit of vodka

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.060
and a ton of soda
so I could just chug and chug.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.390
And consume volume
without having the ...

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.460
without blacking out too fast.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.700
You need vodka lettuce.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.960
I love that people wake up
from food benders.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.950
I think all of this relates
to the size

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.710
of her father's penis
is my take.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:17.980
It probably does.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.180
It's all about volume.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.380
Oh my god.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.020
But the idea of your bender
being that.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.770
Like most people go on a bender
and they wake up

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.230
with like a stomach
ache from all the sugar

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.500
or bloated from all the salt.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.730
And you wake up the next day
and take the most perfect shit.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.920
A perfect cylinder
with flat ends.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.910
I do. I do. I mean...

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.610
Just a tube of play-doh.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.860
I went to bed last night
so sick.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.560
Oh, man.
I woke up a six pack.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.130
Oh, I'm so fucking ripped.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.300
I have 100%
a binge eating disorder.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.540
Like, 100% but it would
never ring any alarms

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.720
because I binge eat
healthy food.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.230
So, no one's ...
everyone's always like,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.010
oh, Nicky and all of her salads.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.950
And it's like,
I'm crying for help.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.200
But it's...

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.530
What were you suppressing
last night?

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:03.730
Can we talk about that?

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.580
I was suppressing the fact
that the guy I'm seeing

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:12.370
hasn't been as communicate
with me as I want him to be.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.980
I was suppressing that I
performed a song last night,

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.960
and I didn't nail it
the way I wanted it to.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.580
I was suppressing the fact
that I have to make-

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You performed a song?

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.060
God Damn?

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.670
Yeah, the Goddamn Comedy Jam.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:23.930
What song did you do?

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.570
Blank Space, Taylor Swift.
Yeah, it was really fun.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.830
Really, you covered
Taylor Swift?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.140
Yeah, we did like
a rock version of it.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.940
It was awesome.
It was really fun. I was...

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.200
I mean...

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.760
The fact that I wasn't
going to get enough sleep

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.360
because I wanted to eat a lot,
and then if I went home

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.390
and went to eat a lot,
I still gotta be up for radio.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.050
So I was kind of stressed
about not getting enough sleep.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.880
And then today,
I have a meeting after this.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.150
And then I have
another thing later,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.570
and I have to go
to Mike Birbiglia's show

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.050
which I'm excited about
but I'm also like

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.420
it's just another thing
I have to dress up for.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.640
I'm seeing it Thursday.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.240
And like look good, and I'm
going to the Comedy Cellar,

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.640
and I have to-
I'm suppressing all of that.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.840
You have to dress up
for Mike Birbiglia's show?

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.150
Yeah, it's a Broadway show.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.900
I'm going to take
a fucking picture.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.290
He's not even dressing up
for it.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.520
I know, that's the ironic...

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.150
He's a married man with a child.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.140
I'm not dressing up so Mike
Birbiglia's like,

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.370
wow, Nikki looks...

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.560
it's like I'm going to take a
picture and post it on Instagram

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.160
because that's why
he's giving away free tickets

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.270
to all his friends anyways,
so that we all promote

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.950
and so that I can talk about
how amazing it is.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.400
So I want to look cute
for that picture.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.700
Then I have to go
right to the cellar

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.900
and do the Comedy Central

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.970
taping that they don't provide
hair and makeup for.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.700
So I gotta do that.
And then I have to make sure...

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.820
There's just so many things that
I'm juggling that I just eat,

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.670
so I don't have
to think about them.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.910
But I'm going to
get it all done.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.970
I'm going to say.
No one else is going to say it.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.550
I think you should
get back on the booze.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.750
I know, right?

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.990
You never hear anyone say that.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.460
And sometimes you just go,
lean into that.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.050
Have a drink.
Take the edge off.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.770
I think I could, and I think
I will some day, but ...

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.370
Come on. Have a drink.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.240
I just think all of my
sober friends

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.970
will be very disappointed
in me,

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.000
and that's kind of
what keeps me doing it.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.230
I've got a lot of friends in AA.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.930
And how sad were they for you?

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.840
I was never in...

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.430
I never really had
a problem big enough.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.180
My thing was just,
I just stopped.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.070
It wasn't a big... I didn't
have a drinking problem.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.300
I just happened to not drink
for 12 years.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.890
It sounds like more of an issue
but then is,

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.220
and I drink a little bit now
but not much.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.010
I think I might give it up again
just to lose weight.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.240
Right, yeah.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.310
Is that what helped you in
the first place losing weight?

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.010
No, I stopped eating after 6.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.390
I did 8 for a while
and that was hard.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.680
Shit, we got to go, guys.
The show's over.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.190
How did this show fly
by so fast?

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.240
Jimmy Carr, thank you
so much for being here.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.330
You're so fun
and exhausting.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.430
And Matthew Broussard,
thank you for being here.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:41.060
That's his name. I knew it.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.830
I was going to say,
the guy from Scooby Doo.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:49.780
Oh, my god.
