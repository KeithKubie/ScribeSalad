00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.709
200 years ago, it took 12 days to deliver
a message from New York City to London. 150

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:09.950
years ago the first transatlantic cable transmission
was sent from the Queen of England to the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.030
US President, taking 17 hours. 85 years ago,
telephones became common household fixtures

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.960
and 30 years ago the first cell phone was
invented, which weighed as much as an iron,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.070
took 10 hours to charge for a 35 minute conversation,
and cost almost $4000. 20 years ago, the first

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.380
text message was sent - a simple ‘Merry
Christmas” - and today more people have

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.360
mobile phones than toilets, with around 23
billion text messages being sent per day.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.820
But how the hell do text messages even work?

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.500
When you tune a radio to a station, you pick
up the information that is being sent out

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.570
via electromagnetic waves at a particular
frequency - in this case they are radio waves.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.620
These waves mostly just pass through our bodies
without interacting at all, but are on the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.570
same spectrum as the visible light we see,
just different in size. Photons with wavelengths

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.720
between 400-700 nanometers have the perfect
level of energy to excite the rods and cones

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.680
in your eyes, which then transmit signals
to your brain that you interpret as different

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.220
colours. But radio waves, which have wavelengths
ranging from 100 microns to 100 kilometers,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.820
are much lower energy and can’t excite your
eyes - so they are invisible to us.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.079
Similar to a radio, your cell phone receives
signals at specific frequencies, but it can

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.720
also transmit its own radio waves back to
a network at the same time. The network is

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.049
a system of towers, antennas and transmitters
which divide a geographical area into ‘cells’

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.119
- hence the term ‘cell phone’. These cells
determine which areas are served by which

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.619
towers, though they generally overlap so that
your phone always has a tower to communicate

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.619
with.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.150
Feel like your phone battery is losing power
faster than normal? Phones transmit at higher

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.560
levels indoors due to building materials,
in rural areas due to greater distance to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.850
the network antennas and when moving at high
speeds, like in a car, due to the frequent

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.939
handover between network antennas.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.909
When someone sends you a text, their phone
transmits radio signals, which convey the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.689
identity of both their phone and yours, along
with the content of the message. These signals

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.440
are then picked up by the tower closest to
them, which converts the radio waves into

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.170
a digital electrical impulse and passes it
along to a hub of the network called a mobile

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.950
switching center. If you’re out of range,
or your phone is off, the message is stored

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.290
by the mobile switching center for a short
time until you can be located by the network.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.990
The network then figures out which tower you
are closest to and passes the signal there.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.570
Once at the tower nearest you, it’s converted
back to a radio signal that can be picked

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.300
up by the antenna in your phone. This all
happens in SECONDS!

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.930
Interestingly, traditional SMS text traffic
actually peaked in 2011! Now, most people

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.040
send messages via internet services. In fact,
last year ‘WhatsApp’ overtook traditional

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.360
SMS as the #1 handler of text messaging, managing
30 billion messages sent each day all over

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.700
the world. And if you’re sending those messages
across the world, it’s actually sent via

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.020
a giant cable that runs across the ocean floor.
In fact 99% of all international data is sent

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.870
via undersea cables.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.620
So what does the future of messaging look
like? We’re currently in the 4th generation

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.320
of mobile communication networks, with 5G
on the horizon. And it’s actually been projected

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.930
that the technology for phones embedded in
our bodies can be available as soon as 2023.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.900
While only a few decades ago it may have taken
months to send a love letter, in just a few

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.230
years you may be able to simply think of your
loved one and send them a message to let them

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.230
know you care.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.290
We tackle humanity's new forms of communication
in The Science of Emojis over on AsapTHOUGHT,

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.680
how they’re often misinterpreted, and how
to use them properly. Check it out with the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.960
