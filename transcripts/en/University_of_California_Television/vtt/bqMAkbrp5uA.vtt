00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.996
(mid-tempo reserved music)

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.770
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.280
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.300
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.770
Our guest today is Christof Koch,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.480
who is the Lois and Victor Troendle

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.505
Professor of Cognitive and
Behavioral Biology at Caltech,

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:48.580
and the author most recently
of The Quest for Consciousness.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.240
He is on the Berkeley campus

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.730
to give the Foerster lecture
on the Immortality of the Soul.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.260
Christof, welcome to Berkeley.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.160
- Good morning, Harry.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.680
- Where were you born and raised?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.120
- In the Midwest, in Kansas
City, believe it or not.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.810
- Surprising, surprising.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.740
How did you happen to be
in America for your birth?

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.894
- I talk like our governor does.

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:09.373
- (laughs) That's right!

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.700
- My parents were diplomats

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.900
with the German state department,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.840
so they happened to be in Kansas City

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.710
because there turned out
to be lots of Germans there

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.620
who emigrated there after the war.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.453
So, I moved around.

00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:22.040
I have a French Baccalaureate,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.987
and then I lived in Morocco,

00:01:22.987 --> 00:01:25.000
and in Holland, and in Canada.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.900
- Mm hmm, so, a citizen of the world.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.640
Looking back, how do
you think your parents

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.490
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.580
- Well, since I moved every three years,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.880
I didn't have so many, you know,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.500
it's difficult to acquire
long-term friends,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.990
so I mean everything was,
we are a very tight family.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.150
So, all my intellectual upbringing,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.793
and my desires, my passions,
I have from my parents.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.543
- And when did you get the
science bug, so to speak?

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.940
What led you into science?

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.050
- Well, I mean, from eight, nine,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.100
or 10 I wanted to be a zoologist.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580
I wanted to be a zoo
director and a zoologist.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.710
And then somewhere at age 13 or 14,

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.920
I wanted to be a physicist,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.848
and then I studied physics.

00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:09.770
I guess it shows you the
importance of role models.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.830
I grew up reading books
about you know Einstein,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.993
and Heisenberg, and Planck,
and all these physicists,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.400
and that was terribly influential for me.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.260
And then when I decided upon a university,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.940
well, I never really made
a conscious decision,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.150
it was always clear I was gonna go

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.190
to a university and study physics.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.230
That's what I did.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.100
- And when one looks at your
degrees and the subject matter,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.100
you really have covered
the gambit of the sciences.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.940
You have a French baccalaureate,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.940
you studied physics and
philosophy at Tubingen in Germany,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.930
and master in physics

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.727
and a Ph.D. in nonlinear
information processing

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:53.950
in the dendritic trees
of arbitrary geometry.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.899
- That's correct.

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:59.899
- (laughs) So, science
has come to you easily?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.900
I mean there was a kind of
a natural coming together

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.970
with these different subjects,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.840
or did one set of problems lead you

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.716
to another set of problems?

00:03:08.716 --> 00:03:10.747
- Well, both, I mean I
always wanted to be a,

00:03:10.747 --> 00:03:13.110
I mean at least from a very early age on.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.350
I love science, I love the
process of doing science.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.290
If I could, I'd like to know everything

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.240
there is about the world.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.073
But of course, you have to realize

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:20.880
as you get older you have to concentrate

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.660
on one particular aspect of it.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.630
And so I chose to
concentrate on the brain,

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.930
how the brain processes information,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.370
in what way is it like a computer,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.550
in what way is it
different from a computer.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.900
And then over the last 20 years,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.700
on the problem of consciousness,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.033
possibly influenced because of
the many philosophers I read.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.340
- Now help us understand,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.614
is it fair to call you a
neurobiologist, is that?

00:03:44.614 --> 00:03:45.693
- [Christof] Yes.

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:50.000
- Yes, help us understand
the skills and temperament

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.550
required to do that kind of work,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.113
before we talk about the work.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.490
- I mean it's different
from being a physicist.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.280
So in some parts of
science, like in physics,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.940
there are a few deep principles,

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.750
like general relativity,
or like electrodynamics,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.865
and then you can use a few principles

00:04:06.865 --> 00:04:09.980
to explain a large number
of facts in the universe,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.973
like the cosmos and its evolution,

00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:14.480
and how particles move inside the cosmos,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.410
and how planets act, and
things like, and you know,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.720
why if I drop my keys,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.780
why do they fall to the floor, et cetera.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.270
Biology's a very different character.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.330
Biology, there are very
few common principles,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.813
except maybe the theory of evolution.

00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:26.310
There's a gigantic,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.920
a gargantuan number of facts

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.850
that you have to know
and have to assemble,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.730
so you really have to be
in the field a long time.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.730
So, children prodigies exist
in maybe in mathematics

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.070
or in music, or maybe in some
areas of theoretical physics,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.130
but don't exist in biology

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.590
because in biology you just have to know

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.530
a huge number of facts,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.650
which of course takes time to acquire,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.530
because you know each biological system is

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.280
sort of an accident of evolution,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.140
and to understand it,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.200
you have to understand
its unique circumstances,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.470
and how this animal's
different from this animal.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.090
And you have to just
know molecular biology,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.940
and biochemistry, and
neuroscience, and psychology,

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.970
and the theory of evolution.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.320
So, it requires a much
larger number of facts

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.590
to explain any given observation.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.920
- What about temperament?

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.130
I know at looking at your website,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.890
that you are adventuresome,

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.563
you're a mountain climber, and so on.

00:05:17.563 --> 00:05:19.730
Is that just you personally,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.730
or what about the temperament
of somebody doing this work

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.370
that brings together so many fields?

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.400
- Well, you have to love risk,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.070
which I guess is what
you have to love doing

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.620
if you like to climb rocks and mountains.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.300
And you have to be in
it for the long term.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.490
It takes a long time, you
have to be very patient,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.340
and you have to love the process.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.500
You have to love the process,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.810
because the action itself
takes place over many years.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.330
You have to fight to get
money to do the research,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.880
the research itself is very difficult,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.560
it's technically very demanding,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.280
it takes long, long hours,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.890
and then you have to
fight to get it published

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.600
and get it accepted by your peers.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.380
And so you know, this can
take five, six, seven years

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.300
for a single experiment,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.870
to run through this entire
life-cycle of one experiment.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.623
And so, you really have
to be passionate about it,

00:06:02.623 --> 00:06:05.130
and you have to be
passionate about the process,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.620
and the rewards that are
sort of very long-term,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.720
distant in the future.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.080
I mean the objective of what
it's like to get tenure,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.010
you get a good salary,

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.080
something like that.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.110
So you have to do it

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.310
because you love the act of thinking about

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.777
and trying to understand a phenomenon,

00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:21.090
trying to collect data,
and sift through the data,

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.950
and try to find, you know
sort the chaff from the wheat,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.010
and do things like that.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.430
- Mm hmm, now I know that
one of your main projects

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.220
in the last few years
is covered in this book,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.220
The Quest for Consciousness:
A Neurobiological Approach.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.550
And what I first wanna ask you is to talk

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.780
about your collaboration
with Francis Crick,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.040
because I know that the two of you working

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.460
over a number of years came to define

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.380
a kind of intellectual frame.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.790
But talk a little about
that intellectual process

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.023
between the two of you.

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:05.220
- And so Francis, has I
guess, the way he works,

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.540
he never had a lab,

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.160
he never worked with a
large number of people

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.360
at any given point in time.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.800
He worked with one or two people,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.260
most famously, of course, was Jim Watson,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.610
and then also with Sydney
Brenner, with Graeme Mitchison.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.850
And so we worked for
close to almost 20 years.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.710
When I moved from MIT to Caltech in '86

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.210
we started to interact and
we met on a monthly basis

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.390
to talk about the brain.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.920
And then in 1989,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.900
we started becoming very
intensely interested

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.850
because there was a certain
neurobiological discovery,

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.737
we became very interested in that

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:40.230
and we thought maybe this would be

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.240
one of the critical features,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.090
a signature of consciousness in the brain.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.363
And I think what Francis
appreciated about our interaction,

00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:51.850
well, the energy level,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.060
but also that you know

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.960
because he's such a well-known person,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.730
many people didn't really
criticize any of his idea,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.563
and he didn't like that.

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:02.560
He wanted to be criticized.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.863
He was prodigious at throwing out ideas.

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:08.710
Some were very smart,
some were very perceptive,

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.570
some were not so, some were just crazy,

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.100
but you know, you have
this fantastic person,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.010
this creative genius, who can
just throw out these ideas,

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.210
and he wants a sounding board to tell you,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.070
well, this isn't gonna work,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.360
this is really great but
this is totally silly,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.590
and really have a give or
take over many, many hours.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.900
I mean that was his style of working,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.739
that you came in the morning

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:32.140
and from 10 o'clock till six o'clock

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.620
you would just discuss paper.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.830
He would go through the evidence,

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.920
he would sift the data, discuss it,

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.150
look at it from different light,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.610
reject it, have a hypothesis,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.350
reject it again, then dinner,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.230
and then usually after dinner
that process would continue.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.830
He kept this up till
essentially the day he died.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.460
- Mm hmm, and what we have here is

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.800
we're on the threshold of a revolution

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.580
in the biological sciences on the question

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.340
of how the brain works

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.050
and the biological basis of consciousness.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.700
So what in a way this collaboration was

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.040
was the formation of a kind of theory

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.820
which could then be tested
by empirical research.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.020
Is that fair?

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.000
Is that a fair way to look
at the article that resulted

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.690
which I guess you published
in Science and Nature,

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.790
laying out an intellectual framework?

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.570
- Yes, it's unfortunately,
it's too ambitious

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.700
to call it a theory.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.200
It's a framework.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.033
And there's a difference.

00:09:30.033 --> 00:09:32.150
A theory is something much more solid

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.740
where you can make very
specific predictions,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.693
like the theory of relativity.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.540
This is more a framework
for approaching the problem

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.080
in a way that allows you for
a sustained research program

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.390
at the end of which you
will understand much more

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.550
about consciousness, and hopefully,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.020
that's a hope right now, a fond hope,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.870
that ultimately you will solve the problem

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.767
at the heart of the classical
conceived mind/body problem.

00:09:58.767 --> 00:10:01.110
Namely, how do feelings
get into the world?

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.470
How is it that the physical system,

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.439
like your brain or my brain,

00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:05.630
can have feelings of pain or pleasure?

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.463
Of being me?

00:10:06.463 --> 00:10:07.296
Of being angry?

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:10.473
- Mm hmm, now help us understand,

00:10:10.473 --> 00:10:12.670
I think we know what consciousness is,

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.760
or people think they do, but explain that.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.470
Now I think you refer
to Searle's definition,

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:22.470
but help us kind of
understand what the it is

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.610
that you're trying to
characterize, and then find

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.590
the sources of that in
the biology of the brain.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.230
- Yeah, John Searle you know
says that consciousness,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.740
what you have when you wake
up in the morning you have it,

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.580
you have it all day,

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.960
and then it goes away when
you go into deep sleep,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.020
and then in dreams, of
course, you also have it.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.190
So, it's the most fundamental
feature of the world.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.240
It's the way how we experience the world.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.380
When I feel pain or feel pleasure,

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.790
I see you, or I'm angry,
or I know I'm Christof,

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.170
I know I'm gonna die,

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.150
those are all conscious sensations.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.550
Philosophers have the term qualia,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.780
so consciousness is made
up these different qualia.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.490
Qualia for being angry, for seeing red,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.860
and that is fundamentally the way,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.850
how we experience the world.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.320
To experience the world
means to be conscious of it.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.770
It turns out there are many
things that I can do in my body.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.460
In fact, most of the things I do

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.240
without having any
conscious access to them.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.210
My digestive system works wonderful

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.300
without me knowing about it.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.393
There're a hundred million neurons

00:11:19.393 --> 00:11:21.940
roughly down here in your
gut, a hundred million.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.160
We're not conscious of them.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.289
When you run, when you climb,

00:11:24.289 --> 00:11:26.700
when you dance, when you drive a car,

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.310
when you bike, you're
doing things effortlessly.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.330
When you run down a mountain,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.120
you run very quickly and you have no idea

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.950
how you're doing it, you're
doing it unconsciously.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.560
When I talk, it's not
that there's a person,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.470
a Christof, in my head

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.140
who sort of puts these words together,

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.420
and then in German or English,

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.770
in the verb and the
adjective and sends it out.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.610
No, I have a vague idea
and the next thing,

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.380
I hear these words coming out of my mouth.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.870
So, we know there are many things,

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.540
in fact, the majority
of things in my brain,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.998
I don't have conscious access to.

00:11:50.998 --> 00:11:52.660
Certain things I do have
conscious access to.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.120
Where's the difference?

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.482
How is this possible?

00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:58.930
- And you actually refer to
this as kind of a zombie effect,

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.110
namely, not the consciousness,

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.620
but these things that we do automatically.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.960
- Yeah, so we have all these zombies

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.330
that we use all the time.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.600
In fact, life wouldn't be possible

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.770
without these zombie agents in our head.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.300
And so this makes you know,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.970
makes for an interesting research strategy

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.980
because I can now ask at
the neurological level,

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:16.813
at the brain level,

00:12:16.813 --> 00:12:18.100
where's the difference
between those systems

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.610
that mediate my zombie behaviors

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.250
and those systems that
actually require consciousness?

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.210
And it's a scandal, and
Francis always felt this,

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.800
it's a scandal if science
leaves out consciousness.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.090
You know it's less today,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.170
but certainly 10 or 20
years ago when we started,

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.120
many scientists, probably the majority,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.480
said, well, you know consciousness,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.980
you've got to leave that
to the religious people,

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.420
you've got to leave that
to the philosophers,

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.550
you've got to leave that to
the you know New Age cult.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.360
That's not something scientists can study.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.193
But that's silly.

00:12:42.193 --> 00:12:43.680
I mean we are conscious

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.920
and I believe it's the most
essential aspect of my life,

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.137
it's the fact that I'm a conscious being,

00:12:49.137 --> 00:12:50.053
and if I leave that out,

00:12:50.053 --> 00:12:52.320
then I will forever deprive science

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.450
of one of the key aspects
of the natural world.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.730
We claim it's a natural phenomenon,

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.310
it exists not here,

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.270
but it seems to exist here,

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.250
so if science has ambition

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.483
that it wants to describe
everything in this universe,

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:05.740
then it has to describe consciousness.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.200
In other words, it's just a cop-out.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.300
Yes, it's difficult,

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.850
it's different than
trying to have a theory

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.160
for how mass is derived,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.680
but it's nonetheless a natural phenomenon

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.023
and we should study it as scientists.

00:13:16.023 --> 00:13:21.023
- Now, one is able to do the
experimentation now, why?

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.761
Because of all of the new technologies

00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:28.390
that are coming on board
that are allowing us

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.970
to look at the brain?

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.330
- Yeah, I mean, we can now
do routinely in animals,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.770
we can monitor individual nerve cells.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.603
So you have to understand

00:13:35.603 --> 00:13:37.030
if you wanna understand chemistry,

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.850
or if you want to understand physics,

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.060
you need to know about atoms,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.640
and you need to know about molecules,

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.330
and you need to know how they interact.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.180
You can't do chemistry without
knowing about molecules.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.110
Likewise, if you wanna
understand consciousness

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.840
or perception or memory or thought,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.440
and what happens if these
goes wrong in mental diseases,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.910
you need to know about nerve cells,

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.550
and you need to know how they interact.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.810
And we today, in 2006,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.620
better than before in
any point in history,

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.230
we can monitor nerve cells,

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.370
we can listen to them,

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.370
we can record them,

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.550
we can stimulate them, we
can do all sorts of things,

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.550
both in animals as well as in humans.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.570
In humans it's much more
difficult, of course.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.150
We have brain imaging, which is cool,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.740
but it's a very low spatial resolution.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.680
But we have all these
tools that enable us now

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.510
to begin to monitor the brain

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.720
at the appropriate level of resolution.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.800
And so now we think it's the time

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.010
to start having experiments,
and people are doing it,

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.233
to study the neural
basis of consciousness.

00:14:31.113 --> 00:14:33.830
- And so the, another challenge, I guess,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.294
is to devise the experiments,

00:14:37.294 --> 00:14:40.740
to create reactions and
then put this together,

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.230
what we're now able to see.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.690
Is that the name of the game here?

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.020
- Yeah, I mean this is what scientists do.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.353
I try to do the right control,
do the correct experiment.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.540
Which, as I mentioned before,

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.560
may take you many years
to figure out some fact

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.263
about the brain basis of consciousness.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.810
- Is there a thumbnail sketch of the brain

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.393
that you could give a general audience,

00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:12.350
where the most exciting points

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.123
of direction seem to be in your research?

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.400
- Wait, you want a summary, an
explanation of the brain or?

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.233
- Let me rephrase it.

00:15:21.233 --> 00:15:22.066
It's a bad question.

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:24.730
In other words, basically,
so let's begin talking

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.340
about what your hypothesis is

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.340
about how the brain works at
this point of consciousness.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.400
What are the hypotheses that help give you

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.300
an organizing sense of
how to look for things?

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.133
- Okay, so first of all,

00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:42.530
the overall approach that we advocate

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.562
that's now, most people do this,

00:15:44.562 --> 00:15:47.520
is to study what people abbreviate as NCC,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.250
the neuronal correlate of consciousness.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.420
Those are the minimal brain, the minimal

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.140
because we know your
entire brain is sufficient

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.210
to give rise to consciousness,

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.670
it does it each and every day.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.050
But do you really need your eyes to see?

00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.900
Well, I can dream.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.680
My eyes are closed and
I perfectly well dream,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.170
perfectly formed visual images.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.170
I can close my eyes and I can visualize,

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.670
so I don't need my eyes.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.240
Do I need my cerebellum?

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.690
Probably not for visual consciousness

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.250
or probably not for any consciousness.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.570
So you can ask these question,

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.390
what are the minimal set of mechanisms

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.010
in your head that you need
in order to be conscious?

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.270
Is there a specific neurosignature,

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.314
are there specific types of neurons,

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:24.870
is there a particular
type of neural activity,

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.420
are there particular types of molecules,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.800
particular types of synapses,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.780
do they sit in a particular
part of the brain?

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.820
So you can ask this
whole set of questions,

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.080
and the name of the game is

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.680
to try to isolate those mechanisms

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.890
to really hone in, saying, okay,

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.830
these neurons in this
particular configuration.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.740
We talk about coalition of
neurons, you have to imagine

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.940
the brain has a very,
very, very large number,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.530
there are roughly 50 to
100 billion nerve cells,

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.250
and each one is like a little computer.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.290
Neurons are not sort of
dumb, like a transistor.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.950
They're very quote, smart,
they're very sophisticated,

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.350
each nerve cell, each neuron,

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.680
and you have 100 billion of them.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.127
And consciousness may be
a coalition of neurons

00:17:02.127 --> 00:17:04.290
You know, it's little
bit like in a democracy

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.730
when you have coalition that form,

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.570
and that assemble and then disassemble,

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.010
except the time scale is not years like

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.870
in the American electoral system,

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.510
but it's sort of fraction of a second.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.560
And so, for a hundredth of a millisecond

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.440
you may have this coalition
of five million neurons,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.760
and they make in code,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.610
they may give rise to,

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:23.680
they may be the feeling of
darn it, I'm late today,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.020
and then this is suppressed

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.870
because then there's this
other five million neurons,

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:27.790
or 10 million neurons,

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.250
who now give rise to the oh,
I see my daughter over there,

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.470
and you know then the fact that I'm late,

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.420
you know I forget that,

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.676
you know and I become
conscious of my daughter,

00:17:36.676 --> 00:17:37.762
and those neurons in the brain

00:17:37.762 --> 00:17:41.170
that represent my daughter
fire and they are,

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.630
well, this now depends exactly

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.510
on your philosophical predisposition.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.080
Some people say the firing

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.680
of these neurons is
identical to consciousness.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.300
Some people say, well, it
correlates with consciousness,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.880
those are the things that we don't know.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.480
But what we try to do empirically
where are those neurons?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.313
Can you track them?

00:17:56.313 --> 00:17:58.150
Can you catch a brief picture of them

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.080
using some fancy imaging techniques?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.913
Can you influence them?

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.587
Can you move from,

00:18:02.587 --> 00:18:06.460
scientists, very often,
we can just observe.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.860
So, for example, a
function of brain imaging,

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.850
I put you in a magnet,

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.540
I show you faces, and I see
every time you look at a face,

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.780
this part of the brain lights up.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.574
People do that routinely.

00:18:15.574 --> 00:18:18.090
So that's observation, that's correlation.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:18.950
What I would then like to do,

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.230
I would like to move to
causation, where I can influence.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.350
What happens if I can
put a probe in your brain

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.690
like a neurosurgeon does
during neurosurgery,

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.590
and I can stimulate that
particular part of the brain?

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.140
Will you then see a face?

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.260
And again, we can begin
to do those experiments

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.093
quite well in animals,

00:18:32.093 --> 00:18:34.200
and we can also do them
in certain contexts,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.420
for example, in a neurosurgical
context with humans,

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.080
where it can actually begin
to intervene with the brain.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.382
- And you, as a matter of your strategy,

00:18:43.382 --> 00:18:46.460
are focusing not on all
the different senses

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.980
but really perception.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.800
Tell us about that choice.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.310
- Yeah, we focus on vision,
visual consciousness.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.780
So you know,

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.920
it's a little bit like the
drunkard who lost his keys

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.630
and then looks for his
lost key where the lamp is.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.260
These are all very,
very difficult problems,

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.590
we haven't made that much
progress over the last 2000 years,

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.680
so when you ask people consciousness,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.690
they say, oh, you mean self-consciousness.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.780
Yes, self-consciousness,
one aspect of consciousness,

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.990
but it's very difficult to study.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.930
The fact that I know I'm
Christof, I know I'm a son,

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.370
I know I have children, et cetera.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:17.960
That's very difficult to study empirically

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.624
because it's it's unclear

00:19:19.624 --> 00:19:21.840
to what extent animals have consciousness.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.740
Some probably do, like the great apes,

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.160
but it's very difficult to study that.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.310
So, let's study a much
simpler aspect of conscience,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.250
namely red or blue or seeing
motion or seeing a face.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.940
We can manipulate that very well.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.940
We can do what magicians
do since hundreds of years.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.810
So if you go to a magic show,
you look at the magician.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.290
The magician will make things disappear

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.510
in front of your eyes.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.840
He does that partly by
using attention distraction.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.850
Use a beautiful bikini-clad
assistant next to him

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.750
and you'll be distracted.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.583
Although you're looking at him,

00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:48.370
you're actually paying attention to her.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.050
We can do something similar, less sexy,

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.880
but we can do something
similar in the lab.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.280
Where we can show you things
that you routinely don't see.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.660
They're in front of your eyes,

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.620
sometimes you see them,
sometimes you don't.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.000
So now we can use this technique to ask,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.450
well, in both cases there's
an image present on your eyes,

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.320
but one case you were actually
conscious of the image,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.210
in the other case you were
not conscious of the image.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.580
Where's the difference in your brain?

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.710
Is the area X, the consciousness
area that lights up,

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.543
that's one hypothesis.

00:20:12.543 --> 00:20:15.120
That whenever this area lights
up, were you conscious of it?

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.030
Where is that area?

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.390
Is it a series of stages?

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.890
It's not gonna be one area, we know that.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.750
It's gonna be a series of
areas, probably distributed,

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.030
that have different properties.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.190
So, we can do this in a magnet,

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.720
we can put you in a magnet and
we can show you these images

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.480
that you see sometimes
and sometimes you don't,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.410
and we can study that.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.820
And you can also do this in a monkey,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.100
or you can do it in a mouse.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.317
So, vision has the
advantage, visual perception,

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:36.280
and we can manipulate your visual percept

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.420
very precisely in space and time.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.220
We can't do that as well as for pain,

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.210
well, it's also very
difficult to recruit people

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.043
to do pain experiments.

00:20:43.043 --> 00:20:43.876
- [Harry] (chuckles) Yeah, right.

00:20:43.876 --> 00:20:45.700
- It's very easy to recruit
them to look at a monitor,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.423
and you know we pay 'em
twenty bucks to do that.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.150
And so, it's a tactical reason

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.808
why we focus on visual perception.

00:20:55.808 --> 00:21:00.513
- And some of these experiments
play with, for example,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.940
when you, these coalitions are often

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.260
in competition, basically, is that?

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.100
- Yes, just like, again, that's
where I think the election

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.380
or democratic analogy or
metaphor is very appropriate.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.427
You have all these neurons in your head

00:21:16.427 --> 00:21:17.620
and they constantly compete.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.980
They excite and inhibit each other

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.660
and they constantly compete.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.760
At any given point in time,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.140
there's only one dominant coalition.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.720
That reflects the character
of your consciousness.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.280
By and large, you're only
conscious of one or two things

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.113
at any given point in time.

00:21:28.113 --> 00:21:31.130
You can shift rapidly within
a fraction of a second,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.299
but at any given point in time

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:34.330
you're usually only conscious of,

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.550
let's say, one or two things.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.380
And so, when you're
conscious of one thing,

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.430
something else is suppressed.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.820
And you can see that, for example,

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.186
the phenomenon of tip of the tongue,

00:21:41.186 --> 00:21:43.439
when you say, oh, what's
that name, what's that name?

00:21:43.439 --> 00:21:44.850
You know and then you do something else

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.480
and 20 minutes later,
it pops into your mind.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.050
That's exactly a case where
the coalition of neurons

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.790
that represent the name
of this acquaintance

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.300
you're trying to recall is
suppressed by something else.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.670
Yeah, so, you wanna track this, and again,

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:57.840
we have experiments in the lab

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.440
where we can do this very well.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.950
We have two different images,

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.000
and for example, we put
one image in one eye

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.680
and a different image in the
other eye and they compete.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.360
You only see one image at
any given point in time,

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.470
although they're both present.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.910
Let's say you put a picture
of you know George Bush here

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.070
and you put a picture of John Kerry here.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.590
You will only see one of them at a time.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.300
It's called binocular rivalry.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.860
For 10 seconds you may see Bush,

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.810
and then there's a transition,

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.250
you see Kerry for a couple of seconds,

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.470
then again changes to Bush.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.220
So, you have the two images
and the underlying neurons

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.600
that represent them, they
compete for attention.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.580
So, you can use this paradigm to, again,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:34.030
to study the footprints of
consciousness in the brain,

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.900
in a human brain or in a monkey brain.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:40.900
- Right, and do the combination
of these experiments

00:22:42.102 --> 00:22:46.340
over time pursuing this framework,

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.980
do you hope it will lead
to a general picture

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.190
that answers some of
these specific questions?

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.313
- Yes, of course, of course.

00:22:54.313 --> 00:22:57.270
When there's aid or not
it's really no alternative.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.100
All right, consciousness
is a difficult problem.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.950
We as humanity have thought about it,

00:23:02.056 --> 00:23:03.380
in the Western tradition at least since

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.960
at least since 2,300 years.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.310
And the only way to approach
it is in an empirical manner,

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.143
step by step.

00:23:09.143 --> 00:23:12.500
You try to discover something
about the material basis.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.750
Ultimately, of course, you
need a theory of consciousness.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.298
You need not just the neural correlates

00:23:16.298 --> 00:23:20.490
but you wanna understand
what type of systems,

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.630
and at what conditions
have conscious sensation.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.260
Because I'd like to know, for example,

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.820
in principle I'd like to know

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.030
what about a young baby
that doesn't speak?

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.180
What about a fetus?

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.110
What about the patient who is in coma

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.560
or who has a persistent
vegetative syndrome,

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.860
like Terri Schiavo?

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.530
You know, I'd like to have a measure,

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.810
a real theoretical understanding,

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.360
is she or is she not conscious?

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.240
What about a monkey?

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.450
What about a dog?

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.320
What about a squid?

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.270
What about a fly?

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.510
Right now, we don't have a good theory,

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.130
for example, for insects.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.450
You know we accord consciousness
really to the degree

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.150
that other people are like us.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.680
And you can go back in history, right.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.900
People, you know even the
Greeks, they first thought,

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.900
well, you know the really only true humans

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.430
are other Greeks, right?

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.517
The other one were barbarous,
they were barbarous.

00:24:02.517 --> 00:24:05.020
And we decided slowly, the
last couple of thousand years,

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.450
we decided well, we'll extend
this privilege of being

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.670
real humans to women and to other people,

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:10.883
and to other races.

00:24:11.977 --> 00:24:13.536
And now we're beginning to
extend this magic circle

00:24:13.536 --> 00:24:14.990
to other animals.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.380
That if a monkey or a dog,

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.830
yes, they don't speak,
they're a little more furry,

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.880
they look a little bit different,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.740
but their brain is very
similar to you or mine.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.330
If I give you a little bit
of monkey brain or dog brain,

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.600
a little bit of human brain,

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.070
it takes an expert to
really tell the difference.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.920
The behavior is very similar,
appropriately measured.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.740
So if a dog's in pain,

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.010
that behavior is not that
dissimilar to when you're in pain.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.260
You know, it yelps, it
has a high motor activity,

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.210
you know it wants to run away and hide,

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.570
similar things to you do.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.500
Evolutionary continuity,
all those reasons,

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.490
suggest that these animals
are also conscious.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:48.820
They're not as conscious as we are,

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.480
they don't know about Macintosh computers

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.313
or things like that,

00:24:51.313 --> 00:24:52.550
but they certainly seem to have

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.760
all the basic conscious
sensation of pain and pleasure,

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.680
and they can be depressed,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.513
they can be happy,

00:24:57.513 --> 00:24:58.670
they can be excited.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.120
Now where does it end?

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.520
What about a squid, and what about a bee?

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.074
A bee is a very complicated organism.

00:25:03.074 --> 00:25:06.020
So, finally, we need a theory
that tells us which organism,

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.950
including which artificial organism.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.560
At what point can you say, for example,

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.210
say if ever, that the
internet is conscious?

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.440
What about a robot, what about a computer?

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.390
So, we're finding what we need is a theory

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.050
that tells us which system,
under what condition,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.080
will be conscious.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.214
- Now what about this notion

00:25:23.214 --> 00:25:26.550
that one had in earlier periods of time,

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.924
of the notion of a little man, basic--

00:25:28.924 --> 00:25:29.757
- [Christof] Homunculus.

00:25:29.757 --> 00:25:32.263
- Yeah, homunculus in your head.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.680
I mean, obviously, there
is no little man there,

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.540
but is that a kind of hypothesis
that one can work with,

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.319
and do you still try to use to,

00:25:41.319 --> 00:25:44.270
'cause you're really
talking about something

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.770
that moves beyond the zombie effect

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.780
where you're responding,
I believe you say,

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.810
you're responding to
your present environment,

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.470
but also it's related
to the planning area.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:58.687
This is the point at
which we need some entity,

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.030
some unit, to be making choices.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.870
- Yeah, to me, it's a very
compelling illusion, right.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.720
We all have it.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.240
There's a person actually
sitting in my head,

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.990
I can tell you where, he sits
here, right, roughly here.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.090
If you have one eye, I presume
it would shift it over.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.300
And he's looking out at the world.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.910
We all have this homunculus
illusion, it's very compelling.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.640
So Francis Crick argued there has to be

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.917
some neuronal basis for that

00:26:23.917 --> 00:26:26.530
to explain this very compelling feeling,

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.270
and we have an explanation for that.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.810
But of course, as you point
out, there is no homunculus,

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.140
it's just a series of very
congregated neural networks,

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.880
and one network, quote, is
looking at another network,

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.540
and that's being looked
at by another network,

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.980
and ultimately what you
get out of this system,

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.590
you get this feeling
that there is a person

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.160
sitting inside my head.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:46.993
But there is, of course,

00:26:46.993 --> 00:26:48.440
no point where you can say, well, see?

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.740
That area, that's Christof, right.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.100
That it's gonna be,
like most other things,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.943
a collection of neurons
that do this process

00:26:54.943 --> 00:26:57.400
that ultimately give rise
to this mysterious feeling,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.000
there's a person inside my head.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:05.430
- So I guess one of the
images that struck me

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.270
in the essay was the notion
of that there are elements

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:13.490
of the brain that are
like a movie essentially,

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.346
or at least that,

00:27:14.346 --> 00:27:16.350
could you help us understand that?

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.190
That in other words,

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:21.460
motion may come out of a series of images

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.570
that are in your brain,

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.570
and presumably the images are an output

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.339
of these coalitions of neurons?

00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:30.860
Help us get a handle on that.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.520
- All right, there's this hypothesis,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.560
is consciousness like a river,

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.360
or is it more like a movie

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.610
where you have, well, we all
know we have the illusion

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.820
of seeing life on the screen,

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.870
but in fact, if you look closely,

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.280
you know there are 24 frames a second,

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.950
or 72 frames a second,

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.280
and so you have a frame like this,

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.220
the next frame like this,

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.053
the next frame like this.

00:27:51.053 --> 00:27:53.730
But what you see, of
course, is smooth motion.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.260
So psychologists have asked
this question since a long time,

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.804
there's now some more evidence for it,

00:27:57.804 --> 00:28:00.130
that perception is actually discrete,

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:03.780
it's actually organized
in discrete snapshots.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.410
Each snapshot may be 30
milliseconds, 15 milliseconds,

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.800
100 milliseconds, so a
small fraction of a second,

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.470
and each snapshot is a
little bit like frozen.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.820
So it's like a drawing that
you make of a runner like this.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.275
You know, clearly this drawing implies

00:28:16.275 --> 00:28:18.200
you know the person's moving forward

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.398
but the drawing itself is stationary,

00:28:19.398 --> 00:28:21.990
but it come with the drawing,

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.840
the stationary drawing comes
with the sense of motion.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.980
And there is this area

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.120
that scientists have identified called MT,

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.050
you have it on both sides of your brain,

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.240
or sometimes called V5.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.500
It seems to be involved in motion.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.600
If you stimulate it, there's
a sense of motion in animals.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.460
If you lose it, you lose
the sense of motion.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.480
And the hypothesis is that these neurons

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.730
in this part of the brain

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.230
that they encode motion in
a series of these snapshots.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.900
And usually, just like in a
movie, you're fooled by it.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.390
Although these are discrete snapshots,

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:54.900
the world looks continuous.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.490
But there may be a rare condition,

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.470
and the neurologist
Oliver Sacks has described

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.380
one of these when, for example,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.839
he himself has had this
condition under migraines,

00:29:02.839 --> 00:29:04.772
where this mechanism breaks down.

00:29:04.772 --> 00:29:07.020
And he describes this
very vividly himself,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.850
and also the experiences
of some of his patients.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.990
When he sees, he says the world
appears shattered, atomized.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.350
What you see, I see the
nurse comes towards me

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.070
and she's in these discrete stills.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.083
I don't see her smooth anymore.

00:29:17.083 --> 00:29:19.860
It's like a movie run too slow.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.990
And so this well may be

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.870
a manifestation of something
that's more general,

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:30.110
that maybe all of our
perception is actually illusory,

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.390
this smoothing, changing
river of consciousness

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.703
may actually be illusory in the sense

00:29:34.703 --> 00:29:38.690
that it is actually a
discontinuous set of snapshots

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.388
but we don't experience it as such.

00:29:40.388 --> 00:29:41.860
It would be another example

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.860
of this perfect con job that's perception.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.010
There're so many things

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.410
that are not really the way they seem,

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.477
but our brain suggests them,

00:29:51.477 --> 00:29:53.510
and our brain is very good at that.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:57.100
- And it the case that
the brain will often

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.860
substitute information where
there is no information?

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.003
I mean will it fill in frames, yeah?

00:30:01.003 --> 00:30:03.100
- Yes, well, for instance, the blind spot.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.880
I mean if I close my eye, we well know,

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.330
at least since the 15th century,

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.430
there's a you know, you can
find it here, roughly here.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.270
When there's a spot called the blind spot,

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.270
when there's no information,

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.300
there are no photoreceptors there

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.560
because in that location
the wires leave the eye.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.490
And so at that location
there's no visual information.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.050
It's like you take your camera,

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.640
your video camera, your consumer camera,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.940
and some of the pixels are black,

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.880
they would always be black.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.510
You would immediately send it back, right.

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.040
Well, why don't we complain?

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.660
Well, it turns out there's
a mechanism in the brain

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.910
that compensates for.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:33.940
So, I don't see a hole.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.235
I sort of have to test it,

00:30:35.235 --> 00:30:36.068
but I think, well, okay,

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:37.457
somewhere around here
my finger disappears.

00:30:37.457 --> 00:30:38.840
Again, it's a con job.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.170
It fills in the information.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.360
There's no information, but
it cleverly fills it in.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.470
There are many, many cases like that

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.250
where the brain fills it in,

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.320
usually using appropriate stimuli

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.900
because it learned over
the course of evolution,

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.560
it makes sense, on average it makes sense.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.160
But if you test it carefully,

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.440
you can see there is a lot

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.270
of this filling constantly going on.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.890
And even at the high level,
at the cognitive level,

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.800
I constantly make implicit
assumptions about people,

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.880
about their behavior,

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.730
and I do it all the time unconsciously.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.910
It's just another example
of the brain filling in

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.880
and predicting things that are missing

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.560
or predicting things into the future.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.330
That's what our brain does.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.540
- Now in addition to
designing experiments,

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.550
I guess pathologies and disease

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.640
are a fruitful place to look.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.320
And this comes out in Oliver Sacks' essays

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.560
in the New York Review.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.780
Talk a little about that

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.360
because they offer the possibility

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.380
of the breakdown of the systems,

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:36.263
and then a testing of the
map of the mind at that time.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.590
- Yeah, so probably one of
the most richest sources,

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.580
the most fertile sources of information

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.550
about consciousness is of course is humans

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.567
because we can talk about it.

00:31:44.567 --> 00:31:46.290
And so there, you have to go to the clinic

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.890
where you see a lot of
sometimes bizarre conditions

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.450
but that tell you a lot
about consciousness.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.590
So, for example, for the prosopagnosia,

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.660
you're unable to see a face.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.070
So the patient says, well, I can see,

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.453
and they're different forms of it,

00:32:00.453 --> 00:32:02.060
I can see your mouth,

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.130
I can see your eyes,

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.040
and I can see your ears,

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.510
so I know there's got to be a face

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.930
because I know intellectually
they go together,

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.330
but I actually don't see it.

00:32:10.558 --> 00:32:12.350
And it turns out you have a particular,

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.730
very often a particular part
of the brain is destroyed.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.170
That tells us a really important point.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.090
That tells us consciousness,

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:19.810
at least for faces, is localized.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.970
It's not global, distributed,
holistic, gestalt-like,

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:23.803
as a lot of people think.

00:32:23.803 --> 00:32:26.290
In this case, there's
actually discrete foci.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.180
There are a bunch of
neurons that code for faces,

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.000
that code for the conscious
perception of the faces.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.577
If you lose them, you're
unable to see faces.

00:32:32.577 --> 00:32:34.470
You can still think about them abstractly

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.970
but you can't see a face anymore.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.720
Another very important discovery was done

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.480
at Caltech by Roger Sperry,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.210
based again on the brains
that don't work very well,

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.630
namely epileptic seizures.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.400
And sometimes to prevent seizures

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.850
from going from a small attack,

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.070
from a so-called focal attack,

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.320
into a grand mal attack you
know where people thrash around,

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.050
you cut 200 million fibers connecting

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.980
the left brain and the right brain.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.000
And then what they then realized

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.340
that you actually have two consciousness,

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.380
two minds in one skull.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.410
You have the left hemisphere,

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:06.980
usually by and large that talks,

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.777
that's usually the
linguistic competent one.

00:33:08.777 --> 00:33:11.760
The right one can sing,
the right one can grunt,

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.310
the right one can answer simple questions,

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.222
but it's not very sophisticated,

00:33:14.222 --> 00:33:15.570
but it seems to be conscious.

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:16.670
So, now you really have the dilemma,

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.940
you have two people, in a sense,

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.160
two conscious entity
inside this one skull.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.860
It's a really interesting discovery.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.390
We work with patients,

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.420
we work with a neurosurgeon,
Dr. Fried at UCLA,

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.845
again with epileptic patients,

00:33:29.845 --> 00:33:31.440
where we can record for many days

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.560
from individual nerve cells,

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.620
something you can never
do in a human otherwise.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.220
You can discover very
interesting nerve cells

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.700
in the brain of these patient.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.240
So, again, the clinic has been

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.840
one of the most fecund
sources of information

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.597
about the brain and about consciousness.

00:33:47.597 --> 00:33:52.567
- And ultimately, the insights
that you draw on perception

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.960
potentially could lead to insights

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.440
that are actually relevant

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.520
for the other areas of consciousness,

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.980
smell, and so forth.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.530
Is that the hope here?

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.760
- Yeah, just like in
molecular biology, Harry,

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.110
it's just like in molecular biology,

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:08.470
where people argued early on,

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:12.390
like Max Delbruck, for example, who said,

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:13.730
well, let's study phages,

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.960
phages are these viruses
that prey upon bacteria,

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.600
and let's study the genetics there.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.820
And some people argued well,

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.670
that's so remote from human genetics,

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:22.840
it's not gonna tell us anything.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.300
Well, it turned out it's
the same mechanisms,

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.340
RNA, DNA, and proteins,
the same mechanism.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.290
So, here the assumption
is, it's a hypothesis,

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:30.600
maybe wrong, the hypothesis is

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.680
that consciousness is
something biological,

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.780
it evolved we don't know when,

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.160
100 to 200 million years ago, who knows,

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.900
but it's something that
probably first came

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.900
with consciousness for simple
things like pain and pleasure,

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.890
then evolution discovered
it's a great thing.

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:48.290
We think the function is to plan.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.340
And then it probably
used the same mechanism

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.650
for visual consciousness,
for olfactory consciousness,

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:55.040
and later on in more complicated animals

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.700
like great apes, and like dolphins,

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.533
and ultimately like us.

00:34:57.533 --> 00:34:58.580
Also for self-consciousness,

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.450
knowing who I am and projecting myself

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.150
in the future of going
through different scenarios.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.530
If there's an earthquake here,

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.790
which door did I come in?

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.530
Which door should I try to egress?

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.370
So yes, there is a common,
that all these different forms

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.349
of consciousness have something common.

00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:14.970
They have this subjective
consciousness common,

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:18.110
but they also will have or
may have something common

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.240
at the neurobiological base.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.383
They're all caused by a similar
set of neuro-mechanisms.

00:35:21.383 --> 00:35:23.143
That's the hypothesis.

00:35:24.027 --> 00:35:25.940
- As I listen to you,

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:30.940
I wanna understand how you are confident

00:35:32.171 --> 00:35:36.880
amidst this complexity
that you're describing

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.300
because there's an
interesting synergy here.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.740
You're saying you wanna focus
on a piece of the action,

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.360
but the level of complexity is striking

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.040
because it's not just perception

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.210
ultimately you're talking about,

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.270
you're talking about past
and present, and so on.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.370
Talk a little about that

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.730
because that must bring the excitement

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.820
that you get in mountain climbing.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:04.310
Is there any comparability there?

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.580
- Well, in a sense it's daunting,

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.810
I mean you know it's
just like in climbing.

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.280
What do you do when you
have a difficult climb?

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.150
You don't think about the
20 pitches ahead of you

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:13.040
that are gonna take
you, you know 12 hours.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.020
You just think, right
now I'm on this pitch

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.790
and this is the cracks that's coming out.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.290
And you totally empty your mind,

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.260
you just try to solve this problem.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.093
The same thing here.

00:36:21.093 --> 00:36:22.570
If you think about the
brain, it's so daunting.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:23.820
I mean right now there are probably only

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.120
around 50,000 neuroscientists
on the planet studying,

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.310
50,000 people study the brain.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:34.310
Each day you know, each week
there's almost a new journal

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:37.450
in neuroscience and
related fields that appear.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.730
So, you can be totally daunted by it.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:44.320
So you have to focus and
believe that ultimately,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.070
maybe similar to replication

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:50.040
and DNA and RNA translation et cetera,

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.380
there's a common, there
is a simple mechanism

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.253
at the root of consciousness

00:36:54.253 --> 00:36:56.460
that we, I mean humans,
are able to understand.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.770
There's no guarantee, right.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.333
It may well be that
consciousness requires a brain,

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.890
you know even in principle
beyond our brain.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.530
I mean some philosophers made the argument

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.290
well, what chance does an ant have

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:08.430
of understanding relativity?

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.270
There's nothing fundamentally
it couldn't understand,

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:12.410
but it just doesn't have
the cognitive operators.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:14.700
Likewise, we may not have
the cognitive operators

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.570
to study consciousness.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.980
I don't like the argument,
of course, it's defeatist.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.980
I don't like it at all,
I tend to be optimist.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:25.260
And I know for sure, the only
way we will ever solve it is

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.240
by trying to pursue this empirical.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.060
Also, there's really no sane alternative.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.270
- I know that people like Searle believe

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:37.270
that we're on the edge
of finding these answers,

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.197
that there's a real revolution,

00:37:39.197 --> 00:37:41.400
and the next big questions are here

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.420
and they will be you know answered

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.728
in some reasonable timeframe.

00:37:46.728 --> 00:37:50.320
Why is this, that it's all
coming together right now?

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.123
Is it that these various
disciplines are coming together?

00:37:53.123 --> 00:37:55.530
I mean, just looking at
your own academic career

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.180
and your training, that
that is all coming together

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.940
among a community of scientists,

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.770
but also with technology
that can deliver things--

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.310
- Yes, fundamentally,
like always in science,

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.290
what's driving this is
our instrumental ability,

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.190
technology, that we can manipulate,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.560
we can study the brain at
an unprecedented detail

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.040
in the resolution, we
can begin to manipulate.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.290
That really makes all of this possible.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:20.710
Otherwise we would just be
sitting around and speculating.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:22.680
So, that's the biggest
driver of all of this.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.370
And then yeah, the belief,
there's a convergence,

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:25.670
there's a meeting now each year

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:29.240
where philosophers, and
psychologists, and neuroscientists

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.920
come together, many hundreds of them,

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.960
and talk about consciousness.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.580
So, there is this great excitement

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.690
that we are on the verge or
we're in this revolution,

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:37.290
this is gonna be one of the golden ages

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.810
that people talk about
in future histories,

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.480
and we're well on the way to understand.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.810
Now of course, one has to admit
we may be fooling ourselves.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.740
You know, of course, it's
always better to believe

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.573
that you're gonna solve the problem

00:38:47.573 --> 00:38:50.980
than to say, oh, darn, I'm
not gonna solve it anyhow.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.160
That's not how you do progress, right?

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.310
So, you could also consider
this as a form of self-hypnosis.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.370
Right now, there's no question

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.600
we're making unprecedented progress.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.280
We are beginning to intervene, also,

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.720
in a therapeutical context

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.510
with the human brain as never before.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.143
So right now, everything
looks very positive.

00:39:10.223 --> 00:39:13.000
There's no question we will find

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.110
the neuronal correlates of consciousness.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.400
There's very little doubt about that,

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.640
assuming you know no major
catastrophe in funding,

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.883
or other things.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:26.450
The big question is what a
final theory of consciousness

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.730
will look like, and will it
really explain everything?

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:30.750
Because some people say,

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:34.610
well, you know this is
all very interesting.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:37.120
So I'm willing to believe in 50th time

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.610
we know that if I feel red

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:39.930
and these neurons fire this way,

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.170
and if I feel pain,
then those neurons fire,

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.003
but so what?

00:39:43.003 --> 00:39:45.070
That really doesn't explain the feeling.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.120
And then people made very
similar analogies with life.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.540
They said, well, you
know you're gonna tell me

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.770
it's all molecules and you
know organic chemistry,

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:51.980
but that really doesn't explain life.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.310
There's something magic about life.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.748
But of course, we discovered
life is you know metabolism,

00:39:55.748 --> 00:39:58.820
and heritability, et cetera.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.200
And so likewise here,

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.770
we have to see how far can
we push the explanation,

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.330
and will we finally have
a satisfactory explanation

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.910
of why certain types
of systems namely ask,

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.570
some of the times, not
when we're in a deep sleep,

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:13.110
not when we're in a
coma, have these states.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.010
And that's the open question.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:19.200
- Are there some subset of questions

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.590
that are very important in the short term

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.330
in this kind of long-term project

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:25.730
that we hope to find the answers to,

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.300
that will be a piece of this?

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.220
- Yeah, so that's why we focus on,

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.890
people have criticized us focusing on

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.447
the neural correlates of consciousness.

00:40:32.447 --> 00:40:34.260
And to see, well, you know, that I mean,

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.810
that that doesn't really
explain consciousness.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.620
If you know these neurons
are critical, so what?

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.040
Well, A, that's something,
empirical project,

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.870
that everybody can agree
that we can actually do today

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.290
with today's technology,

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.560
and just like knowing the
molecular correlates of heredity,

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.340
once Crick and Watson solved
you know the double helix,

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.970
most of the problems were clear.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.000
Now it's probably not gonna be

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.195
of this character for consciousness,

00:40:54.195 --> 00:40:57.540
but it once and again shows
that structure follows function,

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.080
particularly in biological system.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.570
And once you know the structure,

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.900
you're probably a huge step forward

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.440
to understanding its function.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.430
You can also track then that structure,

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.602
you can track in diseased people,

00:41:06.602 --> 00:41:07.870
as I mentioned, in babies,

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:08.730
you can track what happens,

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:11.530
you've got schizophrenia, autism, or ADHD.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.680
You can track it in animals,

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.694
so this will be a huge step forward.

00:41:14.694 --> 00:41:16.970
It'll not be a final
theory of consciousness,

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:18.720
but it will be a gigantic step forward

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.710
on the road to final resolution
of this mind/body problem.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:22.820
Now of course, there are some philosophers

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:23.950
who think this can never be done.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.178
All right, there are some philosophers,

00:41:25.178 --> 00:41:26.620
David Chalmers for one,

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.848
who argue there's the hard
problem, the easy problem.

00:41:27.848 --> 00:41:30.710
That we scientists deal
with the easy problem.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.390
He doesn't mean easy
in the practical sense.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.090
He says a easy problem will
take you hundreds of years

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.670
to figure it out, the mechanism,

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.410
you know this neuron
activating that neurons,

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:38.650
inhibiting that neurons,

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:40.500
but he said forever we'll
be reduced to just saying

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.290
well, finally it's just a list
of bunch of material problems

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:44.330
you can make in the brain,

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.460
and over here you have you know things

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.300
like blue, and pain, and
being self-conscious,

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.610
but how they link will forever elude us.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.300
But of course, many
philosophers have before

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.990
made the argument you
know we shall never know

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.538
what the stars are made out of,

00:41:55.538 --> 00:41:58.040
we shall never know what life is.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.980
And so I'm very skeptical
when philosophers tell me

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.100
this is something in
principle we can never know.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.510
We'll have to see.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.780
- What do you think will be
the implications of this,

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.430
if you can come up with an answer?

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.590
In other words, does it have an impact

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:11.870
on the treatment of disease?

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.900
Does it have an impact on who we are,

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:16.977
and understanding our
place in the universe?

00:42:16.977 --> 00:42:18.190
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.640
Well, certainly there's no question

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.520
it'll have an impact on disease,

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.930
and understanding things
like autism, schizophrenia.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.660
But more even longer term,

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.150
whatever the understanding will be

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.240
you see, we grew up with
a picture in our history,

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.260
in our culture, that we grew very fond of.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.300
And it remains to be seen
to what extent this picture

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.510
you know of people independent
actor having free will,

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.230
and a soul, and all of that
corresponds to actual reality.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:46.893
And so we have to see how it pans out.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.113
Do we really know what we are

00:42:49.113 --> 00:42:51.650
and what's our place in the
universe, and are we unique?

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.150
Is consciousness unique to us?

00:42:54.402 --> 00:42:55.390
What about animals?

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.410
Right now we treat animals beastly, right?

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.835
If you look at the way
the animals are raised

00:42:59.835 --> 00:43:03.340
and kept under horrible
conditions for us to eat 'em,

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.940
is that really justifiable, really?

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.716
I don't think it is.

00:43:06.716 --> 00:43:08.180
And so once we realize,

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.460
once we extend this magic
circle of consciousness,

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.260
once we're really compassionate
about other creatures

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.450
that can actually suffer,

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:16.300
and have a true understanding of that,

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.270
and at the same time
realize that certain people

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.480
cannot suffer anymore,
that a patient in PVS,

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.500
in persistent vegetative
syndrome like Terri Schiavo,

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.410
as far as we can tell from
the best medical evidence,

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:30.250
there isn't anything to
suffer anymore, right.

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.450
The person isn't dead because
the body's still alive,

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.420
but there's no consciousness whatsoever.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.060
So, you could argue a person

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.090
like that should be extended less.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.360
It's sort of on the
level of consciousness,

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:44.060
much, much less conscious
than any of our cats and dogs,

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.780
and pigs and cattle and veal
that we treat horribly, right.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.690
So, all of this understanding will surely

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:55.290
or is gonna impact the way
we deal, we treat each other

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:57.650
and we treat the other
creatures in the world.

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.050
And then of course, the question

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.800
should we create other conscious
entities, like computers?

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.633
Is it a good thing?

00:44:02.633 --> 00:44:04.490
Will we increase the amount
of suffering in the world?

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:05.323
Should we do this?

00:44:05.323 --> 00:44:07.023
Under what conditions should we do this?

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.470
- How does this work
affect whatever religious

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:15.110
or spiritual values you hold, does it?

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:16.340
- Yeah, of course, I think a lot about it.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.703
I was raised as a Roman Catholic
and I think a lot about it.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.060
To what extent is this,

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.560
certainly it's difficult to reconcile some

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.800
of these ideas with the
classical Roman Catholic doctrine

00:44:31.909 --> 00:44:34.700
of a freely independent actor.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.390
All right, this relates to the question

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.223
we haven't talked about,

00:44:37.223 --> 00:44:39.320
to the question of free will and volition.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.520
But neuroscience, of
course, like all of science,

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.810
throws some doubts on that,
some quote, water on the idea

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:47.160
that I can really truly
act like the unmoved mover,

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.620
the uncaused cause, right.

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:51.820
Because how would that be if
I can truly act independent?

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.480
That means that there's something happens

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.640
without there being any
something happening before,

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.170
and how's that supposed
to work in real life?

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.387
So, those are issues I'm profoundly

00:45:02.387 --> 00:45:06.300
and passionately
interested in to reconcile,

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.260
to come to a single
understanding of everything

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.010
in the universe, including
things outside the universe.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.020
- Looking to the future,

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.090
if you had to advise
students about how to prepare

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.540
for the future in this field,

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.420
what advice would you give them?

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.210
I mean obviously they need to learn

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.200
this array of scientific
skills that you require,

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.200
but what about also humanistic
values and education

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.450
with regard to dealing with this,

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:38.663
once we come up with
some of these answers?

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.260
- Well, I mean what I tell people

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:44.210
who ask me what is they
want to do is study physics,

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:48.300
study math, study biology,
study the basic sciences,

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.280
be compassionate and leave
the world a better place.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.990
There really isn't much else to say.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.260
- (chuckles) And then finally,

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.390
what about for the public,

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:02.150
what is the best way to
follow this revolution?

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.590
They're obviously not gonna go back

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:05.810
and get graduate degrees, and so on,

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:07.960
but do you have some
markers that people should--

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.580
- [Christof] Well, they can read my book.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.990
- (laughs) yeah, yeah, right,
we'll show it again, right.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:14.280
- Well I mean there are now many journals,

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.050
for example, Scientific
American just started

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.476
a journal called Mind last year.

00:46:18.476 --> 00:46:20.840
Together with the normal
Scientific American,

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.230
they have this second journal,
Scientific American Mind,

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:26.840
that's just dedicated to
you know the dissemination

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:30.910
of a lot of these ideas.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.480
So there are many books being
written, some very good books.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.277
John Searle has written
a wonderful little primer

00:46:36.277 --> 00:46:38.650
on consciousness and the mind.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.960
So, there are a number of excellent books

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.530
that are now available
for the general public

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:42.460
to inform themselves.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.230
The information's all there,
I mean they, it's not,

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.810
you have to work at it.

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:48.740
That's not surprising.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.840
Consciousness is a very puzzling thing

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.200
and it you know can't be reduced

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.650
to a single sound bite, right.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:55.990
I mean If you ask me what's consciousness

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.823
in 30 seconds or less,

00:46:56.823 --> 00:46:58.319
you know it's difficult to answer that.

00:46:58.319 --> 00:47:00.327
But there are some
wonderful books available

00:47:00.327 --> 00:47:03.570
that describe the current
state of knowledge,

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.530
incomplete as it is, for general public.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:11.493
- I'm curious, looking back at
the trajectory of your life,

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:14.320
are there some certain factors

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.820
that have brought you to
this focus in your life?

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.940
I mean does it all come
together, in a way, in this,

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.340
or is it primarily the science education

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.603
that has led you here?

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.073
- No, it's, well, I mean,

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.660
life is always a series of accidents

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.200
and then some more profound
current that tug you,

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.130
that pull you along in
a certain direction.

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:39.900
So I've always had, probably
because of the way my parents

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.890
raised me in a very religious setting,

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.730
always thought a lot about some

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.440
of these more fundamental
problems about time,

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.627
about eternity, about life before death,

00:47:47.627 --> 00:47:49.690
and life after death.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.660
But it's always puzzled me

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.053
that people are much more
obsessed about life after death

00:47:53.053 --> 00:47:54.480
than life before death, right.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.313
Isn't it strange?

00:47:55.313 --> 00:47:56.520
People are really,

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.970
particularly in the
context of consciousness.

00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:59.770
They rarely ask, well,

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:02.920
what does it tell you
about life before birth?

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.150
Where was I before I
came into this planet?

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:06.210
They're always obsessed

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.840
about what happens after they go out.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.480
Anyhow, no but, so that
certainly had a large influence,

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.083
you know thinking about
these big problems,

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:21.320
and I discovered, I learned
that the only way we can answer

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.920
these problems in any satisfactory
way is by doing science.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.320
I mean, it's great to do philosophy,

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.730
you can think about it,
everybody should do it,

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:30.670
but ultimately you
can't prove any of that.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.910
And so the only sure
touchstone we have seems to me

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:37.010
this empirical knowledge.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:39.980
The rest, we just have
to believe something.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.320
- Well, Christof, on that note,

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.320
I wanna thank you for sharing
your intellectual odyssey,

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.042
and also for being patient with us

00:48:50.042 --> 00:48:53.020
for trying to get into this,

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.480
the complexity that you're working on.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.560
I wanna show the audience your book again,

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.690
The Quest for Consciousness,
which I recommend highly.

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:05.100
And I wanna thank you very
much for being here today.

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.800
- Thank you very much,
Harry. It was a pleasure.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.130
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.474
for this Conversation with History.

00:49:11.474 --> 00:49:15.141
