00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.200
As we get into the second half of the 1930s,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.129
we see an increasingly aggressive Nazi Germany.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.694
In 1935, they publicly announce

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:14.233
their intent to rearm their military.

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:17.350
The reason why this is significant is not that they were

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.130
all of a sudden building their military.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.740
They, in fact, were doing this as soon as

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.761
they had taken power, in 1933.

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.170
But now, they felt confident enough

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.901
to publicly state their intention --

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.725
which is another way of publicly stating

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:32.300
that they [could n't] care less about the Treaty of Versailles,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.210
which had said that Germany was limited to

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.800
a 100,000-soldier military.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.089
Then, we get into 1936.

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.829
1936, you might remember --

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.640
another term of the Treaty of Versailles was that

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.949
Germany was not allowed to occupy the Rhineland --

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.230
this area in yellow right over here.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.620
And then that was actually reaffirmed in 1925

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.418
by the Treaties of Locarno, where Germany, itself,

00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:00.260
agreed to not occupy the Rhineland.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.720
But by 1936, Hitler decides to ignore all of those,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.900
and occupies the Rhineland.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.450
But once again the allies --

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.750
The French are not so happy about this.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.030
The UK, in particular, once again,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.019
[was] not super happy about this.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:19.840
But they decided this is not reason

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.369
to potentially start another war over.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.780
So they really don't push back on Germany.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.918
Then, we get into 1938,

00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:33.831
and German aggression really goes into full gear.

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:41.300
In March of 1938, you have a coup d'Ã©tat,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.240
orchestrated by the Nazis in Austria,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.170
that really overthrows the Austrian government

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.710
and allows the Germans to unify the two countries.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.170
So, you have the Germans come into Austria --

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.950
really a bloodless takeover.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.159
And there was already popular support

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.755
for the Nazis in Austria.

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:07.101
There was a Nazi party in Austria.

00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:08.965
There had been popular sentiment

00:02:08.965 --> 00:02:11.170
for many years, amongst many Austrians,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.934
to possibly be unified with the Germans.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.356
Austria [was and] is, fundamentally,

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:17.636
a German-speaking nation.

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:20.320
And so in March, this actually happens.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.380
This 'Anschluss' -- or unification.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.238
And, if you remember, that was also another

00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:30.340
forbidden term of the Treaty of Versailles.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.050
So now, the Germans are pretty much ignoring

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.060
the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of St. Germain,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.220
which was the equivalent of the Treaty of Versailles --

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.100
but with the Austrians.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.491
So, you have the unification of Germany and Austria.

00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:47.430
Then, as we get into late 1938 --

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.600
in September in particular --

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.040
Hitler and the Nazis are interested in bringing

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.940
the German-speaking populations

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.620
of Czechoslovakia under German control.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.085
And this region, right over here in magenta, this is where

00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:07.110
you have large populations of German speakers.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.279
These regions are collectively referred to

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:15.259
as the 'Sudetenland.'

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.700
And really, just continuing the policy of not wanting

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.260
to rock the boat with Germany,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.970
you have France, Great Britain, and Italy agreeing --

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.160
And Italy was an ally of the Germans.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.100
But France and Great Britain, in particular,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.540
are not interested in rocking the boat with the Germans.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.655
And so, in September of 1938,

00:03:34.655 --> 00:03:38.600
they sign the Munich Agreement,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.558
which did not actually --

00:03:40.558 --> 00:03:42.640
where they actually did not consult

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.400
the Czechoslovakian government --

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.819
where they allowed Germany

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.567
to take over this region right over here --

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:50.276
the Sudetenland.

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:52.319
And that, frankly, with the Germans taking over

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.092
this significant part of the population of Czechoslovakia,

00:03:57.092 --> 00:03:58.625
a significant part of

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:01.792
the industrial capacity of Czechoslovakia,

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:07.426
this eventually leads to early 1939,

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:09.221
where all of what we would now consider

00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:13.970
the Czech Republic -- this area right over here,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.620
all [of] this -- becomes a protectorate of Germany.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.840
So, they call it the 'Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.'

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.958
So, Bohemia and Moravia go to Germany.

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.660
And, so this is 1939.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.365
So, [by] 1939, [we have seen this pattern repeat itself

00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:39.089
during the previous] four years --

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:42.230
Nazi Germany ignoring the Treaty of Versailles,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.990
by rearming, by occupying the Rhineland,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.400
by unifying with Austria.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.720
Now, they're expanding their territory.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.040
They are actively allowed to take over

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.760
the German-speaking areas of Czechoslovakia,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.195
under the Munich agreement.

00:04:58.195 --> 00:04:59.621
And eventually, they're able to take over

00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:01.165
Bohemia and Moravia --

00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:05.760
all of what we would currently call the 'Czech Republic.'

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.240
And this general pattern of German aggression,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.740
[allowed] by the other powers in Europe

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.940
essentially allowing it to happen --

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.860
and, in particular, Great Britain allowing it to happen --

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.163
has been referred to as a 'policy of appeasement.'

00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:21.680
Obviously, the word 'appeasement' means

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.389
there is someone who is angry about something,

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.990
and you just don't want to make them any angrier --

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.160
you just let them do whatever they want --

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.776
this is, essentially, what was happening over here.

00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:31.750
And in hindsight, it might be easy to say,

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.740
"Hey, look!. They were allowing Germany to take over

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.150
more and more -- to become more aggressive,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.780
which made [Germany] more and more confident.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.080
And this would eventually lead to World War II."

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.720
But at the time, you do have to remember [that[

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.560
everyone still had a very strong memory

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.560
of what had happened in World War I.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.780
And no one was interested

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.091
in starting another [pan-European] war.

00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:54.300
And so, even [though] in hindsight,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.050
it's easy to say that the British --

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.558
in particular Neville Chamberlain,

00:05:59.558 --> 00:06:03.134
who was the Prime Minister from 1937 on --

00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:05.790
were weak and allowed German[y] --

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.510
Hitler -- to gain confidence, which eventually led to

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.298
the Nazi invasion of Poland in the fall of 1939.

00:06:15.298 --> 00:06:19.400
But it's easy to say that in hindsight.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.419
But what we see, as we get into 1939,

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.600
is an aggressive Germany, a Germany

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.740
that's not being checked by the other powers of Europe.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.919
And this is what eventually leads to September of 1939,

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.190
where, actually, the Germans and the Soviets agree

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.960
to partition Poland into their own spheres of influence,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.330
which allows Germany to invade Poland

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.210
in early September [of] 1939 --

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.590
which is, you could kind of say,

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.588
'the straw that broke the camel's back,'

00:06:49.588 --> 00:06:51.382
and is the beginning of --

00:06:51.382 --> 00:06:52.770
So, Poland invasion.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.160
The invasion of Poland.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.159
-- which is the beginning of World War II.
