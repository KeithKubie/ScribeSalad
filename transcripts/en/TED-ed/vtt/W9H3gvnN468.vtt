00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:20.468
Most people have heard of the Electoral College during presidential election years.

00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:23.271
But what exactly is the Electoral College?

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:26.985
Simply said, it is a group of people appointed by each state

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:31.267
who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States.

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.768
To understand how this process began and how it continues today,

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:42.587
we can look at the Constitution of the United States: article two, section one, clause two of the constitution.

00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:46.100
It specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.051
Since 1964, there have been 538 electors in each presidential election.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:55.101
How do they decide on the number 538?

00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:59.850
Well, the number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.336
435 representatives, plus 100 senators, and 3 electors from the District of Columbia.

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:09.817
Essentially, the Democratic candidate and Republican candidate

00:01:09.817 --> 00:01:16.035
are each trying to add up the electors in every state so that they surpass 270 electoral votes,

00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:20.885
or just over half the 538 votes, and win the presidency.

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:23.819
So how do states even get electoral votes?

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.252
Each state receives a particular number of electors based on population size.

00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:32.685
The census is conducted every 10 years, so every time the census happens,

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:36.134
states might gain or lose a few electoral votes.

00:01:36.134 --> 00:01:40.751
Let's say you're a voter in California, a state with 55 electoral votes.

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:46.219
If your candidate wins in California, they get all 55 of the state's electoral votes.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.318
If your candidate loses, they get none.

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:54.267
This is why many presidential candidates want to win states like Texas, Florida, and New York.

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:57.550
If you currently add up the electoral votes of those three states,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.983
you would have 96 electoral votes.

00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:05.753
Even if a candidate won North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming,

00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:10.318
Vermont, New Hampshire. Connecticut and West Virginia,

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:14.684
they would only gain 31 electoral votes total from those eight states.

00:02:14.684 --> 00:02:17.400
Here is where it can get a little tricky.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.885
On a rare occasion, like in the year 2000,

00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:25.051
someone can win the popular vote but fail to gain 270 electoral votes.

00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:30.336
This means that the winner may have won and collected their electoral votes by small margins,

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:33.701
winning just enough states with just enough electoral votes,

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:38.617
but the losing candidate may have captured large voter margins in the remaining states.

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:43.969
If this is the case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.817
would add up to over 50% of the ballots cast nationally.

00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:53.317
Therefore, the losing candidate may have gained more than 50% of the ballots cast by voters,

00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:57.169
but failed to gain 270 of the electoral votes.

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:04.085
Some critics of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to states with large numbers of electoral votes.

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:05.601
Think of it this way.

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:10.135
It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote -- not one vote --

00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:18.454
in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states:

00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:25.267
California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio,

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:31.001
Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia.

00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:34.286
This is why both parties pay attention to these states.

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:38.135
However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.351
such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire,

00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:44.651
and even geographically large states with small populations

00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.183
like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas.

00:03:48.183 --> 00:03:51.701
That's because a candidate can't completely ignore small states,

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.901
because in a close election, every electoral vote counts.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.751
There are certain states that have a long history of voting for a particular party.

00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:00.701
These are known as "safe states."

00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:07.868
For the past four election cycles -- in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 --

00:04:07.868 --> 00:04:13.517
Democrats could count on states like Oregon, Maryland, Michigan and Massachusetts,

00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:20.467
whereas the Republicans could count on states like Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas and Idaho.

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:24.300
States that are teetering between between parties are called "swing states."

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.368
In the past four election cycles, Ohio and Florida have been swing states,

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:32.434
twice providing electoral votes for a Democratic candidate,

00:04:32.434 --> 00:04:35.535
and twice providing electoral votes for a Republican candidate.

00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:38.634
Think about it. Do you live in a safe state?

00:04:38.634 --> 00:04:42.518
If so, is it a Democratic or Republican safe state?

00:04:42.518 --> 00:04:44.701
Do you live in a swing state?

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.685
Are your neighboring states swing or safe?

00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:51.452
Is the population in your state increasing or decreasing?

00:04:51.452 --> 00:04:56.484
And do not forget, when you are watching the electoral returns on election night every four years

00:04:56.484 --> 00:04:59.502
and the big map of the United States is on the screen,

00:04:59.502 --> 00:05:04.535
know that the magic number is 270 and start adding.
