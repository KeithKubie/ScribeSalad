00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If I use this equation and calculate the accelerations, I get 2, 3, and 4.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Think back on how we calculate these proportionality problems.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We set them up as ratios,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we realized that sometimes this ratio needs an exponent.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Maybe that exponent is 1 or 2 or -1 or -2.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's see what exponent we need here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's compare this data to that data.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This will be our A1 and F1--A1, F1--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and this'll be A2 and F2.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, this just has 4/1 = 40/10, and I'm keeping in mind that I might need an exponent.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
These 0s cancel and now we just have 4/1 = 4/1 to something.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Well, these are identical so this something is just 1.

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is exactly the definition of proportionality. A is proportional to F.
