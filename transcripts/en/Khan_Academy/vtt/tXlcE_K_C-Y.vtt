00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:02.963
- Let's say that you've got a bag,

00:00:02.963 --> 00:00:06.177
and in that bag you
put a bunch of marbles.

00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:08.980
So, let's say you put 50
of these magenta marbles.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.773
So one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:00:11.773 --> 00:00:14.756
I'm not gonna draw all of them
but you get the general idea.

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:18.862
There are going to be 50 magenta marbles,

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:24.850
and there's also going
to be 50 blue marbles.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.700
And what you do is, you have
these 100 marbles in there,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.871
half of them magenta, half of them blue.

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.531
And before picking a marble out,

00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:39.599
and you're gonna be blindfolded

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:41.915
when you pick a marble out, you shake

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:45.996
the bag really good to, so you think,

00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:47.702
mix them up a little bit.

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:50.546
And so, if you were to say theoretically,

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:52.729
what is the probability, if you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:54.645
stuck your hand in and you're not looking,

00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:59.645
what is the probability
of picking a magenta?

00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:03.433
I feel the need to write
magenta in magenta.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:08.433
What is the probability of
picking a magenta marble?

00:01:08.732 --> 00:01:11.164
Well, theoretically there's 100

00:01:11.164 --> 00:01:12.767
equally likely possibilities,

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.270
there's 100 marbles in the bag.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.770
And 50 of them involve picking a magenta.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.811
So, 50 out of 100, when this is

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:23.007
the same thing as a 1/2 probability.

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:24.654
So you could say, well, "Theoretically,

00:01:24.654 --> 00:01:26.662
"there is a 1/2 probability,
I just did the math."

00:01:26.662 --> 00:01:30.014
If you say these are 100
equally likely possibilities,

00:01:30.014 --> 00:01:32.242
50 of them are picking magenta.

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:34.719
Now let's say you actually
start doing the experiment.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.400
So you literally take a bag with

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.970
50 magenta marbles, 50 blue marbles,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.662
and then you start picking the marbles,

00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:45.771
and then you see what
marble color you picked,

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:48.169
and you put it back in,
and then you do it again.

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:52.458
And so, let's say that after every time

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:54.002
you put your hand in the bag and

00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:55.952
you take something out of the bag,

00:01:55.952 --> 00:01:57.380
and you observe what it is, we're gonna

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.877
call that an experiment.

00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:03.877
So, after 10 experiments,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.118
let's say that you you have picked out

00:02:13.118 --> 00:02:18.118
seven magenta and three blue.

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:28.518
So, is this strange that out
of the first 10 experiments,

00:02:29.364 --> 00:02:32.835
you haven't picked out exactly
half of them being magenta,

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:34.467
you've picked out seven magenta,

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:36.543
and then the other three were blue.

00:02:36.543 --> 00:02:38.747
Well no, this is definitely
a reasonable thing.

00:02:38.747 --> 00:02:41.977
If the true probability of
picking out a magenta is 1/2,

00:02:41.977 --> 00:02:43.960
it's definitely possible
that you could still

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.127
pick out seven magenta, that just

00:02:46.127 --> 00:02:48.897
happened to be what your fingers touched.

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:50.348
And this isn't a lot of experiments,

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:51.973
it's completely reasonable that out of 10,

00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:56.199
yeah, you could have,
later on in statistics

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.008
we'll define these things in more detail,

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:01.744
but there's enough variation in where

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:04.155
you might pick that you're
not going to always get,

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:06.282
especially with only 10 experiments,

00:03:06.282 --> 00:03:09.900
you're not definitely
going to get exactly 1/2.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.425
Instead of having five magenta,

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:13.906
it's completely reasonable
to have seven magenta.

00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:16.510
So, this really wouldn't
cause me a lot of pause.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.795
I still wouldn't question what I did here

00:03:19.795 --> 00:03:23.398
when I calculated this
theoretical probability.

00:03:23.398 --> 00:03:27.359
But let's say you have a
lot of time on your hands.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.359
And let's say after 10,000 trials here,

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:38.265
after 10,000 experiments,
and remember the experiment;

00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:41.310
you're sticking your hand
in the bag without looking,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.668
your fingers kind of feeling
around, picks out a marble,

00:03:44.668 --> 00:03:48.435
and you observe the marble
and you record what you found.

00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:51.328
And so, let's say after
10,000 experiments,

00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:56.322
you get 7,000 magenta.

00:03:56.322 --> 00:03:58.003
Actually I'm gonna do
slightly different numbers,

00:03:58.003 --> 00:03:59.464
so let me make it even more extreme.

00:03:59.464 --> 00:04:04.304
Let's say you get 8,000 magenta

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.691
and you have 2,000 blue.

00:04:13.598 --> 00:04:15.552
Now this is interesting, because here

00:04:15.552 --> 00:04:17.330
what you're seeing experimentally

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.955
seems to be very different.

00:04:18.955 --> 00:04:21.218
And now you have a large number

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.504
of trials right over here, not just 10.

00:04:23.504 --> 00:04:26.518
10 is completely reasonable that,

00:04:26.518 --> 00:04:27.662
hey you know, I got seven magenta and

00:04:27.662 --> 00:04:29.605
three blue instead of five and five,

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:33.821
but now you've done 10,000.

00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:34.836
You would've expected if this was

00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:37.088
the true probability,
you would've expected

00:04:37.088 --> 00:04:39.398
that half of these would've been magenta,

00:04:39.398 --> 00:04:41.992
only 5,000 magenta and 5,000 blue,

00:04:41.992 --> 00:04:43.951
but you got 8,000 magenta.

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:46.434
Now, this is within the
realm of possibility

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:49.761
if the true probability of
picking a magenta is 1/2,

00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:52.924
but it's very unlikely
that you would've gotten

00:04:52.924 --> 00:04:54.775
this result with this many experiments,

00:04:54.775 --> 00:04:57.550
this many trials if the
true probability was 1/2.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.549
Here your experimental
probability is showing,

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:05.185
look, out of 10,000 trials,

00:05:08.893 --> 00:05:13.140
experimental probability here is

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.901
you had 10,000 trials,
or 10,000 experiments

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.305
I guess you could say.

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:24.305
And and in 8,000 of them,
you got a magenta marble.

00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:30.389
And so, this is going to be 80%, or 8/10.

00:05:32.587 --> 00:05:34.958
So, there seems to be a difference here.

00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.615
The reason why I would
take this more seriously

00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:39.844
is that you had a lot of trials here,

00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:43.189
you did this 10,000 times.

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.219
If the true probability was one half,

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.146
it's very low likelihood that you

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.384
would've gotten this many magenta.

00:05:49.384 --> 00:05:50.687
So, when you think about it you're like,

00:05:50.687 --> 00:05:53.113
"What's going on here, what are

00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:55.040
"possible explanations for this?"

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.189
This, I wouldn't have fretted about,

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.232
after 10 experiments, not a big deal.

00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:01.473
But after 10,000, this
would have caused me pause.

00:06:01.473 --> 00:06:02.760
Well, why would this happen,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.130
I mixed up the bag every time.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.045
And there're some different possibilities;

00:06:06.045 --> 00:06:09.412
maybe the blue marbles
are slightly heavier,

00:06:09.412 --> 00:06:11.794
and so when you shake the bag up enough,

00:06:11.794 --> 00:06:13.847
the blue marbles settled to the bottom,

00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:17.462
and you're more likely
to pick a magenta marble.

00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:20.190
Maybe the blue marbles
have a slightly different

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.768
texture to them, in which case, maybe

00:06:23.768 --> 00:06:26.187
they slip out of your hands,
or they're less likely

00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:27.551
to be gripped on, and so you're

00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:29.606
more likely to pick a magenta.

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:31.649
So, I don't know the explanation,

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:33.101
I don't know what's going on in that bag,

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.318
but if I thought theoretically

00:06:35.318 --> 00:06:37.198
that the probability should be 1/2,

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:39.335
because half of the marbles are magenta,

00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:41.076
but I'm seeing through my experiments

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:43.038
that 80% of what I'm picking out,

00:06:43.038 --> 00:06:44.710
especially if I did 10,000 of them,

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.008
if I did this 10,000 times, well,

00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:49.485
this is going to cause me some pause.

00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:50.769
I would really start to think about

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:53.660
whether it's truly equally likely for me

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.562
to pick out a red, a
magenta versus a blue.

00:06:56.562 --> 00:06:59.207
Something else must be going on.
