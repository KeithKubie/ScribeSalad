[NOISE]

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.310
Are

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.780
you spending too much time on debugging?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.100
Are you lost in a mess of code?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.480
Do bugs make you want to smash something?

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.060
Wait! Do you know that there's a Udacity course on

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.894
debugging? I am Andreas Zeller, and in my course, you

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:47.214
will learn how to debug programs systematically, and we'll even

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:52.158
see and build automatic tools that do the debugging for you.

00:00:52.158 --> 00:01:02.158
