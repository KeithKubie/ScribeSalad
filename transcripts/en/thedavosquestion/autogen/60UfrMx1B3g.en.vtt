sure that what we commit to ultimately

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539
sure that what we commit to ultimately
 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.480
sure that what we commit to ultimately
happens i think that the major gap

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490
happens i think that the major gap
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.679
happens i think that the major gap
resides and then the big distance there

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
resides and then the big distance there
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.210
resides and then the big distance there
is between what people say they're going

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220
is between what people say they're going
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950
is between what people say they're going
to do and what they are ultimately doing

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
to do and what they are ultimately doing
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.050
to do and what they are ultimately doing
so it's basically the values in action

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
so it's basically the values in action
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.450
so it's basically the values in action
and the lack of a sort of a network or

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
and the lack of a sort of a network or
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.370
and the lack of a sort of a network or
mutual accountability would make things

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
mutual accountability would make things
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860
mutual accountability would make things
really happened so I think that most

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
really happened so I think that most
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200
really happened so I think that most
leaders express their commitment to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
leaders express their commitment to

doing something but then when it comes

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
doing something but then when it comes
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.910
doing something but then when it comes
down to execution we run short and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
down to execution we run short and
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.069
down to execution we run short and
making it really happen and realistic so

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
making it really happen and realistic so
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840
making it really happen and realistic so
I think there's two things that should

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
I think there's two things that should
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.490
I think there's two things that should
happen the first one is there should be

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
happen the first one is there should be
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.450
happen the first one is there should be
a level of trust of an invitation for

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
a level of trust of an invitation for
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.860
a level of trust of an invitation for
people to raise their hand when they're

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
people to raise their hand when they're
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900
people to raise their hand when they're
see anyone else deviating from their

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
see anyone else deviating from their
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819
see anyone else deviating from their
word or their original commitment and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
word or their original commitment and
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.510
word or their original commitment and
the second one is for those years to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
the second one is for those years to
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490
the second one is for those years to
build operational implications on a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
build operational implications on a
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.890

personal consequences when those things

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
personal consequences when those things
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.649
personal consequences when those things
are ultimately not happen so I think

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
are ultimately not happen so I think
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.380
are ultimately not happen so I think
it's a matter of the walk and of the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
it's a matter of the walk and of the
 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.230
it's a matter of the walk and of the
talk of the work rather than the talk so

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
talk of the work rather than the talk so
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.760
talk of the work rather than the talk so
I think the top is fine that I think

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
I think the top is fine that I think
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039
I think the top is fine that I think
where we where we lose our consciousness

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049
where we where we lose our consciousness
 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.410
where we where we lose our consciousness
is when we execute when we say we're

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
is when we execute when we say we're
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.500
is when we execute when we say we're
going to and we don't do it
