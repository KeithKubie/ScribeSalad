[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.324 --> 00:00:07.282
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Hello.

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.460
MATIAS DUARTE: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.876
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Matias and I have

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.680
been talking about
how we were going

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.110
to-- what kind of fireside--
by the way, no fire

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.920
to be near at all here.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.710
Very upsetting.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.084
We were talking
about how we were

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:21.890
going to have this conversation
because historically, I've

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.557
interviewed Matias about
various topics, usually design.

00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:27.140
But we thought it
would be interesting

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.550
if we interviewed each
other, and so we both have

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.040
a set of cards
today and we're both

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.870
going to be asking questions.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
And it could be a disaster,
or could be magical,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.000
or something in the middle.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.870
So Matias, I think
you wanted to lead.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.774
MATIAS DUARTE: I did.

00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:43.680
Thank you, Josh.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.220
Good morning again.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.440
We've been talking for about
10 years, I think, on and off,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.030
different products.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.110
And it's always
been in the context

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.100
of looking at the products
that me or my team

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.140
have been responsible
for designing.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.220
And you and your team have been
doing this kind of critique

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.520
and reporting on,
I think, products

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.395
from a lot of people in
the audience as well.

00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:11.311
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Yeah.

00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:13.290
We've been tearing
down and tearing apart

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.820
your hard work for
years and years.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.950
MATIAS DUARTE: Heartless,
honest criticism.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.649
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Brutal.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.940
MATIAS DUARTE: But that was
actually my first question.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.950
Normally, your
stage is one where

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.510
you're critiquing
products and results.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.410
What would you say
to this audience

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.660
if you have an opportunity
to talk before they actually

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.545
create a product?

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:38.920
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Well, it
depends on what kind of product

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.795
you're talking about.

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:41.500
But I will say-- you
know what I would

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.590
say if I could talk to
anybody before they create

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.040
a product, particularly
companies that are large,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.600
the Google size companies?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.150
MATIAS DUARTE: Oh, I see.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.890
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
I think, actually,

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.630
Google does a pretty good job--

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.230
MATIAS DUARTE: Just
a few of those.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.896
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: But
not everybody does.

00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:57.050
What I would say is
don't do focus groups.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.665
Don't listen to small
groups of people

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:03.610
that you bring into a room and
ask them specific questions

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.880
about how you make a product.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419
I would say make a product
that you think is awesome

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.590
and that you love and that the
people that you know and care

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.020
about and understand
get how it works

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.180
and like it and want to use it.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.689
Because I've seen
so many companies

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:20.980
do this thing where they go in.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.396
You'll go into a
meeting with them

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:24.900
and they show you this
product and they say,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.957
we did user testing and we found
that 9 times out of 10, users

00:02:28.957 --> 00:02:30.290
prefer this to this other thing.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.380
And it's like your group
is so weird and small.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.395
You put them in such
an odd environment.

00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:37.020
And you can learn
some things about how

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.300
people-- how the general public
might interact with something.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.700
But that I think the best
design, the best products,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.220
come from really
smart people trying

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.121
to solve their own problems.

00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:51.620
Trying to solve problems that
they really deeply understand.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.190
And so when you
get to a situation

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.680
where you're trying to solve
somebody else's problems

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.990
and you're using these very
artificial environments

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.450
to validate whether
your solve has worked,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.090
I feel like it can
often lead to disaster.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.870
So I guess what I'm saying
is follow your heart when

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.564
it comes to design.

00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:12.230
That make sense?

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.950
MATIAS DUARTE:
That's inspirational.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.350
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Is
that what you're doing?

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.200
MATIAS DUARTE:
Follow your heart.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.800
That's good.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.690
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Do
you find that you're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.565
doing that at Google?

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:19.179
Are you following your heart?

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:20.220
MATIAS DUARTE: We don't--

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.178
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Or are
you following a mandate

00:03:22.178 --> 00:03:23.090
from far beyond you?

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.680
MATIAS DUARTE: Not a mandate.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.270
That's actually a good question.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.970
Because it really
resonates with me

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.700
when you talk about
not doing focus groups,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.230
not trying to decide
what is the right course

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.920
to pursue by kind of
being unopinionated.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.890
I actually think design
always should be opinionated.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.530
But it bothers me a little bit
to think about design being

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.090
limited to solving
your own problems only.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.870
I mean, I almost
think it's easier

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.541
to solve your own problems.

00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:52.540
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Really?

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.605
When people have as
many problems as they do

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:55.240
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.130
I feel like my life
would be way easier

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.190
if I could solve
my own problems.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.830
MATIAS DUARTE: Not in that way.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.496
Not in that way.

00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:00.386
Right?

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.260
What I mean is, one of
the biggest challenges

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.690
we have as designers
is to pull ourselves

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.890
and our own perspective
out of the problems.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.410
It's to really understand
somebody else's problems.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.070
And I don't think
focus groups are a way

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.190
to understand whether
you've successfully

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.760
solved the other
person's problem or not.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.080
Maybe it's one of-- I actually
dislike focus groups because I

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.520
think of them mostly
as a marketing tool.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.160
But there is all sorts of
different types of research

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.110
techniques that
are about gaining

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.500
an understanding of
different people, people

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.410
who are different than
you and putting yourself

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.079
in their point of view.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:44.620
We had dinner last
night and somebody

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.800
was railing against empathy
as an overused buzzword.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.180
So I think we're going to
have to have the empathy shot

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.442
drinking game whenever
that word gets used.

00:04:54.442 --> 00:04:56.400
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Well,
we do have these drinks.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.880
MATIAS DUARTE: We do.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.310
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Matias and I thought

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.830
it would be great
to have mimosas

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.669
in the morning on stage.

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.210
MATIAS DUARTE:
Terrible or brilliant.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.418
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I don't
know if it was a great idea.

00:05:05.418 --> 00:05:08.150
MATIAS DUARTE: I don't think so.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.490
But as much as empathy
might be abused--

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.990
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
So we have to drink

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.800
every time you say empathy?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.775
Is that the game?

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:14.440
MATIAS DUARTE: Yeah,
you keep drinking.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.952
I'm just going to
keep saying it.

00:05:15.952 --> 00:05:17.660
As much as it might
be abused or misused,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.330
I actually think that
concept of putting yourself

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.880
in somebody else's
shoes, of stepping out

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.410
of your needs and your values,
that's really important.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.610
That's really critical.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.330
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I'm not saying
don't think about other people.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.830
What I'm saying is
don't create an--

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.480
MATIAS DUARTE: Yes, you are.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.800
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
No, I'm saying don't

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.470
create an artificial
environment where

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.800
you think you're
going to figure out

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.383
what the problems
of other people are.

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:41.450
I think-- maybe
I can expand this

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.410
and say I'm saying solve
problems that you see,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.092
that you understand.

00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:48.300
But I feel like when you
put people in an environment

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.350
where you're sort
of artificially

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.040
asking them to
give you feedback,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.081
you don't end up with the
right kind of feedback.

00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:54.269
I do think data is powerful.

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:55.810
I think using data
in the right way--

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.601
MATIAS DUARTE: Behavioral
data is powerful.

00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:01.860
Asking people opinions really
can be valuable, but fraught

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.140
with danger, right?

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.500
People are not very good
observers of themselves.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.340
They're not very good
judges of their own value.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.310
I think anybody who
has kids knows this.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.990
What's the famous line?

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.870
Where if you asked a million
people to design a car for you,

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.260
they'd all have cup
holders and mini fridges

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.624
and V8 engines and--

00:06:20.624 --> 00:06:22.165
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
American car, you're

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:23.415
talking about an American car.

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:28.180
It would be the entire car
would be cup holders, no seats.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.680
All right.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.510
So--

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.330
MATIAS DUARTE: Throw one at me.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.455
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: You disagree
with my basic concept

00:06:32.455 --> 00:06:34.840
about my advice for designers.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.190
So we actually were
talking about-- I saw you

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.320
in New York-- we have a
lot of social engagements.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.350
I saw you in New York and we
were talking about UI design

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.100
and where everything is going.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.560
We've talked about
this, obviously,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.260
throughout the years.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.500
And if you look across, now,
the major platforms in mobile,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.270
Android, iOS,
Windows Phone-- yes,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.040
I'm throwing that in there.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.390
It is a platform that exists.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.812
So if you look across
those platforms,

00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:05.520
and a lot of those
platforms are starting

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.720
to inform what we see on
other screen sizes, right?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.390
If you look at the
new OS, OS X, it's

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.240
very much like mimicking
what has happened in iOS.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.940
Obviously across
Google products,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.980
Chromebooks and Chrome
and email and everything

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.344
is moving towards
a unified place.

00:07:22.344 --> 00:07:24.760
But it's a very-- to me, and
if you look at Windows Phone,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.676
it's actually sort of
in a very similar space.

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:31.900
It's very flat, it's very
clean, it's very spacious.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.440
And I'm not saying
that I want to have

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.620
skeuomorphic be a thing again.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.120
But I do feel like--
I mean, have we

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.300
lost a little bit of-- are we
past the moment where people

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.700
are really excited about what
you could do in those spaces?

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.450
And are we in the little valley
between the peaks where we're

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.870
going to just ride this very
familiar, very similar--

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.945
Because honestly, you could
put an iOS device and something

00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:57.515
with material design in
front of a random person who

00:07:57.515 --> 00:07:58.890
doesn't really
know the platforms

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.389
and they may not be able to
tell you that they're different,

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:03.070
dramatically
different platforms.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.072
Apple even has a
back motion now.

00:08:05.072 --> 00:08:07.280
You've got your back button,
they've got their Swype.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.695
So are we in the valley of
sameness right now in design?

00:08:12.695 --> 00:08:14.570
MATIAS DUARTE: So you're
saying you're bored.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.110
As a technologist, you're bored.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.930
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I'm
saying I miss felt

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.660
and other surface--
I miss wood textures.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.510
No, but I'm saying
that it is-- things

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.630
are not as differentiated
as they once were.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.530
I actually booted up a
Palm device the other day,

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.930
because I'm sick person.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.310
A very sick person.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:30.800
MATIAS DUARTE: I saw that.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.133
Spotify still works, apparently.

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:35.340
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Spotify still
works, which is really insane.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.390
Kudos to Spotify, by
the way, for really

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.909
keeping legacy products going.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.128
But yeah, I looked
at that and it

00:08:41.128 --> 00:08:42.669
felt like the old--
it felt very much

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.395
like that old, the early days
of when we were figuring out,

00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:46.770
it was very
skeuomorphic, there's

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.395
some skeuomorphic
stuff going on there.

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:49.061
So I don't know.

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:51.510
Yeah, I feel like we're a
little bit of a down period.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.210
I mean, material
design is beautiful.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.802
I'm contractually obligated to
say that to you while I'm here.

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:57.260
MATIAS DUARTE: I
think you actually

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.440
have-- you have to say it
three more times before you

00:08:59.440 --> 00:08:59.700
get offstage.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.660
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Perhaps the
most beautiful mobile operating

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.782
system that's ever been created.

00:09:02.782 --> 00:09:04.240
I have one more
and I hit my quota.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.490
So tell me, what do you think?

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.060
Am I crazy?

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.685
Can you empathize
with what I'm saying?

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:13.226
MATIAS DUARTE: Now
you have to drink.

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:15.350
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I
think you have to drink.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.570
MATIAS DUARTE: No,
I think it's true.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.420
There is a certain sense
of fashion, I think,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:27.200
that starts to play into
design that we see now.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.830
Actually, kind of,
it was always there.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.610
I'm almost tempted
to say that there's

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.490
a fashion in digital design that
maybe is more pronounced now

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.340
because some of the
technology is more mature.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.270
Some of the capabilities, in
terms of resolution, rendering,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.380
and animation and everything
is more pronounced.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.980
And so that gives us kind of
a greater expressive range.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.730
And with that greater
expressive range,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.580
we now have a little bit
of a sense of fashion.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:04.840
I think there's also an
element of fundamental needs

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.269
and convergent common
successful solutions.

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:11.810
It's kind of like
the keyboard thing.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.140
You have the QWERTY keyboard,
and the DVORAK keyboard

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.985
is superior to it in terms
of theoretical efficiency--

00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:21.860
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Do you
personally feel that?

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.610
MATIAS DUARTE: I haven't
done the studies,

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.210
but according to what I
read, in terms of pure typing

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.230
efficiency, it should be better.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.720
But it's this marginal
improvement, and so, you know,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.220
it's OK.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.350
Everybody sticks with
the standard keyboard.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.310
Right now, you'd
be insane to try

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.260
to launch a product that has
a keyboard concept, right,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.240
like a display, whether
it's virtual or physical,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.492
that has a keyboard
layout that's not QWERTY.

00:10:45.492 --> 00:10:46.950
I see this all the
time, like I see

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.942
a television will come out and
be like, A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

00:10:49.942 --> 00:10:52.400
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: That's actually
very common on television.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.817
MATIAS DUARTE: I
know, it's crazy.

00:10:53.817 --> 00:10:55.941
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Is just
a standard keyboard layout

00:10:55.941 --> 00:10:57.022
better on a television?

00:10:57.022 --> 00:10:58.480
Is that easier for
us to parse when

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.160
you're that abstracted
from the surface?

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.480
MATIAS DUARTE: I don't
know that it's better.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.720
It's just, it it's
familiar enough

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.550
that the familiarity
kind of overwhelms

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.184
the potential
optimized benefits.

00:11:12.184 --> 00:11:13.600
We were talking
about this before.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.500
There's always this
tension between doing

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.080
something new that's marginally
better and the switching costs.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:28.780
And so I think there are periods
of consolidation, if you will,

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.479
or settling in terms of--

00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:31.520
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Valleys.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.770
MATIAS DUARTE: --paradigms.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.380
I think of them
more as plateaus.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.080
I like to be
optimistic about it.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.850
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: That is a very
pessimistic view, isn't it?

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.920
MATIAS DUARTE: Yeah.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.750
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I guess-- well,
plateau also sounds bad to me.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.130
MATIAS DUARTE: Why?

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.130
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: If you've
reached-- that's it.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.322
You're flatlined up there.

00:11:42.322 --> 00:11:43.780
MATIAS DUARTE: It's
a stable place.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.569
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: How
can you go beyond it?

00:11:45.569 --> 00:11:46.610
What are you going to do?

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.050
MATIAS DUARTE: But that's
the challenge, right?

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.370
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Tell us
how you're going to go--

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.911
MATIAS DUARTE: In
order to go beyond,

00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:52.340
I think you need to
provide a lot more value.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.030
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: OK, I get that.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.220
I think that makes sense.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.750
MATIAS DUARTE: So let
me ask you a question.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.240
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Oh boy.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.740
Yeah.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.565
MATIAS DUARTE: So now
you're at Bloomberg.

00:11:59.565 --> 00:12:00.440
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Yes.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.857
MATIAS DUARTE: No longer
a tech journalist--

00:12:02.857 --> 00:12:04.440
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Well, I still dabble.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.898
MATIAS DUARTE:
--model slash actor.

00:12:05.898 --> 00:12:08.000
Now you're just journalist.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.920
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I
also model slash actor.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.240
Don't forget about my side job.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.364
MATIAS DUARTE: That's true.

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:15.325
But you were talking about
some of design challenges

00:12:15.325 --> 00:12:16.450
that you have there, right?

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.500
So this seems like
it's not just something

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.750
you're observing in the world.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.670
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I
actually have a card

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.480
that I was going
to ask you, which

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.720
is, does print design
make you a little angry?

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.690
MATIAS DUARTE: I hear
it makes you angry.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.065
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: You know
what, I mean, here's the thing.

00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:29.560
So before going to Bloomberg,
I was at a startup.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.340
And we were all digital.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.120
There was no paper
component anywhere.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.860
By the way, there's
probably a lot

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.160
of people in this room who are
not going to feel this at all.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.510
There are people sitting in this
room who are app developers,

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.676
and they're working completely
in the digital space,

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:42.540
and they don't care
about print at all.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.930
And I didn't care about
print at all, really.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.304
I mean, I love
reading magazines,

00:12:45.304 --> 00:12:46.450
but I never had to think--

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.450
MATIAS DUARTE: So you went from
neglect to downright anger.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.408
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I never
had to think about it.

00:12:50.408 --> 00:12:52.269
So I came to Bloomberg,
and they have

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:53.810
a publication called
"Business Week."

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.270
I think it's brilliant,
one of the best paper

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.560
magazines in the world.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.617
I think it's incredible.

00:12:59.617 --> 00:13:01.200
And then I started
sitting and watch--

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.390
I would watch the design
teams design for print.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.764
And I started to formulate this.

00:13:06.764 --> 00:13:08.180
Of course, I've
always known this,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.400
but I started to think,
god, this is so annoying.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.655
You have a set page size.

00:13:13.655 --> 00:13:16.330
You know there's one thing
you can do with the page.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.670
You're going to
look at it and then

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.230
turn it over to the next page.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.950
And what a dream it must
be to sit down every day

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.130
and go, how can I make
this fixed thing that I can

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.660
do anything I want to
in terms of design, how

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.330
can I make this look good?

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.420
And so I started to
get a little bit angry

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.440
as we were going
through the process.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.834
We just launched a site called
Bloomberg Politics where

00:13:34.834 --> 00:13:36.250
we were going
through this process

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.791
of how do you bring
the best of print

00:13:37.791 --> 00:13:40.330
and how do you make
something feel really--

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.150
News design is
actually difficult,

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.310
and it's a real practice.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.280
And how do you bring traditional
news design to the web?

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.990
I think we move the ball
little bit with The Verge.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.960
And then I'm trying
to do some new things

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.737
and take it somewhere
new at Bloomberg,

00:13:52.737 --> 00:13:55.320
but it was really frustrating,
because you get to these places

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.024
where you have this
beautiful design

00:13:57.024 --> 00:13:58.690
and you're like, oh,
wait a second, when

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.314
it goes to a mobile
phone it looks bad.

00:14:00.314 --> 00:14:02.119
Or oh, we forgot about
the three by two.

00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:03.910
Does everybody know
what a three by two is?

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.035
Raise your hand if you know
what a three by two is.

00:14:06.035 --> 00:14:06.551
Really?

00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:07.050
Nobody?

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.460
MATIAS DUARTE: Yes, see?

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.290
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: One person.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:08.720
MATIAS DUARTE: Nobody knows.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.180
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Two people.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.410
MATIAS DUARTE: What
is this three by two?

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.201
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: OK,
if you're doing design

00:14:12.201 --> 00:14:15.070
for the web in an ad
supported environment,

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.652
there's an ad unit which
is 300 by 250 pixels.

00:14:18.652 --> 00:14:20.110
It's on every
website in the world.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.460
It sits in the-- usually
in the right hand corner.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.370
And as you start to
design for the web,

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.940
and particularly in news design,
which is information dense,

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.212
you realize that we're really
just designing around--

00:14:30.212 --> 00:14:31.670
it must be wonderful
for people who

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.140
don't have to think
about advertising.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.820
We're designing around
the three by two.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.590
That's basically the main
anchor of design on the web

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.530
if you're dealing
with advertising.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.980
And it's totally insane.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.880
And it's been happening
for like 20 years.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.950
And there's no way to
stop, because advertisers

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.000
are-- they don't
move that quickly.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.719
They certainly don't move as
quickly as people in this room.

00:14:50.719 --> 00:14:52.260
Anyhow, so it's just
very frustrating

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.426
when you look at what it's
like to design for a very

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:55.960
static place versus
designing for,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.570
now, every breakpoint
you can possibly imagine

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.179
imagine, every view type
you can possibly dream of.

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:03.220
So I got very frustrated.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.511
I got very mad at-- I mean,
I love the print designers,

00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:07.779
but I kind of shake my fist
every time I walk past.

00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:09.570
You don't have to worry
about that, though.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.810
And you don't have
to worry about ads.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.150
That's a whole
other part of Google

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.340
that has to worry about ads.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.230
All you have to do is
make beautiful things.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.592
How I'm getting angry at you.

00:15:17.592 --> 00:15:18.800
But it is it-- I'm actually--

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.620
MATIAS DUARTE: We have
lots of sizes to work with.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.410
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I'm
actually curious--

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.460
MATIAS DUARTE: Have
some empathy for me.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.610
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Oh yeah,
I have a lot of empathy.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.680
So I actually was talking
to some your Google buddies

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.530
about the process for design.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.597
And you've got-- you're
focused largely on Android,

00:15:33.597 --> 00:15:35.430
I mean, the design that
you're doing touches

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.070
all sorts of other things.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.007
But you're not the only
person doing design at Google.

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:41.590
There are other
pieces of the company.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.620
There's Chrome.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.850
MATIAS DUARTE: It used to
be that Google would only

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.850
have one designer, but
we've gone past that.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.313
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Just one guy, they

00:15:46.313 --> 00:15:47.688
would just put
stuff on his desk.

00:15:47.688 --> 00:15:50.149
But no, you've got a Chrome
team, you've got an email team.

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:51.690
You've got all these
designers spread

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.314
across lots of
different products, lots

00:15:53.314 --> 00:15:54.620
of different breakpoints.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.230
So how do you-- how would a
company the size of Google,

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.950
and one that has historically
not been known, I mean,

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.830
if we look back not that
long ago at Google design,

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.769
we look at things
like Honeycomb.

00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:08.560
Does anybody remember
Honeycomb on Android?

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.260
It looked like Tron.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.720
And older Google products
not that long ago.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.750
Google Reader, think about what
it used to actually look like.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.720
Not known for design.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.094
How do you get
everybody together

00:16:19.094 --> 00:16:21.740
and start collaborating
on good design

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.380
that is not just
beautiful and useful,

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.680
but that is aligned across
all these different silos?

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.280
Maybe they're not silos.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.670
MATIAS DUARTE:
Yeah, I don't know

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.300
if there's any general
lessons to be drawn from it,

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.550
but just speaking from our
experience, material design,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.260
kind of as a story,
as a back story,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.230
it's kind of like an insurgency.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.280
It was not a formal, top
down kind of process.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.380
But it came, at a
certain point, to take

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.640
on that character,
where we did take

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:57.060
on a mantle of authority
which was necessary,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.830
I think to drive as
much change as we did.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.930
But initially, it really
was the design leaders

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:07.371
in various groups who
were all heads down,

00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:08.579
trying to make things better.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.220
And we just built relationships.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.832
And we'd sit around
and we'd talk about

00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:14.099
what are we going to do.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:18.190
And all of a sudden this idea
started to kind of trickle

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:23.605
together, like, well, we if
we kind of did this together?

00:17:23.605 --> 00:17:25.371
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: So you formed--

00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:26.329
MATIAS DUARTE: A cabal.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:27.810
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: A committee.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:28.770
MATIAS DUARTE: No,
not a committee.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.100
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: You'd say
it is design by committee.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.140
Is that how you
would describe it?

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:31.890
MATIAS DUARTE: No.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.515
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: But
what you described

00:17:33.515 --> 00:17:35.670
does sound kind of a little
bit like a committee,

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.050
you will agree.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.540
MATIAS DUARTE: I don't think so.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.030
It's a group of designers.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:41.620
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: A cabal.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.080
MATIAS DUARTE: A cabal.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.590
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: OK.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.400
MATIAS DUARTE: I
think all large design

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.720
problems have to be
tackled by groups.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.520
Typically, a lot of
these groups have

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.320
kind of a formal organization
or formal authority.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.130
And we took on a formal
authority at Google

00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.380
with material design later.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.950
But initially it
really was informal.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.270
It was a set of--

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.645
No, I'm going to wrap
the flag around myself.

00:18:06.645 --> 00:18:09.440
I'm going to say it was
a set of design patriots

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.177
who rallied together under
a common vision and said,

00:18:13.177 --> 00:18:14.760
you know what, we're
going to risk it,

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.272
we're going to try to do this.

00:18:17.272 --> 00:18:18.730
And that's kind of
how it happened.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.250
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: So does that
touch everything at Google now?

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.890
I mean, will all products--
does material design

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.120
become a bible at Google
for how you do design?

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.200
MATIAS DUARTE: It
becomes a guideline.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.170
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Not a bible.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.020
MATIAS DUARTE: Yeah,
we're not big on bibles.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.490
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: You
don't want to say

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.913
that a committee
produced the Bible, is

00:18:29.913 --> 00:18:31.250
that what you're telling me?

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.460
MATIAS DUARTE: A committee did
produce the Bible, actually.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.656
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: That's a
rabbit hole you probably

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:37.656
don't want to go down
this early in the morning.

00:18:37.656 --> 00:18:41.090
But getting back to Google,
you've got disparate teams,

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.590
right?

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.040
You've got people who've got
to design a lot of products

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.560
for a lot different
places, but they

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.809
have to work off of something.

00:18:45.809 --> 00:18:47.350
So you've got to get buy in.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.790
Is it just collective?

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.390
Collectively, people
buy in and say,

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.640
of course we want this design?

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.302
Don't you have dissent?

00:18:53.302 --> 00:18:55.760
Aren't there people who say,
why is that button down there?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.770
MATIAS DUARTE: Oh sure, yeah.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:57.440
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: What
do you do to them?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.410
MATIAS DUARTE: Yeah, it
happens all the time.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.035
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Where do you put them?

00:19:00.035 --> 00:19:02.210
MATIAS DUARTE: Well, you
do-- at a certain point,

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.590
you have to make decisions.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.550
So we have a small
team that is actually

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:10.100
responsible for material design
as a product, as a thing,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.850
as a guideline.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.820
This is no different
than any other company.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.530
At a certain point,
you reach a scale

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.160
where somebody has to be
responsible for the brand book

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.170
or somebody has to be
responsible for a UI

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:19.730
guidelines.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.370
Somebody has to be responsible
for a higher level structure.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.120
And the teams have
to work with that.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.130
And it's actually
one of things I

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.100
think is really
interesting about creating

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.290
guidelines and
creating structures.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.100
There's a very fine
balance between giving

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:41.080
too little guidance and actually
not helping people and giving

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.280
so much guidance you become
kind of a straitjacket.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.510
What I like to do--

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.634
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Wait, give
me a real world example

00:19:47.634 --> 00:19:49.530
of both of those scenarios.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.700
That's very vague, but
give me a specific example

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.390
of what you're talking about.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.390
MATIAS DUARTE: Well, OK.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.420
Take anything in the
material design guidelines.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.110
The spec.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.443
I don't know if in fact we
actually use spec externally.

00:19:59.443 --> 00:20:02.830
We always called it
the spec internally.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.200
So take anything.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.995
Take the FAB, the big
primary action button.

00:20:06.995 --> 00:20:08.370
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
The thing that's

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.411
in the right hand corner?

00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:11.900
MATIAS DUARTE: The thing that
can sit in the right hand

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.880
corner or really can
sit anywhere on screen.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.560
And actually, the position
is a perfect example of this.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:23.090
We recognized that there
was a drive and desire

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.050
to elevate the most important
functions of an application.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.970
And in fact, there's
kind of a design forcing

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.790
function that's really positive
that happens where you say,

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:36.870
OK, you have an opportunity
to say your application is

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.590
about the content
that you see on screen

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.630
and one additional kind of
metaconcept, something that

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.820
can't be visualized
with content.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.450
And when you do that, you
get simpler interactions.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.610
You get simpler products.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.440
You get simpler designs.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.569
So let's create this
design pattern that says,

00:20:55.569 --> 00:20:56.860
this is how you should do this.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.160
This is how things should look.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.576
We're going to
take this one thing

00:20:59.576 --> 00:21:03.150
and we're going to elevate it
literally on a higher surface,

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.410
call it out with color, with
shape, give you all these cues

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.470
to say this is really important.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.320
So we had all sorts of
examples of how to do this.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.550
And one of the
things that we liked

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.970
in the process of
calling that out

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.980
is that we liked that it
breaks across borders.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.090
So it either sits
on top of content

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.940
or, even more
dramatically, it sits

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.860
across a breakpoint of content.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:29.510
So it can sit where a card
surface goes onto a background,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.230
and it can sit half
and half on that.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.846
Or between a header and a
lower piece of content, and it

00:21:34.846 --> 00:21:36.370
can sit half and half on that.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.590
And the tension of
breaking that line

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.710
draws even more
attention to the object.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.090
So it's all these
practical layout tricks

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.750
that help elevate the
user's focus to it.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.392
So then an app says, does
this make sense for me?

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:50.850
Does this make
sense for my screen?

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.720
I've got a product and
there's no primary meta-thing

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.740
that I want to elevate, like
new or star or whatever it is.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.220
Do I need to do it?

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.890
Does it make sense?

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.100
And you can sit
down and you can try

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.640
to encapsulate a huge
amount of guidance

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.850
on all of the nuanced
exceptions for why you might not

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.560
want to do this or why you might
want to do it in a slightly

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.800
unconventional
position, or you might

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.690
want to do it in a
slightly different way.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.470
I don't think that's
actually helpful.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.400
I think the role
of the guidelines

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.540
is to provide the basic rules,
to provide the basic structure.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.575
They're like teaching people
about composition or about

00:22:35.575 --> 00:22:36.075
contrast.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.270
It doesn't mean that in
your particular case,

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.310
in your particular
design problem,

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.410
there isn't a reason to mess
with that, to violate it,

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.990
to play with it, to go
in a different direction.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.370
But if you try to capture
all that nuance in the rules,

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.957
you end up actually not helping
people who, 99% of the time,

00:22:54.957 --> 00:22:56.540
are just trying to
be like, all right,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.354
I just need to get through this.

00:22:59.354 --> 00:23:00.770
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Do you worry that

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.900
with that kind of--
do you worry there

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.370
we're simplifying
too much in design?

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.160
That things are
becoming so simplistic

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.380
that we're actually removing
features that are useful?

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.276
I feel like there's an idea
that for something to be better,

00:23:14.276 --> 00:23:15.900
it has to be more
simplistic and easier

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.970
to understand at first blush.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.530
But we also know that some
of the most powerful things

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.344
require learning.

00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:24.010
Some the most powerful tools the
probably everybody in this room

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.562
uses require you
to learn the tool.

00:23:26.562 --> 00:23:28.770
And when you first see it,
when you first look at it,

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.270
you don't know what
everything does,

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.080
and you don't know why
it has certain functions.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.860
Do you worry that-- I feel like
as we move to smaller screens,

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.910
into tablets and
into phones and those

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.960
are our main points
of interaction,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.610
that we are losing some
complexity in what apps do,

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.336
in what our tools do.

00:23:48.336 --> 00:23:49.460
Does that worry you at all?

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.060
Because material
design is-- it does

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.900
kind of bury some
complex actions,

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.450
but it is very simplistic
in presentation.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.160
So how much of
your time is spent

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.550
pulling out features and
making things more simplistic?

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.684
And does that-- should
we all be very worried?

00:24:03.684 --> 00:24:05.100
MATIAS DUARTE:
Well again, I think

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.310
what you want is
a framework that

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.800
allows you to have the
conversation about how

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.620
you could simplify.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.200
Like when you first
went to mobile,

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.280
one of the biggest
benefits of going to mobile

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.800
was not any of the specific
design patterns that came out

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.220
of it, but simply the
constraint of the screen

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.570
is too damn small.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.800
You just cannot put
all that stuff on it.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.780
You have more variety of
more focused tools instead of

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.210
one large tool that
has a lot of complexity

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.200
where you only ever use
a small percentage of it,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.080
but you're burdened by
all this complexity,

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.505
even though you only want
to use a small part of it.

00:24:39.505 --> 00:24:41.630
That doesn't mean there
isn't room for these larger

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.810
more powerful tools.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.780
Actually, you're talking
about-- you're kind of bored

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.150
with the way a lot of the
tools and a lot of interactions

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.100
we have today are converging
or perhaps reaching

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.800
some kind of status quo.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.010
But I think there are
still pretty interesting

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.600
new opportunities that
are totally untapped.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.600
And the way that simple
tools work together, I think,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.380
is one of those.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.140
I think about how we wrote these
questions on these note cards.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:15.115
We did this with just the
Sharpie and the note card.

00:25:15.115 --> 00:25:16.490
And the Sharpie
and the note card

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.942
is really powerful, because you
can draw just about anything

00:25:19.942 --> 00:25:20.650
on the note card.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.070
It's an incredibly
powerful tool,

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.040
but it's also really simple.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.194
All it does is it's going
to create words or images.

00:25:27.194 --> 00:25:29.610
But one of the things that you
do with a Sharpie or a note

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.520
card, then you combine
it with another tool.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.090
You're like, as
designers, you know,

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.210
you've got Sharpies and
note cards and push pins

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.167
or sticker tape and a wall.

00:25:37.167 --> 00:25:39.000
And now you've got a
totally different tool.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.833
It used to be that--

00:25:39.833 --> 00:25:42.730
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Now
you're making a scrapbook.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.390
MATIAS DUARTE: You're
making it a board, a wall.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.680
You can have a brainstorm--

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.842
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: You're
decorating a dorm room.

00:25:49.842 --> 00:25:51.550
MATIAS DUARTE: So I
think that's actually

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:57.290
one of the places that's a
really open frontier, is how we

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:01.250
get all of our more simple,
more intuitive, more

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.190
focused tools to work better
together, to work in concert

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.782
and to do things with them
together in seamless ways

00:26:07.782 --> 00:26:09.490
that they couldn't do
just by themselves.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.657
I think that's actually
a much more natural way

00:26:11.657 --> 00:26:12.490
to build complexity.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.050
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
You're not talking

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.320
about making products that work
with Sharpies and note cards.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.820
You're talking about
making products

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.277
that are aware of each other
and aware of environments.

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:20.110
MATIAS DUARTE: Sure.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.680
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Am I correct
in understanding that?

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.221
MATIAS DUARTE: That can exchange
capabilities and information

00:26:24.221 --> 00:26:25.820
with each other more fluidly.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.470
Right now, you have a lot of
these very focused products,

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:32.450
but except for a few very coarse
interchanges like cut, copy,

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.470
and paste and drag and drop,
these products are very siloed.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.890
The capabilities that live in
one product is very isolated.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:44.390
When an image is taken out
of a photo editing app that

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.880
has filters and it's embedded
into another application,

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.700
it loses all of the complex
history and metadata

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.260
that came with those filters.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.170
When a place is taken out of a
map and it's put into an email

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.260
or into a chat, it
loses all the richness

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.940
that came with the
map application.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.330
But in the real world, the tools
that we've built everything

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:10.660
around us, everything physical
around us, that doesn't happen.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.165
When you combine
a hammer and a saw

00:27:12.165 --> 00:27:15.110
and a screwdriver
and a piece of wood,

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.700
they become larger than
the sum of their parts.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.160
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: So
is this something

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.990
that you're working
on, something

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.300
that Google is working on?

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.810
MATIAS DUARTE: It's something
I'd like us to work on.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:22.710
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: So
you're not working on it.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.954
MATIAS DUARTE: I'm
passionate about it.

00:27:24.954 --> 00:27:26.620
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: So
is this-- would this

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.770
be a collection of products
that interact with one another,

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.420
or would this be something
that is, suddenly

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.980
software is much more
aware of the rest of what

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.110
the discrete pieces
of software are

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.444
doing within an environment?

00:27:38.444 --> 00:27:39.610
MATIAS DUARTE: I don't know.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:40.151
I don't know.

00:27:40.151 --> 00:27:41.997
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I
feel like you do know

00:27:41.997 --> 00:27:43.080
and you're not telling me.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.760
MATIAS DUARTE: No, sorry.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.926
No, I think I think it's one
of the unexplored frontiers.

00:27:47.926 --> 00:27:50.300
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Because what
you said was very specific.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.930
That wasn't just
like a random fantasy

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.540
you just had about
something you'd like to do.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.192
I'm not needling
you for information.

00:27:55.192 --> 00:27:55.900
I'm just saying--

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.066
MATIAS DUARTE: Yes, you are.

00:27:57.066 --> 00:27:59.370
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Well, I'm
just saying you were very,

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:03.190
some would say hyperspecific
about the kinds of interactions

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.266
you're talking about.

00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:06.140
I mean, phones, in your
phones, your tablets,

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.816
your software doesn't
currently do that.

00:28:07.816 --> 00:28:08.566
MATIAS DUARTE: No.

00:28:08.566 --> 00:28:11.310
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Although Google
just did invent, basically,

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.650
short term memory, right?

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.240
For-- do you not want
to talk about that?

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:15.880
The AI?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.070
MATIAS DUARTE: Oh yeah,
the artificial intelligence

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:17.945
[INAUDIBLE] has done.

00:28:17.945 --> 00:28:19.361
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Is that something

00:28:19.361 --> 00:28:20.950
that could be utilized in this--

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.280
MATIAS DUARTE: Maybe.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.680
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Now I feel
like I'm getting somewhere.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.388
Now I think we're
really on to something.

00:28:25.388 --> 00:28:27.010
MATIAS DUARTE: Yeah,
on to something?

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.104
The future of design?

00:28:28.104 --> 00:28:29.270
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: The future.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.390
Well, I mean, design--

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.765
MATIAS DUARTE: I
was going to say

00:28:31.765 --> 00:28:36.850
that one of the interesting
things to me is right now,

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.750
I think design
matters a huge amount

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.250
in the creation of
products and services

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:45.220
because it's so easy to pour
so much love and attention

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:50.060
and craft into these
hyper-focused experiences.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.860
And I think it's going to be
a big challenge for designers

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.839
and for the tools that we
use to take that into a world

00:28:57.839 --> 00:29:00.130
where all of a sudden these
tools have to start working

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.660
with each other more fluidly.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.470
That's going to be a big change
in how we think about things.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.550
And I think that there's a whole
wave of these kinds of changes,

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.810
challenges to us
that are coming.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:15.530
Right now I see, kind
of poking my head up

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:17.870
and I'm like, what
I worry about today

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.700
in terms of how do
we design something?

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.830
And it's like everything
has to move all of a sudden.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.150
It is just not OK
to have anything

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.020
be a static,
nonresponsive layout.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.060
Everything has to scale from
different shapes and sizes.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.800
Every single transition and
interaction and every piece

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.000
of feedback, you
just expect it to be

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.540
crafted and
carefully considered.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.710
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:44.500
Where am I going to get
all these motion designers?

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.180
I don't think there
are enough of them.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.680
I don't know.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.410
But that's the
challenge of today.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.530
The thing that's also coming
right around the corner which

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:59.810
seems even more daunting is we
get all these motion designers

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:03.310
and it totally disrupts the
way that our barely functioning

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.760
practices are able to work.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.350
Like, we're barely able to
deal with our ethnography

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.380
and our research and the
engineering development cycle

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.240
and getting the layout
and the visual design

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.110
to happen in the right
type of iteration

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.720
and get feedback
and all of that.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.667
We're stumbling,
we're figuring it out.

00:30:21.667 --> 00:30:22.750
At least, I feel that way.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.190
I don't know, maybe
other people feel

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.260
like they've got it figured
out and they just go.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.950
But it feels like
every product I

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:31.342
do, every product
my team does, it's

00:30:31.342 --> 00:30:33.030
so much room for improvement.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:37.076
And then, bam, here comes this
additional need of motion.

00:30:37.076 --> 00:30:38.950
And where's the time
going to come from that?

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.920
Where is the understanding
and the education

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.860
from the other disciplines who
are like, what do you mean?

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.770
Why do I have to take this time?

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.170
Why do I have to
take this space?

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.892
Why do I need room so that
this part of my layout

00:30:50.892 --> 00:30:53.100
doesn't overlap each other
so that the motion doesn't

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.820
feel complicated?

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.630
That's hugely disruptive.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.680
But then, when we start
talking about our products

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.700
and our designs not living in
these hermetic silos of just

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.620
themselves, but having to
actually sit up against others,

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.124
actually dance
together with others,

00:31:14.124 --> 00:31:16.040
that's going to change
the way that we design.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.110
It's a different
type of control.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:19.750
It's a different
type of direction.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.440
We're no longer going
to be orchestrating

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.400
every single move and
every single pixel.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.920
We're going to be
doing something

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.010
that maybe is more
like jazz improvisation

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:33.490
or like DJing or something
where there's other actors that

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:38.430
have their own agendas and
their own needs in the design

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.680
that we can't account for.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.447
We can't possibly predict
what all these other apps, all

00:31:42.447 --> 00:31:44.530
these other services, all
these other designs that

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.571
are going to plug into my
design are going to do.

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:50.010
And yet, somehow we have to have
a flexibility in our designs

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.250
to accommodate that.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:52.360
And that's coming.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.000
And then on top
of that, and this,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.790
I think, gets to where maybe
some kind of machine learning

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.850
or more intelligent
computing systems can help,

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:10.320
is the fact that today, even
with all of these meticulously

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.777
crafted experiences that
we have where we say,

00:32:12.777 --> 00:32:15.110
you know what, we're not going
to try to create the word

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.800
processor for everybody.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.170
We're going to create the
one that's for hipster coffee

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:25.550
drinking writers in New
York who are journalists,

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:29.216
and we're going to create
the finger painting app--

00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:31.090
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I feel
like you have weirdly

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.410
insulted me just now.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.090
MATIAS DUARTE: That
was oddly specific.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:34.730
I don't know.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.870
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Hyperspecific.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.570
MATIAS DUARTE: I
just went there.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.980
But we don't-- even
when we do that,

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.210
even when our products are
focused on a very specific

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.800
target market, they're
still very generic.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.630
We spend all of our time
is designers prioritizing

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.670
use cases and saying,
you're not important enough.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.137
Your use case doesn't
meet the 80% rule.

00:32:56.137 --> 00:32:57.970
Why do we have this
thing in material design

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.450
that says, elevate
this one action.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:04.580
It's all about finding
this common pattern.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.890
But if you compare the
diversity of software

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:14.240
to the diversity of
something like clothing,

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.310
it's like orders of
magnitude different.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:21.540
Right now, it feels like
there is one jacket.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.900
It's like, are you wearing
the journalist jacket?

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.420
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I did.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.910
I actually bought it from the
journalist clothing store.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.600
MATIAS DUARTE: There's only
one jacket for journalists.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.434
But in reality, people
are incredibly diverse.

00:33:31.434 --> 00:33:32.850
They come from
different cultures,

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.620
they have different
capabilities,

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.380
they have different tolerance
for information density,

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.040
they have different
visual acuity--

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.440
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Yeah,
but there's a hammer,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.980
and the hammer
works really well,

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.700
and then there's a nail gun,
and the nail gun works better

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.980
for certain situations--

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.280
MATIAS DUARTE: If I go
into the hardware store,

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.890
there's probably
like 12 hammers.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.265
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Yeah, but that's

00:33:51.265 --> 00:33:53.900
just a question of how expensive
a hammer do you want to buy,

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.189
which one seems most stylish
to you, I don't know,

00:33:56.189 --> 00:33:57.730
because I have my
hammer, obviously--

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:58.310
MATIAS DUARTE: They have
different grips and balance,

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.954
I don't know.

00:33:58.954 --> 00:34:00.870
This is a theoretical,
I never touch a hammer.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:01.270
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: No, I get it.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.950
Clearly, neither one of us
have ever gone into a store

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.940
and bought a hammer, so
that was a bad example.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.759
But what I'm saying is a
hammer is a hammer is a hammer.

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:09.300
They basically all
do the same thing.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.670
And then there's a nail gun.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:13.130
That's a very different thing
and for a different kind

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:13.830
of user.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.460
But we've identified certain
tools that just work really

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.780
well across user sets.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.520
So I totally get what you're
saying about personalization,

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.279
which I think has been tried
and failed in many instances.

00:34:26.279 --> 00:34:27.820
I know that I've
had a lot of debates

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.790
about should people be able to
personalize their news page,

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.310
do we want people to show me,
I want to see this up here

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.000
and this thing over here, and
never show me any of this?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.699
And what I think what we
found, not to go down a rabbit

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:40.070
hole here, but what we
found is that it's actually

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.714
the job, our job, to show
people what's important,

00:34:42.714 --> 00:34:44.380
to tell them what's
important and so on.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.249
And people feel overwhelmed by
having to personalize and think

00:34:47.249 --> 00:34:48.540
about where things should live.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.323
So how do you make it
not feel overwhelming?

00:34:51.323 --> 00:34:53.739
MATIAS DUARTE: That's kind of
like going into the hardware

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.155
store and being like, here's
the tools for making hammers.

00:34:56.155 --> 00:34:57.826
Figure out which one
is right for you.

00:34:57.826 --> 00:34:59.060
Which is different--

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.460
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Like Build
a Bear, but for hammers.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.610
MATIAS DUARTE: Right-- which
is different than going

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:02.170
to a tailor.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.130
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Startup
idea, that's freebie.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.120
MATIAS DUARTE: You
probably want to tailor

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.410
to get that jacket, right?

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.550
You didn't design it.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.466
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I did
not design this jacket.

00:35:08.466 --> 00:35:11.020
MATIAS DUARTE: You went to
some expert who was like, hm,

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.350
you're a journalist.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:13.492
You're this tall--

00:35:13.492 --> 00:35:15.200
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: You
went to some expert,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.783
and they were like,
you're a designer.

00:35:16.783 --> 00:35:19.390
Let me give you an
extremely loud shirt.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.890
I want people--
they're like, people

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:24.229
need to know what's happening
when you walk down the street.

00:35:24.229 --> 00:35:25.020
What's that guy do?

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.600
Is he a carpenter?

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.275
No.

00:35:27.275 --> 00:35:27.600
MATIAS DUARTE: No.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.230
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: He's
got that shirt on.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.470
MATIAS DUARTE: Not a
journalist, that's for sure.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:31.080
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Not a journalist.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.231
Clearly not a carpenter.

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:33.730
But anyhow--

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:34.430
MATIAS DUARTE:
Reeling this back--

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.130
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: You were
talking about my suit.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.150
MATIAS DUARTE: Yeah.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:42.330
I think there's many of
these different axes that

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.230
are going to be radically
changing how we think

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:51.260
about our design practice, that
are going to be challenging all

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.420
the things that we think
are the fixed points of what

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.654
it is that we do as designers.

00:35:57.654 --> 00:35:59.070
Basically in the
exact same way, I

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.350
think, that you were saying
you were print designer

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.900
and you thought you
how this worked.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.490
Print.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.990
I know how to make
beautiful things,

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.780
and all the sudden, when it's
responsive, mind blown, right?

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.900
That's coming for every
aspect of what we do.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.532
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Except print.

00:36:15.532 --> 00:36:17.115
And you know, we
actually were-- cause

00:36:17.115 --> 00:36:18.400
we're running out of time.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.780
So I think we have to wrap up.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.660
But before we do that, I
have one question for you.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.720
I'm very interested
to know your answer.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.660
What do you think is the
most beautiful object that's

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.850
either-- has ever been
created or it exists now?

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:31.710
MATIAS DUARTE: Oh my goodness.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.050
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I had a
bunch of rapid fire questions

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.760
we're not going to get to.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.260
Not empir-- it's an
unempirical thing.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.940
In your opinion.

00:36:38.682 --> 00:36:40.640
MATIAS DUARTE: I think
those kinds of questions

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.140
are impossible to answer.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.100
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: You're
not going to answer?

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.640
MATIAS DUARTE: No, I'm going
to caveat it very temporally.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:50.220
I was just in Kyoto last week
and I had this experience

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:56.540
of going through the Inari
Temple there with the gates.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.400
The red gates all the
way up the mountain.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.965
And that experience of
being inside that space

00:37:00.965 --> 00:37:03.090
was one of the most beautiful
experiences I've had.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:08.400
There was something that was
just stunning about-- each

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.430
of the gates was carefully
considered and crafted,

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.720
yet it was very organic
and chaotic as well.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.940
Yet it created enough
structure and rhythm.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.280
It was kind of like architecture
and kind of like music.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.550
And kind of like exercise,
too, because you're actually

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.362
climbing up this
ridiculously tall mountain

00:37:27.362 --> 00:37:28.820
and it keeps going,
it keeps going,

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.710
and you're still in this space.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:34.900
So that's what comes to mind.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.100
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: That's a
pretty good way to end it.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.060
Matias, thanks so much.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.434
MATIAS DUARTE:
Thank you so much.

00:37:38.434 --> 00:37:39.960
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Thanks, guys.
