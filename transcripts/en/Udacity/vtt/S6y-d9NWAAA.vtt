Consider now the following architectural styles

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.356
that we just saw: pipes and filters,

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:09.310
event-driven, publish-subscribe, client-server, peer-to-peer, and rest.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.150
I'm showing you here, a list of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.220
four different systems, and I would like for you to mark here which

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.750
architectural style, or styles, characterize Each of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.510
these systems. Again, mark all that apply.
