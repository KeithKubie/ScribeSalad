00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.230
Fish have been found singing off the coast
of Australia.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.500
A belated Prince tribute, you ask?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.880
Well, no, not exactly.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.480
Hey guys, Natalia here for DNews today.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.540
The morning rooster has met its underwater
match.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.670
Scientists have studied fish since the days
of Aristotle, analyzing their body language

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.000
and vocal behavior, but recent recordings
off the coast of Australia have identified

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.600
some new overlapping fish songs, particularly
at dusk and dawn.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.510
In a study published in the journal Bioacoustics,
researchers found seven new fish sounds in

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.539
coastal waters off Port Headland, Australia.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.289
They discovered this by recording groups of
fish over an 18-month period and found unique

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.260
choral patterns—overlapping ‘solos’
that created a melody.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.149
But interestingly, they don't create these
vocalizations using vocal chords.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.909
In fact, the term ‘vocalization’ is a
bit of a misnomer, according to researchers.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.320
There are many ways fish can sing – by gnashing
their teeth, snapping the tendons of their

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.110
pectoral fins together, and more commonly,
by contracting and vibrating their swim bladder

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.780
against their sonic muscle.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.830
The swim bladder isn’t a bladder like we
know it.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.030
It’s actually an air-filled sac found inside
the body of many fish that acts like a drum

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.640
to amplify sound.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.720
Not all fish have a swim bladder, but the
species that do will come to the surface to

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.000
“gulp” air that is then directed into
the sac.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.430
The sonic muscle is attached to the swim bladder
to create sound.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.560
When the swim bladder fills with air, it vibrates
against the muscle, producing a low-pitched

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.560
drumming..

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.670
In an Oyster Toadfish, the sonic muscle can
contract at a rate of 200 times per second

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.090
– that’s more than double the speed that
a hummingbird flaps its wings.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.130
Now, all fish can hear, but not all can make
sound.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.660
Of the 20,000 different known species of fish,
only about 800 are believed to make noise.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.740
The ones who can have been known to produce
‘croak,’ ‘purr,’ or popping type sounds,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.630
but the study unveiled a new variety of sounds
along the ocean floor – from a low “foghorn”

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.570
type call by the Black Jewfish, to a grunting
buzz-sound from a species of Terapontid, to

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.670
a quieter, lower “ba-ba-ba” type call
from a Batfish.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.090
And researchers think that fish have many
reasons to cause a clatter: to attract mates,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.040
reproduce, defend their territory, warn of
danger, scare off predators, and hunt their

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040
own prey.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.069
Even more interesting is how the types of
noise differ by time of day.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.220
In a 2015 study published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences researchers

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.920
found daytime fish calls overlapped with each
other, like in a crowded room, while nighttime

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.310
fish calls were more singular and distinct.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.260
This suggested that since day-swimming fish
can see each other, they can use visual cues

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.920
to communicate and therefore can afford to
muddle their sound -- like talking over each

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920
other.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.290
But at night, fish can only tell other species
apart by the noises they make, so they are

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.709
a little more distinctive.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.099
So next time you find yourself swimming with
the fish, keep your ear to the ground…er,

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.579
the ocean floor, and you may just hear their
frequencies -- the complex choruses of the

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.700
underwater world.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.019
Many fish in the ocean make their homes in
coral reefs, but those reefs are in danger.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.689
Our sister show Seeker Stories takes a look
at one unlikely source of reef destruction

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:04.689
- feral pigs.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.510
Check it out here.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.019

marine life?
