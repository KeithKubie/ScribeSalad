00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.600
I think the most important piece of career
advice I ever received was probably from my

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.660
mother who used the phrase, “Be one with
the target.”

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.200
And what she meant when she said that was,
when you are engaging in some kind of a high

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.500
stakes professional gambit, whether it’s
you’re giving a speech or a presentation

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:35.550
at work or you’re breaking a big story,
if you are fully invested in the goal and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.480
it’s a greater goal than yourself it’s
not about you— there’s a certain kind

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.880
of armor in that, and people can attack you
personally (and they certainly do attack me

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.180
a lot personally) and they can try to weaponize
whatever they want against you, but if you

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.270
are really one with the target and you know
that what you’re doing contributes to goals

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.030
that are bigger than yourself and you are
100 percent off of thinking about you and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.329
your self-consciousness and your self-interest
and on thinking about the problem and how

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.140
you’re going to make things better through
your work and communicating that to the other

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.920
people involved in whatever project you’re
working on, there’s no time to get mired

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.920
in the “self” piece of it, in the kind
of self-consciousness and the worry about

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.490
self-interest that can, I think, sideline
and distract.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.299
That’s easier said than done.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.430
I don’t always live up to that, but it’s
a great philosophy that I found really useful.
