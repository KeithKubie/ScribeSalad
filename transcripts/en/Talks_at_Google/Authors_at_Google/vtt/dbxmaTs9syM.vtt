00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.441
WAYNE GLADSTONE: Thanks
for having me here.

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:03.460
I appreciate it.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.760
Just wanted to start
off by congratulating

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.430
you all for being
Google employees.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.250
I also at one point wanted
to be a Google employee.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.080
I even submitted a resume.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.400
I kind of feel my application
probably never made it

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.225
past the review of my
Google search history.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.304
Could probably get a job
at Bing because my history

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:25.095
there's immaculate.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.200
It's like I don't even
use it for some reason.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.620
I'm going to be reading to
you from my new book, "Agents

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.850
of the Internet Apocalypse."

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.030
As Chris said, it's the
second in a trilogy.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.410
In the first book, the whole
world suddenly loses internet.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.890
But electricity still works.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.410
There's still running water.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.970
So it's not a true apocalypse.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.200
It's more like 1995 without
all the grunge music.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.600
But people are
still freaking out

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.080
because they don't know how
to live without the internet.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.780
And so it's kind of
broad satire of seeing

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.730
how people try to recreate
their online experiences

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.580
in real life.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.400
Book One follows the story of
a character named Gladstone,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.600
Semitically handsome,
mid-'30s New Yorker,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.530
who follows rumors that there's
someone who still online.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.550
And his investigation is joined
by his LA gossip blogger friend

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.186
Toby and a 24-year-old
Australian webcam girl.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.060
There are some other
characters from Book One

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.640
that I want to mention because
they pop up in Book Two

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.480
that I'll be reading from today.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.950
There's Jeeves, who's a NYU
librarian and psychic who

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.260
decides to recreate himself as
a human search engine selling

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.300
information for $5.00
a pop in Central Park.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.830
There's a character
called Quiff Monster 42.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.240
Gladstone meets him
at a 4chan meetup.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.470
He claims to be
anonymous royalty.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.290
He wears, like, the Guy
Fawkes mask in Book One,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.500
but not Book Two
because, as he explains,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.640
it's not 2007 anymore.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.490
That's not hip.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.950
He's interested in
Gladstone's investigation.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.060
And there's also a
Special Agent Rowsdower.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.850
If that name sounds
familiar, I poached it

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.550
from an episode of
"Mystery Science Theater."

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.910
Final sacrifice
from MST 3K fans.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.390
He's empowered under
the Net Recovery Act

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.950
to interrogate people and
detain them indefinitely

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.440
if it's in the furtherance
of finding the internet.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.600
The interesting thing there
is, when I wrote Book One,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.680
it was 48 hours,
because that sounded

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.410
draconian enough to detain
someone for 48 hours

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.710
without counsel.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.960
And before I finished
the book, the president

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.130
signed NDAA, which gives
the government the right

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.520
to hold any US citizen
indefinitely without counsel

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.240
if it's to thwart terrorism.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.870
So I had to go back and up
the ante on my dystopian novel

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.730
to make it as draconian
as reality, which

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.010
is probably never a good sign.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.330
So I don't want to give away
too much about Book One,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.170
but for context, it doesn't
end so well for Gladstone.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.010
He needs some
help, and he's told

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.000
that a lot of things he saw or
felt he saw or thought he saw,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.580
he shouldn't believe.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.170
So in Book Two, when he
gets out of the hospital,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.820
he decides he's going to head
out to LA to his friend Toby's

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.580
house.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.050
And instead of pursuing
his investigation,

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.060
he's going to try to
reconnect with his ex-wife.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.790
So I'm going to
read four passages,

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.710
try to give you a taste
of it, jump around a bit.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.250
And then if there's time,
which there should be,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.540
take some questions
if there are any.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.130
"When I reached
Toby's door, I heard

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.540
music coming from
inside, which was good,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.570
because it wasn't
until that moment

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.120
that I realized I didn't
have keys to his place.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.910
I knocked, but had
trouble making myself

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.940
heard over yeses awakened.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.230
Toby finally came to the door,
eyes bloodshot and weary,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.220
but happy as he took a step back
to reveal all of his apartment.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.410
The stink of schwag
wafted into the hall,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.450
but I was more preoccupied
by the man on the couch,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.090
a 5o-something sporting
a balding ponytail

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.519
and a Dr. Who t-shirt so stiff
and new it looked like it's

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.450
still reeked of silkscreen.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.120
'Gladstone!' Toby exclaimed,
pointing to the couch.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.520
'You know this dude?'

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.640
I studied him for a
moment, tilting my head

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.290
and making sure what I was
seeing was really there.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.500
'Well, let me ask you.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.640
Is this dude a 50-something
man with a ponytail and a Dr.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.360
Who t-shirt?' I asked.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.800
'Uh, yeah.'

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.800
I heard myself say Jeeves,
but I didn't say anything,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.580
because how do you greet
something you don't understand?

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.330
I had been positive
Jeeves was real

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.400
when I first got to
the hospital because I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.950
had clear memories of the man
who sat at his little table

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.580
in Central Park working
as a human search engine,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.670
selling information
to people too lazy

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.640
to open books for free.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.626
But after the
memories got hazier,

00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:58.000
and when he never
came to see me,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.410
I started to believe
he wasn't real.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.020
'Gladstone?' he asked.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.840
'Jeeves?'

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.290
He planted his
palms on his knees

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.450
and sprang from the
sinkhole of Toby's couch

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.250
with more grace than I expected.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.100
'Yes!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.800
Come in,' he said, and I
wondered why I needed to be

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.450
invited into my own friend's
home by a more comfortable

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.660
stranger.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.660
I took only a few
slow steps before he

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.800
came over and put his arm around
me, leading me to the couch.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.860
'It's good to see you,' he said.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.640
'Why are you dressed like that?'

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.790
'Like what?'

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.920
'I don't know.'

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.650
'An Argentinian child
prostitute pimp?' Toby offered.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.720
'No,' Jeeves replied. 'I was
going to say something like

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.420
back alley Monte Carlo
plastic surgeon?'

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.760
'Too wordy,' I said.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.330
'Definitely,' Toby agreed.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.109
'Well, anyway, it's great to
see you.' Jeeves plopped back

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:44.400
into the couch, and I took
a seat just as Toby went off

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.700
to the kitchen.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.609
'So,' Jeeves said, 'what
have you been up to?'

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:49.900
'Well, I just got in yesterday.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.810
Catching up with Toby, trying
to reconnect with my ex.'

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.609
I could see Jeeves
lose his energy.

00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:56.400
'No,' he said. 'I meant
about the internet,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.040
your investigation.'

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.810
'I don't have an investigation.'

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.730
'Of course you do.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.410
You're the internet
messiah, remember?'

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.860
I hadn't heard that phrase
in a couple of months,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.250
and it embarrassed
me to remember

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.240
I'd written that about myself.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.560
It was more cringeworthy
than a 3/4 turn selfie shot

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.150
from above.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.330
'Holy shit'-- that's a
tough one-- 'Holy shit,

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.580
that Messiah shit's real?' Toby
asked, returning with two PBRs.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.320
'I thought Gladstone was
just blowing himself again.'

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.760
'Yes, it's real,' Jeeves said.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.260
'This guy's going to find
the internet,' Toby said,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.710
pointing to me with one PPR
while extending the other

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.710
to Jeeves.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.000
'Says who?'

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.590
'Says me.' Jeeves grabbed
Toby's wrist with his left hand,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.360
removing the beer
with his right.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.260
Then he laid his palm
flat on top of Toby's.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.990
Toby pulled away
after a few seconds.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.920
'Bad touch, Mr. Grabby.'

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.400
Jeeves made a pronouncement.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.710
'Three things.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.140
First, you're not my type.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.650
I like my men able to
speak in full sentences.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.190
Second, this morning you
jerked off to a website

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.100
called Amazing Penetrations.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.350
And third--' Jeeves
looked down at his hands--

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.510
'do you have any Purell?'

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.480
Toby was impressed,
shocked even.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.530
I'd never seen him lose
his flippancy before.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.860
He seemed to search for it on
the floor as he took a seat.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.780
Jeeves was here, so either I
was in a fully psychotic state

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.690
right now or I was less
crazy than I thought.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.460
He was the man I remembered,
a man full of information

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.520
both learned and divined.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.080
He smiled at me.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.230
'We need you, Gladstone.'

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.540
'We,' I laughed.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.190
'Who?'

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.390
'It's great to see you.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.780
But seriously, it's not just me.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.160
Anonymous was asking about you.'

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.050
'Get the fuck out,' Toby said.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.520
'I'm serious,' Jeeves insisted.
'He had a mask and everything.'

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.770
'Did he call himself-- what
was the name from the book

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.340
again?' Toby asked.
'Quiff Monster 42?'

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.230
'Uh, no,' Jeeves said.
'I just told you.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.610
He was from Anonymous.'

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.460
'Well, in Toby's
defense,' I said,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.810
'I went to a 4chan meetup.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.150
And trust me, in real life
you have to call a room full

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.020
of twats something.'

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.520
'Isn't that a gaggle?' Toby
offered. 'A gaggle of twats?'

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.400
Jeeves wasn't amused.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.840
'No, he didn't give a name.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.740
And I had nothing
to tell him anyway.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.610
I hadn't seen you.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.980
I couldn't get to you.'

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.460
'Fair enough,' I said, hoping to
end the discussion and failing.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.170
'And now that I've found you, I
don't know what you're doing.'

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.620
'I'm enjoying my
freedom,' I said,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.310
'seeing old friends and
trying to get my wife back.'

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.540
'She's not your wife
anymore, dude,' Toby said.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.070
'I know.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.462
I'm working on it.'

00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:24.920
Jeeves had a mission,
but he wasn't

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.904
so impractical or unkind to
not let it drop for the moment.

00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:31.320
'So lads,' he said. 'I changed
my flight and it's not till

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.947
tomorrow.

00:08:31.947 --> 00:08:33.030
What would you like to do?

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.260
My treat.'

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.020
Toby was quick
with a suggestion.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.250
'Let's go to the Hashtag.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.890
We can catch the early show.'

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.169
'What's that?' I asked.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.590
'Just a place down
on Main Street.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.409
They play hashtag games.'

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.070
Jeeves and I looked
at each other.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.950
'You know,' Toby continued.
'Like on Twitter.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.110
They come up with funny hashtag
topics, post it on a screen,

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.580
and then you write
funny responses.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.930
There are prizes.'

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.040
'You mean like hashtag
first world problems

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.010
and things like that?

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.060
Jeeves asked.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.290
'Yeah, but not old and
lame,' Toby replied.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.980
'I love it.'

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.940
It seemed innocuous enough,
but Jeeves was happy to oblige,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.740
so we took Toby's Matrix.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.420
I let Jeeves ride shotgun
and I packed myself

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.880
into the back seat.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.130
From the outside, the Hashtag
was like any other dingy bar.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.930
But the sign was new and
bright and neon pink.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.940
Inside it was dark.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.940
But I could make out a series
of small tables, each replete

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.360
with a hookah and a bong.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.080
The air hung thick
with what I assumed

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.750
was official California
issue medical marijuana.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.117
'This is a drug den,' I said.

00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:29.950
'Duh,' Toby replied.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.430
'Why do you think they
call it the Hashtag?'

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.860
Because they play
hashtag games,' you said.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.510
Toby considered
that for a moment.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.690
'Well, yeah, but why do you
think I said I love it?'"

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.190
OK.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.480
That's the first section.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.850
OK.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.150
So what I meant to say is--
I guess it didn't really

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.310
matter-- Jeeves is
the one in Book One

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.874
who makes a pronouncement that
Gladstone-- who you wouldn't

00:09:51.874 --> 00:09:54.040
really think, because he's
stumbling around New York

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.970
drunk-- is the internet
messiah, the one who's going

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.110
to bring back the internet.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.666
And so as the book goes on, even
though he came to LA-- sorry,

00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:05.040
just getting my
notes on my phone

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:12.612
because I want to impress you
here at Google, no paper--

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.820
as he doesn't really connect
very well with his wife,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.790
he starts doing the only
thing else he can do,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.110
look for the internet.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:25.200
And in kind of a meta way, his
journal, which is Book One,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.134
sort of goes paper
viral in Book Two.

00:10:28.134 --> 00:10:30.300
People start photocopying
and sharing it and getting

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.133
into his adventures.

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:33.560
So almost like kind
of ass backwards,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.650
he stumbles into kind
of almost becoming

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.300
this internet
messiah, the guy who's

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.140
going to find the internet.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.837
So they keep returning
to the Hashtag.

00:10:43.837 --> 00:10:45.420
And at this point
of the book, they're

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.940
trying to build an army, find
people who can join with them.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.970
And as he's speaking to the
people, who've now all read

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.370
Book One-- you with me?

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.060
It's very-- I guess everyone
throws the word meta around,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.610
but I'm pretty sure that that
is meta for real-- says to him,

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.550
you want a whole book talking
about how the internet sucks,

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.802
how we're all
addicted to it, and it

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.260
has a terrible
effect on our lives,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.460
and we don't know how
to live without it.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.640
So why are you
trying to find it,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.160
and why should we follow you?

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.640
And the crowds about to
turn on him, a little bit--

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.140
not quite like this one,
we're not quite there--

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.920
when someone says to him,
when someone shouts out,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.300
"'Because he helped
me,' a woman said.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.440
It was the long-lashed girl.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.940
She was standing now and
holding a blue copy of notes

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.890
under her arm like a Bible.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.260
I could see the black
Cleopatra eye makeup

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.522
creating the illusion
of larger eyes.

00:11:43.522 --> 00:11:45.480
She might have dabbed
some white in the corner,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.090
extending the sclera.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.631
That trick usually made you
look a little cross-eyed,

00:11:49.631 --> 00:11:51.880
but because her eyes were
already set slightly further

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.840
apart, it seemed to work out.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.410
Regardless, it wasn't
the makeup that

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.180
made her eyes look so huge.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.040
It was because she could
hold all of me in her sight.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.830
She was seeing the man I hoped
to be and wouldn't explain.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.610
The room went quiet,
and I looked at her

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.420
along with everyone else.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.790
'Excuse me?' I asked.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.740
'You helped me,' she said.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.490
'I'm sorry.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.750
Do I know you?'

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.700
'We were Facebook friends.'

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.700
That didn't help.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.900
I'd become Facebook
friends with lots of people

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.230
I didn't actually know.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.260
Mostly with people
I didn't know.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.730
It's much better that way when
you have no good news to post.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.250
'I'm Alana,' she said. 'And I
don't usually look like this.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.850
I'm dressed as Oz for tonight.'

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.430
She smiled, and I
could see her now,

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.750
even though I couldn't
remember her last name.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.902
She saw me scanning drunken
late night memories for more.

00:12:36.902 --> 00:12:38.860
'We met online, like,
two years ago,' she said.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.240
'Anyway, I was pretty depressed.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.290
I don't want to get into
it, but you helped me.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.623
And I wanted to thank you,
although I guess I would like

00:12:44.623 --> 00:12:46.370
the internet back, too.'

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.300
If you're a
functional alcoholic,

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.970
it's easy to find the
start of a lost weekend.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.800
It's usually Friday night.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.160
But e-addiction is more subtle.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.840
They used to call BlackBerrys
crackberrys because

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.570
of how often we checked them.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.350
But by the time the
iPhone rolled around,

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.540
there was no cute name
for this affliction.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.300
Now it was just
something we did,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.190
and it was like
that for me, away

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.867
to unwind evolved into
a way to see the world.

00:13:09.867 --> 00:13:12.200
I don't know when it went
from a hobby to a way of life.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.170
But if you could
somehow quantify

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.630
the mess of my
dropout virtual life,

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.540
Alana probably existed
somewhere towards the start,

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.480
the period shortly
after Romaya left,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.000
when I was no longer
going to work,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.090
but not quite yet the
near shut-in I'd become.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.030
She was a voice looking
for help at the moment

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.660
I threw my scotch-laced
self into a comment thread

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.360
on social media.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.920
I'm not sure how I helped
you,' I said, 'but I'm glad.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.130
You listened, and you heard
me when no one else would,

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.280
when even my friends
wouldn't listen.'

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.280
I wondered if I were
really that wonderful,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.010
or if her friends
were that awful.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.360
Probably neither was true.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.510
The internet deserved the
credit, because in real life,

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.670
the hardest part about
being there for someone

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.650
is knowing once you extend the
effort to make something right,

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.720
once you take someone from
sad to happy, from suicidal

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.330
to safe, they might ask you
to do it again, and again.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.090
And surely you run
that risk online,

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.910
but it's easier to say goodbye.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.840
People get blocked.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.890
They have their chat
privileges removed.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.590
There are more buffers between
you and the real connection,

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.430
making it easier to
say hello and goodbye.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.800
Distance makes it easier
to answer cries for help,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.000
knowing the internet will never
let your good deeds trap you

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.350
into a pattern of selflessness.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.870
Another man stood up.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.160
He was about my age, but had
a much kinder face than I do.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.530
'You helped me, too,' he said.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.020
Standing there in
his cargo shorts

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.490
and a t-shirt 10
pounds too small,

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.100
he didn't look familiar at all.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.890
'I posted an adoption profile
on Facebook when my wife and I

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.900
were almost out of
hope, and you shared it,

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.590
even linked it on your Twitter.'

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.600
I was not, as truly sad
people call themselves,

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.810
Twitter famous.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.930
But my steady stream of puns
and off-color Tweets dead

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.490
celebrities had amassed me
a following of about 7,000.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.160
Compared to someone
with an actual life,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.790
that meant a lot more exposure.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.520
So I understood why
he was grateful,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.990
even if I didn't
remember the posting.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.992
'Did that lead you
to a baby?' I asked.

00:15:01.992 --> 00:15:04.200
'No,' he said. 'The baby
came about six months later,

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.730
totally unrelated.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.835
But you have no idea how much
it meant to my wife and me.

00:15:08.835 --> 00:15:11.210
Sometimes a kindness from
someone you don't even know can

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.580
mean the most.'

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.320
'I'm glad.' I
lingered for his name.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.370
'Ed.'

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.490
'I'm glad, Ed.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.250
Will you help me
bring back the net?'

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.120
'Yes.'

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.350
'Alana, will you help
me bring back the net?'

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.170
'Yes.'

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.780
I addressed the whole room.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.860
'Do we have people here tonight
who will help me find the net?'

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.390
It wasn't a unanimous
response by any means.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.330
But there was enough of a
communal yes to be encouraged.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.820
I looked at Toby and
he smiled back at me.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.160
'OK,' I said. 'Here's
what's going to happen.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.250
As you might have
guessed, and as my friend

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.710
with the hideous body
scarification earrings

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.472
mentioned, Toby and I
are a couple of fuckups.

00:15:45.472 --> 00:15:47.930
Nevertheless, we've learned
more than you'd think possible.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.010
We've obtained information
we believe narrows

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.020
the field of possible suspects.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.400
As you can
understand, that's not

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.941
something we're
going to share freely

00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:57.210
with a room full of
unknown drunken Californian

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.730
assholes like you.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.210
We want to know you better.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.540
So if you came to help, I'd like
to ask you to line up over here

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.280
towards the left wall.'

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.310
People started to
gather their drinks.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.960
'If, however, I don't know, you
came to be part of some book

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.230
club, Cos Play Fun, and
possibly have sex with Toby,

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.590
then hang to the right.'

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.300
'Thank you,' Toby
said earnestly,

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.130
like I'd finally
remembered the key point

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.920
of tonight's gathering.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.930
I felt the kind of
warmth inside me

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.540
that recently had only
come from good scotch.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.110
I would have held the
moment, basked in it."

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.360
I jumped, so this
doesn't quite make sense.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.630
"Alana's face suddenly turned
from compassion to fear,

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.590
her eyes growing as wide
as her makeup's illusion.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.080
I turned around to see something
I couldn't believe was real.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.330
It was Rowsdower.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.150
But now, he wasn't all gussied
up for some TV appearance.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.190
He was in action, wearing a
tan student and a skinny tie

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.760
with an immaculate knot.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.870
Perhaps most noticeable
was his fedora,

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.430
right out of G Man
Central Casting.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.550
'Rowsdower,' I said,
unaware I was even speaking.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.020
'Special Agent
Rowsdower,' he corrected,

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.750
and flashed his badge
inches from my face.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.860
'Wayne Gladstone?' he asked.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.450
I even given my first name.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.460
Insufferable.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.307
'Yes.'

00:17:07.307 --> 00:17:09.140
'You have been declared
a person of interest

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.680
under the Net Recovery Act.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.210
As such, I'm empowered by
the United States government

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.619
to request you follow
me for questioning.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:18.270
Will you be coming voluntarily,
or shall I place you formally

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.540
under arrest?'

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.609
I didn't respond, and
Rowsdower repeated himself.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.770
'WIll you be coming voluntarily,
or shall I place you formally

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.810
under arrest?' he insisted.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.590
'I thought I had a right to
remain silent,' I protested.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.680
'You have no such right under
the Net Recovery Act,' he said,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.290
and in one fluid motion cuffed
my hands behind my back before

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.610
I could even think
of a witty rejoinder.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.500
Toby jumped off his stool.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.340
'What the fuck?' he asked.
"i thought this was America.'

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.740
Rowsdower kept one
hand tight on my cuffs

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.320
and placed the other
on Toby's shoulder.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.080
'The Net Recovery Act
passed four months ago, son,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.850
and you're still talking
about what was America?

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.290
Please get out my way.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:01.100
I have a job to do.'"

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.930
That's when Gladstone
gets arrested.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:08.370
And while he's away, his
reputation and the movement

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.220
actually grows,
because now there

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.150
is a symbol of oppression.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.990
There's not something amorphous
like, who took the net?

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.760
We're good on time, so I'm
going to read one last section.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.210
And I left out something big.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.050
Anonymous has a clue for him.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.170
And when the internet
first came out,

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.420
as I learned in my
research-- and some of you

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.788
probably know, or
definitely know,

00:18:35.788 --> 00:18:37.410
if you read a really
good book called

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.149
"Tubes" by Michael
Blum-- I don't know,

00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:40.190
maybe he even spoke here.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.231
It's a really great book.

00:18:41.231 --> 00:18:42.570
It was really helpful to me.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.500
And one detail I loved from
that was when the internet first

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.410
existed, they had a phone book.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.340
Everyone's name,
address, phone number,

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.340
and their email address,
because there was only,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.295
like, 200 people who
had email addresses.

00:18:55.295 --> 00:18:57.170
And they were still in
that kind of thinking,

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.086
like you needed a phone
book for the internet.

00:18:59.086 --> 00:19:01.360
And then it got a
little bit bigger

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.670
because more people got online.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.620
And what Anonymous tells
Gladstone in this book

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.710
is that they kept
making the book.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.260
Except instead of
it being everyone

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.660
who was online or
everyone who had access,

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.100
it became a list of the people
with power, the robber barons,

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.332
or the hand in the glove
behind the machine, ghost

00:19:21.332 --> 00:19:22.540
in the machine, I should say.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.396
I'm not sure that first
metaphor made any sort of sense.

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:25.895
Gloves?

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.890
And it got smaller and
smaller and smaller,

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.290
says Anonymous to Gladstone.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.690
So if you find the people
who are in this book,

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.550
if you find this book
that has the few names

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.170
of the people with power,
you'll know who took it away.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.560
That's kind of what guides
Blackstone's Book Two mission.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.840
So Gladstone gets out of prison.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.250
The movement has been calling
people constantly at Google.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.782
They're just placing--
someone's phone rang.

00:19:54.782 --> 00:19:56.490
The movement's been
growing up and people

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.140
have been passing
around paper memes

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.100
with the Messiah movement's
logo and spray painting it

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:01.849
everywhere.

00:20:01.849 --> 00:20:03.390
So when Gladstone
gets out of prison,

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.620
he goes to Farmer's
Market in LA,

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.610
and he sees now signs of
a successful movement,

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.230
and people spray painting
it on a clock tower.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.030
But that's when, also,
the bombings start.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.760
And he comes from
Farmer's Market,

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.218
where he sees a
bunch of people die

00:20:17.218 --> 00:20:21.930
in a bombing in the shadow
of his group's logo.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.060
And he's dumped by our
friend Quiff Monster

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.000
42, the guy purporting to be
from Anonymous, in his limo.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.482
So I'll read this last section,
and if there are any questions,

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:33.315
then we can do that.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.021
OK.

00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:37.520
Thanks.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.170
"Toby drove while I lay in
the passenger seat reclined

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.780
all the way back."

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.590
By the way, there's a one in
10 chance, three in 10 chance,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.090
that I might cry
while I read this.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.590
We might have to
edit that in post,

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.740
and that's probably
why that dude left.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.410
"Toby drove while I
lay in the-- Toby drove

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.790
while I lay in the passenger
seat reclined all the way back.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.410
We pulled into a space
in his apartment garage

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.020
but were pinned by a limo
as soon as he parked.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.960
The black tinted
glass rolled down

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.570
with a mechanical
efficiency, revealing a man

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.990
in a hell raiser pinhead mask.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.670
'Get in the car, jackass.'

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:19.832
'Quiff?' I asked.

00:21:19.832 --> 00:21:22.290
'Do you know many other masked
men roaming around in limos,

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:23.420
Gladstone?'

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.290
It was Quiff.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.030
But before I could decide
if I wanted to enter,

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.290
Toby was inside, sticking
his head out the window

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.555
right next to Pinhead.

00:21:31.555 --> 00:21:32.180
'Dude, come on.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.280
There's a wet bar
and everything.'

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.880
I got in and the
car began to move.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.440
'Eventful first day out
of prison, Gladstone.'

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.590
'Yeah, man, it was
awful,' Toby replied.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.700
I turned to Toby.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.674
'You know Quiff?'

00:21:43.674 --> 00:21:45.090
'Of course,' he
said. 'I told you.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.370
Anonymous pitched in when
you went to the big house.'

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.980
The car pulled out
of Toby's garage

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.650
and out into Santa Monica.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.790
'So, Gladstone,' Quiff said.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.850
'What happens now?'

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.200
'What do you mean?' I asked.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.294
He shook his head.

00:21:58.294 --> 00:22:00.210
'If you're going to be
the Messiah, Gladstone,

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.470
you need to think more
than no moves ahead.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.990
This is chess, not
ants in the pants.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.140
I told you I wasn't
looking for war.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.070
And I told you it would
find you anyway, didn't I?'

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.600
I had no clever reply.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.430
'So I'm asking
you,' he continued.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.090
'What happens now?'

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.360
'I don't understand.' Even
through Halloween store latex,

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.840
I could tell Quiff
was disgusted with me.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.769
'Driver, turn on the
news,' he shouted.

00:22:24.769 --> 00:22:27.060
Quiff sat back in his seat
and listened to a news story

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.130
he'd already heard
in his head, one

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.120
I hadn't even begun to imagine.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.800
It was about the explosion
at the Farmer's Market.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.400
That much was no surprise.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.440
But clearly that wasn't
the important part.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.610
It was the ending, the part
about the newly formed Internet

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.880
Reclamation Movement,
now seemingly called

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.520
the Messiah Movement, being
suspected in the attack.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.030
'The hell,' I screamed.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.049
'You didn't see that
coming?' Quiff replied.

00:22:50.049 --> 00:22:51.590
'Because it's not
true,' I protested.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.090
'Is it?

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.220
Is it true, Toby?'

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.151
Toby was drinking
some of Quiff's vodka.

00:22:55.151 --> 00:22:55.650
'What?

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.150
No.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.870
I didn't order anyone to
blow up a trolley,' he said.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.620
Quiff turned professional.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.650
'What does that matter?

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.670
A trolley blew up, and in the
shadow of your Wi-Fi fedora

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.007
symbol, which is really
nice, by the way.'

00:23:07.007 --> 00:23:09.090
I reached for the Scotch,
and Quiff interrupted me

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.300
by placing an empty
glass in my hand.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.400
Then he poured me some
Auchentoshan Classic,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.810
which was behind the decanter
I was actually grabbing for.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.400
'You're a suspect, Gladstone,'
he said. 'So tell me,

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.504
what happens next?'

00:23:21.504 --> 00:23:23.670
'Well, driving around with
Anonymous 4chan, whatever

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.503
the fuck you are, can't
be a very good idea.

00:23:25.503 --> 00:23:26.940
It makes me look guilty.'

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.780
'That's probably true,
but the association

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.320
is already known,
enough to paint

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.720
you as guilty if they want.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.280
So I suggest you
need all the friends

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.980
you can get at this point,
friends you can trust.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.660
'Oh, right.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.000
Friends like masked vigilantes
known only to me by a dirty

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.470
joke of a nickname.'

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.330
'I am the Batman,' Toby said.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.800
'I've explained this to
you already,' Quiff said.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.680
'In this environment,
the man in the mask

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.780
is the only person
you can trust.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.180
Everyone else has
too much to lose.'

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.900
'OK, Quiff, what happens next?

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.660
You tell me.'

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.520
'You will be blamed,' he said.
'You will be discredited.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.240
You will be vilified.'

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.200
Then, almost by cue, my
old friend Senator Bramson

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.322
came on the radio.

00:24:05.322 --> 00:24:07.530
'I've been warning this
administration and anyone who

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.010
will listen about this
so-called messiah for months,

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.066
and for good reason.

00:24:11.066 --> 00:24:12.440
Look what this
movement has done.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.356
And what does this
administration have to show

00:24:14.356 --> 00:24:15.260
for it?'

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.050
I knocked back my drink and
put my head in my hands,

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.540
running my fingers over my
face and through my hair

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.490
like I'd seen
exasperated men do.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.650
'We'll figure this out,
Gladstone,' Toby offered

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.670
weakly.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.230
'Cheer up,' Quiff said. 'Don't
you realize Senator Bramson

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.220
just became your best friend?'

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.240
'Ooh, with benefits?'
Toby asked.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.410
'Shut up, Toby.

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:35.290
Yes,' Quiff agreed.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:35.920
Take a break.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.460
We get it.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.840
You're a moron.'

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.750
'How is she my friend?' I asked.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.950
'Well, think about it.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.460
She's blaming the NSA.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.760
The NSA just released you, so--'

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.410
'I was being held by
the NSA?' I asked.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:48.747
'Who do you think?' Quiff asked.

00:24:48.747 --> 00:24:49.330
'I don't know.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.970
That Rowsdower seemed
like such an FBI guy.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:52.560
'He is.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.390
He was.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.120
But he's been tasked
as a foot soldier

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.230
in the NSA's affectuation
of the Net Recovery Act.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.485
So anyway, if Bramson
is blaming you,

00:25:00.485 --> 00:25:03.030
then NASA has two choices.'"

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.980
Not NASA, NSA has two choices.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.000
NASA, too, really.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.910
It's all connected.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.580
"'They can arrest you again and
try to bury the fact that they

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.420
ever let you go, or they can
dispute Bramson's allegations,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.010
which means you won't be blamed.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.960
We have to get you on
TV, deny any involvement,

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.500
condemn the attacks, help
the government help you,

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.520
because you know, if they do
need you to be the bad guy

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.870
for this, then
nothing can help you.'

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.360
'You think that's all it
takes, go on TV and say, hey,

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.854
I have nothing to do with this?'

00:25:31.854 --> 00:25:32.770
'Well, think about it.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.520
You'll be so grateful
to the US government

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.930
for not wielding
its net recovery

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.220
power on your ass for
something you didn't do,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.730
you'll keep your nose clean.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.300
Think of it as a get
out of free jail card.'

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.550
'But that's crap,' Toby
said. 'This movement goes

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.360
on, and if they
lock up Gladstone,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.995
we'll only grow stronger.'

00:25:47.995 --> 00:25:50.580
'Hey, good for you,
Toby,' Quiff said.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.280
I hated everything
about Quiff's tone,

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.790
but I also knew he was right.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.310
'So no,' Quiff continued.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.020
'I think you should go on TV,
but I don't think it's enough.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.190
It's a stopgap.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.420
It saves your ass for now
and allows the government

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.364
to save face.

00:26:03.364 --> 00:26:05.280
But you'll be compromised,
and they will never

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.940
stop planning your destruction,
because if they lock you up

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.030
again, Toby's right, that
buys them another problem.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.380
But for now, yes,
going on TV will work.'

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.040
'Why so sure?' I asked. 'You
think I'm that charismatic that

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.650
no one will doubt
my performance?

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.330
You think the government
will take comfort from that?'

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.177
Quiff laughed.

00:26:22.177 --> 00:26:23.760
'No, Gladstone,
you're probably right.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.800
If the government had
to rely on that alone,

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.530
they'd probably be more nervous.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.880
But I think they have
another ace up their sleeve.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.360
Any guesses?'

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.640
Toby thought hard.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.200
'Aliens?'

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.630
'Tell us,' I said.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:36.530
'The internet.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.120
I predict within the week
the net will make a return,

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.060
just enough to quell unrest.'

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.310
'What does that get
them?' Toby asked.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.040
'What does that get
them?' Quiff barked.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.000
'How can you, of all
people, ask that?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.860
Indifference.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.450
Apathy.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.329
It gets them that.

00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:51.370
You've had the most
productive month of your life

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:52.650
without the internet.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.080
It's Governance 101.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.580
A content people are
less likely to rebel.'

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.930
'I thought that was the purpose
of religion,' Toby said.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.830
'Yes, that too,' Quiff agreed.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.570
'Professional
sports,' I offered.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.550
'Right again.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.050
These are the things that make
capitalism work, the things

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.550
that make you take
your eyes off how

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.010
the system is rigged to fuck
the common man on behalf

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:12.002
of the elite.

00:27:12.002 --> 00:27:14.210
You might be working more
for more for less, but hey,

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.822
wasn't that World Cup exciting?

00:27:15.822 --> 00:27:17.780
And don't worry, you'll
go to heaven ultimately

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:18.946
while the rich burn in hell.

00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:21.250
So take comfort in that.'

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.000
'I feel like we've
gone off topic here.'

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.150
'Not at all,' Quiff insisted,
'because religion, sports,

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.990
they don't have a
thing on the internet.'

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.020
'It's bigger than
Jesus,' Toby smirked.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.720
'Bigger than Jesus, the
Beatles, Elvis combined.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.400
You can steal content for free.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.780
You can communicate without
long distance charges.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.220
You can zone out and do
nothing while feeling

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:43.949
like you're doing something for
days, days, your whole life.

00:27:43.949 --> 00:27:45.740
Why am I explaining
this to you, Gladstone?

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.210
I read your book.'

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.140
I sat forward in my seat.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.190
I got close enough to
Quiff to see his eyes

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:55.160
were blue, like mine, like that
Not Net creature I'd imagined

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.890
in the Statue of Liberty
at the end of my New York

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:59.620
investigation.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.321
'What's wrong?' Quiff asked.

00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:01.820
'Nothing.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.540
I just hate this.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.040
I hate it.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.410
Why does everything
have to be just-- fuck.'

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.620
Quiff turned to Toby,
who nodded in agreement.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.140
'What he said.'

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.270
'Look, I know the net
was created by geniuses

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.400
in conjunction with
the military,' I said,

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.870
'but I just can't-- why
can't it just be a symbol

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.840
of our ingenuity instead of
just another form of control?

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.090
Can't it just be a pure thing?'

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.590
'Like what?' Quiff asked.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.090
'Nuclear power that can solve
the world's energy concerns

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.390
with just an
occasional Chernobyl?

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.890
Or television that can bring
Shakespeare plays into people's

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.560
homes, as well as attack ads
during presidential campaigns?

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.650
Grow up, Gladstone.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.940
There are no pure things.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.930
People are dirty.'

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.440
I'm going to up the ante on
me crying from, like, three

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.284
out of 10 to six out of 10.

00:28:47.284 --> 00:28:48.200
Not there yet, though.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.080
You'll know when I
devolve behind the podium.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.010
"I thought back to college.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.880
Romaya had taken a job
at a mall Starbucks kiosk

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.550
before quitting due to all
the sexual harassment coming

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.470
from her ecstasy-chopping
hippie boss.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.820
I'd come to pick her
up too early one day.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.460
I was always too early, but
this day I used the time

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.740
to wander the mall.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.050
I wasn't looking to buy anything
with just $12.00 in my pocket

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.470
and too little in my checking
account to make a $20.00

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:15.830
minimum withdrawal.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.610
But I saw dollar
store and wondered

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.130
if I might find something
stupid and fun to give her.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.700
Before I entered, I saw a
father with three girls, all

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.190
with tidy, clipped,
ridiculously blonde hair,

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.010
walking towards the store.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.837
His t-shirt and
jeans were stained,

00:29:29.837 --> 00:29:31.420
and I assumed he had
a job that didn't

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.530
require him to shave every day.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.040
Despite having
girls looking to be

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.660
about ages 12, 10,
and eight, he couldn't

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.340
have been more than 30.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.790
The girls were leading the
way, but before they entered,

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.940
they stopped and looked back
at their dad, who said proudly,

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.840
'All right, girls.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.340
You can have anything you
want.' They squealed and ran

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:55.200
into the store like contestants
on a shopping spree game show.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.760
'What's choking you up,
Gladstone?' Quiff asked.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.370
But I didn't answer.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.500
How could I explain
to him what I'd seen?

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.070
How could I tell
them about a father

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.240
who had nothing but
found a way to create

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.637
a moment of unbridled
joy for his children?

00:30:07.637 --> 00:30:09.720
Were there words to describe
the hope, or at least

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.560
the possibility, of this
man patching together

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.520
enough tiny moments
so that by the time

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.020
his girls realized
how desperately poor

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.650
they were, they'd already
had a happy childhood?

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.130
Or could I explain
what this father

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.260
must have felt, knowing that
in a world trying to crush him

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.350
with everything he didn't have,
for this moment he was a hero?

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.730
How could I explain any
of that to a man who

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.094
didn't believe in pure things?

00:30:33.094 --> 00:30:35.010
'I don't think I can
explain it to you, Quiff.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.920
I believe in things.'

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.050
'I know you do, Gladstone.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.320
You're a true believer.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.220
And that's why going
on TV isn't enough.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.322
After you do that, you'll
have a choice to make.

00:30:43.322 --> 00:30:44.905
You'll have to stop
your investigation

00:30:44.905 --> 00:30:47.510
and go away, or
raise a real army

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.360
and shut this whole thing down.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.110
You find the latest
internet phone book,

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.710
narrow your list of suspects,
and I'll help you raise forces

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.570
for attack.'

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.070
'Wait a second,' Toby said. 'If
you think the government can

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.620
just turn the net back on,
doesn't that also mean you

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.210
think the government
shut it off?

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.870
I thought we didn't know
who was responsible.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.328
I thought that was the point
of finding the newest internet

00:31:05.328 --> 00:31:09.360
phone book, to limit the list
of suspects to just a few.'

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.890
Quiff paused for a second.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.470
'Yes, good point.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:14.450
But everything is
connected, always.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.890
No one can sustain
anything without some form

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.220
of collaboration.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.570
Now it's time to
gather your forces.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.600
It's a matter of survival.'

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.700
'I don't want an army.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.660
I don't want to fight anyone.'

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.180
'What do you want?'

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.350
'I want to explain.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.170
I want to teach.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.920
I want to sit with
even a man like you,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.890
steeped in pragmatism, and
explain that pure things

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.030
exist.'

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.620
'You'll be sitting a
long time, Gladstone.'

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.000
'Well, then, I want to go home.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.060
Take me home.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.190
I have no idea where
you've taken me.'

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.920
'You are home,' Quiff
said, unlocking the doors.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.170
I looked out the windows
for the first time

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.580
to see we were right
outside Toby's apartment.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.820
We were just circling
while we talked.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.620
I got up to leave
without saying goodbye.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.260
'Gladstone,' Quiff said, handing
me a blank business card with

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.020
a handwritten phone number.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.020
'Promise to call me when
you need that army.'"

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.900
Thank you.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.800
That's the reading.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.162
Thank you very much.

00:32:12.162 --> 00:32:12.870
How are we doing?

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:17.940
We've got-- we're
at 12:36, so I guess

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.870
we have time for any questions.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:23.340
And if not, I'll probably
end up asking you questions,

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.540
because I hate dead space.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.720
AUDIENCE: Well, I
do have a question.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:33.210
You mentioned some of the
research that you did.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:37.730
I'm kind of curious, as
a detail-oriented person,

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.800
as many of us are here
at Google, to what extent

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.880
was it important to you in
writing this that you try

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.240
to get technical details right?

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.180
Because obviously,
the conceit here

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.920
is that somehow the internet
can crash, which is a little--

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.930
WAYNE GLADSTONE: Correct.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.860
AUDIENCE: But once
you take that,

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.075
how much did you really care
about having one thing follow

00:32:58.075 --> 00:32:59.280
from another?

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.390
WAYNE GLADSTONE: I
care more about it

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.450
with each book in
the trilogy because

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.000
of the nature of the story.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.480
In notes, I did research.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.991
I read I read Blum's book,
"Tubes," which I really

00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:12.490
enjoyed.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.740
And I didn't really
need to more than that

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:21.270
because Book One is very much
in the protagonist's head.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.130
It's a very personal
story against the backdrop

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:25.650
of an apocalypse.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:30.710
For Book Two, when we have a guy
doing actually investigation,

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.140
I needed to understand it more.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.250
So I got a deeper
understanding of the players

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:44.930
necessary to make
such a thing possible.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:50.980
I mean, I had to learn a lot
about the hubs, the main hubs

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:56.250
of the world, learning that-- as
I try to explain in the book--

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.350
I didn't want the book
to be overly technical,

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:59.850
but I wanted to
explain to people,

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:04.130
like, when I was a kid
before-- the internet existed

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:09.770
on campuses and the military,
but not in our daily life.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:14.560
But I worked a job where
everyone in the bookstore

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.389
had email.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:19.150
But it was a bookstore email and
it was just within the company.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:23.569
And even though the minutiae of
the internet is very technical,

00:34:23.569 --> 00:34:27.280
the framework of
it is very simple.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.685
I mean, the sense that you
have to connect things.

00:34:29.685 --> 00:34:31.060
Things have to
literally connect,

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.840
and really, a global
network is just

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.830
an aggregation of lots
of little networks,

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.219
and they all come together at, I
forget, five, six, seven places

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:45.250
in the world where really
all the places in the world

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.530
come together.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.770
For Book Three, which
I'm working on now,

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:52.710
I had to do a lot of
research, and I still

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:57.330
am because-- not to
give anything away,

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:02.390
but I had to find out more
about the deep web, which

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.320
are those sites that
exist in the world

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.890
but aren't affiliated with
any search engine like Google

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:12.210
or anyone else, a
whole other-- someone

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.750
had said that what we
think of as the internet

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:19.070
is really just dragging a net
over the top of the ocean.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:22.960
And the worst people in the
world, pedophiles and drug

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.250
rings, are existing as
deep sea on the bottom.

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.320
So I didn't want the book
to become overly technical,

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.320
to answer your question.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.940
But I did want to have enough
of a foundation to not say

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.610
anything completely stupid.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.840
That was the gist of it.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.000
And with each book, I've had to
do more research than the book

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.330
before to learn those details.

00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:50.005
So that's one question.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.190
Does anyone have
a second question?

00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:00.430
That's a lot of pressure.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.140
No, I know, I know.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.660
Oh, OK.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.324
AUDIENCE: So you write things
on the internet for a living?

00:36:12.324 --> 00:36:13.740
WAYNE GLADSTONE:
Part of a living.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.827
AUDIENCE: I guess now you
also write things on paper.

00:36:16.827 --> 00:36:18.660
How much was writing
this in the first book,

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.365
and the stuff that
led into it, was

00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:23.734
that like a cathartic,
like, no more internet,

00:36:23.734 --> 00:36:25.650
I'm done with this whole
thing kind of moment?

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.050
Or was it more of a, I wonder
what would happen if this, then

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:31.011
that?

00:36:31.011 --> 00:36:32.760
WAYNE GLADSTONE: No,
it's a good question.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.020
Yeah.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.023
No reason for you to
stand while I answer it.

00:36:38.023 --> 00:36:41.090
That would be a drag.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:45.380
My identity as someone who
creates, in part of what I do,

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.210
creating internet content,
does inform the book

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:55.820
in several ways, because if
there's one theme of the book,

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.980
it's that the internet is
not good and it's not bad.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.700
The internet is people.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.240
That's what the internet is.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.310
So your attempts to
define the internet

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:08.020
are as fruitless and
foolish as your attempts

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.285
to define humanity.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:15.810
And that's a theme that
comes up over and over.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.890
So the point is, in the way that
I love people, I hate people.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.830
And in the way I love
the internet, especially

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:26.630
for communication purposes
and information retrieval.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.640
That's what I love
about the internet.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.650
That's the way it
totally changed my life,

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.380
that some of my best friends
did not live in my city,

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.710
in my town, that there are
people I met-- one of my best

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.525
friends, I've known
him for over 10 years,

00:37:38.525 --> 00:37:40.820
and I've met him in
person, like, four times.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.334
Well, his name's Matt Toby.

00:37:42.334 --> 00:37:44.000
He's nothing like the
Toby in this book,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.740
but that's why I used
that, because to me

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:52.040
he was a green dot on
Gmail, which I do use,

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.120
more than a human being.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.670
But why did-- I think
a related question

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:00.770
to what you're asking
is, why did I name

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:02.700
the character after myself?

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.650
How does my own identity
as someone who writes

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.600
online sort of inform that?

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.810
And I initially named
him after myself

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:15.040
because I started Book One
as a serialized novella

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:15.870
on cracked.com.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.720
And I just thought,
since it was so

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.620
weird to have
fiction on that site,

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.720
it really wasn't
hardly ever done,

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.680
that it would be
helpful to the reader

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.270
if I took this kind
of Gladstone persona

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.520
that I'd created for my columns
and put it into a story.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.040
It would just help
guide them in.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.590
When it came time to
do the book properly,

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:38.230
I was going to give him just
a name that wasn't my own.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.590
But I was at the day job,
and I wanted a week off.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.930
And I got a call from my wife
at the time, who said, hi, we

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:46.580
have absolutely no money.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.020
So I said, oh, I guess have
to write a column this week.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.020
And I really didn't want to.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.350
And I just-- this
sounds so false.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:55.960
It's absolutely true.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.960
I just went, aah,
and closed my eyes

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.970
and typed with my eyes
closed, and typed a paragraph,

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.470
like a free writing,
which I'd done

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.440
and they made you do in school,
and of course it always sucks.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.670
But it turned out to
be almost word for word

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.900
the paragraph that starts
Book One, which is, like,

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.140
"One day, without any
notice, suddenly the internet

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.000
stopped working."

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.200
And I looked at it and I
expanded it out 1,000 words.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.120
And I knew instantly
it was like a novel.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.536
Or if it wasn't a novel, it
was a movie, it was a trilogy.

00:39:28.536 --> 00:39:31.980
I knew it was big, and
I was terrified of it,

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:36.070
and I didn't want to do it,
because writing books is

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.910
not a get rich quick
scheme, I guess,

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:42.390
unless it's twilight fan fiction
with lots of sex throw in.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.860
Then I guess it's a
get rich quick scheme.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.360
Man, she's going
to be so upset when

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.890
she finds out I burned her.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:52.880
I'm talking about
"Fifty Shades of Grey."

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.100
So it seemed like a lot
of work for no reward.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.660
So I tried to get people to
convince me not to write it.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.700
So I showed my
friend Jason Roeder,

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.440
who is now a senior
editor for "The Onion,"

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.790
and I really downplayed it.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.950
I was like, could you
look at this thing I did?

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:08.965
It's 1,000 words.

00:40:08.965 --> 00:40:10.690
It's nothing.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.070
Tell me it's nothing.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:14.150
And he looked at it
and he said, yeah,

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.680
I don't really see
anything there.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.080
And I said, fuck
you, it's a novel.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:23.950
And that's why I wrote it,
because I'm so annoyed.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.710
I set him up to tell
me it wasn't a novel,

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.210
and that was the impetus
I needed to write it.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:33.450
And since, to save you
the burden of asking more

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:37.320
questions, and to give me the
joy of hearing my own voice,

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.230
the related part of that story
is, after I sold the book,

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:45.100
I mentioned off-handedly
that I saw it as a trilogy.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.050
And my publisher said,
well, tell me about that.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.490
And without thinking--
well, I thought,

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:54.860
but it took me half an hour.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.360
I wrote a page and 1/2
about broad strokes

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.450
about where I saw the series
going, w because I thought

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.570
maybe we'd talk about it.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.897
Oh, that sounds good,
that sounds bad.

00:41:04.897 --> 00:41:06.980
And the very next day my
agent called me and said,

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.730
they want to make you
an offer on Book Two

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:11.770
and Book Three before Book
One had even come out.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.820
And because I'm a
normal person, I

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:19.485
got really pissed off, because
to me that was terrifying.

00:41:19.485 --> 00:41:23.560
I thought, OK, I'll commit
this portion of my life

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.310
to this book.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:29.690
But at least if it fails and
no one likes it, cut my losses.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.780
And I know that there's a
Book Two and Three out there,

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.720
but I'll never waste
time writing it

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.830
unless they ask me to.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.204
And they're never
going to ask me

00:41:37.204 --> 00:41:39.880
to unless the first one
makes a lot of money.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.530
And they fooled me by asking
me to commit to the idea

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.500
before I knew whether
or not it was proven.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.550
So from a guy who was really too
afraid to finish his paragraph

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.090
free writing, I
somehow committed

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.950
to writing three novels before
I had any idea if anyone

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.410
would care about it.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:03.260
And now I'm working on the
third and still not sure.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.540
But, you know, those
people who do like it

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:10.770
seem to like it an awful lot.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:16.040
And those who don't-- well, the
first review on Amazon Book One

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:22.070
got was a woman who was
very, very upset because she

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:26.970
didn't approve of all
the cat rape in the book.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:30.240
There's a reference to
a cat in Chapter One.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.740
As far as I know, there
was no animal sodomized

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.080
in any of my literature.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.951
But the very first
review I got on Amazon

00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:37.950
was, this is disgusting.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:38.760
I didn't finish it.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.551
I don't approve of cat rape.

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:46.440
But since then the response
has all been more positive.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.320
Is there anything else
I can answer for anyone?

00:42:58.272 --> 00:42:59.230
Oh, you got a question?

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:01.960
Or should I ask my
question, one that

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.812
usually catalyzes audiences?

00:43:04.812 --> 00:43:05.770
What do you want to do?

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:07.390
You want to do it?

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.822
What they would miss most
in an internet apocalypse.

00:43:09.822 --> 00:43:11.530
Is there anyone who
wants to answer that?

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:12.571
Beside your job, I guess.

00:43:12.571 --> 00:43:14.180
That would suck.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:18.160
Although in Book Two, the Romaya
character interviews for a job

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.010
at Google.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:22.280
And you should probably
all read the book

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.490
just so you can curse me and be
like, that's not like Google.

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.430
It's the California Google.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.186
I made a big ball pit.

00:43:30.186 --> 00:43:32.560
Now I don't know there's a
big ball pit at the California

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.820
Google-- it's there?

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.150
There is a ball pit?

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.700
OK.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.180
Now I know there are
razor scooters here.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.940
Are there Segways
out in California?

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.290
Does anyone ride a Segway?

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:45.697
AUDIENCE: Bikes.

00:43:45.697 --> 00:43:46.530
WAYNE GLADSTONE: OK.

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:47.890
Well, it's a work of fiction.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:49.940
So it's OK.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.660
Actually, is there a Segway?

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:53.590
Yeah, OK.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:54.760
So there are Segways.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.270
So if you want to fact check
me, you should buy the book.
