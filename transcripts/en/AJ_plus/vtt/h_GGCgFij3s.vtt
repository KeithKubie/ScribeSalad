00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:06.133
While the rest of Mexico celebrated the victory of Andrés Manuel López Obrador,

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.893
this small town went about its business.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.083
That's because elections are banned here. 

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:46.714
Cherán sits in the northwest portion of Michoacán.

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.674
The state is overrun by violent crime and political corruption. 

00:00:50.662 --> 00:00:51.834
But not here.

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:55.040
Cherán's 20,000 residents solved those problems by 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.320
kicking out politicians, cops and its mayor.

00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:23.773
Strict rules forbid political parties and campaigning within the town limits. 

00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:27.707
Even motorists entering Cherán have to remove party bumper stickers.

00:01:56.913 --> 00:02:01.429
Cherán also hasn't had a murder, kidnapping or disappearance in seven years.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.280
Minor offenses like theft, drunk driving and disorderly conduct 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.173
are dealt with by imposing community service.

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:11.415
One way the town curtailed crime was limiting access.

00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:16.527
Three entry checkpoints are staffed by guards with assault rifles and body armor.

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:20.727
They're part of a homegrown patrol system in charge of protecting the town.

00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:22.757
That includes Andrés Fabián.

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:49.153
The town's transformation began in 2011,

00:02:49.153 --> 00:02:52.711
after a group of women decided to drive away illegal loggers.

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:12.900
Witnesses rang the town bells to alert the community, 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.968
and this set off an uprising that became known as the chiming.

00:03:32.213 --> 00:03:35.614
Up until this point, the town had been overrun by the loggers, 

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:37.781
who harassed and threatened residents.

00:04:16.692 --> 00:04:21.093
Today, Cherán is governed by its residents, with strict rules and guidelines 

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:23.589
based on their indigenous Purépecha roots.

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:45.778
Each block in Cherán discusses their issues at a community bonfire. 

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:49.753
Then they elect K’eris, or representatives like Enerino Santaclara,

00:04:49.753 --> 00:04:52.080
to bring these issues to the general assembly.

00:05:09.053 --> 00:05:12.353
The community has also been slowly restoring the forest 

00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:15.154
and nursing tree seedlings in a community garden.

00:05:35.373 --> 00:05:39.586
Cherán has become an example for other communities across Mexico.

00:05:39.587 --> 00:05:44.307
In 2018, 32 towns boycotted the presidential elections.

00:05:44.287 --> 00:05:48.181
Others are now looking to replicate its success against crime and corruption.
