00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.970
The Disney Universe has you covered for your
favorite films and that’s because they acquired

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.821
Star Wars, The Muppets, Marvel Comics and
Pixar all within the last few decades. Their

00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:17.411
universe is large and this means there are
a lot of Easter eggs for us to find. We have

00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:21.060
picked out ten that will surely get you to
pay closer attention to the Disney Universe

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.989
and spark your interest in spotting your own.
Stick around to find out how a hidden Mickey

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.429
was put in a Muppet film.

Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Easter
Eggs In The Disney Universe That Will Blow

00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:42.150
Your Mind.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:51.339
Rey’s Helmet in Star Wars: Episode VII – The
Force Awakens

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.609
When The Force Awakens first hit theaters
fans immediately saw the X-Wing fighter pilot

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.350
doll in Rey’s home, but in another scene
she places an old rebel helmet on her head.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.100
The Helmet has the Star Wars Aurebesh letters
“Resh,” “Enth,” and “Herf” on

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.510
the side of it and when translated into English
spells, R , AE, H; which is pronounced Rey.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.690
Don’t get excited, this doesn’t mean Rey
was a fighter pilot because the markings on

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.790
the helmet mean it is from the Tierfon Yellow
Aces, specifically Captain Dosmit Raeh, a

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.800
female X-Wing pilot. All of this just from
a helmet!

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.290
Bomb Voyage in Ratatouille

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.570
Bomb Voyage is a criminal mastermind in the
movie The Incredibles and he even escapes

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.500
Mr. Incredible’s criminal fighting grips.
Sure it’s because of the interference of

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.610
a young Buddy but Mr. Voyage keeps that off
his resume. Another item he keeps off his

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.880
resume is his work as a mime in France. In
the movie Ratatouille when Linguini and Colette

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.360
are roller-skating by Notre Dame he can be
scene in the background performing. Maybe

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.060
this was a disguise for a plot to blow up
a famous landmark or a failed career move.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.530
Alyssa Milano in Guardians of the Galaxy

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.610
There are many references to 1980’s paraphernalia
in the film Guardians of the Galaxy including

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.479
the popular troll doll and a very famous alien.
This is not an alien from that galaxy but

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.630
a cat-eating alien from the 1980’s sitcom
Alf. Another nod to the 80’s goes back to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.940
Quill’s childhood crush, Alyssa Milano.
He named his starship the Milano after her,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.640
looks like after all those relationships with
aliens, Star-Lord still has a place in his

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:33.950
heart for the Who’s the Boss? star and so
do we.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.050
WALL-E in Finding Dory

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.500
Hank became one of the fan favorite characters
in Finding Dory and if you have seen the film

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.410
you know why. Another fan favorite character
is WALL-E from the 2008 film with the same

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.010
name. If Pixar can figure out a way to make
a spinoff film with Hank and WALL-E, we would

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.840
be thrilled but until then we will only have
one scene. In Finding Dory, when Hank has

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.680
Dory suspended over a massive aquarium in
a plastic cup you can see a WALL-E calendar

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.650
in the background. Maybe WALL-E units were
just being built during this time and 700

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.760
years later his story will pick up again.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.090
Pingo Doce in Ant-Man

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.959
In the 2008 film The Incredible Hulk, Doctor
Bruce Banner works at a bottling factory in

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.790
Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, while searching
for a cure for his condition. He cuts his

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.180
finger and a drop of his blood goes into the
bottle killing a very recognizable elderly

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.740
man in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is how General
Thunderbolt Ross finds his location and hunts

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.319
him down. In the film Ant-Man, when Scott
Lang walks in the streets of San Francisco

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.380
you can see faded posters for the guarana
soda but where is the warning label?

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.819
Luxo Ball in Inside Out

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.880
The Luzo Ball was in Pixars first short film
and can be seen in every Pixar feature length

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.430
movie since. Some of the spottings are obvious
like in Toy Story but others are hard to spot,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.210
one in particular is in the film Inside Out.
When Riley is playing with her imaginary friend,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.410
Bing Bong they run right past the pall in
the corner. Also, remember how Bing Bong is

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.239
part dolphin? Check out the dolphin drawing
Riley is working on.

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:20.269
Big Hero 6 in Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.050
As Tony Stark prepares to head off into the
final battle against Ultron and the Ultron

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.830
army he is left without JARVIS to aid him.
So he shifts through a collection of AI programs

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.550
that he has created over the years. In the
end he chooses Friday, a female-voiced colleague

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.229
but look at the other choices he had. One
is labeled JACOSTA, which is a robot Ultron

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.240
creates in the comics and another is labeled
TACASHI. Tadashi is the name of Hiro Hamada's

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.110
older brother, who created Baymax in Big Hero
6.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.680
Iron Giant in The Incredibles

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.999
Elastigirl helps director Brad Bird drop an
Easter Egg to an animated film that wasn’t

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:02.850
even made by Disney. Bird is the director
of The Incredibles and the director of the

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.339
Warner Brothers animated film Iron Giant;
both critically acclaimed films. When Elastigirl

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:15.710
flies in a plane she identifies her plane
to the radio tower. It stands for I G 99,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:24.319
which also stands for Iron Giant, 1999. The
year Bird’s film was released.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.759
Cars 2 in The Muppets

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:31.800
In 2004 Disney purchased the Muppets intellectual
properties from the Jim Henson Company giving

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.020
them the opportunity to make their own Muppet
films. Then in 2011 they did just that with

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.300
their musical comedy The Muppets. At the end
of the film when the stars and a great deal

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.740
of extras perform a song and dance routine
on Hollywood Blvd there is a billboard for

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.719
Cars 2. If that wasn’t enough checkout the
hidden Mickey in the fireworks! Looks like

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:59.460
Crazy Harry used his pyrotechnic skills for
brand promoting.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.039
Vision in Captain America: Civil War

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.529
The Infinity Gauntlet is given its unlimited
power by having all six infinity stones in

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.800
the MCU. One of these stones is named the
mind stone; the powers of this stone are near

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.051
limitless psychic abilities including telepathy
and telekinesis. If you look closely to Vision’s

00:06:16.051 --> 00:06:20.340
head in Captain America: Civil War you will
notice he wears the stone on his forehead.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.050
This is bad news for vision since Thanos will
stop at nothing to acquire all six stones

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.919
and complete his Gauntlet.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:38.849
There you have it ten Easter Eggs In The Disney
Universe That Will Blow Your Mind. Don’t
