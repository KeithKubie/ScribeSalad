is correct if the iou is greater than
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.289
is correct if the iou is greater than

perfectly the iou would be 1 because the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
perfectly the iou would be 1 because the
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.730
perfectly the iou would be 1 because the
intersection would equal to the union

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
intersection would equal to the union
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.090
intersection would equal to the union
but in general Selassie IOU is greater

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
but in general Selassie IOU is greater
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.179
but in general Selassie IOU is greater

convention very often 0.5 is used as a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
convention very often 0.5 is used as a
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.859
convention very often 0.5 is used as a
threshold to judge as whether the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
threshold to judge as whether the
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.930

predicted bounding box is correct or not

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940
predicted bounding box is correct or not
 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.180

this is just a convention if you want to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190
this is just a convention if you want to
 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.740
this is just a convention if you want to
be more stringent you can judge an

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750
be more stringent you can judge an
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.200
be more stringent you can judge an
answer as correct only the IOU is

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210
answer as correct only the IOU is
 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.960
answer as correct only the IOU is
greater than equal to 0.6 or some other

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970
greater than equal to 0.6 or some other
 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.930
greater than equal to 0.6 or some other
number but the higher the IOUs the more

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940
number but the higher the IOUs the more
 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.350
number but the higher the IOUs the more
accurate the bounding box and so this is

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360
accurate the bounding box and so this is
 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.650
accurate the bounding box and so this is
one way to map localization to accuracy

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660
one way to map localization to accuracy
 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.690
one way to map localization to accuracy
where you just count up the number of

where you just count up the number of
 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.290
where you just count up the number of
times an algorithm correctly detects and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
times an algorithm correctly detects and
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.150
times an algorithm correctly detects and
localizes an object where you could use

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160
localizes an object where you could use
 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.730
localizes an object where you could use
the definition like this of whether or

the definition like this of whether or
 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.670
the definition like this of whether or
not the object is correctly localized

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680
not the object is correctly localized
 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.570
not the object is correctly localized

compute a union and take the ratio of

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739
compute a union and take the ratio of
 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.810
compute a union and take the ratio of
the two areas and so this is also a way

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820
