- Let's talk about Tyreek Hill,

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.970 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
the Kansas City
Chiefs' wide receiver

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.874 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
who is being investigated
according to the
Kansas City Star

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:10.443 line:0%
and Overland Park Police who say

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.346 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
they are investigating
two incidents,

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:17.017 line:0%
including one where a
source from the Star

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.886 align:start position:0%
believes that his three-year-old
son broke his arm.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.723 align:start size:97% position:3%
- They're not investigating
the three-year-old son

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:24.924 align:start size:84% position:16%
broke his arm,
they're investigating

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
that Tyreek Hill
broke his son's arm.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.395 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Right.
- Yeah, you didn't say that.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.097 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I said it was a
domestic assault case.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.699
I think people can
put it together.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.668
- No, if they investigate
the son broke his arm,

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.070 align:start size:81% position:19%
but they're saying
Tyreek did it.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.205
It wasn't the mom,
he didn't just fall,

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.874
he didn't fall out
of a fucking tree,

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.376
Tyreek Hill broke
his own son's arm.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.544
- Well they haven't
charged him yet,

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.779
so it's a little, careful.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:46.846 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But that's what
they're investigating,

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:49.816
that's the story, allegedly.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:52.385 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's a domestic violence
story with a twist,

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.686
you know what I mean?

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.888
It's a kid this time,
which I always enjoy.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.423
(Erica laughs)

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.857
We do a lot of you know,
they're beating up women,

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.859
I don't like that.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.728
It's a boy, it's a
three-year-old boy,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.897
then we can have some
fun with the topic,

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:04.831
you know what I mean?

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.467
Then we can kind of mess around.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.969
When I saw the story,
my first thought was

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:12.906
what did the kid do,
you know what I mean?

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.140
They never asked that.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.010
When, who's the running
back who beat his kid

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.545 align:start size:81% position:19%
with a switch?
- Adrian Peterson.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.447 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Adrian Peterson never
explained what his kid did

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.082
to deserve that, do
you know what I mean?

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.917 align:start size:88% position:13%
He was just like, I
punish my kid sometimes,

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.418
I hit him a little too hard.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.288
He never said like, if
he had been like the kid,

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.791 align:start size:84% position:16%
you know, put oatmeal
in my DVD player,

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:34.127
then we'd be like okay,
maybe you were justified.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.829 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I want to know what
Tyreek Hill, like,

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.465
what the kid did that
Tyreek Hill had to

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:43.470
allegedly break his
three-year-old son's
arm over his knee

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.638
which is how I imagine it,

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.273 align:start size:84% position:16%
that's how I imagine
he broke the arm.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.541
How would you picture it, Gregg?

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.009
- I wouldn't.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.511 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You think he maybe
threw him down some stairs

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.113 align:start size:97% position:3%
kind of thing, or like just
picked him up by an arm

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.414
and broke it?

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:55.982
Do you think maybe
they were playing?

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.118
- While you say it's kind
of more fun to play around

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:03.022
with the kid angle of it, it
does involve the kid's mom

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.926
as another person
involved, separate,

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:11.931
and she was also
someone he beat up

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.902
in a domestic assault in
college and pled guilty it,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.140 align:start size:84% position:16%
while she was pregnant
with this kid.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.208
So there's levels,
there's levels to it.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.877
- Gregg, how did he get drafted

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:28.982 align:start size:97% position:3%
if he got charged with
domestic violence in college?

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.050
How'd that slip through
the cracks of the NFL?

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.986
- He got drafted a little later.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.788 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Did the people find
out after he got drafted

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:36.723
that it happened?

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:37.957
- People knew ahead of time.

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.192 align:start size:81% position:19%
- They knew it all
the time, yeah?

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:40.693
Was there a chance that
the kid broke his arm

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:44.097
when Tyreek Hill beat
up his pregnant mom

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.132 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then they didn't find
out about it until later on?

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:49.369
(Erica laughs)

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.870
- Three years?

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.173
- I've never seen you guys
so uncomfortable with a story

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.808
before, I hope we use this
as part of the YouTube video

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.911
because Gregg is
so uncomfortable.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.179
- I'm not.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.648 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Erica gasped, which
I've never heard before.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.583
Listen, it's a three-year-old.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.385 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Look, I made it
through the Kraft week,

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.553
I think I can survive.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Getting his arm broken
by his own father.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.190
- [Gregg] Yeah.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.292
- And how was Tyreek Hill
this year, as a player?

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.493
Did he have a good season?

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.628
- He was good enough
that there was a report

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.263
on our network about a month ago

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.265 align:start size:84% position:16%
that they were
discussing a contract

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.467
which might make him the
highest paid wide receiver

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.203
in the league.
- Really, okay.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.737
- That was before this came out.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.040
- So he earned this, in a
way, you know what I mean?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.542 align:start size:94% position:6%
You're allowed, and
listen, here's the thing.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.811 align:start size:94% position:6%
You break an arm, you
break a bone in your body,

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:34.814 align:start size:94% position:6%
this is science, you
break a bone in your body,

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.016 align:start size:94% position:6%
it heals and it's
stronger than ever before.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.918
You can never break it
in that place again.

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.254 align:start size:84% position:16%
Isn't that what
parenting's all about,

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.722 align:start size:88% position:13%
preparing your
children for the world?

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.924
- What is this medical
science you speak of

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.526
that it's stronger than before?

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:47.694
- It's a fact, it's a fact.

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:49.529 align:start size:84% position:16%
When a bone breaks,
when it heals

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.064
you can never break the
bone in that same place.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.533
It's like, it's break-proof.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.101
- (laughs) That's such nonsense.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.804
- That's the medical
term, break-proof.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.839
If you're a doctor and
you're listening to this.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.307
- You make it sound like
it's one of those lizards

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.977 align:start size:94% position:6%
where you cut the head
off and it can grow again,

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.211
grow like another arm.

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.613
- If you cut off the
tip of a baby's finger

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:07.880
it will grow back.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.483
I saw that on Twitter
once, on a WTF Facts,

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.119
that that's true.

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.188
- As a result, there
may be a brief period

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.090
in the healing process
when the fracture site

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.891 align:start size:84% position:16%
is stronger than the
surrounding bone.

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.059
- A brief period.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.794 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But they later
reach equal strength,

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.063
and the fracture site is
no more or less likely

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:24.897
to break again.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:26.766
- What'd you read that on?

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.034
- NewYorkTimes.com.

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:30.403
- I though in general
if you break a leg

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:31.671
you're more likely to break it

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start size:88% position:13%
cuz it just shows you're
kinda prone to it.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.010 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, you're thinking of
dislocating an arm or a leg--

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.478 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Shoulder.
- Or something, yeah,

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:40.213 align:start size:84% position:16%
then it's gonna
happen all the time.

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:42.548
So Tyreek Hill didn't do
that, he was smart enough

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.083
not to dislocate his son's arm.

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:46.286
But I want to know
what the kid did.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.520
Listen, okay?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.722
If Walker hadn't
turned it around,

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:52.392
and Walker's four, he's
probably past the age

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:53.693
where you can break his arm.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:54.894
(Erica and Gregg laugh)

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.463 align:start size:84% position:16%
But if he's three
then I think sometimes

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:58.931
you gotta teach them a lesson,

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.933 align:start size:94% position:6%
and there's no better
lesson than breaking him.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.803
He didn't burn the kid,
which he could have done,

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.839
depending on what the
kid did, I don't know.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.076
Maybe the kid didn't do
anything and Tyreek Hill

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:12.278
confused him for another
kid that did something?

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:14.213 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well it would
seem that no matter

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.748 align:start size:84% position:16%
what a three-year-old
did, you know,

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.917
it wouldn't be worthy
of breaking his arm.

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:18.851
(Erica laughs)

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.520
- I mean not for me, you know?

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.690 align:start size:97% position:3%
But again, I'm not a father.
- Apparently.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.426
- I don't know the
joy of being a father

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.027
and disciplining your own child.

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:30.530
- Neither do I.

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.766 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Actually I guess I can tell,
I've been around your kids,

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.068
they've never been disciplined.

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:36.536
(Erica laughs)

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.838 align:start size:97% position:3%
But if they were my kids,
they'd be in casts right now.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:42.608
- A Jesus Christ
statue in a small--

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.243
- No, no, that's not a statue.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:45.912
- They called it a statue.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.146
- It's a doll.

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.082
- It's a doll, but
they call it a statue

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:50.383
because it's up in a house

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:53.786 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they have it
prominently displayed.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.221
- You don't turn a
doll into a statue

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.522
by putting it up in a house.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:57.623 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's what they call it,
(Erica laughs)

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.025
that's what they're calling it.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:03.963 align:start size:97% position:3%
Residents of a small
village in Acapulco, Mexico

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:08.301
are concerned because they claim

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.504 align:start size:84% position:16%
that for the fourth
time this year

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.773
this baby Jesus doll

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.777
has started crying blood.

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:19.178
- My favorite part
of the story is,

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:21.147
cuz I read the story
and it was like a doll

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:23.916
that they claim is
a baby Jesus doll.

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:27.653
It's not like an official
like TM baby Jesus doll,

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's just a baby doll
that they're like

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.125
this could be Jesus.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:35.328
It looks just like
a regular baby doll.

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:38.431
- Yeah, I'm a little confused
why it's a baby Jesus doll.

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:39.899
- It looks like a girl.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.769 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Especially with the
very professional looking

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.672 align:start size:88% position:13%
blood (Erica sighs)
coming out of its eyes.

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.775
- It looks like a girl
that Tyreek Hill babysat.

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:52.311 align:start size:88% position:13%
(Gregg and Erica laugh)
Allegedly.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.281 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's a baby
wearing a bib, too,

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:56.582
like is Jesus wearing a bib--

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:57.617
- Yeah and it's got like a hat.

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.752
- And a hat that
says Bear on it.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:00.920
- I thought the baby
doll would have like

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.156 align:start size:84% position:16%
a beard and long
hair, but it doesn't,

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:05.958 align:start size:94% position:6%
and that's what Jesus
was all about from birth.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.228 align:start size:94% position:6%
If you guys read the story
of the nativity scene,

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:11.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
baby Jesus, full beard
when he was born.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.432
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:17.036
- So they are concerned
in this village that--

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.705
- But aren't they excited,
they're like oh this is like,

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:21.207
some people think
it's a good thing,

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.143
like this is God saying hey,
what's up, Acapulco rules.

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:25.978
And some people are saying
oh, maybe it's the devil.

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:27.580
- Right, one woman said, yeah,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.248
a lot of people have said
it's done by the devil,

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:30.883
others think it's
a message from God.

00:07:30.883 --> 00:07:34.420
They believe that the
statue's crying is

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.190
in direct response to
the amount of murders

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.126
in that village, in
which there are many.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.462 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And it's not just
crying, it's crying blood.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.729
- Crying blood.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:44.964
- [Anthony] Which is
a whole other level.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.432
- It happened first
on New Year's Day,

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:49.569 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it's happened three
more times since, this year.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.171
- I would love to know
who noticed it first.

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:53.105
Who was like hey, what's up?

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.307
- It's in someone's house.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.242 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No one's like hey,
is that ketchup?

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:57.477
(Erica laughs)

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.946
Like I don't believe
that dolls cry blood.

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:02.048
That's probably not
a baby Jesus doll.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.484
Dolls mostly don't cry blood.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.618 align:start size:97% position:3%
Did you play with dolls
when you were a kid, Erica?

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:06.819
- Yes.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.054 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Did any of them cry blood?
- Never.

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:09.088
- Never, not even
when you rapped?

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:10.356 align:start size:72% position:28%
- No. (laughs)
- No?

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:12.024
Cuz I would think
that would do it.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.027
Gregg, how do you feel
about this Jesus doll,

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.529
do you think it's legit?

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:19.131 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I mean, I thought the most
telling part of the story

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.567
was from an unnamed priest

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:25.071
and representative of
the Catholic Church

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:27.073
that will maybe go to
this person's house,

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:30.042
cuz they're afraid to
bring the baby doll

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:34.981 align:start size:97% position:3%
into the local church
because that might upset God,

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.183
and so they want to
leave it where it is.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.619 align:start size:88% position:13%
But he said the Catholic
Church is gonna come,

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:42.355
they're gonna check it
out, and he did admit

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.691
a rational explanation
could be at play here

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:48.227
because not everything is
a spiritual phenomenon.

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:49.762
- That's true.
- You think?

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:52.064
(Erica laughs)
- Whoa, whoa.

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:53.633
Was that sarcasm at the end?

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:56.302
I love that the Catholic
Church can find a miracle

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.637 align:start size:84% position:16%
if they need it, you
know what I mean?

00:08:57.637 --> 00:08:59.171
If you wanted to make a
new saint, it's like oh,

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:00.373
this was kind of a miracle.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.642
But if you actually say
oh, what about this?

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:05.444 align:start size:97% position:3%
The Bible's full of stuff
that you wouldn't believe now.

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:08.514 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you were like hey, Erica
turned water into wine,

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.815
is that a miracle,
maybe she's a saint?

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.284
They'd be like no,
it's total bullshit.

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:14.654 align:start size:97% position:3%
When you read it in the Bible,
in the King James version,

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:15.888
I don't know how many
versions you've read

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.356
but the King James
is the best one,

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.625
then they're like that
makes perfect sense,

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.127
that's what happened.

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:23.362
- I just like, like how
does this become a story?

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start size:88% position:13%
Who's idea was it to try
to make this a story?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.068 align:start size:97% position:3%
- There are two kinds of
stories coming out of Mexico.

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.870
One is there's a caravan coming,

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:35.241 align:start size:97% position:3%
another one is a drug dealer
shot up a lot of people,

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.377
and the third one
is Jesus is crying.

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.247
It happens all the time.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.149
Wasn't there like a
Virgin Mary statue?

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:44.417
- Yeah, a very similar--

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.217
- That they thought was
crying and it turned out

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:46.519
it was sewage coming,

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start size:97% position:3%
it was like backed up sewage
(Erica groans)

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.622
coming out of their eyes, right?

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:51.123 align:start size:88% position:13%
- A very similar one
happened last year, yes.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start size:94% position:6%
So my thought was
probably the doll people,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.629
whoever has this in their house

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:58.464
thought that got some good pop,

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:01.367
they're upset about all the
murders going on in town

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:04.804
and they gussied up this
doll with some eye blood.

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:07.873
- You know, I call myself
an atheist or an apatheist,

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:09.241
I don't care if there's a God,

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.743
but whenever I hear
about a baby doll,

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:14.013 align:start size:97% position:3%
a Jesus baby doll crying
blood, I think you know what?

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:16.482 align:start size:88% position:13%
Who knows for sure,
maybe there is a heaven

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:18.551
and I don't want to go there.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:21.554
(upbeat rock music)

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.626
(Comedy Central jingle)
