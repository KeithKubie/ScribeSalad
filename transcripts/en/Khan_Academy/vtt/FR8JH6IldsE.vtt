00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:02.223
- [Voiceover] So we have some tables here

00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:06.773
that give us what the
functions f and g are

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.735
when you give it certain inputs.

00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:11.000
So, when you input negative four,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.797
f of negative four is 29.

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:15.876
That's going to be the
output of that function.

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:18.476
So we have that for both f and g,

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:21.402
and what I want to do is
evaluate two composite functions.

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:25.499
I want to evaluate f of g of zero,

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.540
and I want to evaluate g of f of zero.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.398
So like always, pause the video

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.731
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:38.369
Let's first think about f of g of zero.

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.556
F of g of zero.

00:00:41.556 --> 00:00:42.670
What is this all about?

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.712
Actually let me use multiple colors here.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:49.370
F of g of zero.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.797
Well, this means that we're going to

00:00:51.797 --> 00:00:54.347
evaluate g at zero,

00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:57.277
so we're gonna input zero into g.

00:00:58.497 --> 00:00:59.467
Do it in that.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:03.304
So we're gonna input
zero into our function g,

00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:05.300
and we're going to output,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.681
whatever we output is
going to be g of zero.

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:09.202
I'll write it right over here,

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.139
and then we're going to input
that into our function f.

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.378
We're going to input
that into our function f,

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:17.177
and whatever I output then is going to be

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.942
f of g of zero.

00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:21.829
F of g of zero.

00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.325
F of g of zero.

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:27.509
I wrote these small here so we have space

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.914
for the actual values.

00:01:28.914 --> 00:01:30.446
So first let's just evaluate,

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:32.595
and if you are now inspired,

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:35.194
pause the video again and
see if you can solve it.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.309
Although, if you solved it the first time,

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:37.527
you don't have to do that now.

00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:39.653
What's g of zero?

00:01:39.653 --> 00:01:43.203
Well, when we input x equals zero,

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.931
we get g of zero is equal to five.

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:49.334
So g of zero is five.

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:51.331
So that is five.

00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:53.246
So we're now going to input five

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.650
into our function f.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.926
We're essentially going
to evaluate f of five.

00:01:56.926 --> 00:01:59.747
So when you input five into our function.

00:02:00.277 --> 00:02:02.725
I'm gonna do it in this brown color.

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:05.417
When you input x equals five into f,

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:09.341
you get the function f
of five is equal to 11.

00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:11.838
So this is going to be 11.

00:02:11.838 --> 00:02:15.541
So, f of g of zero is equal to 11.

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:19.100
Now, let's do g of f of zero.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.269
So now let's evaluate.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.138
I'll do this is different colors.

00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:26.238
G, maybe I'll use those
same two colors actually.

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:30.127
So now we're going to
evaluate g of f of zero.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.789
G of f of zero, and the key realization is

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:36.437
you wanna go within the parenthesis.

00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:39.317
Evaluate that first so
then you can evaluate

00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:42.370
the function that's
kind of on the outside.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.167
So here we're going to
take zero as an input

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.071
into the function f,

00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:49.779
and then whatever that is, that f of zero,

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.995
we're going to input into our function g.

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:54.826
We're going to input into our function g,

00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:56.115
and what we're going to be,

00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:59.934
and then the output of that
is going to be g of f of zero.

00:03:00.554 --> 00:03:03.157
So, let's see, what is f of zero?

00:03:03.157 --> 00:03:06.965
You see over here when our input is zero,

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:10.761
this table tells us that
f of zero is equal to one.

00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:13.526
So f of zero is equal to one.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.462
F of zero is equal to one.

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:17.576
So now we use one as an input into g.

00:03:17.576 --> 00:03:20.141
We're now evaluating g of one,

00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:21.696
or I can just write this.

00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:26.496
This is the same thing as g of one.

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:29.249
G of one.

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:30.294
Once again, why was that?

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:33.035
'Cause f of zero is equal to,

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:35.031
f of zero is equal to one.

00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:36.315
And let me, I wrote those parenthesis

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:37.683
too far away from the g.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:40.122
This is the same thing as

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:43.057
g of one.

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:45.260
Because once again f of zero is one.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.643
Now what is g of one?

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:51.077
Well, when I input one
into our function g,

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:55.615
I get g of one is equal to eight.

00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:57.008
So this is going to be equal,

00:03:57.008 --> 00:03:58.993
this is equal to eight,

00:03:58.993 --> 00:03:59.789
and we're done.

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:01.078
And notice these are different values,

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:02.729
because these are different
composite functions.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:07.456
F of g of zero is 11, and
g of f of zero is eight.
