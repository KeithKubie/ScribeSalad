00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're gonna talk

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.880
about the impact of media on politics,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.540
and in particular, we're gonna think about

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.310
how media has changed over time

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.490
and how that might change
political discourse over time

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.270
or how it might change
people's views over time.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.180
So if we rewind many hundreds of years,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.070
you have the printing
press that was invented

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.860
in the mid 15th century and
then the early 17th century

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.250
you have your first printed newspapers.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.020
And so, much of early American history,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.450
the main form of media was the newspaper.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.550
And this is actually a picture
of the New York Tribune

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.620
from 1864, and you see it doesn't look

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.540
all that different from some
of the newspapers today.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.380
And so you can imagine in
the 18th and 19th century,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.950
newspapers were the most powerful way

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.400
of getting views out.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.460
In fact, many of these
historical documents

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.830
that we study in American history

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.440
like the Federalists
Papers, these were published

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.820
in newspapers in order
to affect public opinion.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.170
But then as we start to
enter into the 20th century,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.030
technology starts to give us more forms

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.270
of mass communication and mass media

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.580
that might affect political discourse.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.220
So this is a picture of folks listening

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.610
to a radio broadcast in
the early 20th century.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.230
And there would have been entertainment

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.110
over these broadcasts,
but there would also

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.180
have been news.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.190
And so you can imagine that this affected

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.900
people's views of politics.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.690
Politicians, leaders started
to give speeches over radio.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.350
And as you get into the mid 20th century,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.450
TV becomes more and more pronounced

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.690
of an influence on politics.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.120
This is a picture of Walter Cronkite,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.920
famous for being one of the
most respected journalists

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.410
in all of television and
the first to broadcast

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.480
a nightly news in the mid 20th century.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.420
Now, as you get to the late 20th century,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.590
not only did you have the major
networks broadcasting news,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.980
but you start having the
advent of cable news networks,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.810
so you start having a
larger diversity of people

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.860
who are giving news.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.150
And then as you get into the
internet age, it explodes.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.870
You have blogs and news websites

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.720
that start more and more
to cater to specific views.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.530
And then with the advent of social media,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.150
you have a way for leaders
or people who influence

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.810
other people's thought
to directly influence

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.470
or directly communicate
with those that follow them,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.850
whether we're talking about Twitter,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.000
or Facebook, or Instagram.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.800
And so an interesting question
is how has this affected

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.140
political discourse.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.100
How has this affected politics?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.300
So, many people would view
this as a positive thing,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.590
that back in the day it
took a lot of capital,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.310
it took a lot of resources to
print and publish a newspaper,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.650
it took a lot of resources
to nationally broadcast news,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.440
and so it was a limited number of groups

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.810
that could get the views out,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.490
while as you have the
internet and social media,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.050
anyone can communicate with anyone else.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.580
And so this would have increased
the number of media choices

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.000
and increased the number
of points of views

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that are out there.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.620
Now, others would argue that,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.470
well, that might be
good, but maybe there are

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.930
negative consequences to it as well.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.820
In the days of Walter Cronkite,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.600
everyone was kind of operating
with the same information.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.220
But with social media,
more and more people fear

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.210
that we're living in
our own echo chambers,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.960
that we tend to follow people

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.770
who already believe what we believe,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.880
that we tend to go to the media sites

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.850
that reinforce our existing beliefs,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.600
and so it is polarizing.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.730
And it could also be polarizing
because we have to think

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.130
about the economics of media.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.680
Many of these media outlets
are for-profit businesses,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.320
and so they have to think how do we get

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.540
the maximum viewership, and that might be

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.750
catering to what people already believe in

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.640
or increasing the polarization,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.730
maybe demonizing the other side.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.120
Now, many people would also argue

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.100
along with that increased polarization

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.150
and with this increased diversity

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.770
that more and more
people are just doubtful

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.310
of any news source, of any media source,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.220
and so they just become more skeptical

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.410
and cynical of not just media,
but the government as well.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.480
So it's an interesting phenomenon

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.230
that we are living in as we speak.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.130
As much change as the
newspaper or the radio

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.180
or television broadcasts happened,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.730
we are now in this time
of accelerating change

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.370
where every few years it feels like

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.950
there's a new medium coming out

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.550
and it's interesting to
see how that will continue

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.863
to evolve and affect
our political discourse.
