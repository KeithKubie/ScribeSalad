00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is that it's permutations.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
That's what the definition of permutations is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We take some collection, and then we pick out some number of them.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The order matters, and we have all possibilities.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So there is a built-in permutations function.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It happens to be in a library called "itertools."
