Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:11.201
So in the last episode of Smarter Every Day we revealed that fish eat by sucking in the water by opening up their mouth

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:18.016
and then once they do that they allow the water to exit back behind the operculum by opening up their gill flaps, it's really cool.

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:21.359
But the problem was we only captured the footage above water.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.886
So Dr Seymour and Richard Fitzpatrick at James Cook University have gone back and they made a rig so they could do it underwater.

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:30.235
So let's go check it out.

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:34.497
- So we're gonna do the barramundi high speed feeding sequence again for you but this time from under water.

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:37.852
What we've done is we've modified this camera housing,

00:00:37.852 --> 00:00:39.982
we've put the Phantom camera inside there.

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:44.720
Jamie's gonna use his stick with a prawn but no hooks, so we're not damaging the fish at all,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.964
and we shall see how they look at high speed from under water.

00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:51.156
Yep, little bit closer to you.

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:52.971
Ooh! Got it!

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:55.199
- Looked good.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.176
- So let's have a look.

00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:57.427
(Destin) Alright here we go.

00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:01.938
Watch the water flow through the mouth and out the gills.

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.894
But why doesn't the water flow in through the gills?

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:17.965
If you watch closely it's because the flap overlaps and it slams shut like a check valve

00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:20.534
only allowing flow in one direction.

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:57.874
(Jamie) That is awesome!

00:01:57.892 --> 00:01:59.691
- OK we hope you like that one Destin.

00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:02.921
That demonstrates everything, but under water.

00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:04.233
Bye from Australia. Ciao!

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:04.871
- See ya buddy!

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:08.715
OK the next thing we're gonna look at is the fact that fish can throw their lips forward.

00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:10.943
Now this helps them close the gap with their prey.

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:13.831
There's two more clips that Richard sent to us that we're gonna look at.

00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:17.372
The first one is the stone fish, which you know is the most venomous fish in the world.

00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:20.914
It closes its gap really really fast with its lips, it's amazing.

00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:23.519
The second one is called the slingjaw wrasse.

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.646
Now this one is just unreal.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:28.342
It's like a mechanical hinge structure, I'll let you see it.

00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:31.227
But everything is in slow motion. Check it out.

00:02:31.512 --> 00:02:38.094
So the stonefish just chills out looking like, well, a stone, until the prey gets within its strike radius.

00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:41.049
Then this happens.

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.687
This is a slingjaw wrasse.

00:02:55.687 --> 00:02:58.704
Prepare your brain for what you're about to see.

00:03:10.932 --> 00:03:12.189
Yeah.

00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:18.298
That's crazy.

00:03:18.612 --> 00:03:25.607
Let's watch it again from the side, and you can see if you look close the shadow of that little fish as it zips up through the sling jaw.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.227
OK I hope you enjoyed learning how fish eat along with me.

00:03:43.227 --> 00:03:46.800
Thank you to Richard Fitzpatrick and Jamie Seymour for giving us this footage.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.722
If you want to see more awesome stuff that they do on the Great Barrier Reef, and their Phantom footage under water, it's amazing,

00:03:51.722 --> 00:03:54.825
go check out biopixel. They have stock footage that they make,

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:56.993
just go look at it, it's amazing stuff.

00:03:56.993 --> 00:04:02.355
Also if you want to check out more stuff like this fishing trip you can follow me on @SmarterEveryDay at Instagram.

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:04.892
I've been taking pictures of water striders and stuff like that.

00:04:04.892 --> 00:04:08.937
Anyway I'm Destin, I hope we earned your subscription today. You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:11.636
Have a good one, and go check out biopixel.

00:04:11.636 --> 00:04:13.108
Take it easy.
