00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.210
Which of the features are
shared by f of x and g of x?

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.030
Select all that apply.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.760
So they give us f of
x as being defined

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.620
as x to the third minus x.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.800
And they define g of x,
essentially, with this graph.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.220
So what are our options?

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.020
So the first one is
that they are both odd.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.080
So just by looking
at g of x, you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.930
can tell that it is not odd.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.230
The biggest giveaway
is that an odd function

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.600
would go through the origin.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.507
G of zero would have
to be equal to zero.

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.340
If you want to go
straight to the definition

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.390
of an odd function,
g of x would have

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.330
to be equal to the negative
of g of negative x.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.560
So for example, g of
3 looks like it is 4.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.720
g of 3 is equal to 4.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.410
In order for it to be
odd, g of negative 3

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.080
would have to be
equal to negative 4.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.320
But we see that g of negative
3 is not equal to negative 4.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.037
So this one is
definitely not odd.

00:01:01.037 --> 00:01:02.370
So this statement can't be true.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.860
They both can't be odd.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.250
So that's not right.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.040
They share an x-intercept.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.310
So g of x only has
one x-intercept.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.220
It intersects the
x-axis right over here

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.670
at x equals negative 3.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.650
Now let's think about the
x-intercepts of f of x.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.270
And to do that, we just need
to factor this expression,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.740
f of x is equal to x to
the third minus x, which

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.440
is the same thing
if we factor an x

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.700
out of x times x
squared minus 1.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.835
X squared minus 1 is the
difference of squares.

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:34.210
So we could rewrite that as--
so we'll write our x first,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.080
this x.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.710
And then x squared minus 1
is x plus 1 times x minus 1.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.800
So when does f of x equal 0?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.830
Well, f of x is equal to
0 when x is equal to 0.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.680
When x is equal to 0, that would
make this entire expression 0.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.910
When x is equal to
negative 1, that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.490
would make this term, and
thus the entire expression, 0.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.410
And when x is equal
to positive 1,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.260
that would make
this last part zero,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.390
which would make this
entire product 0.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.430
So here are the zeroes
of f of x, and none

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.949
of these coincide with
the zeroes of g of x.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.820
So they don't share
an x-intercept.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.570
They have the same end behavior.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.810
Now this is interesting.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.820
This is saying what's
happening as x gets really,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.720
really, really, really large,
or as x gets really, really,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.241
really, really, really small.

00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:29.240
So we could just think
about it right over here.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.520
As x gets really, really,
really, really, really large,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.570
this x to the third is
going to grow much faster

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.350
than this x term
right over here.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.950
So as x grows really, really,
really, really large, f of x

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.866
is going to grow really,
really, really large.

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:46.139
So the graph-- and I
don't know exactly,

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.180
to see if I could plot a
couple of other points--

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.890
but the bottom line is f of x
is going to approach infinity

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.150
as x approaches infinity,
or f of x approaches

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.660
infinity as x
approaches infinity,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.996
or as x gets larger
and larger and larger.

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:04.620
And then what happens
as x gets smaller

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.620
and smaller and smaller?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.150
If we have really
small values of x--

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.960
so really negative values of
x, I should say-- once again,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.570
this, right over here,
is going to dominate.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.720
So f of x is going to
become really negative.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.520
So f of x is going to
approach negative infinity,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.800
as x approaches
negative infinity.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.690
And that is the same
behavior of g of x.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.500
As x approaches a really
large value, g of x

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.340
approaches a really large value,
maybe not as fast as f of x,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.620
but it still approaches it.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.410
And likewise, as x decreases,
so does g of x decrease.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.100
It doesn't decrease as
fast as f of x might,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.860
but it's still
going to decrease.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.130
So they do seem to have the same
end behavior, at least based

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.670
on the way that we
thought about it just now.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.860
Now the last option is they
have a relative maximum

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.420
at the same x value.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.780
So we have to think about
what the maximum points are.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.200
Well, actually, we already
know that this is not true,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.490
because g of x has no
relative maximum points.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.067
In order to have
a maximum point,

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:07.775
you would have to do
something like this.

00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:10.090
This, right over here,
would be a relative maximum,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.966
or, you could say, a
local maximum point.

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.840
It's larger than all of
the points around it,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.510
but eventually the
function does surpass it.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.050
But this, right over
here, has no local maxima,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.760
or relative maxima,
or little bumps in it.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.940
g of x doesn't have any.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.850
So they can't have relative
maximum at the same value.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.010
So this, also, is not an option.
