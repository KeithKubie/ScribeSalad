00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:01.835
- Maybe she saw your
pubes once and she's like,

00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:03.036
"all I see are Jimmy's pubes."
- Yeah.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.570
That sounds like what
a principal would say.

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:07.040
(upbeat music)

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.908
- Hey guys,welcome to
The Other Show again.

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:09.742
My name is Chris.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:11.244
- I'm Sarah.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.379
- And we're here with
Drew and HelÃ©ne, and Jimmy

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.715
and Navaris who play a
couple of the Insta Gays

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:16.716
in this episode.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.518
(loud cheering)

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.353
- We're very excited
for this episode to air

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:22.722
and to shoot this episode
'cause it really made us laugh,

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.323
and you guys are
so funny in this.

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:25.792
- Thank you.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.527
- Those characters that
are bitchy gay guys is such

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.230
a stereotype, so to play
someone who's, they have no...

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:32.532
they're just really kind.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.733
- Yeah
- Oh no, totally, yeah.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.567
- Drew's the villain.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.968
- It was so great

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:36.669
that my character's
- Drew's the absolute villain.

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:38.171
- the villain.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.073
- It's so, it was so refreshing
to be like, 'Yeah their not

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.140
bad, I am bad.'

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:41.974
- Yeah
- Yeah

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:42.809
(laughter)

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.043
- I'm using them.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:46.245
- All you do it get
naked and post pictures

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:47.580
and have sex with each other.

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:49.082
- We don't have sex
with each other.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.017
- What? Why don't you?

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.853
- I had to go through and
unfollow a bunch of these guys

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.722
because I would just
like, be out in the world,

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.058
and I would be technically
looking at porn.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:00.226
(laughter)
- Oh yeah!

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.427
- Because I'd be like
hiding my phone like

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.895
over in the corner.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:05.431
And I was like, I can't just
be looking at a man's full butt

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:07.166
at the doctor's
office waiting room.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:10.136
- But it happens suddenly
enough where you follow one,

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.970
then two, and then
- Yes!

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.171
in a year you're like

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:13.406
this is porn I'm
scrolling through.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.408
- He said when we would
like researching-ish

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:18.010
the Insta-Gay culture, any
profile I went to was like,

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:18.845
followed by Drew Darker.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.548
(loud laughter)

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.050
- Are you Brooke?

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:26.719
- Wow!

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:29.155
- I was wondering
about the model.

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:31.057
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, in Madison Square Park.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.258
- Yes, I'll talk about it,

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.494
you see beautiful people
like that in person,

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.129
and it's like truly shocking.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.231
- It was shocking
when I watched it.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.765
- Like a drawing, he
looks like a drawing

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:41.501
- He looks like a drawing,
it's unbelievable to me,

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:42.735
I feel like I wanted to ask him

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:44.003
but I didn't quite
know how to phrase it,

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:45.505
like what is it like
to look like you?

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.140
- I was mad at you.
- Like how has that been?

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.442
- But he would have killed her
though, like clearly like...

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.943
Who shows up like,
- Yeah, like 100%

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.311
in the middle of the day?
- That was the original joke!

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:53.946
He was originally going to say,

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.348
"Now I have to find
someone else to kill."

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.016
(laughter)
- How come you guys cut it?

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.351
- I dunno, we liked
him being like,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.519
- I liked a very
handsome man saying,

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:00.219
'I'm a loser.'
- left in an existential

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:01.420
crisis.

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:02.355
- That was actually
one of my favorite

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.556
things to shoot as well because

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:04.757
we shot that in
Madison Square Park,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.492
like in the early,
early morning,

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:09.562
and shooting in New York
City in like, iconic areas

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.597
like that in the
morning, they're empty

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.100
and you sort of watch
the city come alive

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:17.336
while you're standing there,
and it's really amazing.

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.038
Let's see that body.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:24.177
Wait, where's the body.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.411
- This is sort of an
embarrassing thing,

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:27.446
but maybe it will
spark something,

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:28.748
but you go on a
date with that guy,

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.783
Paul, from Rolling
Stone, but we were like,

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:35.822
oh what's a good douchey Twitter
handle for a guy like this,

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:38.257
and we used my real
one from high school

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.425
because it was so douchey.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.561
My AIM screen-name,
in high school

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.429
was King of Sarcasm Zero-One

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:44.263
(laughter)
- That's me!

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:45.231
- No, it's not!

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:46.065
I must have been thinking like,

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:47.200
I am pretty sarcastic.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.234
(laughter)

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:49.769
In fact, I'm the king of it.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.438
- I had just ended a
production of West Side Story,

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:57.043
and I was Baby John, so my
screen was Baby John Five.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.412
(laughing)
Isn't that just like...

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.513
- That's okay.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.615
- It's sad, you
do one production

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:04.717
- You were proud of that
production and that performance!

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.053
- It's so embarrassing,
like Baby John--

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.155
- It's very literal to
be like, I was Baby John,

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.023
my screen-name
should be Baby John.

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:12.592
- Well yeah, it is kind of like

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.160
when you are in high school,
like one thing you've done,

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:15.261
you make your
entire personality.

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.495
- It's a big deal!
- Yeah.

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:17.997
- Oh, as a matter of
fact, I was a big deal

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.699
in West Side Story, and
it wasn't my screen-name,

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.701
but my class ring says,
"A Big Deal," on it.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:22.935
- Oh no!
- Whoa, that's good!

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:24.704
- Wow, West Side
Story ****ed us up.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.272
(laughter)
- I'm sorry!

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:30.510
- Mine was Belleoftheball,
because of a Guster song,

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.379
where that is a
lyric, 103, which is

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:36.182
where in the song, that
lyric first appears,

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:37.383
- Whoa...

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:38.985
- But the Belle was
spelled with an E,

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.954
because that was my
favorite Disney princess.

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:42.989
- That's rough.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:43.789
- Oh my...
- Isn't that just like,

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:44.957
layers of sadness?

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.359
- There's so many layers.
- Huh!

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.860
- Honestly though if I known,
- This is so earnest.

00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:49.095
- Sarah in in high school,
I would have been like,

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.631
you are deep girl,
I wanna be like you.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.499
- Mine, was complicated.

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:54.467
(chuckling)

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.535
because I'm a big X-Men fan.

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:57.870
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:59.538
- So I wanted an X
in it, and my mom

00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:01.774
had a porcelain
figure of a swan,

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:03.442
(laughing)
- Oh, God.

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:04.810
- I looked to like, the
left, and it was there,

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:07.313
so I was like, Swanex,
and it was like,

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:08.581
(chuckling)

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:11.751
S W A N E X, and it
sounds like a cleaner

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:14.720
that you would like, use.
- Wait, S W A N E X?

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.657
- Yeah, S W A N E X,
and it was like, Swanex.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.459
- You did, like, what they
do in bad writing in comedy,

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:23.062
then they're like, my name
is Bob Treestonefloor.

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:24.130
(laughter)

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.298
- Let's do like, a funny one.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.632
- Oh yeah, okay good, yeah.
- Yeah!

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.501
- Okay, and...
- Good.

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:31.637
- Three, two, one.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.472
(shutter clicking)

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:35.241
- Wait, how did you guys pose?

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:36.809
- So we asked you
guys to show us

00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:39.412
pictures that you had
posted on the internet,

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:41.580
where you were being thirsty.

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:43.783
Okay, this is Navaris.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.751
- That is good!
- Oh, wow!

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:46.952
- Is this your hair?

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:48.154
- That is good!

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:49.755
- Yeah, that was
me in like, 2016.

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:50.956
- Wow!

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:52.091
- We were like, send
the picture that's like,

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:53.726
we can kind of like, laugh about

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.894
'cause you're just
too thirsty in it,

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.295
and we got this
and we were like...

00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:57.596
- No, that's fine, he
should post it, that's good.

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.265
(laughter)
- That's just not good...

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:00.533
- I would love to see
that on my scroll.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.635
- I'm really repressed, I think,

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:03.803
(laughing)
but I still want

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.738
to participate, I'm like, okay
- Yeah.

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:07.239
(laughter)
- Yeah!

00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:09.575
We asked Drew for
a thirsty photo,

00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:11.310
and it's him as a speck!

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:12.345
(laughing)
You have to zoom in

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.213
so much to see any body.

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:15.648
- But that's what you said.
- Yeah!

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:17.249
- You were like, if someone's
going to "work for it,"

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:18.484
- Yeah!

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:19.819
- Then they're gonna
get the reward.

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:21.687
- If they really zoom in,
- Work for it.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.390
- you will see a blurry,
kind-of-good chest.

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:25.257
(chuckling)
- Let's show Jimmy's.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.392
- Okay, Jimmy's is good.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:27.693
- This is also good.

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:28.494
- Whoa!

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:30.029
(Acclaimation)

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:31.230
- How did you get that?

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:32.898
- How did you get that?
(laughing)

00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:34.333
I'm freaking out.

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:36.235
- This is like, Justin Thoroux!

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:38.637
And by the way, when you
post a thirsty photo,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.906
your thirst gets quenched!

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:41.741
(chuckling)

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:42.575
People like that shit!

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:43.843
(laughing)

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:44.977
