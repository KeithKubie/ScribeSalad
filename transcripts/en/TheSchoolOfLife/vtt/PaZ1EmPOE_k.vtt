00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.220
Melancholy isn't exactly a word on everybody's lips.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.760
But we should pay more attention to it, even seek it out from time to time.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.140
Melancholy is a species of sadness that arises when we are open to the fact that life is inherently difficult

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.200
and that suffering disappointment are core parts of universal experience.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.880
It's not a disorder that needs to be cured.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.280
Modern society tends to emphasize buoyancy and cheerfulness

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.020
but we have to admit that reality is, for the most part, about grief and loss.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.960
The good life is not one immune to sadness

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.980
but one in which suffering contributes to our development.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.640
Melancholy is an underused word.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640
It doesn't mean grim and miserable.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.320
It means grasping without rage the fact that the world is full of folly and greed

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.580
that it is rare to find inner peace, that it is hard to live comfortably with those we love,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.340
that it's very unusual to have a career that's both financially rewarding and morally uplifting,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.900
that many decent people have a very hard time.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.980
Often sadness simply makes a lot of sense.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.200
We learn so late about stuff.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.540
You've wasted years; everyone has.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.560
You can only avoid regret by switching off your imagination.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.920
The wisdom of the melancholy attitude as opposed to the bitter, angry one,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.920
lies in the understanding that the sorrow isn't just about you,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.700
that you have not been singled out, that you're suffering belongs to humanity in general.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.600
To take that fully to heart is to become more compassionate and less vengeful.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.620
The melancholy facts shouldn't make us desperate,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.460
rather, more forgiving, kinder, and better able to focus on what really matters

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.620
while there is still time.
