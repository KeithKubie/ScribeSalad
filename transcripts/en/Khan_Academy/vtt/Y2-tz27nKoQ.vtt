00:00:00.551 --> 00:00:03.607
PROBLEM: "Express the rational number 19/27

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:06.538
(or 19 27ths) as a terminating decimal

00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:08.666
or a decimal that eventually repeats.

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.371
Include only the first six digits

00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:12.651
of the decimal in your answer."

00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:14.599
Let me give this a shot.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.791
So we want to express 19/27 –

00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:23.654
which is the same thing as 19 ÷ 27 – as a decimal.

00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:26.349
So let's divide 27 into 19.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.485
So 27 going into 19.

00:00:29.485 --> 00:00:31.264
And we know it's going to involve some decimals

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.707
over here, because 27 is larger than 19,

00:00:33.707 --> 00:00:36.291
and it doesn't divide perfectly.

00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:38.131
So let's get into this.

00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:39.305
So 27 doesn't go into 1.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.923
It doesn't go into 19.

00:00:40.923 --> 00:00:43.994
It does go into 190.

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:47.224
And it looks like 27 is roughly 30.

00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:48.794
It's a little less than 30.

00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:50.430
30 times 6 would be 180.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.132
So let's go with it going 6 times.

00:00:53.132 --> 00:00:54.045
Let's see if that works out.

00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:57.402
Well, 6 × 7 is 42.

00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:01.604
6 × 2 is 12, + 4 is 16.

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:06.365
And when we subtract, 190 - 162 is going to get us –

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.942
Actually, we could've had another 27 in there.

00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:10.716
Because when we subtract –

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:12.510
So we get a 10 from the 10's place.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.966
So that becomes 8 10's.

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.751
This became 28.

00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:17.522
So we could have put one more 27 in there.

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:19.143
So let's do that.

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:22.476
So let's put one more 27 in there.

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:24.328
So 7 27's.

00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:26.923
7 × 7 is 49.

00:01:26.923 --> 00:01:31.190
7 × 2 is 14, + 4 is 18.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.459
And now our remainder is 1.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.859
We can bring down another 0.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.912
27 goes into 10 0 times.

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.146
0 × 27 is 0. [Not "10," as Sal states by mistake.]

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:44.102
Subtract – we have a remainder of 10.

00:01:44.102 --> 00:01:46.694
But now, we have to bring down another 0.

00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:51.014
So let's bring down this 0 right over here.

00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:56.494
So now, 27 goes into 100 3 times.

00:01:56.494 --> 00:02:05.944
3 × 27 is 60 + 21, is 81.

00:02:05.944 --> 00:02:09.154
And then we subtract: 100 - 81.

00:02:09.154 --> 00:02:10.436
Well, we could take 100 from

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:13.331
the 100's place, and make it 10 10's.

00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:15.390
And then we could take 1 of those 10's from

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.139
the 10's place and turn it into 10 1's.

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:22.386
And so 9 10's minus 8 10's is equal to 1 10.

00:02:22.386 --> 00:02:24.719
And then 10 -1 is 9.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.616
So it's equal to 19.

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:26.291
You probably –

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.343
You might have been able to do that in your head.

00:02:28.343 --> 00:02:29.254
And then we have –

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:30.732
And I see something interesting here –

00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:33.593
because when we bring down our next 0,

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:34.899
we see 190 again.

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:36.814
We saw 190 up here.

00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:38.329
But let's just keep going.

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.572
So 27 goes into 190 –

00:02:40.572 --> 00:02:42.654
And we already played this game.

00:02:42.654 --> 00:02:44.551
It goes into it 7 times.

00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:48.283
7 × 27 – we already figured out – was 189.

00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:49.146
We subtracted.

00:02:49.146 --> 00:02:50.591
We had a remainder of 1.

00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:54.013
Then we brought down another 0.

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:57.307
We said 27 goes into 10 0 times.

00:02:57.307 --> 00:02:59.068
0 × 27 is 0.

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:00.261
Subtract.

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:01.641
Then you have –

00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:02.945
We still have the 10,

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:07.298
but we've got to bring down another 0.

00:03:07.298 --> 00:03:09.083
So you have 27, which goes into 100 –

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.438
(We've already done this.)

00:03:10.438 --> 00:03:11.599
–3 times.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.750
So you see something happening here.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.671
It's 0.703703.

00:03:16.671 --> 00:03:18.947
And we're just going to keep repeating 703.

00:03:18.947 --> 00:03:27.218
This is going to be equal to 0.703703703703 –

00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:29.718
on and on and on forever.

00:03:29.718 --> 00:03:32.267
So the notation for representing

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:34.419
a repeating decimal like this

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.405
is to write the numbers that repeat –

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:38.547
in this case 7, 0, and 3 –

00:03:38.547 --> 00:03:40.057
and then you put a line over all of

00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:40.999
the repeating decimal numbers

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:41.789
to indicate that they repeat.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.984
So you put a line over the 7, the 0, and the 3,

00:03:44.984 --> 00:03:47.130
which means that the 703 will keep

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.423
repeating on and on and on.

00:03:49.423 --> 00:03:52.871
So let's actually input it into the answer box now.

00:03:52.871 --> 00:04:02.107
So it's 0.703703.

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:03.341
And they tell us to include only

00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.838
the first six digits of the decimal in your answer.

00:04:05.838 --> 00:04:07.636
And they don't tell us to round or approximate –

00:04:07.636 --> 00:04:10.196
because, obviously, if they said to round

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:13.957
to that smallest, sixth decimal place,

00:04:13.957 --> 00:04:15.017
then you would round up

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:16.107
because the next digit is a 7.

00:04:16.107 --> 00:04:17.485
But they don't ask us to round.

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:19.337
They just say, "Include only the first six digits

00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:20.988
of the decimal in your answer."

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:23.135
So that should do the trick.

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:24.604
And it did.
