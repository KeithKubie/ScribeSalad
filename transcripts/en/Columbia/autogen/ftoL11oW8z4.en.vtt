the Alumni Relations process about doing

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090
the Alumni Relations process about doing
 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.620
the Alumni Relations process about doing
more so let's work on that please

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630
 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.200
there than ever the dirt on that staffs

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210
 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.510
recently told that they don't want any

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520
recently told that they don't want any
 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.190
recently told that they don't want any
people from this school to be involved

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200
people from this school to be involved
 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.500

with the CAA flow
 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.509
with the CAA flow
and so I'm a little confused I see

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519
and so I'm a little confused I see
 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.210
and so I'm a little confused I see
removing in both directions at the same

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
removing in both directions at the same
 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.009
removing in both directions at the same
time I think part of the problem is

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019
time I think part of the problem is
 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.660
time I think part of the problem is
murky what the relationships between

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670
murky what the relationships between
 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.899
murky what the relationships between
these different groups so and that and

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909
these different groups so and that and
 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.729
these different groups so and that and
I'm really really sorry to hear that I

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739
I'm really really sorry to hear that I
 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.069
I'm really really sorry to hear that I
mean that's not something that I've

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.360
mean that's not something that I've
heard about through the grapevine or

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370
heard about through the grapevine or
 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.940
heard about through the grapevine or
whatever so let's just be real blunt

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950
whatever so let's just be real blunt
 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.789
whatever so let's just be real blunt
about all this yeah i think as all of

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799
about all this yeah i think as all of
 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.819
about all this yeah i think as all of
you know in this room the university

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829
you know in this room the university
 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.009
you know in this room the university
abdicated its responsibility for

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019
abdicated its responsibility for
 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.990
abdicated its responsibility for
university alumni relations for some

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000
university alumni relations for some
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.759
university alumni relations for some
period of time and that's what i was

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769
period of time and that's what i was
 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.860
period of time and that's what i was
talking about in the beginning and the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
talking about in the beginning and the
 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.170
talking about in the beginning and the
school's if they wanted to have a strong

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180
school's if they wanted to have a strong
 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.270

alumni program had no recourse but to

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280
alumni program had no recourse but to
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.530
alumni program had no recourse but to
build their own siloed programs and some

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540
build their own siloed programs and some
 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.140
build their own siloed programs and some
of them have done a really fine job at

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150
of them have done a really fine job at
 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.930
of them have done a really fine job at
doing that so you know seven years when

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940
doing that so you know seven years when
 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.960
doing that so you know seven years when

naturally are going wait a second how

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489
naturally are going wait a second how
 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.069
naturally are going wait a second how
are you going to add value to what we're

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079
are you going to add value to what we're
 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.020
are you going to add value to what we're
doing and are you trying to take over

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030
doing and are you trying to take over
 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.420
doing and are you trying to take over
what we're doing and there we are you

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
what we're doing and there we are you
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.379
what we're doing and there we are you
thinking we're going to go out of

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389
thinking we're going to go out of
 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.500
thinking we're going to go out of
business over time I think typically the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510
business over time I think typically the
 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.020
business over time I think typically the
university is the beginning and then the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030
university is the beginning and then the
 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.640
university is the beginning and then the
school's build up under it and it's

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650
school's build up under it and it's
 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.379
school's build up under it and it's
easier than to figure out what the

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389
easier than to figure out what the
 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.330
easier than to figure out what the
relationships are we're going about it

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340
relationships are we're going about it
 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.460
relationships are we're going about it
kind of the backwards way where some of

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470
kind of the backwards way where some of
