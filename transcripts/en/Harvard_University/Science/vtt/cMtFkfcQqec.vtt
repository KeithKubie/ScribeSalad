00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.399
the heart has very limited capacity for regeneration
after injury

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:12.209
and this is an increase cause

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.599
of uh human morbidity and mortality world wide

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.909
there is a compelling un-clinical need to
identify the opposite cell type to drive robust

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.740
cardiac muscle regeneration

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.789
because this uh very recent ah discovery actually
uh is

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.460
the latest in a chain of

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.030
scientific discoveries

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.540
and for the first it uh reports of
the identification

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.230
of the cell that could be viewed as perhaps
an optimal cell type

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.970
to promote cardiac muscle

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.150
uh regeneration

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.370
because the cells that have been isolated
have come from

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.910
embryonic stem cells

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.260
and than had been used to form an intact strip
functioning

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
ventricular muscle tissue

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.450
while you may start out with a very small
number of cells

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.160
they have the capability

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.080
to proliferate and then maintain their ability

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.600
to make muscle

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.710
and it's that property that makes a very unique

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.630
we decided to ask the question

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.230
how is the heart built in the first place
if you want to rebuild a broken heart

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.100
then go back and look at nature and find
out how it's done normally

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.360
so we went back to their embryo of mouse and
we essentially color coded the heart and were able

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.590
to pick up very specific populations of hearts cells
which have these unique qualities of being

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.110
able to replicate

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.270
and at the same time being completely committed
to the muscles heath aid

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.610
the cells turn out to have it built in clocks
in them

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.830
meaning when we isolate them they are capable
of of renewing for a while

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.220
but then after a certain period of time

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.229
they will stop reviewing and they would

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.380
made sure into functioning my cartel tissue

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.090
these are stem cells that are actually differentiating 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.450
the test tube and from them working to generate the hearts tissue

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.410
and using these cells and the tissue engineering
technology that was developed by a Kit parker

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.699
and Adam Feinberg over in the school engineering

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.439
we were able to generate two-dimensional mial cardial tissue
out of that

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.090
now to get to full cardiac regeneration we
need to get to the three dimensions but already

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.159
we've taken this huge step forward with respect
to regenerating the heart

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.009
and we've develop a platform that will allow us
to study how normal heart functions
