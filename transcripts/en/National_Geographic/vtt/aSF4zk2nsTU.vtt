Genevieve Von Petzinger:
<i>This incredible art that mostly</i>

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:05.238
<i> dates between 10 and
 40,000 years ago.</i>

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:08.174
<i> What we often think of,
 of course, is the animals.</i>

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.944
<i> But there's this other
 enormous group called the</i>

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:15.315
<i> geometric signs that outnumber
 the animals and the humans</i>

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:19.018
<i> at most sites by a ratio
 of two to one or more.</i>

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.154
( applause )

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:25.358
So, June, 2014, myself
and my husband and project

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:28.494
photographer, Dillon,
we were in Northern Spain.

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:31.163
<i> We were at a site called
 Cullavera Cave and we were so</i>

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:33.365
<i> excited to finally be there.</i>

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:37.003
<i> Cullavera, the entrance is
 30 meters up, it's 100 feet,</i>

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.673
it's a cathedral entrance
in a wooded hillside in the

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.141
foothills of the Pyrenees.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.744
There's like a whole wreath
of dangling green vines

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.212
coming down, it's inviting.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.014
It wants you to come in.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.315
And so I can understand
why people might've decided

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:52.919
to go in there 14,000 years ago.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:57.690
What's a little more
difficult to understand is why

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.725
they decided to go so far in.

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:06.466
Because the very first art
is 780 meters, half a mile,

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.667
<i> into the cave.</i>

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.870
<i> You can probably just see some
 faint pigment markings on the</i>

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.173
<i> wall that is not
 modern graffiti.</i>

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.108
These are not animals, but
they're not writing either,

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.843
<i> these are the geometric signs.</i>

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:21.047
They came half a mile through
the cave to make these.

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:23.682
<i> If we enhance it, you can
 see a little bit more.</i>

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:26.619
<i> This is a very cool color
 enhancement program created</i>

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.954
<i> by American rock-art
 researcher, Jon Harman,</i>

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.823
and suddenly you can see more.

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:31.857
But still no animals.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.960
Nothing as far as the eye can
see and this is very unusual.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.329
Animals are normally
found everywhere.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.130
But don't worry, we've
just got to keep going

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.465
a little farther.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:43.002
<i>So we keep going, three quarters
 of a mile in and there's</i>

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:46.071
<i> another little passageway
 here with two horses.</i>

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.407
<i>So the animals are represented,
 they're just in a completely</i>

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:49.542
<i> different section of the cave.</i>

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.011
And as you can see they're
very simple, but we also have

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.247
all this detail that kind
of lets you know that there's

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.148
something going on.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.249
There's a hint here that
there's some artistic ability

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.152
that's underlying what
they're doing here.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.253
So we've got two
horses, that's it.

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:04.123
You keep going a little
farther and now there's a little

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.958
crevice off to the
right this time.

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.095
<i> And somebody went up there
 to make these little dots.</i>

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:10.596
<i> Let me enhance it for you.</i>

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:11.731
<i> But these little dots.</i>

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.234
Somebody took their finger
and dipped it in paint

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.469
and made those marks.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.439
And as so often happens when
I find myself in these places,

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.374
I'm like, "What were
you doing here?"

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:27.146
Why did you come three quarters
of a mile, or 1.2 kilometers

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.181
in a cave to make dots?

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:32.285
<i> So let me introduce you to
 some of this Paleolithic,</i>

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:35.354
<i> or stone age, art that mostly
 dates between 10 and 40,000</i>

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:36.155
<i> years ago.</i>

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.191
<i> What we often think of,
 of course, is the animals.</i>

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.693
<i> The animals are by far the
 majority of what we call</i>

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.362
<i> figurative or
 representational art.</i>

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.564
<i> And a lot of it is hunting
 animals so we've already</i>

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:48.133
<i> seen a horse, here's a deer we
 have a fabulous purple bison.</i>

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.570
<i> It's the only one of it's
 kind because most of the art,</i>

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.505
<i> when it's painted, is
 either red or black.</i>

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.208
And so this fabulous purple
bison, I just love him,

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.076
he's like this unique
little guy hanging out in

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.278
northern Spain.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.981
So we've got him and then
also we do have a few other

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.649
figurative images of humans.

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:05.885
<i> And this is engraving, this
 is the other way that they</i>

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:06.785
<i> made the art.</i>

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:09.021
But there's this other
enormous group called the

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.658
geometric signs that
outnumber the animals and the

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:15.561
humans at most sites by a
ratio of two to one or more.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.963
<i> They can be simple
 things, like the circle.</i>

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:20.833
<i> They can be more complex
 things like this incredibly</i>

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:24.937
<i> complicated sign that was
located in this panel in Spain,</i>

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.004
<i> which is a one-off.</i>

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:27.874
It's the only one of
it's kind in the world.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.543
They can be dots, they can be
lines, they can be triangles.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.579
You'll see there's a full range,
everything that's abstract

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.948
and that's kind of how they've
been defined over the years.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:38.217
<i> Abstract characters that
 don't represent anything from</i>

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:39.419
<i> the mundane world.</i>

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.788
<i> So, let me tell you
 some of my fun results.</i>

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:47.993
There are only 32 signs
across an entire continent

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:51.130
and a 30,000 year time period.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.433
My friends, these are not
random doodles or decorations.

00:03:55.167 --> 00:04:00.305
So, what I noticed was that
this, each one of them has its

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:01.807
own distinct patterning, too.

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:03.376
These are not all
doing the same things,

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.144
they're doing different
things in different places.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:07.646
So there were patterns
across space and time.

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:09.815
And that's what's so
intriguing and exciting.

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.851
So let me show you a
couple of those patterns.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.051
<i> This is a child's hand.</i>

00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:15.087
<i> This is 27,000 year
 old child's hand.</i>

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:17.723
<i> Now, hands are a fascinating
 one because they were at</i>

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:20.860
their most popular at the
very earliest time period.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.398
So between 25 and 40,000
is when we find hands.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:29.201
After that they start to
fade out of popularity until

00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:31.270
they vanish towards
the end of the ice age,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.639
they just go away,
people stop making them.

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.107
So that's one pattern.

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.210
<i> Another pattern that's very
 interesting is this is called</i>

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.211
<i> a tectiform.</i>

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:42.381
<i> So this is like a roof-shaped
 and these are only made</i>

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.984
in the Dordogne region of
France between 13,000 and

00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:47.553
17,000 years ago.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:50.790
It's where they're all
located except for one site

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:54.994
250 miles to the south across
the Pyrenees Mountains

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.295
in Spain.

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.864
And it is exactly the same. I've
talked to the researcher

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:00.332
at that site,
we've looked at pictures,

00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:02.401
even down to the little dots

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:04.437
that you can see, the
technique that was used,

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.038
it's the exact same thing.

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:07.373
How did it get there?

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:10.409
This is what's so fun about
the signs is that we can

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.912
actually follow people and
ideas at these incredible

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:14.947
time depths

00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:17.749
and get a sense of how
their culture was developing.

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:19.284
How were they learning
about symbolism?

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:20.820
What was going on?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.457
<i> So, we've got these signs
 that were being used very</i>

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:29.128
<i> purposefully by people who
obviously know what they meant.</i>

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.698
The obvious question people
always want to know is,

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:32.699
is it writing?

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.967
And I'm sorry, I'm here today
to shatter that it's not

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.202
writing yet.

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:38.471
Though, this inscription as
it's called, it's called the

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:39.772
inscription of La Pasiega.

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:40.939
<i> This is a one-off.</i>

00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:43.142
<i> And this is the thing, we
don't have the consistency yet.</i>

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:46.511
<i> We don't have enough
 characters to represent spoken</i>

00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:48.480
<i> language, we're not there yet.</i>

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.617
<i> But that doesn't mean that
 there's not very interesting</i>

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:52.952
<i> things going on.</i>

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:54.954
It's really funny 'cause
I just spent all this time

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.957
building my nice little list
of 32 and now my next job

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.958
is probably going to be
to smash it back apart.

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.994
Because there's some
major omissions there.

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:04.196
Where's the landscape features?

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:06.065
Where's the weaponry?
Where's the daily life?

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.934
Did nobody look up
at the sky? You know?

00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:11.504
And so I think that, personally,
and this is what we're

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:14.573
starting to dig into now,
I think a lot of these

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:17.109
geometric signs might
actually be representational,

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:17.943
as well.

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.545
And it could give us
some fascinating insight

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.213
into thematic categories

00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:23.682
and how these people were
understanding their world.

00:06:23.682 --> 00:06:25.751
Quick example, the penniform.

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:27.720
<i> So penniform means
 feather-shaped in Latin</i>

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.622
<i> and it's being treated
 as a geometric sign,</i>

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:32.958
<i> but there are contexts such</i>

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.161
<i> as this where people have
 muttered it kind of looks</i>

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.362
<i> like a tree.</i>

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:38.497
So my response would be,
maybe a tree sometimes is

00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:39.531
just a tree.

00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:40.499
( laughter )

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:42.568
Maybe we don't have to
over-complicate this.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:45.204
And so this is the kind of
thing we're looking at as well

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.673
as questions about clusters
of dots potentially being

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:49.608
constellations or other
things which would make

00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:52.044
really good sense and we see
in other rock art traditions.

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:54.413
<i> What I've done so far
 is just the baseline.</i>

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:56.549
<i> This was the start, those
 were some really simple</i>

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:57.450
questions.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.518
There is so much
left to be done.

00:06:59.518 --> 00:07:02.354
In Europe, one big category
that we're still missing here

00:07:02.354 --> 00:07:05.091
is that my database does
not have any of the portable

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.425
<i> art in it yet.</i>

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:09.295
<i> And yet, the 16,000 year
 old necklace, for instance,</i>

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:13.565
from a burial in France
has 45 different geometric

00:07:13.565 --> 00:07:15.468
configurations on it.

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:18.403
Think about how that can
help me understand what I'm

00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:20.539
seeing on a big panel on a wall.

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.474
They seem to be starting
to group them up.

00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:24.910
The line, the cross, the
line, I've seen that on a cave

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.879
wall about 50 miles from there.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.682
So, this is part of the
story and there are dusty

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:33.585
artifacts loitering all over
Europe in museums waiting

00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:34.953
to be documented.

00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:37.056
So this is very much the start.

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:39.725
And imagine if we can start
expanding the work that

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:43.228
I'd been doing in western
Europe to a global level.

00:07:43.228 --> 00:07:46.232
Now those would be
some very big patterns.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:47.166
Thank you.

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:49.402
