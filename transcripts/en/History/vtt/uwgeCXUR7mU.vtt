00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.860
In the Blue Ridge
Mountains, Eustace

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.041
is taking stock of his assets
in a bid to raise a lot of cash

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.075
fast.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.109
Hey, man.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.844
- Doing all right, Scott?
- I'm good.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:12.645
How about yourself?

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:13.980
Pretty good.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.815
Scott Beam is an antique
dealer specializing

00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:18.350
in vintage farm equipment.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.121
The two seater buggy
dates back to 1890

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.857
and was once used for day
to day horse drawn travel.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:27.092
Let's get it right out here
where you can see it better.

00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:32.231
Course, the more I see it, it
might change my mind on this.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.633
I like it.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.102
How much can you give
for something like this

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.003
and make a little profit?

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.676
Lookin' maybe 18.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.613
I don't know if I can
let it go for 18, Scott.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.948
How about $2,200?

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.950
Any way you can do that?

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.851
I need some money.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:56.890
I don't know.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.827
Might be get that seat fixed
and a little cleaned up.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.162
What if just split
the difference?

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:06.866
I think $2000 will cover it.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.569
I believe you
picked the right day.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.136
All right. $2,000.
- Good deal.

00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:13.105
Yeah, I got the
tongue right in here.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.374
The tongue is a
wood and metal frame

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.643
that connects the
steering axle of the car

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.178
to the horse's harness.

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.480
Grab the end of it.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.649
Put this together here.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.954
Now let's see if we can
move it up in the road

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.322
where you can load
it more easily.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.032
Too tight.

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:40.700
Oh man.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.834
Oh [bleep].

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:44.637
We broke the tongue.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.239
That was kind of
embarrassing, honestly,

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:47.506
to have a tongue
break right there

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:49.442
while I'm making the sale.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.711
Doesn't look too good on me.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.245
I hope that he still wants it.

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:55.248
I'll try to-- I'll
make it right, somehow.

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:59.352
We'll get another
tongue so we can

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.554
have a solid tongue for you.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.455
A man doesn't need anything
like that, that's for sure.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.524
- Nope.
- Sorry about that.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.526
It'd be a bad day.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:07.927
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.561
I'll try to get it done
by the end of the day.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:10.797
Can you come back this evening?

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.397
I can come back by here.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.500
From my way back down the road.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.802
- OK.
- All right.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.002
Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:18.604
Well, I'm sorry about that.
- That's all right.

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:20.306
But I'll take care of it.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.208
I've got $2000 on the
line here on this sale,

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:26.345
and I've got to get this tongue
in a satisfactory condition.

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:27.947
And that means I've
got to get to work

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:31.651
here and fix this and make it
so that he's happy with it.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.019
Because if he's
not happy with it,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.888
I'm not going to go
away with $2,000 today,

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:38.124
and I need that for the land.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.426
The broken shaft is
an essential component

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:43.463
that connects the axle
to the horse's harness.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.766
To replace it, Eustace first
separates the broken pieces

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.434
from the tongue's
metal framework.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:53.039
Well, I'm getting it
loose one bolt at a time.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.306
I'm running into a
bit of a problem.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:55.408
There's a few of
these bolts that

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.709
just don't want to come off.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.146
So I need to take a cutting
torch to take them off.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:07.419
This will get it
so hot, I can blast

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.889
the metal right out of there.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.292
The red wrench always works.

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:17.196
To make the repair,
he's scavenging

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:22.668
another wooden shaft of similar
dimensions from his collection.

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:25.738
It looks like it
will fit in there.

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:28.874
I guarantee you that
I'm going to fix it.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:33.179
Yeah, pays to have a
few scrap pieces around.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.481
That's part of the
deal that we agreed on,

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:37.683
and I'm going to
make sure he has one.

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.252
Sweet.

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:41.987
I'm pretty happy with my fix.

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:44.890
I just really hope that
he's happy with it.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:49.028
I need to walk away with
$2,000 out of this deal.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:50.930
Hey man, did you
get this fixed up?

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.165
I got it all fixed up.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:55.300
I pulled the tongue
out of another one,

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:58.604
and got one that fit
just right back in there.

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:01.006
I spent a lot of time putting
all this together and getting

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:02.308
a good tongue in there.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.409
He's going to look over
my work and he's going

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.712
to make sure it's satisfactory.

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:08.481
I need some money, I
need to buy that lamp.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.332
Might not be the original
tongue, but it's sturdy.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.000
Do the job.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.303
Tongue looks good, Eustace.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:31.270
Well, I'm glad you like it.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.939
I wanted you to
have something good.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.006
Works for me.
Good deal.

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:36.141
- Good deal.
- Let's get it loaded up.

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:37.643
All right.

00:04:37.743 --> 00:04:42.748
This puts me $2,000 closer to
coming up with a down payment.

00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:43.483
[inaudible].

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:44.316
Take care, bud.

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:45.718
Thank you.

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:48.955
It's really important to me to
keep this land wild and keep it

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:52.191
natural and buy as much
buffer around my farm

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:53.860
as I possibly can.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.961
But right now, it's just a
hope and a dream and a prayer.
