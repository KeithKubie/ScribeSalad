BENEDICT ARNOLD WAS A GENERAL
IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:14.515 line:0%
 
HE'S A HERO OF SARATOGA,
BUT THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:20.721 line:0%
 
PROMOTED FIVE OTHER GENERALS
AND NOT BENEDICT ARNOLD.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.357 line:0%
 
BENEDICT ARNOLD
WAS VERY BUMMED OUT BY THAT,

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.559 line:0%
 
SO HE GOES TO PHILADELPHIA.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.661 line:0%
 
THERE'S A YOUNG WOMAN,
PEGGY SHIPPEN,

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.297 line:0%
 
WHO IS THE IT GIRL
OF PHILADELPHIA.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:33.467
PEGGY WAS LIKE,
I'M HILARIOUS, I'M BRITISH,

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:37.971
AND I'M THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
PERSON THAT ANYONE'S EVER SEEN.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.973
SHE HAS A SUITOR
NAMED JOHN ANDRE,

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:44.578
BUT BENEDICT SEES HER AND JUST
FALLS CRAZY IN LOVE WITH HER

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.780
AND TELLS HER,
IT'S BETTER WITH YOU--

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.848
THIS IS NOT AN EXACT QUOTE.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.950
IT'S BETTER--
YOU ARE SO GREAT.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.785
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE SO GREAT.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.789
SO SHE MARRIES BENEDICT ARNOLD,
WHO I BELIEVE SHE ALSO LOVED.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.658
OH, GOD.
- WHAT?

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:00.194
- I JUST REALIZED
THAT I WAS BEING FILMED.

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:01.528
[both laugh]
- MY GOD.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.063
- SO, ANYWAY, PEGGY SAYS,

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:07.434
SWEETHEART, YOU DESERVE TO BE
BACKED BY THE GOVERNMENT

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.936
THAT YOU BELONG TO.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.773
YOU KNOW, THE BRITISH...

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:15.275
WOULD APPRECIATE YOU.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.710
THEY WOULD LOVE YOU.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.513
ALSO, MY FAMILY'S BRITISH.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:22.850
BENEDICT'S LIKE, NO, NO, NO.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.718
NO, I'M NOT GONNA--I'M NOT GONNA
DEFECT TO THE BRITISH SIDE.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:25.886
THAT'S INSANE.

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:29.623
GEORGE WASHINGTON'S MY DADDY,
KIND OF.

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:33.460
PEGGY SAYS, LOOK, I HAVE
A FRIEND IN THE BRITISH ARMY,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.795
JOHN ANDRE.

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:38.465
BENEDICT'S LIKE, IS THAT GUY
YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND?

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.868
PEGGY'S LIKE, WELL, I MEAN,

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:43.570
BENEDICT, IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO BE WITH ME,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.872
BE MORE CONFIDENT.

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:47.274
AND BENEDICT'S LIKE, YEAH.

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:50.577
YEAH, I AM GOING TO BETRAY
THE UNITED STATES

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:54.915
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU,
AND I'M GOING TO PROVE TO YOU

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:58.986
THAT I AM NOT JEALOUS,
AND MAKES LOVE TO HIS WIFE.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.655
AND SHE'S LIKE, I LOVE IT.
I LOVE BEING A SPY.

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:04.057
THIS IS SO GREAT
BECAUSE I LOVE DRAMA.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.058
