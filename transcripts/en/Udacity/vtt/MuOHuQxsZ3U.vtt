00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When we know the constant speed is the same as being at rest from the point of view of forces,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which means the air resistance force must equal to weight then they balance.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When I carry out this Algebra, I find the terminal velocity or the maximum speed

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that this feather will reach is 0.5 m/sÂ².
