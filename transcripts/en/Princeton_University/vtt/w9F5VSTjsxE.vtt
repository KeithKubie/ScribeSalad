00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.580
ANGELA CREAGER: When both
ordinary people and scholars

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.960
have thought about the legacy
of the Manhattan Project,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.370
we thought about the way in
which physics and engineering

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.090
were put to military use.


00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.930
We thought about a destructive
legacy, the arms race, the Cold

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.020
War.


00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.110
Part of what I discovered
was that atomic energy

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.780
had just as much of a legacy
in some of the fields that we

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.450
think of as peaceable as
it did in military uses.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.650
And specifically here, a lot of
the advances in postwar biology

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.590
and medicine that have been
really taken for granted

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.690
owe a lot to the
materials and the policies

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.420
that were part of
the Cold War US.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.160
When the Manhattan
Project resulted

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.240
in the invention of
nuclear reactors,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.500
many scientists working
for the Manhattan Project

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.870
understood that this would be
a tremendous source, especially

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.880
for the production of
radioactive isotopes.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.760
NARRATOR: What
are radioisotopes?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.010
They are merely unstable
forms of elements giving off

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.240
unseen particles, or
rays, from the nuclei

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.950
during the process of
changing to stable form.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.410
ANGELA CREAGER:
Initially, the hope

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.260
was that radioisotopes could
be used to cure cancer.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.430
So there was a great
hope that perhaps cancer

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.110
could be treated by finding
a magic bullet for every kind

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.410
of cancer, a different
kind of radioisotope that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.300
might localize to
a tissue and kill

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.930
a tumor from within the body.


00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.570
And there are some cancers that
are susceptible to radioisotope

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.420
treatment, although, in the
end, it was more a replacement

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.160
for radium as an
external radiation

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.840
source than a completely
revolutionary, new kind

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.870
of treatment.


00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.250
So those uses were
already known.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.280
In addition, the discovery
of stable isotopes

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.880
had already led to trace
reuses of isotopes.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.190
Trace reuses are
when you replace

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.620
one atom of a compound with a
particular radiolabeled atom

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.200
so that you can
follow that label

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.620
through the ordinary chemical
or biological processes

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.540
that that compound goes through.


00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.860
And so radiotracing
was very widely

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.230
applicable to
study biochemistry,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.680
physiology, endocrinology,
eventually ecology.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.090
Basically anything where a
chemical compound is in motion,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.150
radiotracing is a way to
look at change over time

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.890
and look at chemical
transformations.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.210
There was still this great
hope that radioisotopes

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.730
were going to do great
things for humankind.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.870
There was a story about
the medical dividends

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.370
of atomic energy that features
a very striking color image.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.040
It shows a man,
who's in his pajamas,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.220
having stood up from
a wheelchair, who

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.920
is encircled in this
halo of a mushroom cloud.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.330
And the suggestion
is that he has

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.140
been healed of whatever ailment
had him in that wheelchair

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.880
by the power of the atom.


00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.690
I think it captures better
than any other single image

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.510
the hopeful side.


00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.080 position:97%
 


00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.420
Certainly people understood
that at high levels

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.450
radiation was very dangerous.


00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.870
But it was over the course
of the 1950s and 1960s

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.120
that the hazards of
low-level radiation

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.600
came into clearer view.


00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.340
And that complicated
the hope that radiation

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.950
and radioisotopes could be
beneficial for civilians,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.750
because certainly
their use would expose

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.260
some people to low
levels of radioactivity.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.380
So then it became
more of a calculation

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.460
of when the risk
was worth taking.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.380
And in most cases
today, people feel

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.070
like low-level risks associated
with dental X-rays or tests

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.210
in hospitals are worth it to
get the benefits of radiation

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.600
and radioisotopes.


00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.160
But people are more leery
about the risks of radiation

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.900
from nuclear power
and other kinds

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.560
of environmental contamination.
