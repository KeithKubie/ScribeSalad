00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.070
SPEAKER: When we
first met Sal Khan

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.920
18 months ago he was working
at home in a converted closet

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.110
in the heart of Silicon Valley.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.450
The former hedge fund
analyst had recently

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.400
quit his job to do
something that, at the time,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.690
sounded a bit strange.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.240
SAL KHAN: Right now
I'm cash flow negative.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.410
SPEAKER: He gave up a
paycheck with a hefty ambition

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.057
to help educate
the world online.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.140
SAL KHAN: A lot people
thought I as kind of crazy.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.020
Obviously, when every
waking hour you have

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.020
you would sneak into a
room and make math videos

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.670
and put them on YouTube, people
kind of question, what's up?

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.990
SPEAKER: What originally
started as some math tutoring

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.010
for a cousin turned into
a global phenomenon.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850
The idea didn't seem
so crazy anymore.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.340
Though Khan, a brilliant
MIT and Harvard

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.090
grad with a wife and
two children to support,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.020
was slowly starting to
run out of his savings.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.010
That's when he learned that
one comment from the right man

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.260
can change everything-- an
out of the blue endorsement

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.690
from Bill Gates.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.910
BILL GATES: There's a new
website that I've just been

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.510
using with my kids recently
called Khan Academy, K-H-A-N,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.970
just one guy doing some
unbelievable 15-minute

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.090
tutorials.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.334
SAL KHAN: It was surreal.

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:14.000
I mean, it's one of those things
where it's this person that you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.730
grew up knowing,
almost a hero most

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.320
of your life, all of your life.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.400
SPEAKER: Soon Gates kicked in
a million and a half dollars.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.730
He also won $2
million from Google.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.760
It had a contest to
see who had the best

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.814
ideas to better the planet.

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:29.230
SAL KHAN: We did
now have millions

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.752
of dollars to essentially
pursue the dream.

00:01:31.752 --> 00:01:33.210
SPEAKER: A dream
that's enabled him

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.350
to post more than 2,300 videos
on a host of different subjects

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.180
from math, to
history, to economics.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.780
SAL KHAN: It involves an
expansion of the central bank's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.660
balance sheet.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.290
SPEAKER: Khan has
expanded his approach

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.340
to create a software
platform for classrooms.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.110
And he's working closely with
one local school district.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.010
TEACHER: Why don't you start
with reviewing some of these

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.010
and getting them out of the way?

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.390
SAL KHAN: It was literally,
it started with me just

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.560
saying, look, my
cousins have a problem.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.990
I think I have a solution
for my cousin's problem.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.540
So I did it.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.440
And it required pretty
much no resources,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.636
a little bit of my time.

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:04.510
It was like, oh wait.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.510
My cousins liked it.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.610
And other people liked it.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.610
Let's keep going.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.787
SPEAKER: With his newfound
fame and resources--

00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:11.620
SAL KHAN: This is the
worldwide headquarters

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.520
of the Khan Academy.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.603
SPEAKER: --Khan has been
able to ditch the bedroom

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:16.150
closet for an office.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.790
And he now has a small
staff to take things

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.490
to an even higher level.
