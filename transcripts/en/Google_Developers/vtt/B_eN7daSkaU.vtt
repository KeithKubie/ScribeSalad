MATTHEW GAUNT: Hi, Pete.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.900
PETE LEPAGE: Hi, Matt.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.040
MATTHEW GAUNT: So what's this?

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.860
PETE LEPAGE: The device wall.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.100
MATTHEW GAUNT: What's
the device wall?

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.120
PETE LEPAGE: It's
a wall of devices.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.620
MATTHEW GAUNT: So
seriously, though,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.600
like what's the point
of the device wall?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.433
PETE LEPAGE: So the
point of the device wall

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.190
is to give web
developers an opportunity

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.190
to see what their website
looks like across all different

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.210
devices, whether it's brand
new device or something that's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.030
been around for a long time,
to be able to see your site

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.152
and how it works is
kind of important.

00:00:31.152 --> 00:00:33.110
MATTHEW GAUNT: And
obviously we've got Android.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.400
We've got some iPhone.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.207
We got Microsoft
Services, Chromebox,

00:00:38.207 --> 00:00:40.790
which obviously that means you
start getting different browser

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.456
support and all the
other kind of things

00:00:42.456 --> 00:00:43.860
like that, which is always fun.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.331
So why is this useful?

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:48.330
PETE LEPAGE: Well, so we
found a couple of bugs.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.590
And probably my favorite bug is
one we found on one of our own

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.400
sites on google.com/chrome.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.460
If you take a look at the
site-- let me grab this.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.990
So one of the most
important things

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.650
you can do when building
a responsive site

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.590
is make sure that it remains
within the view port.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.620
So it looks like
it's in the view port

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.300
and if you were
using an emulator

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.760
or something like that, you'd
be like, oh, hey, yeah, look,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.009
everything's in the view port.

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.700
Look at all that text,
it fits perfectly.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.120
No, it doesn't.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.880
By moving the browser
around and actually

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.810
playing with it
on a real device,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.600
you can find bugs that
you'd not find otherwise.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.390
We came across
one site on a site

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.049
Paul Kinlan built,
the Air Horner app,

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.840
which if you're looking
for something fun--

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.226
the Air Horner app.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:33.850
MATTHEW GAUNT: Don't
advertise his app.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.230
It's a terrible, terrible app.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.870
No.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.190
Bad Pete.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.440
But the other side of this
as well is we hooked it up.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.130
So it's looking for
OpenWare platform features,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.170
like HBS, Service Worker,
Theme Color, which

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.920
is super, simple for
people to add in,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.335
and it gets a really nice
branding to the site.

00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:52.349
We've also got PageSpeed
Insights and WebPagetest,

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.265
and that basically looks
at performance issues

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:55.360
that you might have
with your site,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.900
and it gives you a
nice score, which

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.500
is really simple like for
helping people figure out,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.460
OK, how is my site
roughly doing,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.740
which is really, really nice.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.810
Anything else?

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.180
Anyone can use this?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.560
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely
anybody can use this.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.169
There we go.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.960
Anybody can use it.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.200
You can go to our
GitHub repository.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.235
It's up on GitHub
at GoogleChrome/Min

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:14.943
iMobileDeviceLab.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.680
Give it a try.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.820
It's a ton of fun, easy to use.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.567
MATTHEW GAUNT: Nailed it.

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:23.650
PETE LEPAGE: Thanks, Matt.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.410
That was fun.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.850
MATTHEW GAUNT: Bye, Pete.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.950
PETE LEPAGE: Bye, Matt.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.300
