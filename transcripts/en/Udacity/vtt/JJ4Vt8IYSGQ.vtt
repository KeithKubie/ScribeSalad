00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Sometimes it helps a lot simply to tell a colleague or a friend what you're up to.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is the problem I'm working on,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
this is what I'm seeing, this is what I tried out.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In my experience, in 2 out of 3 cases,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the problem resolves itself simply by telling it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When I was a teaching assistant at the university,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
students would come to me and come out with all sorts of problems.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now I'm a professor; they only come with the hard problems.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But when I was a teaching assistant, they would come along

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and say something like, "Oh, Andres, Andres, you know, I have this problem over here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You see, here's this loop, and in this loop we have this binary search tree,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and you know, I've been adding 2 elements here, added 3 elements here,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and more and more and more, and now I'm doing this and I'm doing that,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm deleting over here, but. . ."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And of course I didn't understand a single thing.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But I was still there and nodding and saying "yes, yes, yes, sure," as you do,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but then the student would come up and say,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
"Oh, actually, now that I'm saying it, I'm not deleting anything at all.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I think, yes! It must be! If the element is not in the tree,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Yes, the element is not in the tree, that's why it's not deleting!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Thank you Andres! Thank you so very much, everything is just beautiful.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Thank you so much for helping me out here."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I was happy, the student was happy, and I hadn't done anything.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Of course, occasionally there were also problems

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
where students would really come along and have real problems,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then ask me with a big puzzled face, and then I would have to come up again and say,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
"Okay, okay. Can you repeat this a bit slower?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
What's this thing about foo and a binary tree and the quotes and the tags and everything?"

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And then we would go into regular debugging, but in two-thirds of the cases, yup!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Simply by listening, I would be able to debug it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Hey! I was a king of debugging.
