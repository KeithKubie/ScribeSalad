GUEST SPEAKER 1: Basically just
a programmable visualizer that

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.650
uses an LED array and Arduino.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.350
So basically we wanted to be
able to have cool mounting

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.240
art that's moving on our walls.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.925
And it can display all sorts
of things-- basically anything

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:30.903
we want it to.

00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:33.740
But for now we'll
just do a little demo

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.387
of what it looks like in kind
of a really colorful pattern.

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:40.470
GUEST SPEAKER 2: And these
are four separate ones,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.344
so they're not connected
to just one Arduino,

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:44.050
because we all wanted
to take one home.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.214
There are also four
of us in the group,

00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:48.699
and so we're going
to put them all in.

00:00:52.547 --> 00:00:53.172
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:00:58.142 --> 00:01:02.150
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So we made
variations of each one.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.400
This is a standalone.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.770
This is like one of
the bigger versions.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.340
And then these are smaller
versions that can be--

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.532
I guess these three can
fit into photo frames.

00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:19.760
And you can program
different things

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.320
to put on it if you want
to, so we were exploring

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.880
some software with that.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.422
So I think Alex just
put fire on these two--

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:39.630
GUEST SPEAKER 1: On this one.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.838
GUEST SPEAKER 2: On this one.

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:45.360
So it should kind of
simulate a fire, like,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.450
a flickering flame-ish.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.114
It's not that great
resolution, just because it's

00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:54.830
like one LED per square inch.

00:01:57.794 --> 00:01:59.169
It looks cool under paper.

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:01.252
GUEST SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]
the fire on this one.

00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:02.832
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
is there just a piece

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:03.722
of paper on top of them?

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:04.230
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Oh, yeah.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.420
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.836
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
The original plan

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:08.780
is actually to have it in
a frame with frosted glass.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.919
They were ordered.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.740
I don't think they came
though, unfortunately,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.430
but this will do for now.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.700
But it's cool, because we'll be
able to use these for anything

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.130
from data visualization,
like stocks or something,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.540
or just like nice artwork.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.180
And you could draw on the
paper as well, technically,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.930
and fill it in with the--
