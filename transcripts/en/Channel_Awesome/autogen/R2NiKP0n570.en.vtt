dealing with these lessons that are

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
important um I think you can make them
 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
important um I think you can make them
stick<00:05:53.370><c> better</c><00:05:53.720><c> so</c><00:05:54.720><c> I</c><00:05:55.260><c> think</c><00:05:55.860><c> using</c><00:05:56.220><c> the</c>

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
stick better so I think using the
 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
stick better so I think using the
