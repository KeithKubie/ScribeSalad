00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.149
Hello, friends.

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.980
We’re going to talk about sex today.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.590
I’m excited, and I’m sure you are too.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.590
Yeaaahhh.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.590
Hmm?

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.590
What’s that?

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.450
Old people sex.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.440
Oh.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.259
Now I’m less excited.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.259
Well?

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.900
No, definitely less excited.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.369
Hey everyone, Matt Lieberman here for DNews.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.800
Sex is a complex and divisive subject.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.240
Our cultural opinion of it, unfortunately,
is still rooted in the puritanical views exhibited

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.939
not even that long ago.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.270
No matter how accepted healthy sexual lives
and appetites become, it’s still easy to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.390
fall into the trap of “that’s naughty
or taboo”.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.900
Which, sometimes can be half the fun.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.450
However, why is it that when more and more
empirical evidence emerges about 70 and 80

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.180
year-olds having sex, young people respond
with a collective “Gross”?

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.850
In a recent study of human sexuality by the
Manchester University and NatCen Social Research,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.420
they found that 54% of men and 31% of women
over the age of 70 are having sex at least

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.550
twice a month.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.240
Now depending who you are, that might sound
like a little or a lot.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.360
However, it certainly flies in the face of
your image of Grandma or Grandpa.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.770
That probably was a poor choice of words.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.240
This is the first study of its kind, interviewing
over 7000 people, including octagenarians,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.670
or 80+ year olds, for the very first time.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.490
The fact is, people can and will be sexually
active until they can’t be anymore, which

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.760
has less to do with aging and more to do with
declining sexual health.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.640
39% of the men interviewed dealt with issues
of erectile dysfunction, while 32% of women

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.330
reported that it was difficult to become sexually
aroused.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.620
However, a 2012 study from Elsevier revealed
that female sexual satisfaction only increases

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.520
with age.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.409
The study group, which had an average age
of 67 years and was 63% post-menopausal, was

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.950
able to achieve orgasm in over 67% of sexual
encounters.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.670
So it seems like sexual enjoyment and appetite
do not abate much as we age.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.840
If we think about it, when we’re their age,
wouldn’t we also want to be able to have

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.959
sex?

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.230
So why does it seem to bother or shock so
many young people?

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.340
Well first off, especially in the US, ageism
is rampant.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.290
In his book Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice
Against Older Persons, Todd D. Nelson points

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:35.030
out that Americans revere individuality and
control over what happens to their bodies.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.989
Aging is an anxious reminder of our own mortality,
and that our bodies will one day fail us.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.349
Septua and Octogenarian sex is a fight against
our own failing bodies, often requiring medications

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.769
and lubricants to maintain sex lives that
reflect our appetites.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.049
We may say that we just don’t want to picture
our Grammy or Grampy getting hanky and panky,

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.939
but when we look at them what we see are ourselves.

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.269
We are all going to age and elderly sex will
only become more prevalent.

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.099
So maybe it’s time to accept and, dare I
say it, appreciate that our grandparents are

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.370
gettin-gettin it.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.749
Or maybe not.

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:13.159
Does elderly sex gross you out or are you
cool with it?

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:26.039
