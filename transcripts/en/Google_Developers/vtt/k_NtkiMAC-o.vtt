JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hello and
welcome to "YouTube Developers

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.840
Live." We have an exciting
show for you today.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.750
We'll be talking about social
media verification.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.860
And I have excellent guests
from Storyful today.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.050
Let me introduce our guests.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.300
Joining us live from New York
City, I understand from a cafe

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.670
someplace, is David Clinch.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.050
How are you doing, David?

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.030
DAVID CLINCH: I'm doing
great, Jarek.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.515
Thanks.

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.026
Yeah, sorry, in between meetings
here in New York, but

00:00:35.026 --> 00:00:35.910
thanks for having us.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.530
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well, we
really appreciate that.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.950
And then, live from Dublin,
we have Gavin Sheridan.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770
How are you doing, Gavin?

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.430
GAVIN SHERIDAN: Hello,
how's it going?

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.700
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Everything
is going good, now.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.330
And Paul Watson.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.590
PAUL WATSON: How
are you doing?

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
I'm doing good.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.290
Well, thank you very much.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.300
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz,
and I work for YouTube

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.720
developer relations.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.760
So let's get into it.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.460
I understand that Storyful is
the new news agencies in the

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.480
age of social media.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.750
So, David, tell us a little bit
more about what your goal

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.560
is, and how did you come
up with the idea?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.450
DAVID CLINCH: Well,
yes, I've been a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.150
journalist for many years.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.700
Our founder and CEO, Mark
Little, also a journalist for

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.220
many years.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.740
And along with Gavin and Paul
and our team, we created

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.960
Storyful three years ago to
essentially be the news agency

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.170
of the future.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.740
And the key to our goal at
Storyful is the discovery and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.530
verification of user-generated
content.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.130
And a significant amount of that
content that we supply to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520
the news companies that we work
with in the US and all

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.995
around the world is
YouTube video.

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:43.510
But again, the key to us is not
just discovering it, but

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.300
making sure that we have the
original version, and that our

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.720
news partners have permission
and access to use the content.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.070
So if I showed a video of my
backyard, which is actually

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.320
pretty arid since I'm not that
good about upkeep, and claim

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.620
that this is from North Africa,
you guys are going to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.350
be able to actually identify
it as a fake?

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.610
DAVID CLINCH: Yes, we are.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.880
And it's a combination of what
we call our human algorithm,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.080
which is a combination of our
proprietary discovery tools

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.200
that allow us to tap into
every social media

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.680
platform in real time.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.490
And then finally, old fashioned,
traditional

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.855
journalism at the last level to
fully verify the content.

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:31.520
So we combine real time
technology with real time

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.450
journalism to be able to verify
and debunk videos from

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.850
anywhere, any time.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Very
interesting.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.430
Sounds like the human
and the machine

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.740
working in perfect concert.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.980
All right, so I understand we
have a quick video overview of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.480
what Storyful does.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.960
So I'm going to ask our
producer, in the studio here,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.310
to roll the tape for us.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.210
And then after that, we'll
talk about some of the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.065
technical challenges involved.

00:02:58.065 --> 00:03:05.290
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.760
-I'm Malachy Browne, I'm news
editor at Storyful.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.920
Hurricane Sandy was one of the
biggest stories of the year,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.230
from its timing a week out from
the US election, to being

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.080
the biggest storm to hit
the US since Katrina.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.060
Storyful has built it's brand
on establishing the veracity

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.740
of social media content so that
news organizations can

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.180
use it straight away.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.980
One of the biggest challenges
for news rooms on a story like

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.580
Sandy is the sheer volume of
user-generated content that's

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.500
been shared on social
platforms.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.430
You've got to know who to trust,
you've got to know what

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.995
to trust, and how to
verify content.

00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:42.720
At Storyful, we're very mindful
of official channels

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.000
like the National Guard.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.570
We know how to doorstep their
YouTube account so that we get

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.485
first dibs on the content that
they're uploading, and we get

00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:55.910
to pass that on as trustworthy
content to news organizations.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.030
At Storyful, our mantra is "news
from noise." It's about

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.540
finding the authentic voices
on the ground,

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.010
closest to the story.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.320
It's about finding reputable
sources, reputable uploaders

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.380
of content.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.380
And when we find content, making
sure that that content

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.890
is what it says it is.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.975
-A building has collapsed
here in New York.

00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:18.279
-One of the consequences of the
Occupy Movement has been

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.950
growth in this network of
citizen journalists who are on

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.860
the ground in New York, and
other cities in the US.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.260
-Fantastic.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.565
Yeah, I'd be psyched to give
you guys the fridge.

00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:30.250
-Power has gone down
in this section.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.490
See, there's some
power still up.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.375
Winds are getting rough as we
get closer to high tide.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.870
-We at Storyful have built
relationships with guys like

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.450
Tim Pool, who during Sandy
went out and filmed the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.620
electricity shutting down--
floods on the streets.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.120
He gets it to us and we get it
out to our news clients.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.500
Where Storyful really hits its
stride is finding those gems

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.310
of videos, that video gold.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.390
One example is a great video
by a high school student in

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.550
New York called Matthew
[? Weinschneider. ?]

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.470
A large tree at the back garden
was uprooted, fell

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.940
down, crashed through the fence,
and narrowly missed his

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.160
neighbor's house.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.270
And for us, we were able to
verify the location of the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.940
video, find his house on
satellite imagery.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.210
We looked at his Google+
profile, his Facebook profile,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.300
and we were able to identify
the shed beside the tree in

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.200
his back garden, and the
distance from his back porch

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.610
to the fence to absolutely
verify that this was the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.450
location where the tree
had fallen over.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.280
It's a challenge for the likes
of YouTube, Google, Facebook,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.180
and Twitter as well, to make it
easier for us to separate

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.660
the news from the noise and find
out what's really true.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.959
-Oh my god.

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:37.825
-It hit my car.

00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:38.800
-Oh, the car.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.090
I got that all on film.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.670
-Oh.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.580
-I got that all on film.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.026
-Oh my god.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.760
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.870
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Fascinating.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.090
David, tell us more
about this clip.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.490
I understand you were
involved in the

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.300
editorial process as well.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.100
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.990
DAVID CLINCH: Yeah, in fact,
one of the key elements of

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.130
what we do at Storyful is that
we have our journalists and

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.860
our technologists sitting
in the same

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.490
room, at the same time.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.575
Either in Dublin-- in our main
newsroom-- or virtually--

00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:19.650
through a 24/7 hangout
that we use--

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.490
we are in constant
communication, editorially,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.560
around what new stories
are happening.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.850
But we also have our
technologists, like Gavin and

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.180
Paul, sitting with us and
monitoring our tools that help

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.010
us with discovering
verification.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.480
And literally, on some
occasions, tweaking in real

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.610
time our search and discovery
tools so that we can not just

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.930
use the tools that we have, but
improve them in real time

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.400
as we approach real stories.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.030
So for instance, today we're
covering the clashes in Egypt.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.470
We have search terms that are
going into our discovery

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.870
platform across every social
platform searching for videos.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.270
And at the same time, we have
our editorial team-- our

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.100
journalists--

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.200
looking at what that system
brings up, and using old

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.360
fashioned journalism to help
verify and get access.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.680
So that's where Paul and Gavin
can explain to you a little

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.680
bit more the tools that we
use to help discover--

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.270
when there are thousands
of videos out there--

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.662
which are the real ones and
which are the original ones.

00:07:18.662 --> 00:07:19.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.330
This is a great segue
into the technology.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.630
I wanted to make a comment that
it sounds like very much

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.810
that working for Storyful is
very much an adrenaline sport

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.420
because you guys have to do
this in real time, as the

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.990
story is developing, isn't it?

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.530
DAVID CLINCH: Yeah, it's true.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.140
And we have three years of
experience in doing this.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.030
And also, as I said,
we're constantly

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.420
improving our tools.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.820
But it is really exciting.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.760
In fact, I think it's the sharp
end of the future of

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.390
journalism.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.320
And we're not just talking
about it, we're

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.640
actually doing it.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.770
And in my old days as a
journalist, I always wished I

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.840
had a team of technologists
immediately available to help

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.420
build and improve tools.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.585
That's what we do at Storyful.

00:07:55.585 --> 00:07:57.086
There's no barriers.

00:07:57.086 --> 00:08:00.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great, so
hacks and hackers, right?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.470
DAVID CLINCH: Yeah, that's us.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.890
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
well, let's talk about the

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.990
technology now.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.610
Gavin and Paul, tell us a little
more about how is your

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.640
system implemented.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.760
How do you actually do this?

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.120
PAUL WATSON: Yeah, so
I mean it's pretty--

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.520
there are quite a few different
tools and systems

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.230
that we actually build.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.600
It's not one monolithic
application.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.920
We have a couple of Ruby
processors which do a lot of

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.420
HTTP calls, a lot of hitting
the YouTube API and a lot

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.830
other APIs.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.450
We have a Postgres database
that stores

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.490
the majority of it.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.960
In that Postgres database, just
as a note, we have 70,000

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.179
YouTube videos that have been
looked at by individual

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.409
journalists, and verified, and
annotated, and context added

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.310
to them, given titles,
dates, and locations.

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.400
We've got 70,000 of
these videos that

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.930
are really high quality.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.870
And also cleared and
worked with the

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.330
owners of those videos.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.380
And then we have a Ruby on Rails
front end for our own

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.485
clients, and for our
journalists.

00:08:52.485 --> 00:08:54.580
It's sort of a CMS system.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.720
And then we have a--

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.480
it's a backbone JavaScript
application, at the moment--

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.080
but we're actually moving over
to Google's AngularJS as our

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.930
new front end application
development framework.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.480
And so all together, these
various tools and systems that

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.650
we've built really help the
journalists just be faster and

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.110
better and let the humans do
what they're good at and the

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.580
computers do what
they're good at.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.140
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.494
And since this is a "YouTube
Developers Live" show, what do

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:24.470
you guys use the YouTube
API for?

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.700
PAUL WATSON: Well, first of
all, we use it to get the

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.190
video details that you don't
always see in the UI.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.060
Because obviously youtube.com
is quite consumer focused.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.320
So things like location and
uploaded data is one of the

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.450
most important pieces of
information about a video, but

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.950
it's not serviced in
the youtube.com UI.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.710
So Gavin over here, he'll use
a tool, and he'll actually

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.760
look at the JSON output of their
YouTube API to get at

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.150
the details of the video.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.775
And then we'll pass it.

00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:52.310
So that's the main way.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.780
We also have a tool that goes
through all those 70,000

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.630
videos and makes sure that
they're still live.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.780
So at the moment we have 6,000
videos out of those 70,000

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.150
that are no longer available
on YouTube.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.950
But we still have the metadata,
because we don't

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.330
store the actual videos,
obviously.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.600
We leave those on YouTube.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sure, sure.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.040
So this is an important part of
dealing with user-generated

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.670
content, right?

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.780
Because it ends up in the user's
accounts, it can be

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.500
considered ephemeral.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.780
Like users have full control
over it, they can pull it,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.500
they can do whatever.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.450
PAUL WATSON: Yeah.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:20.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.940
So let's talk a little bit more
about is there anything

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.760
surprising about your product--
your system--

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.720
that you have learned while
building it that you're

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.270
willing to share with
our audience?

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.352
PAUL WATSON: Yeah, I mean, Gavin
can actually talk quite

00:10:35.352 --> 00:10:36.156
a bit about scrapes.

00:10:36.156 --> 00:10:37.300
If he wants to--

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.680
GAVIN SHERIDAN: Yeah, I mean,
I suppose one of our biggest

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.400
problems is that we'll see
a piece of user-generated

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.964
content appear on YouTube, and
within 15 minutes there will

00:10:46.964 --> 00:10:48.040
be 10 copies of it.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.070
And that is one of the biggest
problems in journalism.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.280
So we need to understand who
owns the original video, and

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.855
then we have to kind of track
back and find out, where did

00:10:57.855 --> 00:10:59.260
this video originate?

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.800
Is this the original video
or is it copied?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.830
Dealing with copies is one of
our biggest everyday tasks.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.780
PAUL WATSON: And then I think
the other thing is spam or

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.120
sort of very early uploads.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.990
So we sort by the newest
uploaded date, rather than,

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.990
say, the YouTube UI, which
sorts by relevance.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.370
So a lot of consumers of YouTube
don't see the spam

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.370
videos that have been uploaded
and which are taken down very

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.780
quickly by the YouTube
automated systems.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.470
But if you're using the API and
you're hitting it quite

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.890
regularly, you're polling it--

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.500
those keywords and accounts--

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.580
you're actually going to see
quite a bit of spam video that

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.342
you then have to filter
out yourself.

00:11:35.342 --> 00:11:36.700
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.050
Great.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.930
Well, thanks for sharing that.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.350
Have you guys tried the YouTube
Data API v3 yet?

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.340
PAUL WATSON: Yep, we have, but
it's not in production yet.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.610
We're still exploring
it, especially the

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.130
entity side of thing.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.910
A lot of videos don't have
very good titles or

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.080
descriptions, so if we can get
more entity abstracted

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.770
[INAUDIBLE] out of them,
that's fantastic.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.330
But it's still very
early days for us.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.820
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, I
think for those of you

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:03.750
watching, we actually have the
Topics API in Data API v3, so

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.950
we actually integrated
Freebase.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.300
And then there are additional
annotations available for

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.860
content that you can then query
in the Freebase database

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.190
and try to reason about.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.100
Because these are semantic
annotations as opposed to just

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.130
regular plain text keywords.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.720
Any functionality--

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.320
DAVID CLINCH: Just to add
something there, Jarek--

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.920
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sorry,
go ahead, David.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.440
DAVID CLINCH: Sorry, just to add
something there, which is

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.030
very important, when you were
talking about metadata.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.640
In many cases, the videos that
we're discovering have little

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.100
or no metadata at all.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.410
They might be uploaded as video
nine with no location,

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:38.910
no other information.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.930
And we're discovering them not
by actually searching on

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:45.610
YouTube, but through a social
search which taps into the

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.040
mentions and the references to
those videos from the people

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.350
who are at the scene, or
journalists who are

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.760
knowledgeable in a particular
area like Egypt or Syria or

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.790
somewhere else.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.420
And they're pointing us towards
these videos, with

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.630
additional context.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.430
And really, the only information
that we have about

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.030
the videos exists on other
social platforms.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.055
So it's very important for us
to understand, and for our

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:11.680
news clients to understand, that
in some cases you will

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.080
not find the videos by
searching on YouTube.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.830
But we can help discover them
because they're being

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.530
referenced on other platforms.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.670
At some point later they may
have metadata added, but at

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.870
the time that they're uploaded,
they often don't.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.860
Yeah, very interesting.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.680
Sounds like when you think of
metadata, it's in the broader

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.810
context of all the social media
signals that you can

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.590
reason about.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.680
And that kind of builds
the metadata in your

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.730
system about the video.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.920
YouTube is just one of the
sources, and sometimes the

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.390
only thing that YouTube will
provide is the actual video,

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.300
without any other
signals, right?

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.910
But fortunately, you can
actually look at a

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.480
lot more than this.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.220
Thank you for sharing that,
that's very interesting.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.950
Is there anything in the API
that you guys would like to

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.100
see that is not there yet?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.160
Any things on the wish list?

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.770
PAUL WATSON: Yeah,
streaming APIs.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:13:59.320
[? Pushnote ?]

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.220
APIs.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.601
That's really-- it will
help us a lot.

00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:05.190
We do quite a bit of polling,
and the YouTube API is a lot

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.150
more generous than, say,
the Vimeo API.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.005
But again, if we can get more
streams of data, it will fit

00:14:11.005 --> 00:14:13.700
our use case a lot better.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:13.920
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.000
Well, thank you for
sharing that.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.010
We do have quite a bit of work
ongoing right now to integrate

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.870
our synchronous push
notifications

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.970
into Data API v3.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.320
In fact, for those of you that
attended Google I/O or watched

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.150
the videos-- there was a
presentation by my colleague

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.480
Jeff Posnick talking about
exactly how this is going to

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.370
work when it's fully
rolled out.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.670
We will post a link to that
video, and then we hope to

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.190
have it available soon.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.090
Well, let's switch to the
Moderator to see if we have

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.210
received any questions.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:50.210
I see there's one question that
is relevant, and it's

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:51.620
actually from me.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.350
It's about whether YouTube
Developer Relations is hiring.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.970
And the answer is yes,
we are hiring.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.150
Google Developer Relations
is hiring as well.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.460
You can learn more at
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.360
Well, thank you very
much for your time.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.440
I really appreciate you joining
us late from Dublin.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.990
And thank you, David, I
understand he needed to run to

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.840
the meeting that he alluded to
earlier during the show.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.270
A real pleasure having
you on the show.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.240
You're doing some very
interesting work.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.120
And for those of you watching,
thank you very

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.220
much for your time.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.380
And we'll see you again live
next week on "YouTube

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.530
Developers Live." Bye.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:29.470
PAUL WATSON: Thank you, Jarek.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.720
GAVIN SHERIDAN: Thanks.
