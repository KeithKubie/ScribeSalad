00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.890
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I'd like
to introduce Gino Blefari.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.250
Gino Blefari is a
chief executive officer

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.296
for HSF Affiliates, which
operates the real estate

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:10.170
brokerage network for
Berkshire Hathaway Home

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.150
Services, Prudential Real
Estate and Real Living Real

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.620
Estate, Warren Buffett's real
estate franchise business.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.290
Blefari has an award-winning
agent, manager,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.580
and broker owner.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.730
He came to his position
at HSF Affiliates

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.440
from Silicon Valley, CA-based
Intero Real Estate Services,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.110
Inc., which he founded in 2002
and through mid-2014 served

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.480
as its president and CEO.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.650
Under Blefari's
direction, Intero

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.460
became one of the fastest,
organically growing companies

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.090
in the history of real estate.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.790
In 2014, Intero ranked seventh
nationwide for real estate

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.280
sales volume, according
to REAL Trends.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.200
Some of his recognition
includes ranked

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.450
among top 25 most powerful
and influential leaders

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.210
in the residential
real estate industry,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.140
according to the 2016
Swanepoel Power 200 rankings

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.760
and 2007 Italian
Businessman of the Year

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.450
by Italian American
Heritage Foundation.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.280
And last but not least, he
was my real estate professor

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.210
at De Anza Community College.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120
So let's give Gino a
warm welcome to Google.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.760
GINO BLEFARI: Thanks.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.926
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Thank you.

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:17.415
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.377
So for the first question, I
was going to start off with,

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:27.210
can you talk about the
different real estate

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.227
investments you've made?

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:29.810
GINO BLEFARI: My
personal investments?

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.870
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah,
your personal investments.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.125
GINO BLEFARI: Sure.

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:33.333
JORDAN THIBODEAU: And what
has been one of your best?

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.450
GINO BLEFARI: OK.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.290
You know, I'm not a huge
real estate investor,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.040
but being in the
real estate business,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.340
I remember when I
started in there I

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.850
had heard from some trainer
that it would be great to try

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.030
to buy one house every year.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.101
And so the first probably seven
years of my career, that's

00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:49.600
what I did.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.370
I bought a house.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.260
And I had a rule then.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.530
The rule there
was I wanted to be

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.720
able to drive to
it within one hour.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.350
So that was my
simple rule there.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.610
In turn, traded those seven
houses into a building,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.500
and what has turned out
as my best real estate

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.310
investments over time have
been commercial buildings.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.290
And I'll give you
a case in point.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.560
If you look at the Intero
building on Santa Cruz Avenue

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.550
there, that was some of
my little rental houses

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.689
that I rolled into that.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.230
I actually built
that building there.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.800
It turned out to
be a great return.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.280
And a funny story of how
investments, sometimes you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.520
think they're good, and then
you think they're terrible.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.690
And then they turn out to
be good, back and forth.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.200
In 2005, I bought
a piece of dirt

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.370
on El Camino Real right
here in Menlo Park.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.970
It was an old gas station.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.130
And it had already
been cleaned up.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.690
And I was going to
build a building.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.666
And at the time,
2005, as you remember,

00:02:57.666 --> 00:02:59.290
the real estate market
was really good.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.132
So Intero was doing terrific.

00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:03.090
I thought, OK, I'm going
to build this building

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.080
and open up a real estate
office in Menlo Park.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.830
So I had hassles with the city,
and hassles with the city,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.070
hassles with the city.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.790
And they didn't finish
the building until 2008.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.390
Well, 2008 was right in
the brink of this recession

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.790
that we have, right?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.210
And so it was a terrible time.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.334
So there was no way I could
put an Intero in there.

00:03:23.334 --> 00:03:26.360
So I had this building
that I had debt on.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.430
And I'm not some
multi-millionaire investor

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.220
at that time at all.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.840
And so I had debt on it that
was costing me about $48,000

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.730
a month.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.020
And it was vacant.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.940
It's not a very good investment.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.160
I think everybody in
the room would agree.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.220
But I was lucky enough to get
Stanford Medical to lease it.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.630
So I had Stanford Medical in it
and Pendleton in a little 2,500

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.450
square feet.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.620
And they leased it for like,
maybe, 55 grand a month.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.380
So I had a tiny
bit of a cash flow,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.520
but I never pulled
one penny out of it.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.140
And I think about a
year ago right now,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.520
because rates were so low,
I refinanced the building.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.450
And they appraised it
when you refinance,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.540
and they appraised it for
$10 million, which was fine.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.496
I think I owed about
$5 million on it.

00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:18.870
But I'm going to
keep it, haven't

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.180
taken a penny out
of it, zero return,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.470
just whatever appreciation
you might have.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.350
And I got a call from
the commercial broker

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.740
that leased it, a guy from
Cornish &amp; Carey Commercial.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.390
He says, hey, you want to sell
your building in Menlo Park?

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.270
Naw, I just refinanced it.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.110
You know, this is
a long-term hold.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.940
It almost broke me.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.370
But he goes, well, I got
a stupid offer for you.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.000
I go, really?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.510
How much?

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.862
He goes well, $13,100,000.

00:04:44.862 --> 00:04:49.010
Oh, well, go ahead and
send me a letter of LOI.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.740
So he sent me a letter of LOI.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.790
And I had one of the Intero
agents, commercial agent,

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.790
lease the downstairs
2,500 square feet.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.410
And I had them lease that.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.993
And so I called him
up, said, hey, I'm

00:05:01.993 --> 00:05:03.940
going to need a
copy of the contract

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.580
because I might be
selling the building.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.480
He says, oh, what's going on?

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.240
So I tell him what's going on.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.780
That Monday, the
following Monday,

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.832
I got an offer on the building
that was worth $10 million

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:20.260
for $15 million all cash with
like a 30-day close, right?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.570
So what turned out
to be one of those,

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.460
Travis said, crazy,
like, oh my gosh.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.710
How did I get into this?

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.320
Now, I'm always the majority
owner in the buildings,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.860
and I drag a bunch of my
friends in with little pieces

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.680
of the whole thing.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.304
And so it turned out
to be a good deal.

00:05:36.304 --> 00:05:41.520
But that might be one of the
more successful-- definitely

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.330
is the most successful
deal that I did there.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.629
Also, when we're speaking
about real estate investments,

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.170
coming out of that
investment, then I

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.880
had several million dollars
that I needed to roll over

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.030
into other properties.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.200
And with my new job as the
CEO of HSF Affiliates--

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.020
and we operate
Berkshire Hathaway Home

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.110
Services that brand and
Prudential and Real Living--

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.360
I'm constantly on the road and
visiting affiliates, you know,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.720
franchisees.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.890
And so I'm in Chattanooga,
Tennessee, and you know,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.060
I tell them, so, do you have
any good deals out here?

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.250
We're always looking
for good deals.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.090
Funny thing, in
Chattanooga, Tennessee,

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.500
I was able to buy
five single family

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.420
homes for like $110,000 each.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.690
And they rented for $1,300.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.840
You don't find those kind
of deals like right here.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.590
So most of the investments
in real estate for now

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.310
seem to be good.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.070
But look at that Menlo Park one.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.230
In 2008, it was terrible.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.230
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.810
Now, when you made a
decision to buy in Tennessee,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.100
what metrics were you
looking at to determine

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.520
if it was a good investment?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.430
GINO BLEFARI: I was just
looking for a good return, not

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.550
any specific number.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.230
But OK, I can buy
it for this price.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.850
And here's how much cash flow.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.777
I'm kind of all
about cash flow now.

00:07:01.777 --> 00:07:03.110
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Exactly, yeah.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.984
They have a rule of
thumb called the 1% rule.

00:07:04.984 --> 00:07:08.720
So by you bringing $1,300 a
month, buy it for $100,000.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.470
I mean, that exceeds 1%, so--

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.970
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah,
it's pretty hard

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.760
to do almost anywhere else.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.801
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.250
GINO BLEFARI: I kind of
spread it out a little bit.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.840
Before my rule was it's
got to be one hour away.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.400
Now my rule is it's
got a cash flow.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.200
I'm lucky enough, though, to
know real estate professionals.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.240
Like Travis is here
in the audience right

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.670
over here, Travis Conte.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.770
So I know people like
Travis all over the country.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.910
And so it's not me trying
to guess is this good.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.750
Because a lot of
times you can guess,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.240
but you don't have all the
details that you really

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.480
need to know about it.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.480
And so I'm lucky enough
to have that all around.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.870
I've got a place
in Austin, Texas,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.650
because I knew Austin
was a pretty good market.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.405
Believe it or not, I've got
a Starbucks in Oklahoma.

00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:05.030
And if you Googled it-- I can't
even remember the city it's in,

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.738
but if you Googled
it, it's where there's

00:08:06.738 --> 00:08:08.720
more tornadoes than anywhere.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.991
But the return was very, very
good, and I've got insurance.

00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:16.010
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.360
What do you think
separates a good investor

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.130
from a great investor
in real estate?

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.050
GINO BLEFARI: Luck.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:33.520
I mean, look, it's just like
with any type of investing.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.100
It's someone with a good
strategy and the strategy

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.130
that fits for them.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.039
Luck does play a
bit of it, though.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.990
Perfect example, my parents
were from Massachusetts.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.500
I grew up in Sunnyvale,
working class family.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:57.930
They happened to buy a house in
Sunnyvale in 1960 for $18,750.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.840
Now, we are from
Massachusetts, where

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.570
they had a house that was about
$20,000, worth about $20,000.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.160
I went back when I
was visiting, when

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.520
I toured through Massachusetts.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.840
I wanted to go to my
mom and dad's house.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.930
Their house is still worth
$20,000 in Massachusetts.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.280
Their house here in
an area of Birdland

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.970
right by where the
new Apple's coming in,

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.190
is probably worth at least
a million and a half,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.030
maybe a million eight.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.730
So there is some-- from an
appreciation standpoint,

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.447
some of it is.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:34.280
JORDAN THIBODEAU: A lot
of us here at Google

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.690
are thinking about
investing out of state,

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.430
and so we have to
use our networks

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.710
and try to determine what
would be a good partner for us

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.860
to work with, how to find
a good property manager,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.730
how to find a good agent.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.260
What are things
that you look for

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.610
in a quality investor-oriented
real estate agent?

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.150
GINO BLEFARI: You know,
someone that understands

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.360
the real estate investment.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.540
And lots of realtors,
they just sell houses.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.240
But you may not need
that commercial agent,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.296
which is more of like-- if
you're buying a building

00:10:10.296 --> 00:10:11.170
and things like that.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.690
But you want someone that
understands the numbers,

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:21.870
understands, you know, the
return, just someone like that.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.920
I can do it myself now.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.480
It's like, OK, what
can I get a place for?

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.642
What can it rent for?

00:10:27.642 --> 00:10:29.350
And then I'm going to
do the math myself.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.480
But you want to have
somebody-- I'm lucky enough

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.030
to have someone that I'm
going to know and trust that's

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.910
going to say, oh, it's not right
next to-- the dump's like two

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.710
miles away.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.610
And the wind blows right by it.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.187
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Exactly.

00:10:44.187 --> 00:10:46.020
One issue that we deal
with here in Bay Area

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.420
is, because the cost
of housing is so high,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.350
that it's really hard
to find good real estate

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.214
investments here.

00:10:54.214 --> 00:10:55.630
For Googlers just
starting out who

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.059
don't have a lot of capital,
are there certain areas

00:10:58.059 --> 00:11:00.600
that you would suggest that we
take a look at for real estate

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.460
investing?

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:08.140
GINO BLEFARI: Again, I would
say it's all personal to you.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.350
I had that rule, that one hour.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.990
I wanted to get one
within one hour.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.970
So a couple of the
first things I bought

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.050
was down in Morgan Hill.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.440
I bought a place down in--
I remember like in 1987, I

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.709
bought a brand new
house that Dividend

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:23.250
was building in
Morgan Hill because I

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.050
could drive to it in an hour.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.900
And it was certainly
easier to afford.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.130
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:35.390
GINO BLEFARI: Right now, you
have this crazy opportunity,

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.940
and I know lots of the Google
people are millennials.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.560
You're young.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.059
But you've got the
crazy opportunity

00:11:40.059 --> 00:11:45.450
of interest rates being really,
really historically low.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:51.530
So if I didn't have a house
right now, I'd buy one.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.500
I wouldn't try to wait for is
the market going to change?

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.050
Actually, the market's actually,
right here in Silicon Valley,

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.990
even though there's
almost no inventory,

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.770
has actually slowed
a bit right now.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.610
It's starting to
slow a bit right now.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.780
But let me tell
you the reason why,

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.480
and you almost never will
hear this from anyone.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.190
In fact, I think a student
one time at De Anza

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.320
asked this question.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.780
And I went back, and
I did the math on it.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.600
I say, oh my gosh.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.440
I wonder why no one's
ever heard of this.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.220
But let's just pretend
interest rates are 4%.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.720
Interest rates are 4%.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.740
And let's just pretend that
interest rates move to 6%.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.430
Now, in the old days-- in
1989, I paid four points

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.750
to get 10 and an eighth.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.284
That's just perspective for you.

00:12:39.284 --> 00:12:40.700
But everything
else, it was coming

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.330
down from like 14% and 13%
and right on down there.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.380
But here's an interesting piece.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.500
When you make your payment
on a 30-year fixed rate

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:57.620
loan amortized over 30 years
at 4%, 30% of that payment

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.070
goes toward paying down
your principal of your loan,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.350
reducing your principal.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:06.770
When it moves to
6%, only 17% goes.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.020
So if you do the math, you
almost have a 13% to 14%.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.750
It's almost like appreciation
because appreciation's

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.390
gaining equity.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.920
When you pay off your mortgage,
you're gaining equity.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.990
And rates are even lower.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.770
I used 4% and 6% just
because it was kind of easy.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.120
But it's even better.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.330
If you're going to buy property,
especially your own house,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.160
man, that interest rate
is a huge, huge factor.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.740
And it's totally in our favor.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.660
Because it's as low as
we've ever seen them.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.700
And I don't know
what they will do,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.082
but my guess is they will go up.

00:13:46.082 --> 00:13:47.040
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Fair.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.330
Now regarding
international markets,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.030
are there any
international markets

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.350
that you have seen that looks
like a potential good areas

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.260
for real estate investing?

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.620
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah,
you know, international

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.870
is kind of a little
bit more risky.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.830
Certain markets like I think
Beijing and Vietnam-- might

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.890
be a good market in Vietnam, but
you can't buy as an American.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.890
So I would go to the
ones that traditionally

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:23.850
have been pretty good
markets like Mexico, Canada.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.920
Here's the other
thing too though.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.530
You can get to Cabo San
Lucas in-- how long would it

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:29.280
take to fly there?

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.940
Deidre, do you know how
long it would takes?

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.160
SPEAKER: 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.570
GINO BLEFARI: 2 and
1/2 hours, right?

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.361
Now you're buying
something over in Europe,

00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:37.610
it's what, 10 and 1/2 hours?

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:43.636
So I would look to some
of those areas like that.

00:14:43.636 --> 00:14:46.260
JORDAN THIBODEAU: What are your
thoughts on the general housing

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.700
market outside
the United States?

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.158
People are always asking me,
do you think we're in a bubble

00:14:50.158 --> 00:14:51.550
right now?

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.002
Is there more legs in this
economy to keep on going?

00:14:54.002 --> 00:14:54.960
What are your thoughts?

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.710
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah, I
know, that question,

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.390
it's one of those things.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.510
Before I answer that, I'll
tell you a quick little story.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:07.750
In 2004, because Silicon
Valley was going really well,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.020
I was on "Kudlow &amp;
Cramer," the CNBC.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.522
And the whole big thing
was, is it a bubble?

00:15:14.522 --> 00:15:15.730
Is the bubble going to burst?

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.630
Or it's a soft landing.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.350
And, you know, I had
really, really no idea.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.380
But everybody at that
time, except a few guys

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.830
that had figured it out,
thought we were going

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:30.290
to be in for a soft landing.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:35.490
Before I say, how many of you
think that we're in a bubble?

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.330
So maybe a third of you.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.420
And then the 2/3 say that
we're not in a bubble.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.000
If I had to guess, and
it would only be a guess,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.090
I would say we're
not in a bubble.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.360
And here's why I back that up.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.260
When we had the
bubble in like 2000,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.940
but I guess the bubble
burst, what, in about 2007?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.200
OK, let's say bubbles burst.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.730
There was a thing called
a negatively amortized

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.670
adjustable rate
subprime mortgage.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.100
And what that was was a
mortgage that when you start out

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.600
at a very, very low rate.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.510
And that's what your rate was.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.320
Negatively amortization
means really payment's

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.380
supposed to be up here.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.190
But I'm only making
the payment down here.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.120
And what I'm going to
do with the payment

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.920
that you were supposed to
make up here, that difference,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.336
I'm going to add that on to
the back end of your mortgage.

00:16:28.336 --> 00:16:33.000
Now, that only works if
property is totally, totally,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.450
totally appreciating.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.390
The next piece to
that was back then--

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.400
and now those loans
are pretty much gone.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.630
There's government
regulations that you

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.210
can't do that type of a loan.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.280
The other thing--
there were loans where

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.940
you wouldn't verify anything.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.930
We almost called them liar
loans, like as a joke.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.420
It's a liar loan because there
was no verification of anything

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.060
that was put down on
the loan application.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.830
So all sorts of people
got loans that they never

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.050
should have gotten.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.460
And that doesn't happen.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.430
So the only way that those
people that got all those loans

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.770
could even survive was with
the market accelerating

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.819
at a crazy, crazy space.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.190
And if my balloon
payment came in,

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.450
it was OK, because I
just refinanced out of it

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.410
and got another
adjustable rate mortgage.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.660
Those days are gone.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.000
We don't have those
specific days now anymore

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.050
because of that.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.080
So to that, I would
say maybe we don't

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.920
have a big bubble
where it's going

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.740
to burst like it did in 2007.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.650
How many of you saw the
movie "The Big Short"?

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.660
Almost all of you, yeah.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.430
That was a pretty
darn good movie.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.890
How many of you
have read the book?

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.770
It was Michael Lewis's
book, "The Big Short."

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:48.410
OK.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.300
It really talked about
the negatively amortized

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.096
adjustable rate
subprime mortgage,

00:17:53.096 --> 00:17:54.762
and it also talked
about it in the book.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.720
He was talking to the
lady in the club, right?

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.090
And she owned like-- he goes,
well, how about your condo?

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.680
How you doing on your--
well, I own six houses.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.800
I mean, people just
owned and owned

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.270
and owned because
anybody could get a loan.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.840
And we don't have that anymore.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.790
It's a lot harder.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.890
So I'd say government
regulations

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.050
have played a role in that.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.370
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah, so today
I saw the GDP numbers came out.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.530
And it showed they're
a little soft.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.030
A question I'm
getting from Googlers

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.630
also is, do you think
this interest rate

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.447
environment will hold for
the next year, two years?

00:18:37.447 --> 00:18:40.030
Or do you think we're going to
eventually sees some increases?

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.110
GINO BLEFARI: I think we're
going to eventually see

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.890
some increases.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.022
I have no idea how long it will.

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:45.730
Everybody was forecasting
it would go up,

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.640
and then something in
the economy will happen

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.800
and it will go down.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.630
I think what you need to
understand about interest

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.220
rates, when the Fed
raises interest rates,

00:18:54.220 --> 00:19:00.770
usually the market has already
anticipated that raise.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.588
It's not like it's going to
have some giant jump overnight.

00:19:03.588 --> 00:19:04.463
JORDAN THIBODEAU: OK.

00:19:04.463 --> 00:19:05.430
Gotcha.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.870
So as real estate
investors, we depend

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.080
upon our agents to
get access to MLS

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.500
and get real estate information.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.920
What are some other
sources of information

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.880
that we could find that wouldn't
require us to have MLS access?

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.870
GINO BLEFARI: Well, real
estate's local, number one.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.180
So every market's different.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.040
And of course, I come from
the real estate industry.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.320
So I would say
you've got to find

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.670
somebody that understands
that market and knows

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:36.510
what's going on.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.190
There was a time a
while-- not so much now--

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.500
but in Silicon Valley
and other markets

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.860
when the market was so hot
half the properties were

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.820
being sold off market.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.690
So you wouldn't have
had access to it

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.990
unless you were part of
some sort of a network.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:03.200
There's also, like at
BHHS, we have an app

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.830
that you can put on your phone.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:14.630
If you text BHHS and you put
in 87778 exclamation mark,

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.140
you can get a free app
that wherever you are,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.800
you can find out what's
going on in the market.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.830
You'll see what's
for sale, what sold,

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.420
all sorts of things
right there on the--

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.010
And Berkshire Hathaway isn't
the only one with that app,

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.280
but there's all
sorts of ways to.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.790
That's a way to
almost get access

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.650
to all of the MLS yourself.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.480
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.030
In case of a
deflationary environment,

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.400
how can we position
real estate assets?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.880
And what signals do
you guys look into

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.204
to check if there's
a deflationary risk?

00:20:45.204 --> 00:20:46.620
GINO BLEFARI: Well,
first when you

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:53.620
look is for a deflationary--
if prices are going down.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.930
Now all of a sudden, homes are
selling for less than they are.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.080
So that would be the first sign.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.350
Decline in wages,
decline in unemployment,

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.410
commodity prices-- you could
look at all of those things.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.530
But I'm mainly going
to focus on, wow,

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.180
prices seem to be coming down.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:20.190
I think the Fed expects about--
or they would like about-- 2%

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.081
inflation.

00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:23.830
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah
the Wikipedia entry

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.600
for Home Services America, the
parent of Berkshire Hathaway

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.860
Home Services,
says that HSA also

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.470
provides mortgage loan
originations, title and closing

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.480
services, home
warranties, property,

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.930
and casualty insurance.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.410
Can you explain how all
those entities work together?

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.610
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah,
most big companies

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.220
like Berkshire Hathaway
Home Services, Home Services

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.150
of America is the second
largest real estate

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.180
company in the country.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.650
They have things like my
brand, Berkshire Hathaway Home

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.880
Services, Prudential
Real Living.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.350
But they also have
about 26 companies.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.570
Like when you see
an Intero sign now,

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:05.170
you'll see it say "Intero, a
Berkshire Hathaway affiliate."

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.100
So they're a big company.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:12.980
And the consumer on every
survey going back to 1995

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.460
has always said they
want a one-stop shop.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.880
So what we try to do as
a real estate company

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.720
is provide mortgage, title,
homeowners insurance,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.290
personal insurance.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.080
It's a whole gamut
of the whole thing.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.829
I think you were
referring to RESPA.

00:22:31.829 --> 00:22:33.870
Is everybody familiar with
RESPA, the Real Estate

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.030
Procedures Act?

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:40.570
And that's where no one can
receive anything of value

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.740
on directing a
settlement service.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.910
However, when
you're a big company

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:51.120
and you own the whole thing,
and a manager's an employee,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.520
the manager could be
incentivized to increase

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.570
the capture rate on mortgage.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.090
A realtor now is an
independent contractor.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.980
They could not receive
anything of value

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.270
for directing business to a
settlement service company.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.700
I will tell you this.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.750
The companies-- and many
big companies have them.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:19.670
The ones that do, you're better
off almost 100% of the time

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.310
using a company that
has all those services

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:29.540
because those providers are
held to a higher standard,

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.830
even by the regulators.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.840
If you get a 0% for
a mortgage, you'd

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.490
have a $0 on that
closing statement.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.790
It can be off $0 if
it's the own company.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.500
If it's an outside company,
it can be off as much as 10%

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.910
and still fall under
the regulation.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:52.930
So the other thing too is
there's a whole reputation

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:53.980
piece.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.531
It's all based on service.

00:23:55.531 --> 00:23:57.530
You've got to give great,
great service in order

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.988
to get the business,
whether you're

00:23:58.988 --> 00:24:00.697
the title, whether
the mortgage provider,

00:24:00.697 --> 00:24:03.154
whether you're the insurance
provider and things like that.

00:24:03.154 --> 00:24:05.070
But when it's all right
in the same family,

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.870
it's scrutinized a lot closer.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.990
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.910
Can you share your views on
the title insurance market?

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:15.490
"The New York Times" has some
unfavorable words regarding it.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.420
And they think it's kind of--
the field is an oligopoly.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.770
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah, title adds.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:25.500
I always kind of
almost smile when

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.780
it comes to title insurance.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:31.240
But let me just explain
what title insurance is.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.910
Title insurance is
a one time-- most

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.750
insurance you pay every year.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.250
You renew your
insurance every year.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.660
Title insurance is
a one time where

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:44.590
they're assuring that the title
is exactly what you thought it

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.840
was when you bought the house.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.570
In other words, who sold me the
house was actually the owner.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.860
What liens are on
the house that may

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.720
go with it are
going to stay there,

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.750
but what liens have to get
be cleared off do that.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:03.170
The title insurance paid out
something like-- last year--

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:07.770
$670 million in title
claims where they

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.150
had pretty much got it wrong.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.450
But where were "The
New York Times,"

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.970
I think where they were going in
that article, where they almost

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.420
say it's kind of like a scam
is because, here's the deal.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.170
They're going to search
through that title

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.000
as carefully as could be.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.730
And if they find
anything wrong with it,

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.070
they're not going to insure it.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.150
Your deal's not going to close
until they get that fixed.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.770
So it's like
everything's perfect.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.120
It's like I want to put
title insurance on this car.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.320
I'm going to put
insurance on this car,

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.770
but I'm going to make sure
it's in perfect condition.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.160
And then now you can't drive it.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.430
It just is like--
it's a one time fee.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.542
So that's where it
gets that reputation.

00:25:47.542 --> 00:25:49.500
But they do make mistakes,
and they do pay out.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.940
Now, in the old days,
before title insurance,

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.420
you had an attorney do it.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.732
Now, if an attorney
had no assets,

00:25:56.732 --> 00:25:57.940
you could never even recover.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.461
It was like, too bad.

00:26:00.461 --> 00:26:01.710
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Interesting.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:05.540
It seems like there's a secular
trend where people are now

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.240
moving towards going
to urban environments

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.740
and the suburbs don't have
the same, I guess, allure

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.560
they used to once had.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.950
Do you think this is going
to continue on forward

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.470
or are we going to revert
back to that suburban trend?

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.710
GINO BLEFARI: I think
we will revert back.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.160
But until that point--
there's that commercial,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.160
that television
commercial. "Well, I'm

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.310
never going to do this."

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.870
And then he's doing that. "I'm
never going to get a van,"

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.245
and then the guy's
getting a van.

00:26:30.245 --> 00:26:32.282
And "I'm never going to
move to the suburbs,"

00:26:32.282 --> 00:26:34.740
and then he has kids and he
moves to the suburbs and things

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.240
like that.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.970
I think with the millennial
generation being so big,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.430
and people do-- you
know, millennial,

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.270
they want to walk to
everywhere they go.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.790
If you look at the
building in San Jose,

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.330
all those high rises, right
downtown, Santana Row.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.840
You go to San Diego, you go all
over, there definitely is that.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.560
I have two daughters 23 and 25.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.910
Where do they want to live?

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:04.630
San Francisco so they can
just walk to work and do that.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:05.700
So there is that.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.075
The other thing you need to
remember about the millennial

00:27:08.075 --> 00:27:12.980
is the average age of
a millennial is 25,

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.670
so that's kind of young.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:18.870
The average first
time home buyer is 31.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.790
And we've done all sorts of
studies on the millennials

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.930
and what they want and
what they're looking for

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.000
and things like that.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.330
And I think back to when
I bought my first house.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.080
What was important to
me is the same thing

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.510
that's important to them.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.177
Ease of purchase was one.

00:27:34.177 --> 00:27:36.510
But the other one was to be
able to tell everybody, hey,

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.020
I got a house.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.690
I got my first house.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.430
Travis, you're 25, right?

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.580
And you're going to be
buying a house this year.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.360
And one of those things will
be, hey, I got my house.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.210
It's a little bit of
that pride that you have,

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.460
but definitely there has been.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.600
And you've just got to
watch the construction, all

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.040
of the stuff that's built.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.010
My headquarters, now, is
in Irvine, California.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.950
And even though I still
live in Los Altos,

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.736
and I try to be at
home as much as I can,

00:28:02.736 --> 00:28:04.860
if I'm going to be down in
Irvine, I thought, well,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.780
maybe I should buy
something down there.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.640
And that's exactly what I
bought, a condo, urban living.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.770
And you know what?

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.940
It was about-- I timed it.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.550
It was 2 and 1/2
minutes from my condo

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.089
to the front door
of my building.

00:28:21.089 --> 00:28:22.130
And I'm not a millennial.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.790
But you know, it is common.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.406
And they're building more
and more and more of them.

00:28:26.406 --> 00:28:29.540
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now, as far
as the average size of a home,

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.720
we're noticing that the
average square footage that

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.810
peaked around 1950s,
1960s, has slowly

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.190
decreased to smaller
and smaller home sizes.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.706
And now we're seeing a lot
of talk about the tiny homes.

00:28:41.706 --> 00:28:43.580
Do you think that trend
is going to continue?

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.387
Or do you think home sizes will
revert back to a larger size?

00:28:47.387 --> 00:28:49.220
GINO BLEFARI: Well, I
actually think they've

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.514
gotten larger over time.

00:28:52.514 --> 00:28:54.180
I think they've gotten
larger over time,

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.360
and that's just
because part of it

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.390
is that move-up buyer is
getting a bigger home.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:03.870
Part of it is when the
luxury market-- watch when

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.660
a developer builds a house.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.040
They're pretty much bigger.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.840
If you go to Sunnyvale or
Cupertino or Mountain View,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.230
wherever there were
homes and a developer had

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.710
come in the last
even 20 years, you'll

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.860
see those newer
homes are bigger.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:26.480
And so I think it will
continue as people-- every once

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.380
in awhile, you'll get somebody
moving out of their big house

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.470
into-- they're retiring.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:32.970
And then that's going down.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.190
But for the most part,
the homes being built now

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.080
continue to be more square
footage, more square footage.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.940
In our area, it could be just
because the land's worth so

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.677
much money too, and they want
to maximize the amount of house

00:29:43.677 --> 00:29:44.760
that you can get on there.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.190
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Excellent, so at this point,

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.750
we're going to go to audience
questions and [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.330
questions.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.140
So if anyone has
a live question,

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.620
I'm going to grab the
mic and pass it over.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.350
Does anyone have
a live question?

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.850
Excellent.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.250
Can you had that to him, please?

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.256
Thanks.

00:30:06.256 --> 00:30:07.630
GINO BLEFARI:
Travis is here too,

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.000
if you had a local
real estate question.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.150
I haven't sold a
house since 1997.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.210
Go ahead.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:16.442
AUDIENCE: For a
first time homebuyer,

00:30:16.442 --> 00:30:18.250
do you think it's
overly aggressive

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.610
to try and get, let's, say,
a multi-family home where

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.142
you'd be paying more but you
could find a renter, if you

00:30:25.142 --> 00:30:27.600
wanted to look at your property
not just as a place to live

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.120
but as an investment?

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.660
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah,
I think that's great.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.260
You've got to
convince your partner,

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.436
your significant other,
your spouse, that that's

00:30:36.436 --> 00:30:39.060
what you want to do because this
is where you're going to live.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.410
But yeah, I think it's great,
because then you're going

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:42.771
to have that rental income.

00:30:42.771 --> 00:30:44.270
You're going to
have your own house.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.769
You're going to be
able to watch it.

00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:47.450
It's right next door
if it's a duplex

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.840
or a triplex or a fourplex.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.480
Great advantages when you
become on the investor side,

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.970
because that part
that you do rent you

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.090
can depreciate the
improvement on it.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.240
You can write off
all the expenses

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.530
that you have on that site.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.320
So no, that'd be a great thing.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.532
In fact, I was just
talking, and I didn't even

00:31:08.532 --> 00:31:09.990
know it-- Travis
Conte, right here,

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.010
real estate agent
in Redwood City.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.730
We're talking.

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:14.230
He's 25.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.680
He's going to buy
his first place,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.505
and that's what you wanted
to do, right Travis?

00:31:17.505 --> 00:31:18.166
TRAVIS CONTE: Exact same--

00:31:18.166 --> 00:31:19.170
GINO BLEFARI: Same thing.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.658
TRAVIS CONTE: Yeah, you
know, under four units

00:31:20.658 --> 00:31:22.126
is still residential, right?

00:31:22.126 --> 00:31:24.626
So you're looking at getting
basically the same type of loan

00:31:24.626 --> 00:31:26.610
[INAUDIBLE] respects.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.090
And you can afford to
live there and count that

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.082
as part of your income.

00:31:30.082 --> 00:31:31.528
So your [INAUDIBLE]
could change.

00:31:31.528 --> 00:31:33.278
It all depends on the
lender, who you use.

00:31:33.278 --> 00:31:37.170
But it's honestly a
great option for--

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.960
GINO BLEFARI: It's
a very good option.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.410
That'd be great.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.910
Maybe even some of
the improvements

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:46.410
you're able to do yourself,
right there to it.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.980
AUDIENCE: Is there
a metric that you

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:53.680
use as far as like what kind
of rental income versus how

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.814
much you put into the house?

00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:57.730
Like you were talking
before about like return

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.820
on investment.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.980
Is there like a
return on investment

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.010
kind of metric you use for that?

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.670
Let's say I think I can get this
much rental income per month.

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.934
And that's a certain
percentage of the total

00:32:09.934 --> 00:32:10.850
that I'm putting down.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.690
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah, and
then again, and Travis,

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.490
you can comment on
this if you'd like to,

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.970
but then again, it's going
to be all personal to you.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:25.010
And also here, location is going
to play a huge, huge difference

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.200
on how that's going to play out.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.290
A duplex in Gilroy can
be a lot different than

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:33.930
that a duplex in Cupertino or
Mountain View or Palo Alto.

00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:38.440
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Any
other live questions?

00:32:41.104 --> 00:32:42.770
GINO BLEFARI: You
know, for a brand new,

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.780
starting out like you are, you
might just want to do the math

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.410
and let's say, OK, our
payment's this amount.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:53.710
And if we rent it for this
amount, and we can afford this.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.600
It almost becomes, like,
what can you afford?

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.040
I remember when I bought my
first house, I was a realtor,

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.200
and my wife was a nurse.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:06.770
And we bought a house,
26 Del Monte in Los Altos

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:11.030
back in 1985 for like $200,000.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:15.480
And I figured out what my
payment, and then we actually

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.960
got a roommate in
one of the rooms.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.920
And with what my wife made,
and what that rent came in,

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.172
we could make it.

00:33:24.172 --> 00:33:25.630
And so that was my
little criteria.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.230
It wasn't anything fancy.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.520
And when it's little, it's got
to be almost customized to you.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.320
Yes, sir?

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.880
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about commercial property.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.500
It seems like one of the
trends that's happening now

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.340
is retail is sort of
under siege, if you will,

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.440
from online services, a lot
of competition from Amazon

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.340
and other places.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.967
So people are mail
ordering things.

00:33:49.967 --> 00:33:51.800
And I'm wondering how
you see that affecting

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.070
the commercial marketplace,
or maybe it's not a problem.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:34:01.180
GINO BLEFARI: You know, I
don't have a good call on that.

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.020
But let me just tell you
it's certainly affecting it.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.550
And I think that's why
we're seeing more and more--

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.410
have you noticed?

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:12.580
You've got retail, and then
you've got units above it.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.534
It's like a mixed use.

00:34:14.534 --> 00:34:19.389
And that probably gets a
little bit of a safer routine.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:25.600
I'm building 16 units right
now, if you go down Winchester--

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.010
on Winchester and Campbell.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.120
After you get past Campbell
Avenue, you go down.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.639
You'll see it going up there.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.154
But it was the same thing.

00:34:35.154 --> 00:34:36.820
And it was kind of
like a personal thing

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:37.736
where you do the math.

00:34:37.736 --> 00:34:41.030
OK, I'm going to have 16
units here that I can rent,

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:44.050
and then you're going to have
some retail like underneath.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:49.159
But it certainly has had its
impact on a lot of things.

00:34:50.687 --> 00:34:52.645
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Any
other audience questions?

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.390
You guys are quiet, wow.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.939
You know, what I enjoyed
about your class was

00:35:01.939 --> 00:35:04.230
that not only did you talk
about real estate investing,

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.370
you also talked about other
businesses you invested in.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:11.192
Can you share any stories about
companies you've invested in?

00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:12.650
GINO BLEFARI: Do
you have something

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:13.680
that you recall from class?

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.763
JORDAN THIBODEAU: There
was a story where you had,

00:35:15.763 --> 00:35:18.270
I think it was your
father-in-law, who

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.049
was a dentist.

00:35:19.049 --> 00:35:20.090
GINO BLEFARI: Oh, got it.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:20.500
Yeah.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.000
Yeah.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.590
That really wasn't
an investment,

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.000
but it's basically, again,
kind of understanding business.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.220
My father-in-law was a
dentist, retired dentist.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:36.830
But he had a stroke, and
so he was in the hospital

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.220
and couldn't be a dentist.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.870
And so we were just
trying to figure out--

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.250
and a check bounced.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.490
You know, [INAUDIBLE]
what was going on there.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.990
Well, what had happened
was the dental practice

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.460
wasn't doing super
well because he hadn't

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.320
raised prices in a long time.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.310
And he hadn't done
the high margin items.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:56.980
And I told this in
my real estate class

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.830
when we were talking about
business opportunities

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.320
and selling business
opportunities.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.010
Because as a realtor, you
can sell a dental practice.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.830
You can sell this.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.050
And somebody had asked,
have you ever sold

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.280
like a dental practice?

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.160
And I said, yeah.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.350
But here's what I did.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:14.780
I went in to the secretary
there, and I said,

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.950
what are your high margin items?

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.380
What makes you the most money?

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:24.780
And she goes, oh, root canals
and the different more surgery

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.950
types of things.

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:28.720
I say, really.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.780
I go, do we have any of
them that we need to do?

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.530
She goes, oh yeah.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.940
We have a lot of them we need
to do because several years ago,

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.910
we got sued by one
customer, which is normal.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.850
And so we just
stopped doing them.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:45.850
So I went up to Sacramento
and found a dentist, a guy,

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:49.780
28-year-old, just out of dental
school and paid him $500 a day

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:55.110
and had the admin
book every root canal

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.410
and whatever else she told
me were a high margin ones.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:03.170
And I can remember made a
pretax profit of $60,000

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:06.660
a month for three months and
then sold, sold the practice.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.830
And if any of you are
over there in Sunnyvale,

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.200
Mike Maher, the
Foothill Medical Center,

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.461
that's who I sold
it to right there.

00:37:13.461 --> 00:37:14.960
Was that what you
were referring to?

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.910
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah,
that was an amazing story.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:16.470
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.428
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah.

00:37:19.009 --> 00:37:20.800
GINO BLEFARI: It's a
business thing, right?

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.240
What do you make
the most off of?

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.880
Well, doing this, OK.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.310
Do you need to do them?

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:26.680
Yeah, OK.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.330
Put them in, and
that's what you do.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:29.371
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.460
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.770
JORDAN THIBODEAU: One
thing here at Google

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.650
is we have a lot of
people who are extremely

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.850
busy with their careers.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:39.300
And so we get solicited by
turnkey investment houses,

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.300
telling us we should go
invest in Memphis or in Ohio.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.480
Do you have any
advice for us on how

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.350
we can go about making
sure that if we're

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.380
going to get into a deal
with these companies

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.310
that we know we're dealing
with reputable people?

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.382
GINO BLEFARI: Do whatever
research you can online.

00:37:57.382 --> 00:37:58.090
Do your research.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.680
But I would just
say, be careful.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.230
Just always, always,
always be careful.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.300
Every time the deal looks
too good to be true,

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.300
it almost always is
too good to be true.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.220
So I would just be careful.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:21.490
And you know, my advice to
you would be get that duplex.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.650
Get that duplex
with your 4% loan,

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:28.930
and put some of your own
sweat equity or whatever in.

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:32.230
And eventually
maybe buy a house,

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.570
and then you still have the
duplex and things like that.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:36.920
So I would just say be
careful because there

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.750
are a ton of scams out there.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:40.820
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.920
Now, in investing in real
estate, one issue I deal with

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.960
is I really like
the Sacramento area

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.560
because I have family up there.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.090
It's within maybe two
hours driving distance,

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:52.460
depending on how fast I drive.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.020
But I want to continue
buying investments in there.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.410
But at the same time,
I feel that I am not

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:59.750
diversifying myself.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.730
Do you ever worry about if
you're investing too much

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.130
in a certain area?

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:07.332
Or is there a way to
kind of hedge that?

00:39:07.332 --> 00:39:08.790
GINO BLEFARI: Well,
there certainly

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.360
is a way to hedge that.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.160
But personally, I
don't worry about that.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.570
Sacramento's working for you.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.810
We've got one guy at
Intero, Howard Bloom.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:20.440
Some of you may
have heard of him.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.880
And he just invested in Texas.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.490
And that's been his plan
year after year after year.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:31.460
Sacramento market kind of
follows our Silicon Valley

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:31.960
market.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.130
If we're real, real good
here, anybody moving there it

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.860
seems like such a great deal.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.110
We have a tendency to
drive their prices up.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.180
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yes.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.220
Yeah, I was working
with a person in HR

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.050
who went to go buy a
house in Sacramento.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:50.290
And the person was surprised
how cheap things were.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.600
And I was telling her,
though, everything's relative

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.920
but going to your fact
that looking at a house

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.610
here for $1.3 million and
then going to Sacramento

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.209
and being able to
get six houses--

00:39:59.209 --> 00:40:00.500
GINO BLEFARI: Exactly, exactly.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.180
JORDAN THIBODEAU: It
changes everything.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.096
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah, or
Chattanooga, Tennessee.

00:40:03.096 --> 00:40:05.140
You know, it's like I'll
take all 13 of them.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.050
And it's like, it's less
than a house in Los Altos.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.050
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.940
You know, that
definitely is true.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.790
Let me see if I can-- oh,
there's a question right there.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.250
Chip, can you pass
the mic, please?

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.914
Thank you.

00:40:18.914 --> 00:40:20.455
AUDIENCE: We talked
about residential

00:40:20.455 --> 00:40:22.370
and commercial real
estate investments.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.710
So I'm curious-- and I guess it
kind of plays into residential.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:30.342
But for vacation rental
properties, with Airbnb

00:40:30.342 --> 00:40:34.170
and a lot of that,
you know, actual work

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:39.250
shifting to the homeowner
instead of an agency,

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.994
do you see that as--
I was curious to get

00:40:40.994 --> 00:40:41.910
your thoughts on that.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:42.872
GINO BLEFARI: OK, yeah.

00:40:42.872 --> 00:40:44.330
I'll give you my
thought on Airbnb.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:45.990
So here's what I did.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:52.140
I went and bought that
townhouse in Irvine.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.910
You probably shouldn't
have me up here

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.380
giving you advice
on how to invest.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.637
I was at a conference
with Deidre,

00:40:58.637 --> 00:40:59.720
my admin right over there.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.230
We had a conference.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:05.860
And I was moving to this
new office in Irvine.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.060
And I didn't know
where it was, so we

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.690
decided at the break,
the 15 minute break,

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.600
to drive over to the office.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.910
So we went out and got
a cab from the little--

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:18.850
we were staying at the Fairmont
there right there in Irvine

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:21.470
and went to the office.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.470
That's cool.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:26.500
And as he's driving out, saw new
condos being built. So I say,

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.300
hey, wait a minute.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.090
Pull in there.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:28.840
OK?

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.630
Pulled in there.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.270
Talked to the guy in there.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:34.530
I said, what do you have?

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.460
I go, do you got
any two bedrooms?

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.690
He goes, yeah, we've got one.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.930
We've got one left in
this space right here.

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.160
I go, OK, where is it?

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.160
And he goes, it's there.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.510
I go, OK, I'll take that one.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:44.810
You know he's like,
you kidding me?

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:48.190
Bought the thing in 15 minutes.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.640
What was the name
of the builder?

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.815
[? Lore ?] or
something like that?

00:41:51.815 --> 00:41:53.190
I forget the name
of the builder,

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:55.610
but they said it was
their fastest sale ever.

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:56.780
So I buy the thing.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.570
And I'm in there, and I
put my little stuff in it.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.670
And I find out, wait
a minute, this new job

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.200
I'm on the road every day.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.370
I'm down in Irvine two
or three days per month.

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:11.250
So now I'm having lunch with
one of the Berkshire Hathaway

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.970
agents there in Irvine.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.530
And we're talking about--
I was coaching her

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.620
on how to do more business,
a relatively new agent.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.810
And she goes, so,
when will you be back?

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.030
This is December.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:28.200
It's December 12th of a year
ago, last year, December 12th.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.490
When we be back, Geno?

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.782
I go, let me check my calendar.

00:42:30.782 --> 00:42:31.281
Mm.

00:42:31.281 --> 00:42:32.870
I won't be back
here till February.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:34.590
I'll be here on the
10th of February.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.170
OK, great.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.628
She goes, so what do you do at
your house when you're gone?

00:42:37.628 --> 00:42:38.726
It just sits there, right?

00:42:38.726 --> 00:42:40.600
She goes, have you ever
thought about Airbnb?

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.030
I go, no.

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.520
And I go, I did try
to rent it one time.

00:42:50.846 --> 00:42:52.470
I wanted to rent it
for $3,600 a month.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.730
I could rent it for $3,300.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:56.280
But they wanted me to take
all my stuff out of there,

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.020
and it's just such a hassle.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.270
And so I didn't want to do it.

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.520
She goes, well, I do
Airbnb for my mom.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.479
I go, really?

00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:03.270
And she goes, yeah.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.436
She goes, I'd do it for you.

00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:06.474
So I go, OK.

00:43:06.474 --> 00:43:07.640
So I just pulled my clothes.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.515
Because I had just sets
of clothes out there.

00:43:09.515 --> 00:43:12.750
I just drove down, pulled
my clothes out there.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:17.010
January, I got a
check for $5,900.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:23.530
This month of July, I'll
make $8,400 on my Airbnb.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:27.930
So I'm a big proponent of
that's pretty darn cool.

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:31.940
I mean, I guess
you can't totally

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.210
do Airbnb at Santana Row.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:35.774
They may have some
rules where you've

00:43:35.774 --> 00:43:36.940
got to have a 30-day tenant.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.260
But I wanted to go out
and buy another place just

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.480
to do Airbnb.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.930
So that--

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.492
AUDIENCE: She
manages all of those?

00:43:43.492 --> 00:43:44.450
GINO BLEFARI: She does.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:46.690
She does.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.710
So she manages the people
coming in, the cleaning lady.

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.740
The place is better
than it ever has been.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.390
And she gets a chance to
meet new clients potentially

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:55.390
as they come in.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:56.290
She does it all.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.550
I pay her a fee to do that,
which is a small fee here.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:05.070
I think vacation rentals, right
on the mainland United States,

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:10.100
probably OK because you can
get people to manage them

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.330
for you at a reasonable amount.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.640
Vacation rentals or short
term rentals are good.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.750
Wherever there is
water, wherever

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:20.710
there's skiing,
wherever-- golf--

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.130
those types of activities.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:24.983
But I was just over in
Hawaii, family vacation.

00:44:27.781 --> 00:44:30.030
We're still in July, so for
the 12th through the 14th,

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.530
I'm in Hawaii, our
traditional family vacation.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.026
I took up with the
Berkshire Hathaway,

00:44:35.026 --> 00:44:37.650
the Travis of Berkshire Hathaway
over there, hook up with them.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.495
And we go out, and we looked
at some vacation rentals.

00:44:40.495 --> 00:44:42.370
Because I thought that
might be kind of cool.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:43.740
Well, here was the thing.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.200
The vacation rental, the
property management-- and this

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.390
is what you'll get when you
go international, same thing.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:52.670
The property management,
they want 50%.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:55.160
Now, I could go outside
to my own Berkshire

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.670
Hathaway, because they have
their own management service,

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:58.582
and they want 27%.

00:45:01.116 --> 00:45:02.490
And a couple of
places where I do

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.050
have property managers like
in Chattanooga, Tennessee,

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:08.320
and even here in Santa
Clara, it's just like 10%.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.140
So that makes it palatable.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.490
But you get that
little thing there?

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:17.362
That Airbnb, though, is
very, very cool, very cool.

00:45:17.362 --> 00:45:18.820
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Now you mentioned

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.180
the commercial investment
that you're talking about,

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.637
the area of dirt, and
how you eventually got

00:45:23.637 --> 00:45:25.520
it rented out from Stanford--

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.490
GINO BLEFARI: Stanford
Medical leased it, yes.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.323
JORDAN THIBODEAU: You
said you had partners.

00:45:29.323 --> 00:45:31.407
How did you go about
structuring the partners?

00:45:31.407 --> 00:45:32.990
GINO BLEFARI:
Structuring the partners

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:37.960
in that particular
one as an LLC.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.920
That's how we were advised.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.421
The only thing is is
you've got to be careful.

00:45:43.421 --> 00:45:45.920
You've got to get a tax guy and
things like that because you

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.080
may need to turn it
into a partnership,

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.210
like a tenant in common, in
order to exchange out of it.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.200
So just be careful with that.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.030
But I started in
an LLC because was

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.980
planning on never selling it.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.320
Turned it into a
tenant in common,

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:05.690
I think, when we had
debt so we could sell it.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:09.990
The Santa Cruz Avenue, 518 Santa
Cruz Avenue, the Intero there,

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.720
that's still an LLC where
I'm like the manager

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.400
as the main guy, as
the manager of it.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.816
And then you have
other people in.

00:46:16.816 --> 00:46:17.940
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.070
GINO BLEFARI: The nice
thing about commercial,

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.440
if you get commercial, the
nice thing about commercial

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:29.430
is that typically the
tenant pays the insurance.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:33.480
The tenant pays for
all the maintenance,

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.199
whatever's late laid out there
in that triple net lease.

00:46:36.199 --> 00:46:37.740
And that's where it
makes it so nice.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.650
The heater goes out.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:42.090
It's like, heater went out.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.290
Your apartment building,
I have eight units

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:47.240
in downtown San Jose.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.180
And the interesting
thing there is every week

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.180
the sink was clogged up.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.790
So I just changed the lease.

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:58.000
Sink clogs, tenant's
responsibility.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:58.800
You know what?

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.700
The sink never
clogged up anymore.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.390
You know, there's just simple,
simple things that you can do.

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:05.390
JORDAN THIBODEAU: It's
magical how that happens.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:07.740
GINO BLEFARI: Yeah,
it's magic, you know?

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.860
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah,
one of my mentors, they

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.890
were one of the part of founding
families of Santa Clara.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:18.529
And his mother actually owned
so much land in Santa Clara

00:47:18.529 --> 00:47:20.320
that she bequeathed
the city of Santa Clara

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.030
so they could build their city
council chambers on her land.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.646
And one part of their
land they rented it out

00:47:25.646 --> 00:47:27.740
to Yoshinoya of Beef Bowl.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.710
They developed the
land, and then they

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.574
paid rent about
$15,000 per month

00:47:31.574 --> 00:47:32.740
and took care of everything.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.590
It was just a sweetheart deal.

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.340
I think we have one
more question, though.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.126
I think it was in the back.

00:47:39.126 --> 00:47:40.780
AUDIENCE: There's
one [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.560
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Oh.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.090
Anyone else?

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:48.150
All right, well, thank you
so much for coming to this--

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.435
GINO BLEFARI: You're welcome.

00:47:48.435 --> 00:47:49.632
JORDAN THIBODEAU: This
is an absolute pleasure.

00:47:49.632 --> 00:47:51.345
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:47:51.345 --> 00:47:52.220
JORDAN THIBODEAU: OK.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:52.810
It was you!

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:54.018
GINO BLEFARI: Oh, it was him.

00:47:54.018 --> 00:47:55.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:56.930
Yeah, I had a question.

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:58.950
So just now you
mentioned you have

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.972
the class about real estate.

00:48:00.972 --> 00:48:04.970
So can you talk a little bit
more about the class too.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:09.790
Do you have any plans to give
the same class in the future?

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.300
GINO BLEFARI: Oh, yeah.

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.380
When I was part of
Intero, and part

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.360
of Coldwell Banker--
and my company

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.480
before that was Contempo
Realty-- when I was here,

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.950
I taught a real estate class
at that community college.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:24.800
That's how we met.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.489
I taught Real Estate
Principles, things like-- see,

00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:29.780
he only remembered the stories.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.170
He didn't remember
there's 640 acres

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.520
in one section of a township
or all these crazy things

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.880
that you have to do to get
your real estate license.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.460
But it's kind of cute.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:38.209
You remember that.

00:48:38.209 --> 00:48:40.670
But no, I don't do that anymore.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.355
That was at the
community college.

00:48:43.355 --> 00:48:44.730
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
And Gino's part

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:47.770
of the reason why I'm here at
Google because he had this time

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:50.490
management sheet on how to
become a better real estate

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:51.430
agent.

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:55.020
And it was just completely
applicable to any career

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:55.780
or any fashion.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.460
And so when I was
TVC here at Google,

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.690
every morning on the bus,
I would read his sheet

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.421
to the point where I
didn't have a digital copy.

00:49:03.421 --> 00:49:05.170
It was eventually just
falling apart on me

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.545
where I couldn't read it
anymore because of all the times

00:49:07.545 --> 00:49:09.100
I'd take it in and
out of backpack.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.470
But it was an absolutely
amazing class.

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:11.210
GINO BLEFARI: You
know, I actually

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:12.460
remember you calling now.

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.300
It's starting to ring a bell.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.230
When you called, that
because it disintegrated.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.760
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.620
GINO BLEFARI: All
it was was 63 points

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.880
on time management that I had
done over 25 years of doing

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.010
real estate, simple
things like when

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:28.690
the subject of the email
changes, the subject line

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.990
needs to change.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:31.940
That saves you some
time right there,

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.090
than going back and forth.

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:36.740
But scheduling yourself
out a year in advance

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.714
is a really cool
thing to try to do.

00:49:38.714 --> 00:49:40.630
And you put everything
in there that gives you

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:43.590
balance first, your days off,
your vacations, your date

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:46.190
nights, things like that,
and then you backfill.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.746
So I do that to this day.

00:49:49.746 --> 00:49:51.620
But yeah, that's what
you were talking about.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:52.570
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yeah,
and then my favorite

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.700
was proper preparation
prevents poor performance.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.450
GINO BLEFARI: Yes.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:57.840
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Yeah, so-- well, oh--

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.280
did you have one more question?

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.290
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Use the
mic so everyone can hear you.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:04.510
And that will be
our last question.

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:05.009
Yeah?

00:50:05.009 --> 00:50:08.470
AUDIENCE: Do you have anywhere
I can find that sheet?

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:10.580
Because on the internet,
I found an article

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.770
about your productivity
beauty tips.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.470
GINO BLEFARI: Oh,
time management one?

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.420
Yeah.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.030
Yeah.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.160
We can connect you to it.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:17.680
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
I'll get a copy,

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.900
and then I'll send
it out to you.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:19.500
AUDIENCE: OK, that
would be great.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:19.860
GINO BLEFARI: Excellent.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.250
Yeah.

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.080
I'd be happy to do that.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.460
JORDAN THIBODEAU: All
right, well, Gino--

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.085
GINO BLEFARI: I also
have a blog that I

00:50:24.085 --> 00:50:26.580
do every Thursday, Thursday
thoughts on leadership.

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:29.250
And I'd be happy to add
anybody to that blog.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.489
It's always got some sort
of message from where went.

00:50:31.489 --> 00:50:34.030
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Well, you've
got one subscriber right here.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:36.260
You can add me.

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.560
Gino, thank you so much
for making time for us.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:38.950
GINO BLEFARI: You're welcome.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:39.550
JORDAN THIBODEAU: We
really appreciate it.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:40.480
It was an excellent talk.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.420
So can we give Gino a
round of applause, please?

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:42.940
GINO BLEFARI: OK.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:43.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.390
Thank you.
