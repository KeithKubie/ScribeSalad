&gt;&gt;Presenter: Welcome everyone to Photographers
at Google. My name is Ricardo Lagos. Iím

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.351
a software developer. Itís my distinct pleasure
to introduce you to our special guest, photographer

00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:17.930
Eric Cheng. Ericís award-winning photography
has been published in over 60 magazines and

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.900
books worldwide. He has won contests such
as Natureís Best Magazineís Photo Competition,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
which placed some of his work in the Smithsonian
Natural History Museum.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.370
Eric is the editor and publisher of wetpixel.com,
the premier online community for underwater

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.890
photographers. Wetpixel provides a forum for
photographers to share their work and to discuss

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.580
ocean-related issues, in turn educating viewers
about the beauty and fragility of the marine

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.690
ecosystem. Ericís work with wetpixel.com
was awarded the prestigious Underwater Imaging

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.070
Website of the Year from the Antibes Festival.
Through Wetpixel expeditions, Eric leads regular

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.560
photography expeditions and workshops around
the world. He has given seminars and lectures

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.600
internationally at events such as TEDx, Boston
Sea Roverís Clinic, DEMA, Digital Shootouts,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.640
Kona Classic, scuba diving magazine events,
and others.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.900
Eric is also involved in ocean conservation,
and is technical advisor and photographer

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.520
for the Sea Shepherdsí Conservation Society.
He was head photographer for the Operation

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.490
Musashi, Sea Shepherdsí 2008 and 2009 anti-whaling
campaign in Antarctica, which was featured

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.760
in season two of the hit TV show Whale Wars.
You can find more info about Eric and his

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.759
photography at echeng.com. Eric, thanks for
taking time to come to Google today, and welcome.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:52.900
[applause]

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.250
&gt;&gt;Eric Cheng: Thanks so much for having me.
That was a very official bio. Itís funny

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.790
because Ricardo told me that in the version
that he sent out to Google, he said something

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.170
like, ìEric was bumming around for a few
years and took some pictures.î [laughter]

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.670
Both are accurate, and I fully own up to both.
Thanks again for having me. I actually started

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.310
out as a software engineer. Twelve years ago,
or I guess even longer now, I worked in a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.110
cubicle. I guess cubes are not in anymore.
But I started out in software.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.959
I discovered photographyóI had discovered
photography earlier than that, but had not

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.090
gone underwater with a camera. So nothing
had ever stuck in the photography realm. It

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.129
was really when I took a camera underwater
that it changed my life. It was the inspiration

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.780
I needed to move my photography beyond something
technical into something that really felt

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.480
like photography. Before, I could take a picture
that was sharp, well-exposed, but it never

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.690
did anything for people. It was missing the
inspiration.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.190
It very quickly changed my life. I worked
as a photographer and publisher for about

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.959
ten years before coming back into industry.
Now Iím at Lytro. Thereís a big Lytro contingent

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.940
over here, on the right side.
I want to talk a little bit aboutójust a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.129
little bit about the gear and technique involved
in photography, but mostly tell stories of--

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:31.310
underwater photography, but mostly tell stories
about specific shots and locations.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:41.130
This is a quick summary of the housing market
out there for cameras. Thereís a huge range.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.290
You can get OEM plastic housings for point-and-shoot
cameras for $150, $180. But in the high ends,

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.409
typically, a full rig for SLR aluminum housings,
machined aluminum housings with strobes and

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:01.311
all the support necessary to hold those strobes
with articulating arms runs $12,000+. So itís

00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:06.970
a huge range.
Up there on theóin the middle is a GoPro

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.260
housing. These are becoming more and more
popular for underwater video and photography,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.830
although until a few months ago, they didnít
focus underwater without third party housings.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.580
I have met film crews out in the field who
have discovered that after the shoot, because

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.689
their, in fact, topside videographers taking
cameras underwater, thinking itís very much

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:33.479
the same. But it is not.
Whatís happening now, as well, is that these

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.780
mirrorless cameras are becoming more and more
popular underwater. Hereís a little line

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.960
up of Nauticam housings. The Sony NEX series
is pretty popular. The NEX 7 in particular

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.719
is really interesting because you can put
magnified obstacle viewfinders to look at

00:04:50.719 --> 00:05:00.190
their very large electronic viewfinder underwater.
This Olympus OMDEM5, easy to remember model

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.490
name, is also really popular. People have
been getting great results with them. So things

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.080
are changing underwater. Typically, a little
bit behind what happens on land.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.180
This is a very old picture of me in the water.
This is from 2003, with my second SLR rig.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.949
It was a Canon D60. Sea and Sea Housing. But
pretty much the anatomy of an underwater rig

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:31.750
has not changed. You have some kind of housing,
a very large dome port for wide angle, for

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.160
the optics thatófor clear, sharp wide angle
shots underwater. Some kind of lighting, so

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.560
in this case, two Ico Light strobes, and articulating
arms. [pause]

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.469
This is a shot thatís a little bit more recent.
Again, the cameras have not changed that much

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.569
in the professional underwater photography
world, still photography world. This is a

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:00.439
Seacam housing with a Canon 1DS Mark III.
[pause]

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:07.819
So one thing that is very specific to underwater
photography is that we basically carry around

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:14.259
mobile studios. Weíre carrying strobes, articulating
arms, and underwater photography is almost

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:21.539
completely manual. We shoot manual exposure,
manual strobes. The idea is basically to expose

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:28.361
to the background and fill the foreground.
Thereís not very much color underwater. Water

00:06:28.361 --> 00:06:33.379
strips out light starting from red all the
way down the spectrum. We need to bring full

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:39.679
spectrum lighting down to get these colors
to pop.

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:44.000
This is a picture taken with a setup like
the one you saw on the previous slide. Itís

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.580
a very wide angle shot taken in eastern Indonesia,
in Raja Ampat. Those of you who are divers

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:56.929
will recognize Raja Ampat as being the place
where the reefs are the best. Itís an incredible

00:06:56.929 --> 00:07:04.939
location. Itís incredibly diverse. In fact,
if you go underwater and count fish for a

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:10.740
fixed amount of time, which is how they measure
diversity, this area has the highest diversity

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.600
of any area in the world, underwater. Thereís
some theories about why this might be. One

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.179
theory is that during the Ice Age, everything
froze over except for this section, and so

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:27.559
the fish survived here and then repopulated
around the world.

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:31.490
Because itís incredibly remote, most of the
diving in places like this are done by Liveabord

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.319
dive vessel. The Liveaboards are usually pretty
nice. This is one that I went on, on the upper

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:45.759
left. The divingís done by tender.
When I started going here, nobody was there.

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:50.729
There were maybe two boats out there. Now,
it is incredibly popular, and is managed as

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:58.539
a national park. But because itís very remote,
and there are dozens of Liveaboards operating

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:01.429
there, you still donít see very many people
when you go.

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:08.429
In addition to really nice reefs, thereís
a lot of marine life here. This is a school

00:08:08.429 --> 00:08:15.150
of baitfish over a reef that looks what a
reef looks like if youíre 20 feet away. So

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:20.340
this is what everything looks like underwater
until you light it. This was really cool.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.939
These baitfish were actually being hunted
by jacks. You can see the whole school moving

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:31.779
as one organism. The action is pretty interesting,
but itís hard to get an interesting picture

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:37.130
from something like this. While itís interesting
to look at, you have to think about how to

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:44.000
get a shot.
In this little ledge there, or a bunch of

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.040
interesting corals, these are really interesting
corals to see under the water. Theyíre very,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.620
very shallow, and particularly interesting
because theyíre in a location where you can

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.399
shoot upwards through the surface of the water
and see some trees. So I played around here

00:08:56.399 --> 00:09:03.490
and took some shots, but I felt like something
was missing. So I went back to that location

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:10.110
and just waited, and I noticed that those
baitfish were moving around a lot on top of

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:18.180
me. So I just waited. I took a lot of pictures.
Eventually, I got the shot that I wanted,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:25.100
which was a shot where the baitfish were above
me, but you could see through the school to

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.241
see some of the surface elements. So this
isó

00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:30.110
&gt;&gt;Male #1: How shallow is it, and is it natural
light?

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.410
&gt;&gt;Cheng: How shallow is it, and is it natural
light? Itís very shallow. Itís like ten

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.931
feet deep. It is natural light in the background,
but strobe-filled in the foreground. This

00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:43.120
is in the shadow of a cliff. So thereís no
light. If you had taken this without, you

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.720
would have gotten just silhouette.
So lighting is really interesting underwater

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.250
because there are a lot of particles floating
around. If you use a flash thatís very close

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.310
to the lens, it lights up all of those particles
between you and your subject. Thatís called

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:01.319
ìbackscatter.î Even though the visibility
was not that great in the shot that I showed

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:06.139
before, you donít see very much backscatter.
Thatís because we light things like this.

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:12.949
This is a picture my friend David Fleetham's
set up. It illustrates how we position strobes.

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:17.879
Where the fall off lighting intersects is
where you want your subject to be. The reason

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:21.541
we do that is so that none of the water between
you and the subject is illuminated, so it

00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:22.930
doesnít ruin your shot.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:33.740
&gt;&gt;Male #2: In this shot, and in the previous
shots, it wasnít very obvious: are your cameras

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.740
neutrally buoyant?

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.560
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Are cameras neutrally buoyant? They
can be made to be neutrally buoyant.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.060
&gt;&gt;Male #2: How about your setup?

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:44.100
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Mine is slightly negative. Historically,
manufacturers have not paid attention to buoyancy,

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.190
and they should. Video housing manufacturers
do pay quite a lot of attention to buoyancy.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:55.640
But if itís too heavy, it becomes very difficult
to hold, so we will typically put closed cell

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:02.129
foam floats on the setup to make it more buoyant
until itís where you like it. If itís totally

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:07.949
neutral, I find that it also becomes difficult
to use for stills.

00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:12.329
So again, hereís the shot from before. You
can see the strobes are really never pointing

00:11:12.329 --> 00:11:16.939
at the subject. Theyíre always pointing slightly
out so the fall off light is what brushes

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:20.710
the subject in front of you. Itís a nice
soft light. And, of course, the choice of

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:26.300
strobe matters. Some strobes have a very hard
edge, and itís hard to use that fall off

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.690
lighting to light your subjects.
So again, the goal is really to expose the

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:36.230
background and to fill the foreground. You
get these nice colors popping in the front,

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:41.600
but a nice dark blue in the background. Cameras
do not exposeóTheyíre not designed to expose

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.170
well underwater, so if you just take a camera
underwater and just take a picture in auto

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:50.060
mode, youíll get a very bright background.
Who knows what youíll get in the foreground.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:57.029
We just fill-- use these strobes to fill.
If youíre in the shallows, you can shoot

00:11:57.029 --> 00:12:02.380
a little bitóYou can use white balance. You
donít need to use strobes as much. You can

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.830
use the strobes to fill as much as you can
for these scenes that have subjects that go

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:13.249
further off. But the strobes that weíre bringing
are actually quite big, but they still donít

00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:18.370
light the reef up for very far. They like
maybe six feet in front of you. We shoot super

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.029
wide. A lot of fisheye.
These reefs are from Raja Ampat, that same

00:12:23.029 --> 00:12:28.100
area. This is one of my favorite shots. Itís
a giant clam in the foreground, reef in the

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.550
background. This school of juvenile convict
fish swimming around. Whatís interesting

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:39.139
is I had gone there the day before, and the
reef had been dead. Same dive, same location,

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:43.320
different time of day. And when the current
picked up, all the fish came out. Itís a

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:51.279
highly dynamic environment. [pause]
This is a shot of a reef called Mikeís Point

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:58.250
in Raja Ampat. Thereís a ton of current flow
through here. These upwellings that feed the

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:05.580
coral. This is what that point looks like
from land. It looks like nothing, really,

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.230
but itís ringed by really incredible reefs.
And, in fact, this little island leaves a

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.260
wake because of the current, and was bombed
in World War II because they thought it was

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:19.731
a boat. [laughter] [pause]
Okay. On the other side of the spectrum, we

00:13:19.731 --> 00:13:24.629
have very, very small things underwater to
photograph. This is the smallest seahorse

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:30.870
in the world, a pygmy seahorse. Thatís one
of my friendís eyes. So you can see it in

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.350
the upper right hand side of the frame. Tiny,
tiny seahorse. Very hard to see. If youíre

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:40.399
over 40, you may never see one in your life.
We have a lot of people who take pictures

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:46.200
where the guide points, and hope itís in
the frame. Thatís not a good way to do it.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.510
[laughter]
That shot was taken in Papua New Guinea. This

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:55.309
is an idea of one of the resorts there. Thatís
Lota Wata Island. We used wheelbarrows to

00:13:55.309 --> 00:14:00.740
get our gear around. We hopped on a boat,
went to Rabaul, and the volcano blew while

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.389
we were there, and covered the reef with ash,
which was very interesting, but not great

00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:10.660
for photography.
This is the typical picture people get of

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:18.150
pygmy seahorses. A macroshot. We typically
use 100 millimeter macrolenses. Sometimes

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.020
with diopters to get even closer. I took a
bunch of these shots. Didnít really like

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:27.399
any of them. Theyíre hard to shoot because
they donít like you. They donít like divers.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:31.430
They donítí like light. So if you get really
close to one and try to take a picture, theyíll

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:36.709
turn away and youíll get shots of themóof
their backs a lot. This picture took a while

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:42.740
to get. I asked a friend to take his mask
of underwater, and just sit in front ofóbehind

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:50.209
this fan. We waited a long time for the pygmy
seahorse to just continue doing its thing,

00:14:50.209 --> 00:14:55.670
until it totally ignored us. Then I was able
to get these shots. So this is that final

00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:00.959
shot.
I like this shot a lot because it shows scale.

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:04.290
Typically, youíll see a full frame shot of
one of these things, and it looks interesting

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:13.389
because itís a bizarre animal, but you have
no idea how big it is. [pause]

00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:19.779
This is another one of my favorites. Itís
unusual. Most people think this is a forest

00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:27.529
scene when they see it, but thereís of course
a fish in there. These corals are less than

00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:35.100
a foot tall, so the scale is deceiving. The
equipment that was necessary to get this was

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.689
a little bit unusual. Itís not used very
often.

00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:45.589
This is the camera setup I used for that.
Itís an SLR, a typical SLR rig. But it has

00:15:45.589 --> 00:15:52.550
this very long lens in the front, which is
pseudo endoscopic. So itís a relay lens with

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:58.199
many, many different elements. I think there
are 18 elements or something. Bad for image

00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:03.269
quality, but great for composition. And so
what happens is you get a fisheye view, a

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:07.680
very, very wide angle view at the end of the
lens. You can focus all the way up to the

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.629
lens. Very unusual underwater. Normally we
use big dome ports for wide angle optics that

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:18.340
prevent you from getting very close to your
subject. Shooting wide angle and macro, close

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:25.059
focus wide angle, is typically very difficult.
We call this the ìinsect eye lens.î I think

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:29.079
in Japan they call it ìbug eye.î So thatís
where that name came from.

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:32.879
This is one of the shots that you can get
with it. If you donít know what these are,

00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:37.829
it might seem like a normal shot. But that
hole in the coral is less than a centimeter

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:43.480
in diameter. And so these are two tiny little
coral hermit crabs shot wide angle from probably

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.200
less than a centimeter away. Then you have
the reef falling off in the background. Pretty

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.059
unusual shots.
Again, these shots were taken in New Guinea.

00:16:54.059 --> 00:16:58.480
But very, very remote New Guinea. These were
taken in a place called the Eastern Fields,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.110
pretty much halfway between Papua New Guinea
and Australia. Itís about 100 miles from

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.569
Port Moresby, and thereís a very large sunken
volcano thatísóI think itís 400 miles in

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:13.189
diameter. But it never breaks the surface,
so treacherous for ships. No boats go there.

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:18.020
Thereís only one dive boat I know that goes
here, and one captain who knows it well. So

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.029
itís pristine.
You can see in this picture here. Itís just

00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:29.430
shallow reefs when youíre above one. Beautiful
water. These are the corals that I was talking

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.380
about. Theyíre very common corals. These
are the kinds of corals you just swim by,

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:39.390
because theyíre so boring. But you can get
a very different view of these corals with

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:45.700
this lens. Specifically, you can insert the
lens under the canopy and get shots from inside

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.690
this coral forest, really.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.541
&gt;&gt;Male #1: So the strobes have to go under
the lens?

00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:55.179
&gt;&gt;Cheng: So the strobesóThe question is about
strobes. The strobe do not go under the lens.

00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:59.720
What Iím doing is putting the strobes on
top of the entireóon top of the corals, and

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.600
looking for holes I canófrom which I can
insert the light.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.010
&gt;&gt;Male #1: So you have them separated? You
donít have them attached to each other?

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.020
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Yeah, the strobes are attached to
the housing by articulating arms, so we can

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:17.830
position them wherever we want. Yeah. [pause]
So hereís the final shot. It looks like this

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:24.091
mossy bank of the left. You can get some other
interesting pictures with this setup. This

00:18:24.091 --> 00:18:29.179
is an Emperor shrimp on a rather large nudibranch.
With a normal macrolens, you canít get the

00:18:29.179 --> 00:18:34.260
depth of field necessary to capture this picture.
You get the head and the rhinophores, or you

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.100
get the shrimp, or you get the tail. Because
weíre shooting super wide angle here, the

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:44.080
depth of field is quite large.
You can also shoot small animals from their

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.960
point of view. These are Coleman shrimp on
a fire urchin. Theyíre shrimp that live on

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.590
a fire urchin. They snip off the spines in
specific areas and live with the protection

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:58.929
of these urchins, which are really nasty if
you touch. These kinds of shots that show

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:04.950
blue in the background and portray these animals
as very laróas potentially being large are

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.580
pretty cool.
These are striped catfish, Plotosus, striped

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:17.190
catfish. Again, shot from their point of view.
They school and feed off of stuff in the sand.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:22.520
You can just get in front of them and stick
the camera in their face. [pause]

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:29.950
And then again, another very common coral.
This is a mushroom coral, or leather coral,

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:35.950
mushroom leather coral. Itís a really boring
coral. But if you get very close, the polyps

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:42.090
suddenlyóthe polyps and the shape can be
very interesting. I took this and posted it

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:47.279
around Valentineís Day, because it looks
kinda like a heart. [pause]

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:53.450
More close-up polyp detail. This is a large
heart coral. Hard to photograph in wide angle

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:59.380
in an interesting way. This shows the alien
landscape.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.270
I have a short video [video starts, water
sounds] of me actually shooting this rig.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:13.010
You can see how the working distance is really
close. Thatís a frogfish, that orange blob.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:25.980
[video playing] This is a flamboyant cuttlefish.
[video playing] Maybe less interesting than

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.980
the frogfish. It just looks like a blob, really.
And these are those Plotosus, striped catfish.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:35.650
You can see the way they move, this is at
night. And Iím putting a red light on, because

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:42.220
they seem to not like the white light. A lot
of animals donít respond much to red light,

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:50.190
because thereís not very much red light down
there. [video playing] [video stops playing]

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:56.450
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Was that on a DSLR, or a different
camera?

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.000
&gt;&gt;Cheng: It was on a DSLR. I mean, the shots
that I was taking, yeah.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.789
&gt;&gt;Male #3: How about the video?

00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:05.980
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Oh, the video. I think they shot
on a camcorder. A friend shot. Yeah, just

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:11.330
camcorder.
Okay, back to wide angle stuff. I think Ricardo

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:16.620
used this picture on one of the events. Itís
a school of scalloped hammerheads taken in

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:22.130
the Galapagos off of Darwin, which is the
northernmost island, which is a place only

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.760
divers go to, because you canít go on land
there. So of course, the Galapagos are very

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:33.190
well known, are very famous for their giant
tortoises, the blue-footed, red-footed boobies,

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:41.580
the northernmost penguins, and marine iguanas.
Albatross, some other stuff too. But underwater,

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.059
it is a fantastic place.
Itís really for advanced divers. The currents

00:21:45.059 --> 00:21:50.220
areócan be pretty interesting there. You
can see bubbles going sideways on that picture

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.770
on the upper left. These bubbles on the right
are bubbles that we exhaled, that are now

00:21:54.770 --> 00:22:00.210
below us. So there are lots of down currents
and weird whirlpool-type things. If youíre

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:07.830
not comfortable in the blue, you shouldnít
go. [laughs] But itís a really great place.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:12.820
I have been there one or two times a year
for many years before I got this picture of

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:19.030
the hammerheads. They donít like bubbles.
They donít like people or bubbles, so typically,

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:23.220
when you get close to them, they just swim
away from you very quickly. So everything--

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:28.350
all the conditions lined up one year. In fact,
this picture in the lower left was taken right

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:33.320
before I got that shot of the school of hammerheads.
Basically, thereís a very, very strong current,

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.440
but there were large boulders we could hide
behind, so we didnít have to fight. But the

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.899
currents would sweep our bubbles away horizontally
away from the hammerheads. And so this large

00:22:41.899 --> 00:22:46.649
school of hammerheadsóIt was also just two
of us. A large school of hammerheads swam

00:22:46.649 --> 00:22:52.130
right above us, and the bubbles were swept
away without disturbing them. So I got this

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:56.710
series of shots. You do have to hold your
breath for these shots, which they tell you

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:57.899
never to do underwater.

00:22:57.899 --> 00:23:01.080
&gt;&gt;Male #1: So the rebreather is not an option?

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.170
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Rebreathers? Rebreathers are an option.
I have never taken them to Galapagos.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.080
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Have you ever taken {inaudible}?

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.221
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Oh. Shops for re-. Yeah. I would
not trust another rebreather. Yeah. Bring

00:23:12.221 --> 00:23:19.390
your own rebreather. The problem with rebreathers
is theyíre deadly when there are accidents.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.730
[laughs]
And so this shot on the lower right is actually

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:26.640
the scatter shot. At the moment the hammerheads
decided they had enough of me, they scattered.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.830
You can see them going every direction.
Most of the scalloped hammerheads here in

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:37.500
the schools are female. They actually joust
for position within the school. And theyíre--

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.320
One of the reasons theyíre there is to be
cleaned by other fish.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:48.150
Incidentally, itís very hard to find hammerheads
now. If you go virtually to any dive site

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.250
in the world, thereís always a hammerhead
point with no hammerheads. The reason is that

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:57.190
they are pretty muchóMost sharks have been
fished out of the ocean for their fins. And

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:02.070
so one thing that I fight against a lot is
shark finning for the purpose of putting it

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:09.450
in shark fin soup. If youíre interested in
sharks, please contact me.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.539
This is really one of the last places on the
planet where you can see large schools of

00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:20.529
hammerhead sharks, another being Cocos Island
and Malpelo off of Costa Rica and Columbia.

00:24:20.529 --> 00:24:23.789
That might be it. Those two places. Only two
places I can think of on the planet where

00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:29.470
you can still see this. [pause]
There are other things in Galapagos underwater.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:35.400
Thereís a healthy turtle population. This
is a green turtle at a dive site called Cousinsí

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.779
Rock. Of course, there are whale sharks too.
This is one of the best places to photograph

00:24:39.779 --> 00:24:45.100
whale sharks. Very large whale sharks, mostly
female. Iíve only ever seen one male whale

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:50.830
shark in Galapagos.
This was one of the only really friendly ones

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:57.260
Iíve ever seen there, who just hung out.
I mean, all of those divers on the surface

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.110
are out of air. What weíre doing is trying
to snorkel around this whale shark whoís

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:06.309
just hanging out and rubbing up against boats,
doing weird things.

00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:10.820
The other thing is: this whale shark would
pick one diver and swim towards it until you

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:16.799
got out of the way or it forced you out of
the way. [laughter] This is our dive guide,

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:19.600
who just couldnít get out of the way fast
enough. Theyíre harmless. Theyó

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.730
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Is he snorkeling? Is he actually
snorkeling?

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.280
&gt;&gt;Cheng: I donít know if he has a snorkel
on, but heís out of air. So heís in dive

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:32.380
gear, but on the surface. Yeah.
So these sharks are the biggest fish in the

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:38.690
ocean. They can get up to around 40 feet long.
They are totally harmless. Theyíre plankton

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:47.600
eaters. Amazing fish to see. [pause]
Some more sharks. This is a lemon shark. It

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:55.650
isóThis was taken in the Bahamas. We call
this sort of shot a ìlemon snap.î Itís

00:25:55.650 --> 00:26:01.549
taken at a very, very close range. That water
line is on my camera. So the water line is

00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:08.400
on the dome port of the camera, and the shark
is a couple inches away.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.360
The Bahamas are one of the best places to
photograph sharks, big sharks. This is the

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.779
boat that Iíve been going on a lot. Itís
called the Shearwater. It goes out of Palm

00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:20.960
Beach. Itís four hours overnight to this
area of the Bahamas.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.000
The trips that I run are very camera-heavy,
of course. We have serious photographers coming

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.210
along, and we typically have a dozen high-end,
very large cameras on these trips.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:38.130
In the lower left you can see the population
of lemon sharks. Itís very healthy there.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:44.740
What we do is sit on this swim step here and
put our cameras in the water. Then we use

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:50.149
hookless lines with a little bit of fish to
attract them to the boat. They donít do this

00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:56.809
anymore, unfortunately, so if you want to
do this, you can now go and use a pole cam.

00:26:56.809 --> 00:27:03.299
This was in the early days when things were
a little more free. [laughs]

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:06.710
So you can see some shots of how weíre getting
these shots. Thatís me in the upper right

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:13.409
hand corner there with the shark coming in.
[pause]

00:27:13.409 --> 00:27:17.130
There are also tiger sharks there. Itís a
really great place to photograph tiger sharks.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:21.821
Iíll show some pictures of those in a minute.
Here are shots of a tiger shark coming in

00:27:21.821 --> 00:27:29.460
on some fish. Again, we use no hooks here,
so thereís no chance of hurting the sharks.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:36.250
[pause]
So for those lemon snaps, that mouth open-close

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:41.980
motion can last a fraction of a second. It
can be very difficult to capture. The trick,

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:47.850
really, is to take a lot of pictures, and
not toócertainly not to retreat, because

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:52.710
the camera is the thing between you and the
shark. If youíre not there, they can sometimes

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.340
swim on the swim step, which is really uncomfortable
for those people around you who have not moved

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:02.679
yet. [laughs] Or I was yelling, ìHold the
line! Hold the line!î because you have to

00:28:02.679 --> 00:28:09.960
make sure that you have a solid line of cameras
there. [laughter] Yeah.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:18.240
Also, we use both acrylic and glass stone
ports underwater. Acrylic isóhas the sameóa

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.230
very similar index of refraction as water
does, so itís more invisible in the water,

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.909
but it scratches very easily. Shark skin will
scratch an acrylic dome port. If a shark brushes

00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:32.610
by your port, it basically goes opaque, and
then you have to polish it off. Glass doesnít

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.169
really have that problem, but if you have
a damóif you damage your glass dome port,

00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:40.290
itís not possible, really, to fix it. Certainly
not in the field. [pause]

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:47.179
So hereís one of my favorite lemon snapshots.
And Iíll show you a few more. It makes them

00:28:47.179 --> 00:28:52.800
look pretty vicious, and so Iím a little
bit torn about sharing these pictures, because

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.539
I donít want to portray them as being vicious.
But I love that they have teeth, and theyíre

00:28:56.539 --> 00:29:03.620
these amazing predators. So itís always thatóItís
always trying to walk that fine line in terms

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.330
of balance. Pretty much, if you see a shark
with small, pointy teeth, itís not dangerous.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:12.190
Small, pointy teeth means they eat fish. Youíre
not on their prey list. If they bite you,

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.700
itís probably because of something you did.
[pause] [laughter]

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.990
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Theyíre swallowing.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.929
&gt;&gt;Cheng: [laughs] So these areóThese sharks
are five to seven feet long. Maybe some eight

00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:43.690
footers. Theyíre not very big. [pause] This
is that moment that they snap their jaws shut.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.950
And some stuff shot later in the day. This
is pretty close to nighttime.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:54.860
&gt;&gt;Cheng: We are baiting them using fishing
lines with no hooks. We tie a little piece

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.460
of fish on. You can see a little bit of water
coming off of the piece of fish on the top

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:02.559
of this frame. Baiting can be a controversial
issue for sharks.

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:10.610
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Are these second curtain sync or
something? That looks like a couple different

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.610
exposures.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.049
&gt;&gt;Cheng: A second curtain sync? Yeah. These
shots are second curtain sync, yeah. But shot

00:30:14.049 --> 00:30:21.900
at the max sync speed. So 1/200 or 1/250.
Yeah. Baiting can be controversial. Many conservationists

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:27.880
do not like baiting sharks in. But I think,
really, the two options are: donít bait sharks,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:34.441
which means you donít get any pictures of
sharks, or video, so you canít share how

00:30:34.441 --> 00:30:38.870
amazing they are to people, and they get killed.
Thatís basically how I see it. Thatís on

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.720
the one side. The other side is: do a little
bit of baiting. Have areas that are very carefully

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:48.360
managed for tourism where people pay. Sharks
are worth much more alive than they are dead.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.820
That has been shown in many, many reports.
Tourism brings in much more money than killing

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:59.740
one shark. [pause]
Okay, hereís anotheróthis is another shot

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:05.929
that is a little bit unusual. Itís the eye
of a tiger shark. Iíve spent a ton of time

00:31:05.929 --> 00:31:12.630
in the Bahamas photographing tiger sharks.
In the Bahamas, we have very clear water when

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:17.789
weíre in with these tiger sharks. Itís very
shallow, and they move very slowly in these

00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:22.169
situations. Thereís not theseóItís not
a place where tiger sharks are ambushing marine

00:31:22.169 --> 00:31:28.429
mammals, so theyíre probably more scavengers
here than they are ambush predators. So we

00:31:28.429 --> 00:31:34.559
really do find that they move very slowly.
You have to be careful, of course, because

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:39.049
they are wild animals. But as you can see,
you can get very close. They are so fixated

00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:43.240
on finding out where that fish smell is that
they just swim around you looking for the

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.710
stuff.
We do know many of these tiger sharks individually

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:54.960
by name. Weíve been photographing some of
them for eight years or so. Some individuals.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.210
Theyíre pretty friendly. This is one of the
on the bottom. Sheís probably one of those

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:05.720
famous tiger sharks. Sheís named Emma. She
has a Facebook page. [laughter] Maybe a Google+

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.570
page, even.
So this is the best place to photograph tiger

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:14.179
sharks. You have lots of opportunity. Iíve
had up to ten around me at a time. Other people

00:32:14.179 --> 00:32:15.830
have had 25 show up.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:19.060
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Is that a shipwreck or something
on the upper left?

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.960
&gt;&gt;Cheng: The questionís about the photo on
the upper left. It is a shipwreck. Itís called

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:27.940
Sugar Wreck, a very shallow shipwreck full
of life, so itís a great place to dive or

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:34.169
snorkel. Although I wouldnít recommend snorkeling
when tiger sharks are around, which weíve

00:32:34.169 --> 00:32:35.169
had happen before.

00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:38.309
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Why? Whatís the difference between
snorkeling and diving?

00:32:38.309 --> 00:32:41.870
&gt;&gt;Cheng: The difference is youíre on the
surface, and sharks pretty much always investigate

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:46.840
anything floating on the surface. So if you
want to get attention from a shark, just jump

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.990
in and float around, and youíll getó[laughter]
There will beóAnd there are sharks around.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.990
Theyíll investigate you. Theyíre not necessarily
going to just attack you, but what they will

00:32:54.990 --> 00:33:01.139
do is bump you a lot. Theyíre very, very
careful. And eventually, they might take a

00:33:01.139 --> 00:33:06.279
test bite if you donít react. So you do have
to be very aware in these situations. You

00:33:06.279 --> 00:33:12.240
have to always face the shark and react. I
mean, I found many times that the sharks almost

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.280
always approach from behind. If you turn around
a look at a shark, thereís a good chance

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.790
itíll turn away. Theyíre very in tune to
where youíre looking.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.160
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thereís a chance of {inaudible}?
[laughter]

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:27.500
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Good chance. Well, no. Iíve tried
pretty hard down there. [laughs] Iíve escaped

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:33.350
without ever having contact. Of course, I
have a large camera between me and the animals.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:40.440
I decided I wanted to get some different shots,
shake things up a little bit. So we have done

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.629
some night dives with these sharks as well.
You can get a nice black background. Then

00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:49.450
what I did was I put a macro lens on.
That shot in the lower right is how you feel

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.830
when you look at the shark. Most shark pictures
are shot super wide angle or fisheye, and

00:33:53.830 --> 00:34:00.620
so you get this looooong serpentine look to
the shark. That is not what they look like.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:05.010
This shot really shows the girth of these
animals. And then as they get closer, you

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:13.000
can start to focus on detail. Some gill detail,
eye detail. This shot is an uncropped shot

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.120
of the eye. If you zoom in a little bit, you
can see the shape of the pupil, even, this

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:26.640
baseball diamond-like shape. [pause]
People feel like tiger sharks-- like they

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.380
communicate more because their eyes are lessótheyíre
a little bit more like ours. If you look at

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.280
a lemon shark eye, it looks very feline. It
looks alien.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.360
Okay, another unusual shot. [laughter] Pigs!

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.790
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Iíve never seen one of those.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:49.000
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Yeah. Domestic pigs that have gone
feral. These are also shot in the Bahamas.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.830
These pictures were taken during a trip to
look for oceanic white tip sharks. White tips,

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.930
which are starting to make the way back in
the ocean. They were almost completely fished

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:02.450
out. In the Bahamas, in the tongue of the
ocean, in the middle where itís really deep,

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:09.250
thereís a population now growing of these
oceanic white tips. Thereís an island there

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:17.220
called Big Major Cay, which has these pigs
living on the beach with babies. So little

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:23.380
piglets there occasionally. The locals feed
them, so theyíll come in and feed them scraps.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:29.830
What the pigs are doing now is swimming out
to the boats that are coming in. And so we

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:35.620
just take cameras in the water and itís a
lot of fun. [pause]

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:42.200
Hereís some behind-the-scenes shots. Theyíre
actuallyótheyíre pretty big, and theyíre

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:48.580
focused. A couple of my friends there put
peanut butter on their cameras. [laughter]

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:58.180
That really draws the pigs in. Yeah. They
can, in fact, swim over you. It hurts. [laughs]

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.620
[laughter]
So this might be the most fun you can have

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:08.440
with a pig, legally. [loud laughter] These
areó[laughs] These are some shots on the

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.370
way to taking this shot, which is one of my
favorite portraits. And, of course, there

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.360
are people in it, so I had to crop them out.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.640
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Whatís the trick to the split
shot?

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.420
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Whatís the trick to the split shot?
The trick is to use a large dome port. The

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:28.930
more surface area you have, the less chop
in the water will affect the shot. Itís also

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:34.220
toóDepending on the material and how old
the dome port is, water will sheet differently.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:39.450
These shots were almost all taken with water
completely covering the dome port. I dipped

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:45.890
the dome in the water, and I pulled it out
of the water. Before it beads, I take a picture.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:50.330
Some people have managed to figure out ways
with their dome ports to make it completelyó

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:51.330
&gt;&gt;Male #1: {inaudible}

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.080
&gt;&gt;Cheng: The coating isóPeople use spit,
and they use baby shampoo sometimes. Iíve

00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:00.180
seen {raynecks} attempted, which does not
work because it beads most of the water off,

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:05.070
but then it leaves lots of little beads, which
show up. I find that the way Iíve been most

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:09.980
successful is by using clean glass dome ports
that have not been etched by diesel. Diesel

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:14.800
will etch these dome ports if you leave them
in the bottom of the tender of a boat. The

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:19.690
water in there has some gas and some fuel
in it. That, I found, has been pretty disruptive

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:22.060
to glass. There are a lot of tricks.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.160
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Why not acrylic?

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.850
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Why not acrylic? I just havenít
had as much luck with acrylic. I feel like

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:32.270
it doesnít sheet as well for some reason.
Iím not sure why. Maybe a brand new acrylic

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:37.260
port thatís super smooth could do it. You
can get them with both. The best way is just

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.490
to keep it dry. Keep the top half dry if you
can. If itís totally smooth water, you can

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.280
dry it off and then be very careful about
your shot. But very often, weíre floating,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.930
and just come up from a dive, and youíre
shooting a split. So you have to work with

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:57.440
what you have. [pause] [man coughs]
This is another whale shark, another split

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:05.520
of a whale shark shot. This is a whale shark
feeding. Itís in Isla Mujeres in the Gulf

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.380
of Mexico, just off the Yucat·n. This is
happening right now. In fact, Wetpixel has

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.230
a trip running right now. Yesterday, they
reported between three and four hundred whale

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:20.880
sharks on the surface. Whatís happening hereóAnd
this town, by the way, is fantastic. If you

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.840
hate Cancun, you will love Isla Mujeres. [laughter]

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.450
&gt;&gt;Male #1: What is it called again?

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:31.310
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Isla Mujeres. This is a place. Itís
a little island off of Cancun that feels still

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:35.270
very local. This is the touristy strip, so
itís not that bad, and even in the tourist

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:40.160
strip. But if you go a couple blocks of, it
still feels very local. Everybody drives golf

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.360
carts around. There are a lot of tourists
on the island, but itís a nice feel.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:51.290
But whatís great is itís very close to this
whale shark aggregation every summer. On permit,

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:56.160
these boats go out and look for these whale
sharks that are feeding out there. This is

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.460
a shot. Each one of those fins is a whale
shark.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:03.470
The average length of a whale shark here,
according to some of the scientists there,

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:09.750
is about 7 meters. So 24 feet, something like
that. There are, of course, some that are

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:15.450
much larger, and a few that are much smaller.
But this is the largest known concentration

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:22.880
of the largest fish on the planet. [pause]
Itís really an incredible place. This were

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.900
taken from the tuna tower of the boat. If
you get lower, you can shoot multiple shark

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.980
fins in one shot. But really, itís great
for underwater photography. Of course, you

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:38.570
have unlimited opportunity to take pictures
of whale sharks here. Every minute or two,

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:43.030
a whale shark will just swim by you. If youíre
not paying attention, it might even hit you.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:48.040
Itís pretty incredible.
And these sorts of silhouette shots are done

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.140
by free diving down and then swimming so the
shark is between you and the sun. Thereís

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.380
the added bonus that this oneís pooping [laughter]
which always makes for a better shot.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.410
&gt;&gt;Male #9: So you said Wetpixel runs this
trip every year?

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:04.840
&gt;&gt;Cheng: We run this tripóWetpixel runs this
trip every year. There are some other organizations

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.230
that do as well. If youíre more casual about
how you want to approach it, you can just

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.820
go to Isla Mujeres and get on a tourist boat,
which would give you half an hour on the water,

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.950
or so. Yeah. Itís not as good for photography,
but itís a great experience and itís much

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:19.980
cheaper.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:24.483
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Why did you say ìfree divingî?

00:40:24.483 --> 00:40:29.060
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Free diving. Youíre not allowed
to scuba dive here, so it isóAnd really,

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.120
if youíre diving, you canít swim. If you
have all that gear on, itís very hard to

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:37.150
swim. So itís a much better experience by
snorkel and free dive.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:44.590
These are shots of whale sharks feeding. These
were taken of sharks when theyóTheyíre called

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:48.800
ìbotellasî, like a bottle. They float like
this: vertical with their mouths open on the

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:54.340
top, and just gulp in all the plankton they
can. They just spin slowly. If youíre very

00:40:54.340 --> 00:41:00.100
careful, you can get close and shoot right
down their mouths here. [pause]

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:07.110
This is what theyíre after. These are tiny
eggs, or little bonito-like tuna. These guys

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:14.080
are spawning there at every full moon. So
the sharks are in the area waiting, and when

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:19.050
it happens, they aggregate in groups of hundreds.
And hundreds are what you count on the surface,

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:26.960
so it may be that there are many more. [pause]
Yeah, itís great. You haveóWe have six hours

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:36.020
a day to take pictures of these sharks. You
can get pretty creative. [pause]

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.520
There is a random picture in here. Oh, it
went away. Okay. Here, this is a video of

00:41:40.520 --> 00:42:00.340
[pause] [video starts playing] of me swimming
around. [jaunty video music playing] [video

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:18.480
stops playing] So that gives you an idea of
how many there are. This was shot in one take.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:28.560
Eleven whale sharks went by. [pause]
Okay. This is another shot. I call this one

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:33.400
ìinterspecies encounter.î This is actually
in the talk that Ricardo embedded on the Google

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.830
Events. So if you want more information about
this shot and this area, you can go check

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:45.380
that out. But this was taken off of Dominica
in the Caribbean. Itís a place known for

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:51.480
its sperm whale population. There are a couple
pods of sperm whales off the coast here, which

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:58.250
are all very well studied by scientists. They
know each of the whales individually. Photographers

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:02.550
can get permits, as well, to get in the water
with them there. Marine mammals are pretty

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:08.420
well protected, so if you want to get in the
water with a whale, you have to be on permit.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:14.641
We use hydrophones to find these whales. Sperm
whales make a lot of noise. They click. They

00:43:14.641 --> 00:43:19.960
have, in fact, a coda for just certain populations,
so you can tell which population of whales

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:26.210
from by the pattern that they use to greet
each other. They use very loud noises at depth,

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:30.940
1000 meters down when they feed. They have
specific feeding noises, and so you can track

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:36.780
them as they move around on their dives, which
are typically 45-50 minutes long. Then when

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.890
they come up, hopefully youíre in the right
place.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:46.140
We got really lucky there. There were a lot
of sperm whales socializing. These sperm whales

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:51.690
were rubbing up against each other. Theyíre
rubbing dead skin off of each other. It was

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.640
really spectacular to be able to get up so
close to them.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:00.750
I think theyíre the largest carnivore on
the planet? In theory, the males can get up

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:09.340
to around 60 feet long. They have teeth. These
are mostly juvenile males and females of all

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:16.400
ages. Again, because they were soóThey just
basically ignored us here. You could take

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:20.750
some more interesting shots instead of just
going for whatever shot you can get. So I

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:25.290
shot splits, these vertical splits, and then
I dove down to their heads to try to get shots

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:35.830
of them hanging in the water upside down.
This is also on snorkel, on free dive. [pause]

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:43.230
More shots here. The one on the left is--
That little piece there, of red, is actually

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:49.760
part of a squid arm, which is what they feed
on. This one in the middle is a juvenile about

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.400
to do a tail slap on the surface. Youíve
seenóIf you go whale watching, youíll see

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.600
tails come out of the water and slap. Thatís
what it looks like underwater.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:05.452
And then this one on the right may be nursing,
although thatís unconfirmed. And I donít

00:45:05.452 --> 00:45:13.050
think anyone knows how sperm whales nurse.
It could be like this. Who knows? [sighs]

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.760
If only marine mammals researchers worked
with photographers.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:23.330
Now, this whale is named Scar. He wasóthis
is maybe three years ago-- at the time around

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:28.220
ten years old, and was the friendliest of
the bunch. Heís been interacting with humans

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:34.370
for his entire life. This whale would literally
just come in and get right in front of you.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:40.190
In fact, you could swim inóYou had to swim
away from this whale to get a picture of it.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:47.590
[light laughter]
This is the guide who knows Scar the best.

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:53.120
I would never advocate swimming up to a whale
and touching it, but this whale, Scar, actually

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:58.230
closed his eyes. You can see his eyes there
that are closed. And then all of us went in

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:07.010
and just rubbed him down. It wasóWe couldnít
resist, really. [pause] Pretty incredible

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.010
encounter.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:14.470
&gt;&gt;Male #1: One of your G+ posts said that
he disappeared last year.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:20.030
&gt;&gt;Cheng: The question is about whether heís
still there or not. I have not seen any recent

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:24.420
pictures of Scar. They do leaveóMales leave
the area where they grew up when they get

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:28.560
to a certain age, and they go to the polar
regions to then hunt and eat until theyíre

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:34.020
much larger and they come back to breed, to
mate. Iím not sure whether heís still there.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.290
People are still going there, because itís
still a really great place to getóa lot of

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:44.080
film crews are there to get footage of sperm
whales. But Iím not sure if heís still there.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.790
[pause]
I like this shot because it just shows that

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:56.140
moment of connection between whale and human.
I have a little bit of video of the sperm

00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:05.600
whales, as well. This was taken with a Canon
5D Mark II. [video starts playing] [water

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:09.660
sounds] One of the great things about the
cameras now is that you can instantly start

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:16.480
shooting video if you see something that is
better captured that way. [video continues

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.960
playing] [tapping and clicking sounds] This
is natural light. Theyíre really too big

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:29.340
to light up with strobes. [video continues
playing] All these sounds are from the whales,

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:37.440
and that tapping, that pattern, that pattern
is the pattern that this group uses. [video

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.300
continues playing]

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:44.270
&gt;&gt;Male #10: How easy is it to control the
camera?

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:48.370
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Itís really easy to turn it on.
Itís hard to ensure that youíre in focus.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.580
We pretty much prefocus these. Theyíre shot
so wide, Iíll focus on my fin [video stops

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:56.710
playing] and just stop down. But theyíre
also hard to hold steady. Dedicated video

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:01.270
cameras are designed to be held steady, and
the housings have a lot of mass, so itís

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:05.610
hard to shake them. But an SLR housing has
two handles on the side, so if you just move

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:11.360
a little bit, it shakes. It takes a lot of
practice to shoot smoothly. I think itís

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:20.020
impossible to have a shot that looks like
it was completely smooth with an SLR.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:25.080
I think thatís all the pictures I have to
show today. I do have-- This portfolio link

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:31.371
goes to my Google+ page where there are 300
pictures uploaded. And, of course, Wetpixel

00:48:31.371 --> 00:48:37.790
is a site for those of you who are interested
in underwater photography. I think we have

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:38.790
time for some questions. Do we? Yeah.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.360
&gt;&gt;Male #11: Do you do any diving in Monterey?

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:47.450
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Do I do any diving in Monterey? I
do some diving in Monterey, but not as much

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:51.960
as Iíd like to. Iíve actually done more
diving in Alaska than I have in Monterey.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.760
But itís right here, and itís incredible.
Itís some of the best cold water diving in

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.000
the world. In fact, this weekend, thereís
a big shootout in Monterey, where people go

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.740
and compete in a photo contest. There is a
film festival where Iíll be speaking as well.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.740
Yeah. Other questions?

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:13.821
&gt;&gt;Male #12: I want to know about the radio
triggers for the flash.

00:49:13.821 --> 00:49:20.250
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Radio triggers for the flash? We
donít use radio triggers. We use either electrical

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:30.400
sync cords or optical sync. You have to trigger
the camera somehow. For a while, when digital

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:35.280
cameras came out, underwater photographers
lost the ability to use TTL, because everyóThat

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:40.460
went D-TTL and i-TTL, and Canon went E-TTL.
And none of the underwater strobe manufacturers

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:45.140
could catch up. So we shotóAnd thatís when
I started shooting. So we pretty much shot

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:48.710
manual. Everything was manual.
But I find, in general, all you need is a

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:53.460
signal to fire the strobe, because if you
rely on TTL, especially for macro, and you

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:58.270
have more than one strobe, the pictures end
up looking really flat. The idea is to think

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:03.790
about shadows. Shadows are the most important
thing for underwater macrophotography. You

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:08.390
always want to think about where that shadowís
going to be cast. Since so many animals underwater

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:13.660
are totally camouflaged, the best way to cut
them out of the environment is to make them

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.500
cast a shadow on their host.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.220
&gt;&gt;Male #13: So youíreó

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.950
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Oh, go ahead.

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:27.490
&gt;&gt;Male #13: What do you think is your most
dangerous encounter ever? Anything youíve

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:28.490
ever been close to?

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:30.290
&gt;&gt;Cheng: [laughs] My most dangerous encounter
ever? I donít think my most dangerous encounters

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:36.040
have been wildlife related. [laughter] Itís
mostly been in a situation where youíre in

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:40.790
a very high current environment and youíve
pushed yourself somehow. Iím too deep, Iím

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:44.510
in deco, I donít have much air left, and
all I can see are my bubbles streaming off

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:50.060
into the blue when Iím ready to let go to
go do a safety stop where you drift for three

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:54.760
to five minutes, plus deco time. So there
have been some moments like that that are

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:59.510
very visceral memories where Iímómy back
is to the current, and Iím just staring at

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:03.780
my bubbles going down, and thinking, ìOkay,
this is going to beóI hope the boat follows

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.040
me.î
So there were some moments like that. Luckily,

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.390
Iíve never had anything truly life-threatening.
I think most of my friends who have been doing

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:16.400
this for a long time have been bent or have
had some kind of serious malfunction. Their

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:24.131
first stage blows off their tank or something
really disastrous. The only realóThe only

00:51:24.131 --> 00:51:30.880
lethal incidents, at least, amongst my friends,
have involved rebreathers. They have a rebreather

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:36.100
accident and they die. Or the occasional surf
photographer can get smashed in the coral.

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:40.670
So there are just a fewóSometimes, there
are really unfortunate events, especially

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:44.480
rebreather stuff. Even really experienced
rebreather divers can have accidents like

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.300
that. Itís less forgiving than open circuit.
[pause]

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.470
Other questions?

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:53.880
&gt;&gt;Male #1: So have you done much rebreather
diving at all?

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.550
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Iíve done some rebreather diving.
I donít own one, but I typically will dive

00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:01.480
it in Papua New Guinea where thereís a boat
that I go on that has them.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.900
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Why is that? Why only there?

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.360
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Itís mostly that I just donít own
one. I havenít invested in one.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.170
&gt;&gt;Male #1: And you think theyíre dangerous.

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.880
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Well, I think if you donít use them
a lot, if youíre not very comfortable with

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.710
them, they can be dangerous. I love them.
I mean, rebreathers, for those of you who

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:22.950
donít know, are fully closed circuits, so
they scrub the CO2 out of what you exhale,

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:30.050
and inject a very small amount of oxygen into
the system. Itís bubble-free. Almost everything

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:35.650
underwater is afraid of bubbles. If you ever
go underwater and hold your breath or are

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:40.530
on a rebreather, divers make a ton of noise.
You can hear divers long before you can see

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:45.330
them, in the water. It affects the wildlife.
You can immediately see the fish start hiding.

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:49.180
With every exhalation, if you have someone
on scuba whoís taking video, you can watch

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:53.760
the fish pulse in and out as they breathe.
With a rebreather, you just donít see that.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:58.260
And the other benefit of using a rebreather
for photography and videography is that as

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:02.200
you breathe, your buoyancy does not change,
because thereís a counterlung. You exhale

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:06.370
into the counterlung, so the amount of air
stays constant. With open circuit, every time

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:10.890
you inhale, you start to float, and every
time you exhale, you start to sink. That makes

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:16.940
it really hard to hold a camera steady. So
rebreathersóMost serious videographers will

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:18.790
shoot on a rebreather. [pause]

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:25.440
&gt;&gt;Female #2: You talked a little bit about
sharks. I was wondering if youíre doing anything

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.720
in terms of awareness to the concentration
of those sharks?

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:31.030
&gt;&gt;Cheng: The questionís about awareness and
conservation around sharks. I work really

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:36.030
closely with an organization called Shark
Savers, which is a conservation organization

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:48.051
dedicated to policy and awareness around shark
finning and how unsustainable it is. Most

00:53:48.051 --> 00:53:54.320
of the direct action happens in the Chinese-speaking
world, so mostly Hong Kong, China, Taiwan.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:00.090
But a lot of the fundraising happens here.
So yeah, I think most people are afraid of

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:04.800
sharks. Thereís that fallout from Jaws, and
a lot of the media we see. Shark Week is coming

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:10.530
up. Shark Week is usually 90 or 95% sensationalist
stuff about sharks. ìTop 10 Most Dangerous

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:14.990
Sharksî, that kind of thing. Weíre working
directly with them to try to influence programming

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:21.940
as well, and to see how much we can get them
to publish real facts around sharks. I mean,

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.550
thereís an average of five people killed
a year by sharks, but you hear about every

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:29.760
one of those, maybe more than once. It feels
like people are being killed by sharks all

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:34.790
the time, but in fact, youíre probably more
likely to die from just about anything else.

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:38.630
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Are you making any {inaudible}
policy?

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:45.460
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Iím not directly involved in a lot
of theóin the policy stuff, but what we noticed

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:50.360
in the last few years is that a lot of countries
and states are now banning shark fins. California

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:57.130
banned shark fin. This is the last year. You
canít buy it anymore if you own a restaurant,

00:54:57.130 --> 00:55:01.430
but you can still serve it this year. Weíre
finding a lot of legislation, now, to ban

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:08.530
shark fins. But mostly, it has to happen in
Asian, high-density Asian areas, so mostly

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:11.240
in Asia.
And itís already starting. The Chinese government

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:16.080
said they wonít serve it anymore at official
government events. A lot of celebrities in

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:22.160
Hong Kong, Taiwan, China are now speaking
out against it. Itís really an education

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.050
thing. When most people learn about whatís
involved in making a bowl of shark fin, which

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:30.210
is basically finning a shark and throwing
away the body and keeping the fin, because

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:34.930
itís so much more valuable, theyóespecially
the younger generationóis very much against

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:45.710
it. So hopefully, people will have their minds
changed before sharks are gone. [pause]

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:47.100
Questions?

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:51.230
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Are animals sensitive to light?

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:52.570
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Are animals sensitive to light?

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.360
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Yeah, are they scared by light?

00:55:54.360 --> 00:56:00.610
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Yeah. Most animals are affected by
light in some way. This is all, again, highly

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:04.900
controversial as well, because, I mean, if
you image a giant strobe flashing in your

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:10.750
face if youíre a pygmy seahorse, it could
be very distracting. [laughs] But having said

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:15.070
that, Iíve seen pygmy seahorses feeding while
theyíre being photographed, so sometimes

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:22.140
theyíre not affected. I think theyíreómost
things will just run from things that are

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:27.730
notóthat are scary. Theyíll typically try
to get away from you, just as a diver, regardless

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:32.690
of your lights. But sometimes, you get one
shot, and that first strobe flash will make

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:37.670
the animal run.
We do use red lights a lot at night. We find

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:42.880
that many animals are less sensitive to red
light, presumably because thereís no red

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:47.230
light down there. So any animal thatís red
is probably trying to hide, because thereís

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:51.400
no red light. [pause]
Questions?

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:57.030
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Do you shoot more landscapes,
like not animals stuff?

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.030
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Do I shoot landscapes underwater,
oró

00:56:58.030 --> 00:56:59.030
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Yes, or {inaudible}?

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:06.780
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Oh, okay. Yeah, I shoot a lot of
reefscapes, reef scenes that are colorful

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:11.680
and show that thereís a lot of life in the
water. And the occasional interesting topography,

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:17.550
like crevices and a little bit of cave stuff.
Wrecks are really artificial reefs these days.

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:21.320
If you sink a ship and leave it for any amount
of time, it will collect a huge amount of

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:27.650
wildlife around it. Some people are interested
in the wrecks for historical context, and

00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:32.950
they want to go find the bell or swim through
the grand ballroom, but I really like wrecks

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:37.820
because they collect a lot of wildlife. In
some wrecks, in fact, you canít see the wreck.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.020
It is completely covered in coral and fish.

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.931
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Do you have to be super far away?

00:57:42.931 --> 00:57:46.390
&gt;&gt;Cheng: You have to be super far away to
photograph and entire wreck, yes, typically.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.730
And there are some photographers who specialize
in that. Theyíll go down 300 feet with a

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:55.990
heavy tripod and plant themselves in front
of a giant wreck, taking long exposure stuff

00:57:55.990 --> 00:58:00.740
in the dim light. And then theyíll decompress
over hours going back to the surface.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:09.051
&gt;&gt;Male #15: Have there been any species that
have been particularly elusive for you to

00:58:09.051 --> 00:58:10.051
photograph?

00:58:10.051 --> 00:58:15.700
&gt;&gt;Cheng: Species that have been elusive? Yeah,
certainly. We went looking for sperm whales

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:19.590
in Japan, and we hadóOne of my friends and
I were the first to photograph sperm whales

00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:25.720
eating giant squid. But the giant squid is
the classic elusive animal that no oneís

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.650
really photographed. Thereís a little bit
of video on the surface of one alive, and

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:33.590
thatís it. I would say that as a scuba diver,
itís not realistic to think that I would

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:38.190
ever see a giant squid alive, because they
live at 1000 meters. Yeah.

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:42.990
But there are a lot of animals Iíd like to
see. Iíd love to do a Humboldt squid. Theyíre

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:50.390
a five to seven foot squid on the California
coast near Mexico into Baja California. And

00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:55.640
thereíre just schools of squid that can beóthat
flash, and theyíre really cool.

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.640
Are we done?

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.510
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Weíre done. Weíre out of time.

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:00.220
&gt;&gt;Cheng: [laughs] All right. Okay, thanks.

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:02.510
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Thanks, Eric, for coming to Google.
