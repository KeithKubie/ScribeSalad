00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.950
After you've developed, tested,
and launched a great app,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.910
your next biggest challenge
is to grow a valuable audience

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.680
of interested users.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.960
Hi, I'm Frederic from
the Google Play Team.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.680
With new tools in the Google
Play Developer Console,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.260
we're making it
easier to understand

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.730
the performance of user
acquisition channels,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.680
and we are making it possible to
acquire new users across Google

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.920
networks.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.950
Imagine you've developed
a racing game called RPM.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.990
Your beta testers loved it.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.940
And so you launched
publicly on Google Play.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.140
Once users started
downloading your app,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.380
you start asking yourself
important questions.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.860
Where are the users coming from?

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.910
How did they hear
about the game?

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.100
What prompted them
to install it?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.610
And which of these users
are most likely to make

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.810
an in-app purchase?

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.150
You can now find answers
to these questions

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.780
in the user
acquisition performance

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.850
report in the Google
Play Developer Console.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.320
For new user acquisition
performance reports

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.190
summarizes how users discover
your app and spend money.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.070
You can find out how many users
visited your store listing

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.970
page, installed the
app, and eventually made

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.800
one or more purchases.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.220
Looking at this information
on your user funnel,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.320
you can choose areas
to optimize or plan

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.090
store listing experiments to
explore different options.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.500
For getting Discovery
Channels, we

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.390
show traffic coming from
the Play Store and outside

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.990
of it, such as users finding
your app via Google Search.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.000
And if your marketing gurus are
using UTM tags on their links,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.300
the performance report
also tracks those

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.000
and will tell you exactly
how each of your channels

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120
are doing.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.760
Now that you know where
users are coming from,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.450
you want to start
acquiring new users, which

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.410
is critical to your success.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.270
There are many ways
to acquire new users.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.240
One common way is to
pay for app install ads.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.580
That's where the new universal
app campaigns come in.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.150
They are the easiest way
to promote your Android

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.170
app to interested users
across Google Play, Google

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.389
Search, YouTube, and the
Google Display Network.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.070
You can do this directly
from the Developer Console.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.690
It takes just a few clicks
to get a campaign up

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.570
and running within your budget.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.290
Let's see how it
works in practice.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.600
When you open the Developer
Console, navigate to your game

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.460
and select the User
Acquisition tab.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.820
From there, choose to
create a new campaign.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.940
The ad creation form
is already pre-filled

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.660
using the existing
place to listing assets,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.250
like your app icon, short
description, and promo video.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.520
If you want, you can tweak with
promotional messaging a bit.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.700
All that's left is
choosing a maximum budget

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.230
and how much you're willing
to pay for an install.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.470
If you're publishing
your game globally,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.590
you know that each market
monetizes differently.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.980
Cost per install might be
different between the United

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.520
States and Spain, for instance.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.740
We recommend that you
explore what cost per install

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.340
makes sense in
each country you're

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.130
targeting on Google Play.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.330
And also think about how much
you earn from the typical user

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.700
in each country.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.240
It's important to experiment
with your cost per install

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.520
to see how it affects
the number of conversions

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.640
that your campaign generates.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.050
After completing
the form, that's it.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.880
The first app promotion
campaign for RPM is ready to go.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.270
Google Play will run a
fully automated campaign

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.290
across Google networks.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.330
This includes Google.com web
search, AdMob on Google Display

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.900
Network banners and mobile apps,
video placements in YouTube,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.270
and even search ads in
the Play Store itself.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.980
We do the hard
work to figure out

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.440
which ad placement
works best for your app

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.970
and which users to target.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.720
Zero optimization work for you.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.920
It's why we call these
universal app campaigns.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.080
It's the fastest way
to start advertising

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.020
your app with Google.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.190
With the performance report
you can understand and optimize

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.780
your acquisition channels,
whether organic or paid.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.190
And with universal
app campaigns you'll

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.769
be able to find users interested
in your app in no time.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.910
Next you should
check out our video

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.950
in Store Listing Experiments.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.880
You will learn how to run AB
test on your Play Store listing

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.790
and increase your installs.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.790
This could multiply the
effect of all your user

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.110
acquisition efforts.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.670
Thanks for watching.
