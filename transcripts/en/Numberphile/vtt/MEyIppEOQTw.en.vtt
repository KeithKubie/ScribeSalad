00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800
[electric whizzing noise]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.880
[happy smile from Cliff Stool]

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.860
Let me use a yard stick, to add and subtract.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.180
Really I am going to use a meter stick, to add and subtract. But...

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.060
Let me talk to the Americans for a moment.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.740
5 plus 4 is 9.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.500
Watch this.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.200
5...

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.340
...plus 12...

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.840
...is 17!

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.380
And...

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.580
...I can say "oh".

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.700
"7..."

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.220
"...plus..."

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.220
"...13 is 20!"

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.260
It adds and subtracts.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.740
I'm not telling you anything new.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.300
What about multiplying and dividing.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.900
[sighs]

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.060
There we go to logarithms.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.080
:O

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.420
Logarithms!

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.620
I can hear people say "Oh, I hate logarithms. I hate it! Oh oh oh oh!

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.800
Logarithms: common logs were created so that instead of multiplying big numbers.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.640
751 times 982...

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.740
; ･`д･´

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.340
What you would do is you take the logarithm of 751,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.160
add it to the logarithm of 982, to get the logarithm of...

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.980
...something else, the answer.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.580
Look up the anti-log of that, the backwards log of that, to get the result.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.960
So, instead of adding and subtracting numbers

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.920
on these 2 meter sticks.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.540
If I replaced these with logarithmic sticks, I can multiply and divide.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.500
So, I've got a pair of meter sticks where I've covered up a couple numbers with the log of that number

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.060
The logarithm of 2 is 0.301

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.520
So, I'm gonna cover up 0.301 with 2.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.600
I'm gonna cover up 0.301 with 2.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.800
Well, the logarithm of 3 happens to be 0.48, more or less.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.880
Now cover that up.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.560
Look at this!

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.200
Instead of being nice and linear like this!

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.240
All the numbers squeeze up over here!

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240
That's the way logarithms work.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.560
Big numbers!

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.480
Squash up over here.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.440
In the real nice end, lazy out here.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.000
Let's see what we've made here.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.660
I know that I can add distances, lets try it now.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.580
Here's the number 2, here's the number 2.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.360
Oh, 2 times 2 is 4!

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.060
2...

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.720
...times 3 is 6.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.240
3 times 3 is 9.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.520
It's multiplying!

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.240
Brady, come on over here, check this out. Instead of having a ruler like this.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:03:02.120
Notice how, it's a ruler like here. Here's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and over here is 10 if you really wanna push on it.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.280
So here's the slide rule, and this scale over here. The D scale is the important one.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:24.640
Oh, π is hiding. Woah hey, there's our friend π. But this one also has 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:33.520
Let me throw these sticks away and I'm only gonna look at these 2 scales here. The C and the D scales.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.160
Let's just look at those. Let's go one step further, let's use this cursor.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.200
2 times 4 is 8.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.680
Okay, no surprise there. In which [we] now go in-between numbers. Let's try something a little bit more cool.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.240
2 times...

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.960
2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3. Okay, let's say 2 times 2 and a half.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.560
2 times 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5. Look at that.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.840
2 times 2.5 is... almost exactly 5!

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.120
Let's look at between 1 and 2, there's all these extra numbers.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.160
1.5 is over here but they didn't write the 1!

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.640
A piece of tape.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:45.040
1.1, 1.2, 1.3... 1.9, 2, 2.1... 2.8, 3.0

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.080
There's pi!

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.640
1.2 times 2 is...

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.520
2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4! Okay, it works!

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.640
1.25

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.200
1.25 times π is...

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.440
3.92, about..

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.520
I'll give it just a smidgen, right in here to...

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.400
So, why do I even bother owning a calculator? Well...

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.040
This is nice, it's sits next to me. You know I can, when I sit in here in my desk.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.120
I can multiply, using a calculator.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.280
So...

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.280
Like everybody else, I'm fairly lazy.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.120
Let's fix this up just a little bit better.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.960
Here, like this over here.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.880
Now, I don't need to reach up anymore.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.600
I can just say "Oh."

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.520
[electric whizzing noise]

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.880
Now I have a electric slide rule.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.160
So, when I want to multiply or divide.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.400
Oh.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.600
2.1 oh, let's just move it back over to here.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.400
2 times 2 is 4. All done electrically.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.640
But of course, I need to move the cursor too..

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.120
Let's multiply 8 times 4. Oh.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.640
Oh, 8 times 4...

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:37.360
Is a little bit more, it looks like 32. It's ether 3.2 or 32. The decimal place, I don't care about.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.200
I'm just concerned with the numbers.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.700
[Whispering] Slide rules don't know about decimal places.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.200
Here's

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.360
51, 52, 53, 54, 50~, 55.5 times....

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:57.680
[more electric whizzing noise]

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.840
3 to give, oh, 1.67~

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.840
Something like this.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.960
The latest advance in slide rule technology.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.960
