00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Google Slides lets you
collaborate with others

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.431
to create presentations
that engage your audience,

00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:09.030
whether you're using the
web, Android, or iOS.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.220
Typically, the most
effective presentations

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.230
use data to help tell stories.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.685
But sometimes, it's hard to
import data from other sources

00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:18.110
without considerable
manual work.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.050
That's why we're
building a Slides API.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.860
We want to make it
easier to establish

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.807
connections between slides and
the tools you use every day.

00:00:25.807 --> 00:00:27.640
Let's take a look at
how two of our partners

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.470
are using the Slides API.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.530
First up is SalesforceIQ,
a small business CRM tool.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.510
Now, every sales manager knows
the pain of preparing reports

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.586
before a meeting.

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:38.960
They have to
collect the numbers,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.910
build the reports, name, copy,
paste, resize, and, of course,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.500
brand it, which represents a
daunting amount of manual work.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.044
The new integration between
Slides and SalesforceIQ

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:53.340
makes this a simple operation.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.930
For example, to create a
presentation-ready report,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.860
click Create Google Slide
Presentation on your Reports

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.225
tab in SalesforceIQ.

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:04.590
Select the reports that
will go into your deck,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.890
a date range, and
you're all set.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.940
Your data and charts will appear
formatted and ready to present.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.420
It can also be shared with
others who may not have access

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.147
to SalesforceIQ.

00:01:14.147 --> 00:01:15.730
The new API makes
it easy for partners

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.896
to export data from other tools
and leverage functionality

00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:22.020
and slides to create great
looking visual reports.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.580
Second is Conga, a
tool that makes it easy

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.800
for you to use Salesforce
data in other applications.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.570
Conga recognized that their
users require the flexibility

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.140
to collaborate with
others to develop

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.050
polished materials with a
consistent look and feel.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.690
Users can define customizable
presentation templates

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.280
to perform common tasks.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.830
As a result of a Conga
integration with Slides,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.170
they can merge, transform,
and stylize Salesforce data,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.020
charts, and images into a
presentable Google Slides

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.040
presentation.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.820
This saves them
considerable time,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.470
while removing copy and paste
errors from the process.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.050
The new Slides API can
be used to empower users

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.660
to merge data from
other products

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.700
into Slides to create custom
presentations quickly.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.300
These integrations, along with
those from our other partners,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.060
will be launching with our
API in the coming months.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.050
Visit
developers.google.com/slides

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.550
for more details.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.180
We look forward to
seeing what you create.
