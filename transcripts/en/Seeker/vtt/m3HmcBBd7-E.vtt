00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.380
New research says the more intense the lighting
in a room is, the more intense your emotions

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.290
are- and not just the positive ones.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.620
Anthony Carboni here for DNews and to a certain
extent this seems obvious- we hear all the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.670
time about sunnier days making us happy and
darker, grayer, dimmer winters making people

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.670
sad.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.990
A team from the University of Toronto Scarborough
found kind of an interesting paradox, though.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.989
Depressed people didn't get happier on sunny
days.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.330
They got more depressed.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.370
So the team ran some studies and found that
all emotions are more intense under bright

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.370
lights.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.690
We just FEEL more when it's brighter.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.530
The team asked people to rate certain things
in a brightly or dimly lit room - the spiciness

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.710
of some chicken wings, how attractive someone
was, how aggressive a fictional character

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.710
seemed.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.610
In the brighter room, people thought the chicken
wings were spicier, the woman was more attractive

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.040
and that the character more aggressive.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.870
The theory the team lead put forward is that
ambient brightness makes people feel warmer.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.650
Light is perceived as heat by our emotional
system, and heat can trigger emotional responses

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.650
in us.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.570
I guess spiciness, sexiness, and anger could
be considered 'hot' emotions, but then what's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.570
a "cold" emotion?

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.250
There are a few other takeaways from the team
that I found much more interesting: the first

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.780
is that bright light could be intensifying
our initial emotional response to things that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.990
happen to us throughout the day.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.310
So turning down lights before an argument
or emotional conversation might help people

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.860
think about it more rationally.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.060
The other is that stores could design their
lighting based on what they're selling: engagement

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.060
rings?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.060
Flowers?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.170
Those are emotional decisions- crank up the
lights and let the love come in.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.580
More sensible products?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.670
Lower the lights and let logic take over.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.890
I know I tend to be more productive and motivated
in a bright room- I've never really paid attention

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800
to whether I FEEL any different.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800
What about you?

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.229
Are you more intense in brighter environments?

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.520
Let me know down below.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.560
If you watch a lot, you probably noticed I'm
wearing different glasses.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.170
These are from Warby Parker.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.790
They're awesome and they were affordable-
these frames and lenses were $95.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.430
They also have prescription sunglasses for
$125.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.450
They've got a home try-on plan where you go
to their site, pick 5 kinds of frames, they

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.670
send 'em to you to try on for free, then you
send them back in a pre-paid mailer.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.890
If you wanna help out DNews and get some sick
glasses go to warbyparker.com/dnews and get

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.260
some glasses with free 3-day shipping.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.090
For every pair they sell, they donate another
pair to someone in need.
