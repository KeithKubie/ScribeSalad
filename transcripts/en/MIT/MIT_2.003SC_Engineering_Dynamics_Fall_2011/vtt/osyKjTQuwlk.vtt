00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:25.560
PROFESSOR: OK, what
I thought I would do

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.549
is I'm going to go quickly
through the problems that

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.745
were assigned for practice.

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:35.513
There's seven or eight of them.

00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:36.846
I'm not going to do all of them.

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:38.304
I'm going to go
through and kind of

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:43.570
talk about what some of the key
issues are with each problem

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:51.000
and maybe make some
points about identifying

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.410
how you do problems, not
necessarily specifically focus

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.620
on the exact question
that was asked here.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.670
So here was this first-- this
was a quiz from last year.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.290
And you were asked to
find an equation of motion

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530
for this thing.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.190
And it can be a bit
of a puzzling problem,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.570
so how many degrees of freedom,
what are the constraints, what

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.920
equation should you use.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.660
So first of all, I look
at a problem like this.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.070
Is it planar motion or not?

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.970
OK, so maximum three
degrees of freedom.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.463
What are the
constraints, though?

00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:37.700
STUDENT: So G is [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.970
PROFESSOR: So G is
R/2 from the center.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.380
So that's true.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.520
And so what you're really saying
is it's fixed in radial motion,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.290
right?

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.730
And you're right.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.820
So that's one constraint.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.780
What's another constraint
in this problem?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.050
How many degrees of freedom
do you expect to end up with?

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.920
How many equations do you need?

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.370
How many coordinates?

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.368
One, right?

00:02:05.368 --> 00:02:07.243
So how do we articulate
the other constraint?

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.280
So it can't move radially.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.310
We figured that out.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.370
So this is actually kind
of an important point

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.220
in this problem.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.480
Because if you
can get this down,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.515
then the problem
becomes very simple.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.090
So talk to a neighbor.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.060
How would you describe
the other constraint here?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.130
I'm going to hold it a second.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.070
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.820
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.560
STUDENT: Gravity is
just [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.670
PROFESSOR: Well,
there is gravity, yes.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.260
But gravity is not a constraint.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.555
So this is a pendulum,
actually, of sorts.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.360
So talk to a neighbor.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.275
How would you describe
the other constraint?

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.310
OK, how would you describe it?

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.250
What's the other
constraint here?

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.840
So sometimes if
something is pinned,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.895
we say, well, then
it's fixed in x and y.

00:04:02.895 --> 00:04:04.680
And that's two constraints.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.290
It's only left to rotate.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.290
But this one doesn't seem
to-- it's kind of hard

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.140
to understand where
this one is pinned.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.057
You know this thing is
constrained in x and y.

00:04:14.057 --> 00:04:16.390
Because you want to use theta
for the coordinate, right?

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.070
But how do you say
that it's constrained

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.903
in that other thing?

00:04:18.903 --> 00:04:20.264
Yeah.

00:04:20.264 --> 00:04:22.650
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.985
PROFESSOR: OK, so he's
saying that you can define x

00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:34.185
and y in terms of r and theta.

00:04:34.185 --> 00:04:36.176
And that's true.

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:38.050
And I'm going to say it
slightly differently.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.591
So the way I think
about this problem

00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:42.040
is we've said that
it's constrained

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.440
in the radial direction.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.880
So that's one.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.040
It can move in the
tangential direction, right?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.060
This problem is really
exactly the same

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.090
as the skateboard
problem in a bowl.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.759
You shorten that
thing a little bit,

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.050
and it looks like a skateboard.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.190
And we're ignoring the
inertia of the wheels.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.500
So it's just a stick
sliding up and down.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.370
So what's the relationship
between the tangential motion

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.860
and theta?

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.690
Is it a fixed relationship?

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.370
So how far does it
move in the theta?

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.350
If you have a little
motion, delta theta,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.290
how far does it
move tangentially?

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:27.400
R delta theta is the
delta r tangential,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.210
the distance it moves.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.980
So this is the way to
say the other constraint,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.610
is if you know theta,
you know how far it's

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.520
moved in the radial, in
the tangential direction.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.180
So that's a way of saying
that other constraint.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.080
OK, then we can say
we completely describe

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.060
this problem by one coordinate.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.660
And that's theta.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.440
And the second you can do
that, this problem then

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.270
has a center of rotation right
in the center of the circle.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.440
And anytime you
have a body which

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.350
rotates around a
central point, then

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.960
you know that you can
describe the angular

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.300
momentum of the body
as some I with respect

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.250
to A times-- and
it's planar motion.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.520
So then it's just omega z, as
long as this is a principal,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.760
as long as you have the mass
moments of inertia in terms

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.410
of principal axes here.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.460
And it's nice when you
can write it that simply.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.070
The second you can identify
a fixed point about which

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.510
something rotates, then
the angular momentum

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.532
simplifies to that.

00:06:41.532 --> 00:06:48.370
OK, and then this
problem, of course

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.580
the sum of the torques
with respect to the center

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:59.990
here has got to be d H with
respect to A dt plus vAO

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.490
cross PGO.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.960
But this is-- what's
the velocity at point A?

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.380
0, so you don't have to
worry about this term.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.580
And it's just that.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.580
And you know that the sum
of the external torques

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.930
in this problem
comes from gravity.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.202
So you put in the gravity
term and compute the torques

00:07:26.202 --> 00:07:26.910
about the center.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.330
So our object really
looks like that.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:38.885
And here's G. And in the
problem, the way it was posed,

00:07:38.885 --> 00:07:42.340
the theta is drawn
from this line.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.530
So this is theta.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.702
So what's the moment arm?

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:55.510
It looks like whatever this
distance is, which is R/2.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.490
It's given.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:04.910
R/2 cosine theta is the
length of this side.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:11.391
So the moment that
gravity makes is some Mg.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.980
And that's going to
be equal to some Izz

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.990
about A theta double dot.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.910
OK, good.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:33.370
Let's take a look
at the next problem.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.969
And now so my
intention here, I'm

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:36.760
going to go kind of
quickly one by another.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.843
And I'm just trying to hit
the important concepts.

00:08:38.843 --> 00:08:41.789
So if you have a question
about the concepts, ask.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.610
If I've left you
wondering, I really

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.060
want this to be kind
of a conversation here.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.180
So that's the whole point.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.610
I've given you the essence of
what makes these problems work.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.930
OK, this one, we just find a
location of the center of mass.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.790
I think you're pretty good
at that sort of thing.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.710
Well, remember just a couple
points about center of mass.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.820
This one it says, find it.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.455
And you're given
the two objects.

00:09:10.455 --> 00:09:12.210
The important point
is that you can

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.520
pick any coordinate
at all in order

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.430
to use it to compute
the center of mass.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.050
So I pick S here, the M1.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.930
And some distance down here
is where the center of mass

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.060
is that we're looking for.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.200
And so this is the
G we're looking for.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:38.426
So M1 plus M2 is the total
mass times the position of G.

00:09:38.426 --> 00:09:43.050
I guess that ought to
be a capital-- SG here

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:48.610
must be equal to the sum of the
parts times their positions, M1

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:54.680
SG1 plus M2 SG2.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.430
And you can solve for SG.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.090
And that tells you
where you're at.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.320
So you can pick any coordinate
at all to calculate it.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.600
And once you find it,
you know where it is.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.360
So you just solve here for SG.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.600
It's that divided by the
total mass, obviously.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:21.370
OK, the next question
was, draw principal axes.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:27.400
So does this object have
some planes of symmetry?

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.510
Tell me one.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.714
STUDENT: This one.

00:10:29.714 --> 00:10:31.630
PROFESSOR: Slice down
through it this way, OK.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.210
And that means you have
a principal axis where?

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.000
Perpendicular to every
plane of symmetry.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.360
So you have a principal axis
coming out of the board.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.670
That's one.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.127
And give me another
plane of symmetry.

00:10:43.127 --> 00:10:43.960
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.043
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this one.

00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:46.850
So that means you've
got a plane of axis,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.910
principal axis going that way.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.680
And so then the third one has
to be perpendicular to that.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.640
So you have one this way,
this way, and this way.

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:17.220
So I'd asked for-- so if this
is G, then principal axes

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.850
with respect to G, one there,
one coming out of the board,

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.250
and one going up like that.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.050
So what is it?

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.840
Let's remind ourselves what it
means to be a principal axis.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.370
So if you know the
principal axes of an object,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:46.620
if you rotate, and you've
chosen them to go through G,

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.140
do they have to go through G?

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.150
Do all principal axes
have to go through G?

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.800
No, not at all.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.650
The principal axes just have to
give you, when you work it out,

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.635
a diagonal inertia matrix.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.630
But what does it
mean to have body

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.920
coordinates that we
know are principal axes?

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:17.730
Well, one of the things we know,
that if you rotate about G,

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.340
rotate about a principal
axis passing through G,

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.440
if you rotate about
any one of them,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.775
is it dynamically balanced?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.010
Guaranteed.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.760
You must rotate about the
principal axis, though.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.550
Now, I'll ask you
a second question.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.840
If you rotate about any
axis passing through G,

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.730
is it statically balanced?

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.530
Right, if you rotate about
any axis passing through G,

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.960
is it dynamically balanced?

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.140
Maybe, right?

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.880
Not necessarily.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.600
It might be dynamically
balanced if you pass through G,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.100
and it is a principal
axis, right?

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:07.350
OK, can you have a principal
axis not going through G

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.560
and rotate about
that axis and have

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.388
it be dynamically balanced?

00:13:13.388 --> 00:13:18.990
Yeah, OK, so we'll talk
about an example in a second.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:25.860
OK, so I think the second
question here said,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.530
OK, we want to rotate
this about this point G2.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:35.317
Now, G2 is right in the
middle at this body.

00:13:35.317 --> 00:13:36.775
That's where its
center of mass is.

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:39.150
And there's a G1 up here
that's the center of mass

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.430
of the upper body.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.350
And there's a composite
center of mass right

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.710
here, which we just
computed what it was.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:51.740
And we want-- there's going to
be an axis of rotation passing

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.125
through G2.

00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:56.210
And we're rotating
this body around it.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.475
So first question is, this
axis coming through G2,

00:13:59.475 --> 00:14:01.333
is it a principal axis?

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:02.280
Yes.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.255
If we rotate about
that axis only,

00:14:05.255 --> 00:14:08.520
do you expect it to be
dynamically balanced?

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.450
Right.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.520
Do you expect it to be
statically balanced?

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.020
No.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:46.900
So we're spinning it around this
G2, going like that around G2

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.270
at some omega z.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.390
We know that this is G2.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:56.650
We know that G for
the object is here.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.720
That's the center of
mass of the whole thing.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.185
So there's some distance between
those two, which I don't know.

00:15:03.185 --> 00:15:04.310
But we could figure it out.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.760
We'll call it e.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.730
So what's the force
required at this pin

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.370
that its axle is going around?

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.890
What's the force required
to allow this thing

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:20.070
to spin around, to hold it,
essentially, the force required

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.620
to hold it in place?

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.570
And you ought to intuitively
have an idea of what it is.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.250
Why is there a force?

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.260
That thing will spin
around this central axle.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.210
And there's a force
required to keep

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.720
that thing from moving away.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.142
What is it?

00:15:36.142 --> 00:15:39.130
STUDENT: Centrifugal force.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.650
PROFESSOR: I hear centrifugal.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.130
So you're accelerating the
center of mass of that thing.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.960
You're making it go in a circle.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.800
Mass times acceleration
is a force.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.269
And that's the tension
in the string when you're

00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:52.310
swinging the ball around.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.550
This is no different from
swinging the ball on a string.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.100
And you're essentially
calculating

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.970
the tension required to keep
that thing from flying off.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.580
And we could
probably just guess.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:10.990
We can almost guess what it
is, minus the total mass times

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.174
the acceleration,
which is inward.

00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:15.590
That's where the
minus comes from.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.320
And what is it?

00:16:19.122 --> 00:16:20.530
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.648
PROFESSOR: Louder.

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.239
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:23.239 --> 00:16:24.280
PROFESSOR: Omega squared.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.680
I hear an omega z squared.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.540
We need something else.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.440
Pardon?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.872
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:29.872 --> 00:16:30.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the r.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.577
And the r is this little e here.

00:16:32.577 --> 00:16:33.993
It's called the
eccentricity, when

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.230
you have something
unbalanced. e omega squared,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.720
and it's in the r hat direction.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.910
We'll call it inwards.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.850
And the inwards is the minus.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.080
So that's the acceleration.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.430
Mass times acceleration
is the force.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:53.950
Also, you could compute this
by computing d by dt of P of G

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:59.350
with respect to
O. And that's then

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:07.270
M1 plus M2 times v of G. You
have to take the d by dt of it.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.380
And that gives you that,
which is the acceleration.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:16.750
So the forces you get
directly from computing dP/dt,

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.730
if you need to remember
a way to do that.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:26.950
All right, so conceptually,
if I don't know what e is,

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.080
then I don't want to
have to figure it out.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.090
So I'm going to describe to
you a way in which you could

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.870
get directly at
this answer, which

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.320
reminds us something
about angular

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.530
momentum and these bodies.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:48.830
This object is made
up of two objects.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.970
And we're spinning it about
the center of one of them.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.890
So let's take them
one at a time.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:09.350
How much force is required
to keep this spinning

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:14.170
about that axle that goes right
through its center of mass?

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.670
None, right?

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.270
Because there's no
r omega squared.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.520
There's no acceleration.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.980
You're not making the center
of mass of this object

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.010
go in a circle.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:28.340
So this piece doesn't
enter into the solution.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.320
The actual force, the
mass, this mass here,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.080
is M2 in the problem.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.350
M2 doesn't actually have
anything to do with the answer.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.820
Because it's
perfectly statically

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.630
balanced around that point.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.500
All of this force making
the thing go in a circle

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.730
is making this piece
go in a circle.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:54.380
So in fact, this force
up here is minus M1.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:02.790
And now we need the distance
from the axis of rotation

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.240
to its center of mass.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.840
Well, that's some r.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.390
We need to know what that r is.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.970
And I think that's
basically-- this was L/2.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.250
And this was b, so plus b/2.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.860
So the distance from
this rotation point

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:34.280
to that center of mass is L/2
plus b/2, omega z squared.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.430
Mass-- this is acceleration,
and it's inwards.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:38.740
And that's the total force.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.020
All right, let's look
at the next problem.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.320
Vicente, can you
pull up the next one?

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.530
OK, this problem-- this
problem and the next

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.470
are rather similar.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.859
This is the elevator
problem with the pendulum

00:20:11.859 --> 00:20:12.525
in the elevator.

00:20:16.604 --> 00:20:18.580
There's a couple
subtleties here.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.580
The elevator, you're told
that it's moving upwards

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.740
at some particular
rate of acceleration,

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:29.220
some y double dot.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.140
That's given.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.963
So how many degrees of freedom
does this problem have?

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.230
OK, two or one?

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.530
I hear one.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.230
I see a two.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.960
How many coordinates
is it going to take

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.485
to completely
describe the motion,

00:20:46.485 --> 00:20:48.390
or how many equations
of motion do

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.681
you think you're going to need?

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.400
I see ones and twos.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.950
So there's a little
not-- two, OK.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:04.290
If we know the acceleration
of the thing-- we start

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.110
with some initial
conditions, at time 0,

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.140
it's sitting on the
ground, and y equals 0,

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.770
and now it takes off
from the first floor-- we

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.300
know for all time its position.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.570
So that's actually a given.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.950
It's a specified thing.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.610
And we don't have to write a
separate equation of motion

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:26.540
for that that we then
will have to solve.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.940
So it's actually given.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.580
So the actually only
dynamic equation

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.730
of motion we have to write
is about the pendulum.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.540
Now, will it involve
y double dot?

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.610
Absolutely.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.657
But it's a given number.

00:21:36.657 --> 00:21:37.990
It's just a number you're given.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.239
You don't have to write a
separate equation of motion.

00:21:40.239 --> 00:21:42.571
So actually you've got
just one degree of freedom.

00:21:42.571 --> 00:21:43.071
Yeah.

00:21:43.071 --> 00:21:45.230
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:51.680
PROFESSOR: OK, so put up
the next problem-- that one.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.090
So this problem has how
many degrees of freedom?

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.540
This is definitely two.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.850
Because you don't know.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.570
The motion in the up
and down of the mass

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.104
and the slider with a
spring on it is unknown.

00:22:04.104 --> 00:22:06.520
You're going to have to write
an equation of motion, which

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.290
would have to be solved to
get it, so a distinction,

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.790
a subtlety that can trip you up.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.390
When the motion is
actually specified,

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.280
and you know what
it is for all time,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.890
you don't need a separate
equation for that.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.060
So this problem requires two.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.150
The behavior of
the pendulum part

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:29.390
is essentially the same in both.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.840
When you write the equation--
well, let's talk about it.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.650
How will we go about
solving this problem?

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.630
We need two equations,
two coordinates.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.293
What would you pick
for your coordinates?

00:22:39.293 --> 00:22:40.126
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.630
PROFESSOR: Theta, and
then a coordinate.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.950
This one I guess
is called y, so y

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.520
for the square block
sliding up and down,

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.510
and a theta for the pendulum,
two equations of motion.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.670
And to get the y
equation of motion,

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.600
you would use-- we're
not using Lagrange here.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.725
We're going to do a little
review of direct method.

00:23:00.725 --> 00:23:05.670
How would you write the equation
of motion using-- up there

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.380
I kind of wrote the
key to everything

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.740
that we do with the direct
method, some of the forces,

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.280
some of the torques.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.730
Every rigid body has at max
how many degrees of freedom?

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.530
Six for rigid body.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.910
In planar motion, this
is reduced to three.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.640
But every rigid
body in 3D space has

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.180
six degrees of freedom-- three
positions, three rotations.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.070
So you write some of
the forces on the body.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.590
That is equal to the
mass times acceleration.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.810
That gives you three equations,
one in each vector, component

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.710
direction.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.990
You write the sum
of the torques.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.490
That's also a vector equation.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.780
You can get as many as
three equations out of it

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.060
if you need it.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.960
Then we keep reducing
down how many

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.390
equations we need to get by
figuring out the constraints

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.170
until we get down to the number
of actual degrees of freedom.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.440
And that's the remaining
equations, the number

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.150
of equations you actually need.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.060
So this one requires two.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.000
And if you're going to
write an equation of motion

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.910
about the main mass that slides
up and down, what law would

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:15.480
you use?

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.440
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
sum of the forces

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.219
equal to the mass
times acceleration.

00:24:20.219 --> 00:24:21.760
Then we need to get
another question.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.936
What law would you use
for the second one?

00:24:23.936 --> 00:24:24.810
STUDENT: Torque.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.660
PROFESSOR: Torque about where?

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.500
STUDENT: A.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.310
PROFESSOR: Torque about
A. So let's look at that.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.790
So that's the second
equation up there.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.530
Torque about A is
the time derivative

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.710
of the angular momentum
with respect to A plus

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:43.750
that vA cross momentum
term, which is

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.780
a little annoying to work out.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.360
So the simpler version
is the third equation.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.120
It's a pretty quick derivation
to go from that second equation

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.290
to the third.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.970
And it's much less
work, generally,

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.270
to get that mass
times acceleration

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:04.160
term, a lot less work actually.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.340
And if I've got
time, I'll go back

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.440
and we'll work out
a problem like this.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.160
And we'll do that part.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.110
But let's go on to
the other questions.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:19.220
OK, this problem--
two rigid bodies.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.810
Is it planar motion?

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:22.492
STUDENT: Yes.

00:25:22.492 --> 00:25:23.200
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.180
How many possible degrees of
freedom for each rigid body?

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.970
Times 2, 6, now how
many constraints?

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.880
So let's take them one
rigid body at a time.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.551
It's a big roller.

00:25:36.551 --> 00:25:37.050
Pardon?

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:37.730
STUDENT: No y.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.850
PROFESSOR: No y, she says.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.120
OK, that's one constraint
in it-- two left,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.940
two possible things left.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.720
STUDENT: No slip.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.780
PROFESSOR: Ahh, so I
think this one's no slip.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.970
So how does a no slip then
give you a constraint?

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:54.570
STUDENT: So x dot equals r
omega of the wheel turning.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.920
PROFESSOR: So r, there's an r.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.530
X equals r theta,
or minus r theta

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.570
depending on how you
define the theta, right?

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:08.239
So x is not
independent of theta.

00:26:08.239 --> 00:26:09.530
And that's a second constraint.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.340
So you only need one equation,
one generalized coordinate,

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.872
to describe the
motion of the wheel.

00:26:15.872 --> 00:26:16.830
And what would you use?

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.495
STUDENT: Theta?

00:26:20.495 --> 00:26:21.370
PROFESSOR: OK, theta.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:22.203
You could use theta.

00:26:22.203 --> 00:26:23.850
Or you could use x.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.290
All right, and now the other
object, how many constraints

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.075
does it have?

00:26:30.075 --> 00:26:31.142
And what are they?

00:26:31.142 --> 00:26:32.725
What are the constraints
on the T bar?

00:26:36.032 --> 00:26:39.860
STUDENT: Can't translate the y.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.490
PROFESSOR: OK, that's true.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.940
Let me give you a little
hint about how I process

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.500
this when I'm looking at it.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:53.230
Remember when you're picking
generalized coordinates,

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.530
they need to be independent.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.880
And independent means if
you freeze all but one,

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.810
that last one can still move.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.360
OK, so we've picked one.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.410
You said theta or x.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.710
Let's freeze it.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.154
What motion is
left of that T bar?

00:27:09.154 --> 00:27:10.819
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:12.360
PROFESSOR: It can
only rotate, right?

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.800
And that means it
has a pin, a point

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.170
about at which it rotates,
which you have just fixed.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.210
So it's constrained.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.005
That pin constrains it
in how many directions?

00:27:24.005 --> 00:27:25.250
STUDENT: Two.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.940
PROFESSOR: Two,
right off the bat.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.050
You have the two constraints
right at the pin.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.840
But it's not so obvious
until you say, let's freeze

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.594
at other coordinates.

00:27:33.594 --> 00:27:35.010
And then we see
that, ahh, there's

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.470
only one possible motion
left, the rotation.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.970
OK, so we have a rotation and a
translation, or two rotations.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.720
That's the way we could
write equations of motion.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.910
If we did translation
of the main disk,

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.710
what equation would you use to
write the equation of motion

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.140
for the main disk?

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.600
STUDENT: Force.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.950
PROFESSOR: Force, yeah.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.190
Newton's second law, sum of
the forces in what direction?

00:28:03.985 --> 00:28:05.607
It can only move in--

00:28:05.607 --> 00:28:06.440
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.630
PROFESSOR: Horizontal, yeah.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.740
So sum of the forces
in the x direction,

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.120
sum of external forces
in the x direction,

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.160
equals mass times acceleration.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.870
Now this, though, has some
problematic external forces,

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.300
right?

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.499
What are they, the
difficult ones?

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:22.397
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:22.397 --> 00:28:23.480
PROFESSOR: Well, friction.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.521
There's a friction force.

00:28:24.521 --> 00:28:31.020
And there's also the
internal forces at the pin.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.310
So you're going to
have to sort out how

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.920
to work your way through that.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.710
If you don't want to mess with
external forces at the pin,

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.133
you have to sum
rotations at the--

00:28:42.133 --> 00:28:42.966
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:46.626 --> 00:28:48.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so this problem,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.220
there's no escaping
something messy.

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:59.850
So let's say one
equation will be

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:03.010
the sum of the forces
on that main roller

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.610
in the horizontal direction.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.880
And that's going to force
us to deal with a friction

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.720
force and an internal, two
reaction forces at the pin.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.360
Well, you just write them down.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.200
Then go and write the same
expression, sum of the forces

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.580
on the other object.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.809
And it'll also show up with
those two internal forces.

00:29:22.809 --> 00:29:24.350
You add those two
equations together.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.183
Those forces cancel.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.190
And that gives you
the first equation.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.880
And it'll involve
acceleration of both masses.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.220
And you'll have to figure
out the acceleration

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.164
of that second mass
around its own.

00:29:39.164 --> 00:29:40.330
But you know how to do that.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.288
That's just kinematics.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.780
And then you've got to
do the torque equation.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.300
And you'd probably
do it about A.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:56.752
And does this involve--
what about the velocity of A

00:29:56.752 --> 00:29:57.680
in this problem?

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.610
Is it 0?

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.400
No, so you may have to
deal with that second term.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.740
And again, I would go
use the third expression.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.460
Because you need to find
the accelerations anyway.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.480
And I would use that.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.302
Yeah.

00:30:11.302 --> 00:30:14.719
STUDENT: Could you also take
the sum of the torques about d?

00:30:14.719 --> 00:30:16.260
PROFESSOR: Some of
the torques about?

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:16.560
STUDENT: d?

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.310
PROFESSOR: Then d is
the point of contact.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.291
Yeah, and that would give
you a way of getting at,

00:30:27.291 --> 00:30:29.040
I think, an equation
of motion that mostly

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.450
describes the big roller.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.910
I don't know.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.880
In terms of the
other one, I'm not--

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.270
summing it, then talking
about the second rigid body?

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.460
I don't think I would do it.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.146
It gets a little complicated.

00:30:49.146 --> 00:30:50.020
But it's interesting.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.057
It might be worth a try.

00:30:53.057 --> 00:30:55.390
I'd probably do it about A,
is the point I would choose,

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.980
and deal with the
fact that you need

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.070
to know the acceleration
of A. But in this problem,

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.320
that's pretty straightforward.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.100
What's the acceleration
of point A?

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.380
And let's say our
horizontal coordinate is x.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.520
What's the acceleration
of point A?

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.310
x double dot in the I
direction-- pretty easy

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:17.210
to stick that in this
third expression up here.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.710
And you know Rg
with respect to A

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:25.290
is just the length
of the distance down

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.730
to the center of mass of
that T. So that term's

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:29.930
pretty easy to figure out.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.810
And then the lead term is just
everything with respect to g.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.360
And that's pretty
straightforward.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.240
OK, good, how are
we doing on time?

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.180
Not a lot left.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.880
And is that the last problem?

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.519
Yeah.

00:31:42.519 --> 00:31:43.518
STUDENT: Quick question.

00:31:43.518 --> 00:31:46.018
The previous problem, we don't
need to worry about friction,

00:31:46.018 --> 00:31:48.427
do we?

00:31:48.427 --> 00:31:50.010
STUDENT: If it was
slipping, we would.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah, will
friction ultimately

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:57.565
end up in the
answer to this one?

00:31:57.565 --> 00:31:58.065
No.

00:32:01.073 --> 00:32:01.906
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.880
PROFESSOR: Well, speaking
in Lagrange terms,

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.256
does it do any work?

00:32:10.256 --> 00:32:11.994
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:11.994 --> 00:32:14.160
PROFESSOR: I know, but you
know about it now, right?

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.350
Constraints that
do no work usually

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.045
don't end up in
the final answer.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:31.050
I don't have a simple way of
explaining why it doesn't.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:35.115
But if in the first case,
instead of doing Newton's law

00:32:35.115 --> 00:32:38.730
on the first one, we had
done torques about d,

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.850
it would have given us
an equation of motion

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.040
for the roller.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.540
And then you could
have done torques

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.629
about A, a different equation.

00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:48.920
And we'd have got an equation
of motion largely dealing

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.910
with T. You still have
some internal forces

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.470
and torques that you're
going to have to eliminate.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:59.280
So this is not a simple problem,
but straightforward if you

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.080
know what laws to apply to
some of the forces, some

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:04.820
of the torques.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.360
And be careful with
the extra term.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.680
If this object were just
given an initial deflection,

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.275
like the T bar is picked up and
let go, and it's just there,

00:33:14.275 --> 00:33:16.800
and it's just doing
its thing, what

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.225
can you say about the center
of mass of the system?

00:33:23.342 --> 00:33:26.150
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:30.215
PROFESSOR: Well, it's not that
it doesn't necessarily move.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.780
Well, let's put it this way.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.830
What if I gave this thing
a push to start with,

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.751
and now it's going
to roll along?

00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:42.250
Huh?

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.600
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.160
PROFESSOR: OK, in
that case, you're

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.550
saying that the center of mass
moves with constant velocity.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.550
And Newton would agree with you.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:53.159
Why?

00:33:53.159 --> 00:33:53.992
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:57.349 --> 00:33:59.390
PROFESSOR: Because once
it gets rolling, is there

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.300
any friction force?

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.012
STUDENT: No.

00:34:01.012 --> 00:34:03.262
PROFESSOR: So you've got to
draw the free body diagram

00:34:03.262 --> 00:34:06.100
and decide whether or not there
are any forces on the system.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.500
If there are no external
forces on the system,

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:13.710
Newton says no acceleration,
no change in momentum.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.659
So once you get it
rolling, there's

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:17.070
actually no friction force.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.790
Because it isn't trying to
either speed up or slow down

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:21.870
the rolling.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:23.449
So it goes actually to 0.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.086
Is there slip?

00:34:25.086 --> 00:34:26.610
No, it still isn't slipping.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.250
But it's just happily
rolling along.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.020
There are no external
forces acting on it.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.010
It means the mass times the
acceleration of the center

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.469
of mass of the system is zero.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:36.625
So the center of mass
does not accelerate.

00:34:36.625 --> 00:34:38.790
That means it has
constant velocity.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:41.639
Now, if I contrive to have the
initial velocity of the center

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:46.760
of mass be 0, just cause that
thing to swing back and forth,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.290
what would you see
the center of mass do?

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.159
It has no linear momentum.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.120
The linear momentum
of the system is 0.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.470
So the center of
mass sits still.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.850
Its velocity now is 0.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.170
There's still no acceleration.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.410
It's just this T bar is
rocking back and forth.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:09.696
So what must the
roller be doing?

00:35:09.696 --> 00:35:11.010
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.810
PROFESSOR: So the roller
has to move to the left

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:15.740
when the T bar is
going to the right.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.940
So the two things
are going like this.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.970
In the center of mass, wherever
it is, it's just sitting still.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.240
All right, is there
a last problem?

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:31.150
This forces you to go back
to the fundamental definition

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:33.060
of angular momentum.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:39.440
It's R cross, this little
summation of each RI cross PI.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.030
And add them up, and you get the
angular momentum with respect

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:47.790
to the rotational point,
1 degree of freedom,

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:48.691
has a center of mass.

00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:50.440
Where is the center
of mass of the system?

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.273
Can you describe it?

00:35:54.437 --> 00:35:55.820
STUDENT: Right in between--

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.440
PROFESSOR: Somewhere in
between the two masses.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.065
There are two point
masses, center mass

00:35:59.065 --> 00:36:00.610
has to be someplace in between.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:02.390
So once you figure out
where that is, then

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:06.440
you can concentrate all the
mass there and go from there.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.400
Does this have mass
moment of inertia?

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.970
Can you write the
equation of motion?

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:16.840
This is a pendulum.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:25.580
Can you write I about A theta
double dot equals minus Mg

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.570
something sine theta?

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.880
This is a pendulum.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:34.670
The restoring torque on
it comes from gravity.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.150
And you'll end up
with an expression

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:39.000
that looks like
some I with respect

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.050
to the point of rotation.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.760
So basically, you just
need to figure out

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:48.290
what is I with respect to
A. And they're particles.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:52.500
So each particle has an I with
respect to its center of mass.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:59.020
It's equal to, for a particle,
concentrated point mass?

00:36:59.020 --> 00:36:59.994
STUDENT: Mr squared?

00:36:59.994 --> 00:37:01.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
but there's no r.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:06.890
So I for a particle about
its center mass is 0.

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:10.700
So this only has parallel
axis theorem components.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.960
It has M1 times this
distance squared

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.480
from the center plus M2
times this distance squared

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.210
from the center.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.180
And that's the total Izz.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.960
So then you can write it out.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.460
OK, so I think we've
run out of time.
