everyone

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600
 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.719
it's not going to be easy but I think it

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729
it's not going to be easy but I think it
 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.200
it's not going to be easy but I think it
can be done I think that if you have a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
can be done I think that if you have a
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.300

are able to pay for but that doesn't
 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.580
are able to pay for but that doesn't
mean that you then not allow people who

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590
mean that you then not allow people who
 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.080
mean that you then not allow people who
don't have the wherewithal to have

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090
don't have the wherewithal to have
 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.359

insurance that everybody has insurance

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369
insurance that everybody has insurance
 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.940
insurance that everybody has insurance
and everybody can get a doctor it may

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950
and everybody can get a doctor it may
 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.560
and everybody can get a doctor it may
not necessarily be the doctor of your

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570
not necessarily be the doctor of your
 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.719
not necessarily be the doctor of your
choice but it's a doctor that's well

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729
choice but it's a doctor that's well
 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.999
choice but it's a doctor that's well
trained and paid well enough to be

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009
trained and paid well enough to be
 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.219
trained and paid well enough to be
someone of high quality so just because

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229
someone of high quality so just because
 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.570
someone of high quality so just because
you go into a system where you're

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580
you go into a system where you're
 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.669
you go into a system where you're
assigned the doctor if you have people

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679
assigned the doctor if you have people
 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.169
assigned the doctor if you have people
who are well trained and well paid and

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179
who are well trained and well paid and
 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.300
who are well trained and well paid and
have good motivations for being in that

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310
have good motivations for being in that
 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.730
have good motivations for being in that
you can get good medical care you don't

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740
you can get good medical care you don't
 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.249
you can get good medical care you don't
necessarily have to then exclude those

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259
necessarily have to then exclude those
 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.690
necessarily have to then exclude those
people who want to choose their own

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700
people who want to choose their own
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.400
people who want to choose their own
doctor and are willing to pay to choose

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410
doctor and are willing to pay to choose
 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.440
doctor and are willing to pay to choose
their own doctor so I think you can get

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
their own doctor so I think you can get
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.660
their own doctor so I think you can get
both worlds there and also there's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
both worlds there and also there's
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.110
both worlds there and also there's
enough profit margin in drugs and the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120
enough profit margin in drugs and the
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.479
enough profit margin in drugs and the
development of drugs that I don't think

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489
development of drugs that I don't think
 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.410
development of drugs that I don't think
there's going to be an issue with the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420
there's going to be an issue with the
 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.759
there's going to be an issue with the
drug companies there there will always

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769
drug companies there there will always
 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.620
drug companies there there will always
be the need for new medications better

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630
be the need for new medications better
 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.690
be the need for new medications better
medication so I don't see that as an

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700
medication so I don't see that as an
 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.790
medication so I don't see that as an
issue
