00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To check that you understand how the crypto system works, we have a quiz.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Suppose n has chosen to be 6371.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That's 277 times 23, the two prime numbers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I should emphasize that this is not a secure choice.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For RSA to have any security, p and q have to be very large prime numbers,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
large meaning several hundred digits long, but to keep things simple,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
suppose we pick our n value as 6371.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What is the maximum value of our message?
