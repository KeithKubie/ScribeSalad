00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.000
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
There is my son.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.690
He will be 11 tomorrow.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.629
I promised him I would
tell everyone that.

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.170
Because normally,
I just say he's 10.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.685
He will be 11 tomorrow.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:19.140
And I started out as a parent
going, what is this operation,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.040
parenthood?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.440
What is expected of me?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.190
What do I want for my child
in 20 or 30 years' time--

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.100
happiness, success, fulfillment?

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.440
Right now what makes him
happy is programming something

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.480
in Python and then
playing on the trampoline

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.136
when it doesn't work.

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:36.510
I don't know what's
going to make

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.250
him happy in 30 years' time,
and nor can I give it to him.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.830
So at this point, I want to
ask who here is a parent,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.770
a mum, a dad, a
concerned citizen

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.810
about the future, a
caregiver, an aunt, and uncle?

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.444
Let's see.

00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:52.060
All right.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.560
OK.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.080
So I guess we're all
in the right place.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.250
So welcome, everybody.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.030
Thank you so much
for having me here.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.660
I do want to thank a colleague
of yours, Linda Scotti, who

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.860
isn't here today.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.410
And she read "Raising Thinkers"
before it was published.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.970
And she suggested
that I definitely

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.520
have to come and
share it with you,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.960
and to Caroline for being
such a gracious host

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.860
and for making it all happen.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.580
So operation parenthood,
where do we begin?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.410
Now when I started
looking at this,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.050
I thought, well, perhaps--

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.751
hello, Anthony.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.390
He knows exactly where to
begin on operation parenthood.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.620
He's got his own ideas.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.080
I thought-- well, I
realized that I was not

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.870
sending my son into a
fixed point in the future.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.440
I was actually sending
him on a journey.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.410
And how he behaved within
that journey and the decisions

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.480
that he made on that
journey would actually

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.920
create that future.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.540
So could I not
try and understand

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.000
the forces that would be
shaping that future, what

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.180
skills he would need
along the way to bring him

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.310
happiness, success, fulfillment?

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.880
If I could equip him with good
decision making and good ways

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.040
of thinking about
information, then he

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.474
could sort out happiness,
fulfillment for himself.

00:02:03.474 --> 00:02:04.390
And that was the plan.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.150
So I started talking
to and listening

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.240
to the people and
the companies who

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.460
are actually shaping the
future, companies like Google.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.680
And I was asking them
about employment practices,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.110
what they're hiring for in
the leaders of tomorrow.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.370
I scoured job boards.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.160
I attended conferences and
talked groups, and over

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.307
18 months.

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:23.890
I also spoke to
people who are running

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.020
apprenticeships programs,
which by the way,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.645
are very much back in fashion.

00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:29.020
Because they're
filling gaps left

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.000
by schools and universities.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.720
And along this journey, I came
up with several conclusions.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.760
But mostly, I got
good news, bad news,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.560
and I learned that I was wrong,
very wrong in how I approached

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.130
this first part of the journey.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.970
So can we just start with the
good news, get it out the way,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.270
and then the bad news.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.810
So the good news
is that by 2020, it

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.390
is estimated by
McKinsey that there

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.050
will be 85 million job
vacancies for medium

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.270
and highly-skilled employees.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.417
That's fantastic.

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:01.000
By the time my
children grow up, there

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.360
will be jobs if they
choose to take jobs.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.780
The bad news is that it is
estimated by McKinsey that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.580
by 2020, there will
be 85 million--

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.240
or employers will face 85
million job vacancies that they

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.020
cannot fill.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.780
How is this possible when
university enrollment

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.870
rates for the current generation
are higher than for any others?

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.270
This was curious.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.670
And this is when I
learned that I was wrong.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.250
Because I truly believed that
the future belonged to STEM

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.690
graduates-- science, technology,
engineering, and maths.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.050
And I will show you a snapshot
of the kind of information

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.650
that I was receiving from
companies and from my research.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.120
So what it turns out is that
it isn't a lack of skills,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.500
but there is a
mismatch between what

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.910
employers-- or what universities
and schools are producing

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.610
and what employers
are looking for.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.270
And this is very much at the top
of the agendas of governments.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.880
But you see, with
STEM graduates,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.620
schools are in a
very good position

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.960
to teach STEM
subjects, because it

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.090
follows the traditional
teaching methods--

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.200
teach, test, repeat,
correct, repeat--

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.829
whereas the skills that are most
sought after today for tomorrow

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.440
are slightly harder to
teach, but not impossible.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.880
So I was invited to a conference
at Microsoft headquarters

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.490
in the Thames
Valley near Oxford.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.210
And it was a small
affair, just attended

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.460
by the heads of the tech
companies based there.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.860
And they were talking
about the future of tech.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.990
And the entire morning
was spent talking

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.160
about this lack of skills,
this skills gap, this skills

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.000
mismatch.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.680
And the first question
of the morning

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.660
was, well, what skills are
missing from job applicants?

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.210
And I wasn't entirely surprised.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.780
This is just a screenshot
of the screen that I took.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.970
I was expecting slightly
more hard skills.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.790
But we've got critical thinking,
creativity, collaboration,

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.980
communication.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.050
And I don't know about you,
but none of those soft skills

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.560
yet feature on my son's
report, on his grade card.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.210
He doesn't get a grade for
communication, collaboration,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.290
cooperation, critical
thinking, problem solving.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.350
And the UNESCO report
summed it up really well

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.140
when they said that technical
skills were the bedrock

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.970
of an industrialized nation.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.730
But when a country moves up
into a fully fledged service

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.250
economy, high level thinking
and behavioral skills

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.160
are what continue to
drive economic growth.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.530
Now this got me very excited.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.010
Because I had spent the
last 12 years in Asia,

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.680
in Singapore and Hong Kong,
teaching critical thinking

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.360
and decision making.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.220
I knew what behavioral
skills were.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.210
I was working with
the government,

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.290
with the private
sector, and on an MBA

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.450
and an undergrad program.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.590
But I was teaching
it to the adults

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.740
in two of the top three
school systems in the world

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.940
because they had not learned
these skills at school.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.580
And being very
forward-thinking governments,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.246
they knew they had
to bring these skills

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:03.620
in if they wanted to continue
to move their economies forward.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.100
So I knew what high-level
thinking and behavioral skills

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.910
were.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.452
But I'm interested to know what
you guys think that they are.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.118
And I have a very good idea that
you know exactly what they are.

00:06:12.118 --> 00:06:13.030
So let's hear.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.740
What do you think
constitutes high level

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.420
thinking and behavioral skills?

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.030
It's not as fluffy
as it sounds--

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.190
promise.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.510
Some ideas, let's hear.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.580
Who has some ideas?

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.140
Caroline, kick us off.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.598
CAROLINE: High
level thinking and--

00:06:28.598 --> 00:06:30.350
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
And behavioral skills.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.640
CAROLINE: Decision making
or cognitive skills

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.890
or how to approach a decision.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.050
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Absolutely,
making decisions-- yes,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.591
having a system for
making decisions.

00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:38.175
What else?

00:06:38.175 --> 00:06:39.050
AUDIENCE: Leadership.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.383
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Leadership,
absolutely-- common sense

00:06:41.383 --> 00:06:43.320
is less common than you think.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.510
Absolutely.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.444
What else?

00:06:46.444 --> 00:06:49.017
AUDIENCE: Thinking
two steps ahead.

00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:50.850
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
Thinking two steps ahead,

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.471
so having a way to think about
whatever you're working on.

00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:53.970
Right.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.469
What else?

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.490
AUDIENCE: Understanding
communication styles.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.870
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
Communication styles,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.550
yes-- knowing what's
going on when people

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.674
are using different styles.

00:07:00.674 --> 00:07:02.510
Yes.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.400
What else?

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.340
AUDIENCE: Emotional
intelligence.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.590
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Absolutely.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.571
Thank you very much--
emotional intelligence.

00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:08.070
What else?

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.310
AUDIENCE: Intercultural skills.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.870
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
Intercultural skills.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.450
Thank you.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.300
What else?

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.460
We could go on and on.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.826
How many of these skills
are on your child's report

00:07:18.826 --> 00:07:19.950
card, if they're there yet?

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.640
I know most of you
have young children.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.800
But even in four or
five years' time,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.950
they will not appear on
your child's report card.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.720
Because they're not
being taught them yet.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.220
So the skills we
were looking for

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.914
are critical thinking,
innovation and problem solving,

00:07:33.914 --> 00:07:36.080
emotional and social
intelligence, systems thinking,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.470
adaptability, risk taking and
resilience, and above all,

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.520
this idea of raw intelligence.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.630
Now there are two ways
of looking at thinking.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.740
There's thinking about stuff.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.600
And that's what we
learn at school.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.820
We learn what's called
crystalline intelligence--

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.350
facts and information.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.720
Then there's thinking
about your thinking--

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.210
how to think.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.860
This is fluid intelligence,
or raw intelligence.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.610
And the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation,

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.210
realizing how important this
fluid or raw intelligence is,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.300
not just for the future,
but for right now,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.280
they commissioned a
study, a really big

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.910
and well-credentialed study, to
try and understand if schools

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.410
that were able to improve grades
on crystalline intelligence--

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.070
so the stuff we
learn at school--

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.310
if schools who were able to
improve that could also improve

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.710
tests on fluid intelligence
without any extra intervention.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.110
And what do you
think they found?

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.270
Were children able to improve
fluid intelligence just by

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.760
doing better at school,
all these things

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.450
we've spoken about?

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:39.950
No.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.090
I see lots of head shaking.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.660
No-- unequivocally
no, they were not.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.640
So doing really well
at school does not

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.630
produce an increase
in fluid intelligence.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.230
Now this left me in a very
uncomfortable position

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.970
as a parent.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.810
Because I knew what
these skills were.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.030
I knew how to teach them.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.450
But I was absolutely not going
to spend the few precious hours

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.170
that I had with my son every
day teaching him stuff.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.910
I wanted to be a cool
parent, after all.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.620
That's a very rare thing, right?

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.750
So I wasn't going to do this.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.820
But the more I dug and
the more I researched,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.740
the more I spoke to
people and schools--

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.170
I interviewed 22 schools--

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.620
the more I realized that no
one else was going to do this.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.580
And that's where the book
was born, where I realized

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.350
there was a message here.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.690
And we needed to tell it.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.000
Problem was, I didn't
know how to do it.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.030
I didn't know how to do it
in a way that was interesting

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.550
and wouldn't take up our time.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.580
My son has enough lessons,
kind of extra everything

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.340
classes on top of schoolwork.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.810
So I got stuck.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.270
And I started writing up all
the information that I had

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.950
and looking at and
thinking about it

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.440
and thinking about how
I worked with adults.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.374
I trained them, I coached
them, and I consulted.

00:09:54.374 --> 00:09:55.790
And out of all
those three things,

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.710
the most effective
way of getting

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.259
them to change behaviors,
to learn new things,

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:02.300
to get rid of behaviors
that weren't particularly

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.250
good for decision
making and thinking,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.870
was through coaching--

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.240
not particularly
technical coaching,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.850
really simple but
powerful conversations.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.350
And that's when I tried
coaching with my son.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.820
I took a situation
when he was eight.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.000
And I thought, all right,
I can listen to him

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.310
and hear what he thinks and
then tell him what I think

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.876
and what I think he should do.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.000
Or I can turn it around
and try and have a coaching

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.860
conversation with him.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.110
So instead of telling you
what a coaching conversation

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.984
with a child looks like,
I'll play you one so

00:10:34.984 --> 00:10:35.942
you can hear it.

00:10:35.942 --> 00:10:37.400
And I want you to
think how this is

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.530
different to the
typical conversations

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.020
you have with your children,
or if your children are still

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.720
not quite having conversations,
the kinds of conversations

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.180
that your parents had with
you when you were faced

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.340
with a difficult decision.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.500
And the setup up to this
particular conversation

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.650
was that my son is a
small boy for his age.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.810
And he was being verbally
bullied at school.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.590
And one day on the bus,
he was just sitting,

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.840
minding his own
business-- so he tells me.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.410
And these bigger boys were
overpowering him with words,

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.870
but quietly so that the
teacher couldn't hear them.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.910
He got so frustrated
and so angry

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.470
that he swore at
them very loudly.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.980
And the teacher heard him.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.570
So he got into trouble.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.900
So when the dust settled,
we had this conversation.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.890
It was our very first
coaching conversation.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.180
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.470
- Honey, how did you feel about
what the boy said to you today

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.940
on the bus?

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.110
- I felt angry, really angry.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.330
- So he called your baby.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.140
Is it true?

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.100
Are you a baby?

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.660
- No, I'm not a baby.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.250
- So why did it
make you angry then,

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.576
if you know it's not true?

00:11:36.576 --> 00:11:37.950
- Well, because
he said it aloud.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.540
And everybody on
the bus heard it.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.130
And I felt really embarrassed.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.490
- Ah, could you have stopped
him then from saying it?

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.900
- No, not really.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.380
- So do you think you
reacted in the right way?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.550
- No, I don't think I did.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.420
But I mean, I was so
angry, it just came out.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.160
- OK.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.120
So what would you have liked
to do differently then?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.820
- I would have liked to
said something cool that

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.530
doesn't get me in trouble but
gets him to stop annoying me.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.750
- Ah, OK.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.790
So you want a line
that you can say

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.040
when you get angry
that sounds cool

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.870
but doesn't get
you into trouble?

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.461
- Yes.

00:12:13.461 --> 00:12:13.960
- OK.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.270
- But what?

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.516
- Well, you tell me.

00:12:16.516 --> 00:12:18.390
What can you say every
time someone calls you

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.042
a name, something
that you won't forget

00:12:21.042 --> 00:12:22.916
and that you can use in
different situations?

00:12:23.415 --> 00:12:25.470
- I could tell them
to stop annoying me.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.110
I could tell them
that I'll tell them

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.240
that I'll tell on them if
they keep on annoying me.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.860
- Hm.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.470
I'm not sure.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:32.430
Does that sound cool?

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.360
- No.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.590
- So tell you what-- how about
you think of two or three lines

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.070
that are short and easy to
remember and then we chat about

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.980
them tomorrow after school and
see which one will work best.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.890
- OK.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.580
- OK, cool.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.165
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:48.540
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: And we did
chat about it the next day.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.498
And I still didn't think
they were cool enough.

00:12:50.498 --> 00:12:54.840
Of course as mummy, as a
writer, I had so many lines

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.590
that he could use.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.006
I knew exactly
what he should say.

00:12:57.006 --> 00:12:58.400
But I bit my tongue.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.370
And I played it cool.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.450
And I waited.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.082
The following day, he
came up with this line.

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:04.920
And I was so incredibly
proud of him.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.110
He said, Mummy, I'm
going to say this.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.440
When somebody calls me a baby
or a nerd, I'm going to say,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.590
you may think that
I'm a baby or a nerd

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.764
but that doesn't make it true.

00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:19.440
I thought, wow,
for an 8-year-old

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.620
to come up with that, to
say, I respect the fact

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.690
that you have an opinion.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.420
But I don't have to believe it.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.620
And he did that by
himself at eight.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.080
He still uses it today.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.150
It's given him a tremendous
amount of confidence

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.400
to stand up for
himself in a way that

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.930
doesn't get him into trouble.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.380
Because the teachers go, well,
you know, it's OK what he said.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.840
You know, he respects
that you have an opinion.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.700
But he doesn't believe you,
which he's entitled to do.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.540
So how is that
conversation different

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.010
to the typical conversations
we have with our children?

00:13:53.902 --> 00:13:54.860
Let's hear it from you.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.860
What's the one big difference
that you heard there?

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.760
AUDIENCE: You let them
think for themselves.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.080
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Absolutely.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:07.350
I guided him with my knowledge,
with my experience as an adult.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.910
All I did was guide him and
let him think for himself.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.250
And this then
became, I tried this.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.070
And I continue to use these
coaching conversations.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.920
Other parents started to use
these coaching conversations

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.670
to start delivering all
these skills, this huge menu

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.000
of skills that our children
aren't getting anywhere else.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.560
And the results have
been astounding.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.290
So it became the vehicle then
to really impart the knowledge

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.700
that I knew my son would need.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.670
So there we go.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.850
So of course, "Raising Thinkers"
was a four-year journey for me.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.520
And today, I'm leaving
out almost everything,

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.680
because I only have half
an hour to talk to you.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.790
And I know most of you
have young children.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.248
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to leave you with just

00:14:51.248 --> 00:14:54.030
a couple of really concrete tips
that you can start using with

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.150
your children
immediately-- well,

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.394
from about the age
of four to five--

00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:00.810
that will really
make a difference

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.580
in how they think
about themselves,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.620
other people, and information.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.750
So the first one is,
of course, as parents,

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.750
we make better decisions
than our children.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.750
Because we've made more.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.900
We have more experience.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.000
We understand risk.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.090
And we have this enormous
internal database

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.220
of decision outcomes, what's
worked what hasn't worked.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.340
So we tend to make
decisions for them.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.040
And something that I've found
in working with graduates

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.890
and undergraduates and
then coming to the UK

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.750
and working with
young entrepreneurs

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.560
is that they really, really
battled to make a decision.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.930
They actually battled
to have a structure

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.720
to think about their options
and then to pull the trigger

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.634
and make that decision.

00:15:41.634 --> 00:15:43.800
And then you start to
realize, in talking to parents

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.720
and reflecting on
your own experiences,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.700
that that's because
most of their childhood,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.760
we've made the
decisions for them.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.040
And they've only started to
get this enormous database

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.590
of decision outcomes
from early adulthood.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.850
So what if, as parents, we
start from about four or five,

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.950
allowing our children
to make decisions,

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.660
controlled decisions?

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.539
So we become
decision architects,

00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:08.830
where we can ask quite simply
for a four-year-old, peas

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.994
or beans for dinner?

00:16:09.994 --> 00:16:11.660
Very simple-- those
are the two choices.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.420
But you can pick
them, and I will

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.341
prepare whatever you choose.

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.840
And as they get
older, the decisions

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.970
can become more
complicated, more complex.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.700
But you still design
their choices.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.330
So they start to understand
that there are consequences.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.980
And they have to accept them.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.440
This is enormous for a young
child, especially one that

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.530
is used to having parents
make their decisions for them.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.990
As you saw in the conversation
I had with my son,

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.600
he got to choose what
he wanted to say.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.330
But I really helped and
guided him get there,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.877
using my knowledge
and my skills.

00:16:41.877 --> 00:16:43.960
You know, your children
will have so many teachers

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.110
in their lives.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.110
They will have a
couple of mentors.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.940
And if they choose you,
that's great, as a mentor.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.300
But they will have
very few true coaches.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.450
So designing these
decision outcomes for them

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.760
becomes part of that role,
when it's appropriate.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.050
The next one is in
understanding risk.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.589
Because again, we're much
better at understanding risk.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.599
Our children have no
experience of what's

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:11.980
out there, all the nasties
that can really happen to them.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.260
Yeah, it's true.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.960
But they have something
that most of us--

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.569
certainly what I
see in my work--

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:21.490
that we have lost along the way.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.177
And that is an
incredible imagination.

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.010
And if you look at the
financial crises that

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.050
have happened over
the last two decades,

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.430
pretty much all
of them have been

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.560
billed as black
swan events, things

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.290
that we couldn't
have seen coming.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:39.190
But some commentators who
thought a little bit deeper

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.530
about these events have
actually seen that they

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.600
were a crisis of imagination.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.970
We didn't see them
coming, because we

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.820
do our projections
and our risk analysis

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:53.650
based on the past, the
present, and the numbers.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.440
And a lot of what I'm doing
in working with adults

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.360
in the boardroom
is reintroducing

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.670
this idea of telling
narratives to understand risk.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.760
So when your teenage daughter
comes to you and says,

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.540
I want to date this guy
who's really, really cute

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.882
but has a bit of a bad
reputation-- she might not

00:18:09.882 --> 00:18:10.840
actually tell you that.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.120
You might hear that
from the friends.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.180
How about you ask her
to sit down without you

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.420
and think about the absolute
best that can happen out

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.930
of this relationship
and the absolute worst

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.870
and how that will affect
her social standing,

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:30.400
her personal perception, her
Facebook profile, her Facebook

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.330
feed.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.270
What could possibly go wrong?

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.360
And when she's had a
chance to think about this,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.435
you then sit with her and
discuss these options.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.960
How much of this risk
is she prepared to take?

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.240
Help her come to a conclusion.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.200
And seven times out of 10--

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.050
I won't say 10 times out of 10--

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.300
seven times out of 10, if
you help your child actually

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.786
reach their own conclusions,
they will stick to them.

00:18:55.786 --> 00:18:57.160
And that's
particularly important

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.930
when you're not around
in the teenage years.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.380
Now "Raising Thinkers" goes
through a lot of this parent

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.510
as coach and all these
skills, but it also

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:08.362
looks at how the brain
develops from before birth

00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:10.570
all the way through to the
teenage years and the role

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.289
that we as parents play
in that brain development.

00:19:13.289 --> 00:19:14.830
That blew me away,
because it was not

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.510
something I knew I had
any particular role in.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.520
But we do.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.260
And especially in
the teenage years,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.710
it looks at how
they perceive risk

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.770
and why the initiatives
that schools and governments

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.680
have been introducing to try
and reduce teenage risk taking,

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.840
why they're not working.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.360
Because they're actually
focusing on the incorrect.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.030
They're focusing on controlling
risk, not getting teenagers

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.560
to understand risk.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.330
And it's got to do
with how the brains are

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.360
growing in that particular
point in their lives.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.190
And the last thing I
want to leave you with

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.179
is to suggest that you take
your children to the movies.

00:19:48.179 --> 00:19:50.470
Don't just take them and
leave them there, but actually

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.110
take them to the movies,
watch something with them.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.670
It must have
interesting characters

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.247
and dialogue, real dialogue.

00:19:56.247 --> 00:19:58.330
So that might exclude some
of the superhero movies

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.860
on at the moment.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.720
But there are other
movies available.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.310
And when you're
done, when you're

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.760
driving home, having
pizza with your kids,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.380
chat to them about
the characters,

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.240
what one knew that another
one didn't know, why there was

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.160
conflict, how they resolved it.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.080
And how would your
child have resolved it

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.590
if he was a superhero
without superpowers?

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.810
What would he have
done in that situation?

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.850
And what you're doing here
is developing theory of mind.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.300
Now as you can already
imagine, theory of mind

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.300
is the foundation of social
and emotional intelligence.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.080
And it is incredibly important
as they grow up, start working

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.340
with other people and teams.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.070
And believe it or not, it is one
of the most important aspects

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.750
of good decision making,
emotional intelligence.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.790
So there's a tip.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.170
And ultimately,
what we're trying

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:48.400
to do through all these
ideas is to develop skills

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.222
that artificial intelligence
will find hardest to fulfill.

00:20:52.222 --> 00:20:53.830
Yeah?

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.020
I'm not going to say
won't fulfill or give you

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.100
a particular time line,
because who knows,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.310
but that we'll find
hardest to fulfill--

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.955
the human element.

00:21:01.955 --> 00:21:02.830
So just to be clear--

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.410
I left out-- theory
of mind is the ability

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:10.290
to create a map of what somebody
else intends, is thinking.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.610
And that thinking
and those intentions

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.420
are different from your own.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.840
So if you say to a
small child, Daddy

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.600
thinks that the
Earth is flat, they

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.936
will generally believe then
that the Earth is flat.

00:21:21.936 --> 00:21:23.560
But there is a
difference between Daddy

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.800
thinks that the Earth is
flat and the earth is flat.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.040
The earth may be round
or wobbly or bumpy,

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.890
but to make the difference
between what Daddy thinks

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.390
and what reality is.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:40.060
And when it comes to fake data,
fake news, alternative facts,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.550
this is becoming really,
really important.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.300
When I started writing
"Raising Thinkers,"

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.700
that wasn't even a word.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.800
But it's a thing now.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.480
In 1917, Einstein had a problem.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.410
He discovered that his brand
new theory of relativity

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.380
was giving him
dodgy information.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.490
It was saying that the
universe wasn't stable.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.752
It was either expanding
or contracting,

00:22:03.752 --> 00:22:04.960
which of course, was rubbish.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.670
Because it looks pretty stable.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.870
So he developed what he called
the cosmological constant.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.760
And he popped it
into his formula.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.010
And it controlled for
the effects of gravity.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.960
It held everything
together, according

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.420
to his belief of the world.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.730
A Belgian astronomer--
well, a Belgian priest

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.190
an amateur astronomer,
George Lemaitre,

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.630
he came to him 10 years later.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.830
And he said, you know what?

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.830
I don't think you need
your cosmological constant.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.927
I think the universe
is expanding.

00:22:31.927 --> 00:22:33.385
Of course, he is
a complete madman.

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:38.680
I mean, what's this guy talking
about, expanding universes?

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.190
60 years later, that
became the foundation

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.650
of how we understand
the universe today--

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.570
the Big Bang Theory.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.850
Now I don't know what I don't
know, like Einstein didn't know

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.380
or what he didn't know.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.650
And we don't know where
we're sending our children.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.690
But if we can give
them a system to think

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.880
about this new information
that will be coming their way,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.471
then that would be
incredibly helpful.

00:23:03.471 --> 00:23:05.470
So what you will also
find in "Raising Thinkers"

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.590
is that I've taken all the
work that I do with adults,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.110
and I've really squeezed it
down to its very essence.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.370
And I've come up with the seven
habits of good decision makers,

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.930
like brushing your
teeth twice a day.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.190
So this is information
that does we go through

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.500
in the book in
detail, again in fun

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.900
and interesting ways to
do with your children

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:31.270
as they grow to help them think
about this spread of fake news

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.920
and fake data and
the information

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.130
that they are working with.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.730
My corporate mission
has always been

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.680
to change the world
one thought at a time.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.110
Because if people can
make better decisions

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.810
and think more soundly about
themselves, about other people,

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.370
about information, then they
will make better decisions.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.410
And that will affect their
family, their communities,

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.240
their businesses.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.640
But when I became
a parent, I did not

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.580
realize the enormous
responsibility

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.650
and the enormous
power that I had

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.910
to shape somebody's mind, their
thoughts, and their outcome.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.150
And I now know if my son
can make better decisions

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.480
and think more soundly about
himself, about information,

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.680
about other people, not only
will I be changing his outcome,

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.670
but I may just change his
community, his company--

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.530
if he chooses to
work for a company

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.420
or becomes an entrepreneur,
whatever it is he

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.530
chooses to do.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.110
And if enough people do this, we
can actually change the world.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.250
And I think that is very
necessary right now.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.130
So I invite all of you, whether
you have children or thinking

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.520
of having children or have
cousins and nieces and nephews,

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.820
to join me in continuing to
raise your children as thinkers

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.800
and hopefully change the world.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.820
Thank you very much.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.903
Let's have some questions.

00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:53.675
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:54.175 --> 00:24:56.009
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
So thank you very much.

00:24:56.009 --> 00:24:57.258
I'm going to jump straight in.

00:24:57.258 --> 00:24:59.140
And the first question
I'd like to ask

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:04.709
is, what behaviors are not
good for decision making?

00:25:04.709 --> 00:25:06.500
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: I
think what is not good

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.780
for decision making
is an inability

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.430
to question information, an
inability to question sources,

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.770
and certainly an
inability to question

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:16.880
your own understanding.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.080
So we talk quite a bit--

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.538
I mean, I'm a
behavioral economist.

00:25:19.538 --> 00:25:22.310
So the work I do is in
understanding mental biases,

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.340
how we process
information, how who we are

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.590
affects how we see the world
and the decisions that we make.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.610
And probably the most
limiting in terms

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.000
of making good decisions is
falling into our own biases

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.030
and not understanding
how we frame information.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.680
Because how information
is presented

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.220
is more powerful than the
information itself, so good

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.049
question.

00:25:44.049 --> 00:25:45.590
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
So you mentioned

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.380
at the very beginning
that to question where

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.224
you get your information
from, or maybe

00:25:51.224 --> 00:25:54.090
in that case, your parents
and the information

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.810
that they give you or the
advise that they give you.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.370
And that's, I
guess, something we

00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:59.960
have to encourage
our children to do,

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.163
to not just blindly listen to--
or accept everything that's

00:26:04.163 --> 00:26:07.490
said to them or even for
also our peers and the people

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.214
that we work with or report to.

00:26:09.812 --> 00:26:11.520
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
When I was growing up,

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.353
my parents would say
to me-- because I would

00:26:13.353 --> 00:26:15.470
say why a lot, annoyingly.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.740
And they would say to me,
just because I said so.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.340
Yeah?

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.590
A couple of you are laughing.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.230
Because yes, as parents, we
get to the point where we say,

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:24.760
just because I said so.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.930
Because I know better.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:28.840
And I make better
decisions, so just take it.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.420
And sometimes we don't have
time to do the coaching

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.550
and to sit down and
explain everything.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.820
But at some point, we have to
be able to say to our children

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.220
that it is OK to ask us why.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.920
My son is allowed to--

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.680
lots of times, being a boy,
a preteen, lots of times

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.230
he makes decisions on the fly.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.900
And we have to say to him
afterwards, that was wrong

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:50.860
and explain to him why.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.940
And if he still
doesn't understand,

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.690
he'll come to-- he's
allowed to come to us

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.380
and say, I need more
information, Mum.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.540
I want to know why you
say, no, I can't do that.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.730
And we've promised him.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.070
And it's a contract between
my husband and myself

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.500
that we will take the
time to explain to him.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.317
And as soon as he
understands our thinking,

00:27:08.317 --> 00:27:10.150
that there is actually
something behind it--

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.566
because sometimes kids think
that you just say no because,

00:27:12.566 --> 00:27:13.741
right?

00:27:13.741 --> 00:27:16.240
The minute he understands that
there is thinking behind it--

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:16.930
he's 10.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.420
He's old enough to
reason, absolutely.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.230
He gets it.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.970
And he may not be happy with it.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.050
But he works with it.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.330
So we have this rule that
we are not allowed to say,

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.620
because I said so.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.000
And it's tough as hell.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.010
Because sometimes you
just want to say that.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:30.690
But you know?

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.420
It's making all the difference.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.110
And he's at a school
where-- he was in a school

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.880
previously where
he would do that.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.010
And he was actually told
to be quiet a few times.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.600
He was being
disruptive in class.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.150
We took him out of that school.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.900
It took me two years
to find a new school.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.287
But we found him a new school.

00:27:45.287 --> 00:27:46.870
And that was the
deal with the school,

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.830
that if he asks respectfully, if
he can ask why the teacher says

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.670
that, they must be comfortable
that they will give him

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:55.240
an answer.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.470
And it may not be in front
of the class, but afterwards.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.810
And the school was
delighted to do this.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.393
Because it was so
refreshing that here

00:28:00.393 --> 00:28:02.260
was a pupil who could
do this respectfully

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.910
and out of curiosity, which
was quite different and making

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:07.994
waves a bit in the school.

00:28:07.994 --> 00:28:09.076
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Yeah.

00:28:09.076 --> 00:28:11.550
I imagine it was tough for
a few teachers at first.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.694
That's great.

00:28:12.694 --> 00:28:15.400
Can I ask, what
advice would you give

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:21.250
to parents or aunts or uncles
on encouraging an anxious child

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.340
or teen to start
making some decisions?

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.400
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: OK,
so anxiety in a child

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.220
usually comes from
inexperience, from-- especially

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.080
for a child who
likes to be organized

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.050
and needs to know one thing
follows another thing.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.390
Anxiety normally
starts in a child

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.464
when memory starts to develop.

00:28:39.464 --> 00:28:41.380
Because suddenly, you're
faced with a stranger

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.370
that you don't have information
in the memory bank about.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.049
Or going to a new school--

00:28:46.049 --> 00:28:47.590
there's a lot of
anxiety around that,

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.214
because you don't
have any information.

00:28:49.214 --> 00:28:51.430
There's nothing in your
memory about that school.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.470
So if a child is
particularly anxious

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.180
and they need to
make decisions, it's

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.430
about priming them
as much as possible.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.980
I found having worked
in Asia for a long time

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.010
in Asian cultures, standing
up, making decisions on the fly

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.529
is quite a difficult
thing to do.

00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:06.070
Because it's not
part of the culture,

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.360
certainly not part of
Confucian cultures.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.010
So giving a child space
and time, prepping them,

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.320
exposing them to information--
not making the decision

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.680
for them, but encouraging
them to maybe read up or speak

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.050
to people, getting them
comfortable with ideas

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:20.980
and concepts.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.460
Again, all of this takes longer.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.910
But this is the difference
between take-out parenting

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:27.920
and actually a
good, wholesome meal

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.300
that is going to nourish
the body and the mind.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:30.630
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Thanks.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.350
That's great.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.906
Thanks.

00:29:31.906 --> 00:29:32.680
Fantastic.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.132
Are there any live
questions in the audience?

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.984
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:39.984 --> 00:29:40.918
Is it on?

00:29:40.918 --> 00:29:42.320
Yeah.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.100
My question is how to deal with
a child or a teenager which

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.420
is irrational or
dishonest about the facts?

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:56.015
So in the example you gave about
a young female teenager that

00:29:56.015 --> 00:30:00.087
wants to go out with
the hot guy at school,

00:30:00.087 --> 00:30:04.320
and she might sit down,
as you recommend, to think

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.776
about the consequences.

00:30:05.776 --> 00:30:09.260
But she skews the
reality and decides,

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.890
well, it's going to be really
nice to start going out

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:12.610
with him.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:17.420
And she doesn't see any bad
consequences on the horizon.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:21.736
How do you balance making
them make their own mistakes

00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:22.810
and protecting them?

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.560
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Of
course, because life

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.880
gets kind of serious at
round about that age, right?

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.780
And again, giving frames
and how we view information,

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.390
they will frame that information
for their own outcome.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.130
But there's a reason
they want that outcome.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:41.986
And you as a parent, if
you understand the coaching

00:30:41.986 --> 00:30:43.860
conversation, which the
book is quite clear--

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.590
and it's not a difficult thing,
by the way, these coaching

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.640
conversations.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.210
But at that point, for you as
a parent to try and understand

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.590
why they so desperately want
to go out with this kid,

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.880
what is the reason behind it?

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.150
So put all that risk assessments
and everything aside and sit

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:02.660
down with them or get
a friend, somebody they

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.930
trust, somebody they speak to,
to actually sit down with them

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.100
and say, all right,
so what's behind this?

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.500
Why this guy and nobody else?

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.080
And you will get some
interesting information

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.140
as to why they choose
that particular boy.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.690
And that is something that
you will then work with first,

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.614
before you even get
to the risk thing.

00:31:20.614 --> 00:31:22.280
Does that actually
answer your question?

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.850
But the thing is, you're
missing information from that.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.070
If she is continuously skewing
the discussion towards I

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.830
will do this because-- so she's
only looking at the positive--

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.720
you need to understand
why it is that she's

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.072
insisting on pursuing this.

00:31:34.072 --> 00:31:35.780
Because you would have
helped her by then

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.000
to actually look at
all the negatives.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.280
And she is quite happy
to brush those aside.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.509
So there is-- and it's
usually a social game.

00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:45.050
So there is some kind of social
game that she gets out of it.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:48.167
You go back then to this, well,
I'm going to be really cool.

00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:50.000
And it's going to light
up my Facebook feed.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.280
And it's going to be
brilliant for me socially.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.900
Then we start
talking about, well,

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.450
the necessity of
this social need

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.300
and the long-term
consequences of that.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.290
It's a process.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.556
Yeah, there's no there's
no quick fix to it.

00:32:02.556 --> 00:32:03.972
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's great.

00:32:03.972 --> 00:32:04.960
Thank you.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.420
It's over here.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:12.716
AUDIENCE: I have a question,
maybe a slightly different view

00:32:12.716 --> 00:32:17.490
on raising critical thinkers
in [INAUDIBLE] countries,

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.860
where you don't have freedom of
expression, freedom in speech.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:21.888
And I'll explain why.

00:32:21.888 --> 00:32:23.100
I grew up in Soviet Union.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.210
But when I was 10, the
Perestroika started.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.110
It wasn't that time.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.500
But I do remember my
mother telling me, at home,

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.210
you can say what you want.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.970
At school, you can say only
what you've been told on TV.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.870
So I was--

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.400
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Wow, that
is a difficult question.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.780
AUDIENCE: --you can't-- there
are different consequences

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.850
for saying things
you might believe in.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:50.860
So how you do explain to,
like, 10, 12-year-old children?

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.240
What would be your advice?

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.461
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Wow.

00:32:53.461 --> 00:32:53.960
OK.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.150
That is a tough one.

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.730
For me as a parent,
your first port of call

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.280
is to protect your child, right?

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.832
So up until, I would
say the teenage years--

00:33:03.832 --> 00:33:06.040
and again, I have absolutely
no experience with this,

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.110
so don't quote me--

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.940
but up until that
point, your primary goal

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.110
is to protect them.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:15.280
So they need to understand the
framework, as you explained,

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.930
within which you're working.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.150
The danger is they
get into a situation

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.790
where their true beliefs
come out in public.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.600
And that is dangerous.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.140
So it also depends,
I guess, if you're

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.690
able to leave the country,
where this becomes valuable,

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.730
or if this is not a
skill that will ever

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.070
benefit them in any
which way, will only

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.100
get them into trouble.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.150
So as a parent, you do
your own risk assessment.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:41.110
Because the consequences
are not standing up

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.810
against a teacher who might tell
you to shut up and sit down.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:47.470
It's very different.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:51.460
So if they're capable of
understanding that duality,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.650
then to have that
critical assessment,

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.990
perhaps keeping it to things
within their own life,

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:59.090
their immediate world, and
teaching them within that.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.530
But again, how do you
teach a child to criticize

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:04.039
their brother or
to think critically

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:05.830
about what their brother
says, but not what

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.000
the government says?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.130
So to be honest, I do
not have an answer.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.728
I think that is an incredibly
interesting question.

00:34:11.728 --> 00:34:13.995
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:34:13.995 --> 00:34:15.120
It's very hard [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.460
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: It's
something to think about.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.317
Yeah.

00:34:17.317 --> 00:34:19.775
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: How to
advise your child for that one.

00:34:19.775 --> 00:34:22.674
We have some questions
at the back of the room.

00:34:22.674 --> 00:34:23.648
Thanks, John.

00:34:28.518 --> 00:34:30.969
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned that this book,

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:34.486
it's kind of useful from
five onwards, right?

00:34:34.486 --> 00:34:35.679
But I have a two-year-old.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.429
So my question is,
is there something

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:41.030
that I can do so that I don't
prep him in the wrong way

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.430
so that when we
reach five, I can

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:47.110
coach him to be
better [INAUDIBLE],,

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.480
coaching him [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.646
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Oh, dear.

00:34:49.646 --> 00:34:53.100
There are no wrongs when
it comes to parenting.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.080
No, the book is not
only useful from five--

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.810
the coaching conversations
are only useful from five,

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.560
because at that point,
they're able-- they

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.120
have a greater theory of mind.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.940
They're able to understand
consequences and have

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.304
enough vocabulary
for conversations.

00:35:07.304 --> 00:35:08.720
But in fact, what
the book does is

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.000
it looks at how the
brain develops right

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.020
from the beginning.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.230
And it looks at the foundations
of fluid intelligence, which

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:18.690
is memory capacity and
processing speed in the brain.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:22.040
It also looks at how a baby's
brain develops in response

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.750
to its environment, which
to me was incredible,

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:28.340
that if you take a child-- which
has happened in many conflict

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.530
countries-- and put
them in an orphanage

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.350
where they do nothing but
sit in a cot all day, devoid

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.080
of love and contact and
music, and their brains

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.960
are actually smaller than
other children's brains.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.270
Because they haven't had an
environmental stimulation.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.120
And the connections in our
brain grow from stimulation.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.270
So actually, we go right
from the very beginning,

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.952
from before your baby can talk.

00:35:48.952 --> 00:35:50.660
And we look at ways
to actually stimulate

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.270
processing speed and
memory capacity, games

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.080
that you can play.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.550
It's all games.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.604
We look at things like
when my son was young,

00:35:57.604 --> 00:35:58.520
we lived in Singapore.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.840
And there are the parking lots.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.780
There'd be 5,000 parking
bays in a parking lot.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.970
And it would be over 17 floors.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.230
And you forget where
you parked your car.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.110
So I would always just
put it on my phone

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.540
so that I knew when I came
out, which floor I was on,

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.072
which parking bay, which color.

00:36:13.072 --> 00:36:15.280
It was kind of a whole list
of things we had to know.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.420
But eventually, we
played this little game

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.630
where we put the phones away.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.707
And we said, OK, let's remember
where we parked the car.

00:36:21.707 --> 00:36:23.040
And we would look at the colors.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.880
So we would go, it was number
17 B on the seventh floor.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.640
And we'd come up with rhymes--
so 17 baboons in the whatever

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640
it was.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.090
And these are fun things
that are absolutely

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:39.890
developing that
brain capacity that

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:42.800
will be so important later
for all these other things

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.280
that your child needs.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.990
So if you're loving your
child, talking to your child,

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:50.450
and actually spending
time with them

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.540
away from devices and phones
and that sort of thing--

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.430
because a baby can--

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.470
a young child can only
see about 30 centimeters

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.340
in front of them.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.350
And that is so that
they can focus,

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.670
so that they're actually
not distracted at all.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.960
And if you can have that quality
face-to-face time talking,

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.200
using words as big as you want.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.410
And let them hear it.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.317
They don't get that from a TV
show, because-- from cartoons--

00:37:12.317 --> 00:37:14.150
because the facial
expressions and the words

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:17.300
are not congruent, or
necessarily congruent.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.790
So it's very important
that they hear us.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:23.740
So keep going-- very important
from the very beginning.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.060
It's actually a pivotal age,
that sort of under three.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.216
In fact, all the critical brain
mass that a child will have

00:37:31.216 --> 00:37:32.840
is fully developed
by three and a half.

00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:35.670
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
I'm you sure

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.086
you're probably
doing a great job.

00:37:37.086 --> 00:37:39.555
Don't be too hard on yourself.

00:37:39.555 --> 00:37:42.441
Do we have another question
at the back there, John?

00:37:42.441 --> 00:37:45.491
Then we've got a few
at the front as well.

00:37:45.491 --> 00:37:47.256
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that you spent

00:37:47.256 --> 00:37:50.300
some time coaching young
adults, graduate students,

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.610
et cetera, about these skills.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.720
And how does that differ,
in your experience,

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.644
from coaching a young child,
like your son or someone

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:02.250
else, some other minor?

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.860
And again, how
might that coaching

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.426
differ from self-teaching
these skills,

00:38:06.426 --> 00:38:08.050
so how might these
different modalities

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.341
to acquire these skills differ?

00:38:09.341 --> 00:38:11.537
And what does that tell us?

00:38:11.537 --> 00:38:13.370
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: OK,
so the big difference

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.830
between working with
young adults and children

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:18.980
is self-confidence
and self-belief.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.650
I find that young children
are still very much looking

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:25.460
to you for the answers,
whereas young adults feel

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.420
they have the answers.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.030
They just want you to
check on their thinking.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.820
And that's just two different
modalities, two different ways

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.110
of working with them.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.352
So with young children, you have
to be their choice architect,

00:38:36.352 --> 00:38:37.310
give them the guidance.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.601
Because they don't know, right?

00:38:38.601 --> 00:38:41.120
They know what they've
experienced from friends and TV

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.040
and superheroes and stuff.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.860
So there's a lot more in
terms of intervention.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.581
There's a lot more of
yourself that you put into it.

00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:50.330
Working with young
adults, it's a lot more

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:54.860
checking what they're thinking
and definitely not telling them

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.620
what you think, unless
they ask, but helping them

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.170
discover for themselves, so
very much like the conversation

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:04.040
that you heard but actually
asking those questions,

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.840
just probing, probing,
asking, asking,

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.330
letting them go off and
discover, come back, check,

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:09.920
and work with it.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.920
And when it comes to
working with yourself,

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.890
it's quite difficult. It's the
most difficult of all of them.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:20.240
Because you are asking
questions about your thinking

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.850
with the thinking that is
producing the thinking.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.280
So this is
particularly difficult.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.130
This is why having
a sounding board--

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.570
not necessarily a coach,
but just somebody to say,

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.050
hey, this is what I'm thinking.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:32.100
What do you think?

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.460
How would you find
fault with me?

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.030
So again, it's something--
and I'm doing a PhD now

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.190
in this critical thinking
decision science.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.890
And what I'm finding,
the foundation of it

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:45.920
is the ability to be
reflective, to actually say,

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.970
these are my frames.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.090
This is where I'm coming from.

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:50.090
But that's what I think.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:50.590
Hang on.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.530
Is that really true?

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.420
Are these actually my
frames, and going back,

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.253
speaking to other people,
checking yourself.

00:39:56.264 --> 00:39:57.680
I have this
particular background.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.470
This is who I am.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.020
How does it affect my thinking?

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.370
Because that affects
your decision making.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:03.500
Because that affects how
you process information.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.510
So the big difference
in working with yourself

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.430
is brutal honesty.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.260
And that, my friend, is the
hardest thing in the world.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.285
But it's doable.

00:40:11.285 --> 00:40:11.970
Yeah.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.386
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's great,

00:40:13.386 --> 00:40:16.250
so questioning your biases,
your frame of reference,

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.975
maybe even arguing
against yourself?

00:40:17.975 --> 00:40:19.475
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
Absolutely, yeah.

00:40:19.475 --> 00:40:20.360
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Or the other person

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.026
would say, their point
of view might be.

00:40:22.026 --> 00:40:24.210
Won't We have a question
up at the top of the room.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.266
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
A couple here.

00:40:25.266 --> 00:40:27.432
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
[INAUDIBLE] our last one there.

00:40:30.162 --> 00:40:31.620
AUDIENCE: So my
question is related

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.883
to the one about raising a
child in a totalitarian system.

00:40:34.883 --> 00:40:36.383
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
Oh, the hard one.

00:40:36.383 --> 00:40:37.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.410
So what does the child's safety.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:42.720
The other part is that it's not
even a totalitarian society,

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.770
but I think any society.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.110
We have a lot of things that
are enforced by societies

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.910
say that are counter--

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.750
essentially not logical.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:55.830
And if you raise your child
to be a critical thinker--

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.390
I'm trying to be
critical thinker.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:59.330
And I get a lot of
frustration out of that.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.087
Because for example,
I have to operate

00:41:01.087 --> 00:41:04.580
in environments
which are extremely

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.320
illogical and frustration.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.890
And it doesn't bring me
happiness in some way.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:14.480
You know, there is a component
of unhappiness because you--

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.311
for example, if people around
you force you to obey something

00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:18.830
that doesn't make sense.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:23.466
So if we are talking about
raising a happy person,

00:41:23.466 --> 00:41:26.664
how do you raise a person
who is a critical thinker

00:41:26.664 --> 00:41:30.280
and is not getting happy because
of the state of the world?

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.280
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: That
is a brilliant question.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.560
And my son has already
hit up against this.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.890
Brexit-- he is so
unhappy about Brexit.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.590
And he can't understand Brexit.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.240
And he's in an
international school.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.270
He grew up in Asia.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:44.220
He loves England.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.690
And then Brexit happens.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.430
And he's trying
to understand it.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.320
Now, this is theory of mind.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.450
This is the ability
to say that I

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.160
have a certain way of thinking.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.290
And for me, that is
logical and correct.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.630
And there's a big question
about what is logical

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.967
and what is rationality.

00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:01.800
But I have to respect
that other people have

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.660
a different way of
thinking because

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.400
of their different
frames and filters

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.040
and where they were raised
and how they were brought up.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.070
So part of that maturity
and that ability

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.380
to be happy with my life
is to know that this

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.150
is my decision making.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:17.940
And these are the boundaries
within which I work.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.060
I cannot affect everybody
else's thinking.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.050
So you know--

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:23.550
AUDIENCE: But they
can affect yours.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.220
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Absolutely.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:24.505
Absolutely.

00:42:24.505 --> 00:42:25.662
AUDIENCE: That's the
problem I'm talking about.

00:42:25.662 --> 00:42:26.490
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Yeah, Yes.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:28.680
But if you know that you're
making the right decisions--

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.280
you see--

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.350
and this is the coach in me--

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.870
nobody can make you unhappy.

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.900
You choose to be unhappy.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.210
And it's easy for me to
say that, sitting up there.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.850
I know that.

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.772
But again, it is that choice.

00:42:42.772 --> 00:42:44.730
And the minute somebody
else makes you unhappy,

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:49.200
it's a powerlessness
that you're accepting.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.590
So again, that critical thinker
in you-- because emotions

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.700
are about 60% of our
thinking, of our decisions.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.920
And that emotional
content that is coming in

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.290
is not making you happy.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.540
And you're giving power to it.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.260
So the idea is to
understand, well,

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.780
what power do I have
over other people,

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.590
and then being able
to step away and say,

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:09.760
this is my decision making.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.570
And it's good.

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:12.600
You cannot change other
people's thinking,

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.760
as much as we cannot
change Brexit.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.350
But it's what we do with that.

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:18.840
I got so unhappy with
Singapore and Hong

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.810
Kong having the top two
education systems in the world

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:22.920
that I wrote a book.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.540
And I feel better about it.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.100
Because I'm doing
something about it.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.140
Because it used to
drive me insane that--

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.100
I went looking.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.650
Because schools keep saying
they teach critical thinking.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:32.760
I was going, really?

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.882
Let me see what
they're teaching.

00:43:34.882 --> 00:43:36.840
And it turns out that
what schools are teaching

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.840
is a critical application
or a real world application

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.760
of mathematical concepts.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.695
Fantastic.

00:43:42.695 --> 00:43:43.320
Kids need that.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.350
We all need that.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:46.420
That's not critical thinking.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.610
Critical thinking is
thinking about your thinking.

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:51.750
So there is no quick
answer or quick solution.

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:53.880
But again, it's
that having power

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.400
over other people's decision
making, where the limits are

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.970
and how much you're
prepared to accept.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.350
And that is not even a
critical thinking issue.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.450
That is more an emotional issue.

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.180
It doesn't help, but
does it make sense?

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:06.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it does.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.300
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
OK, fantastic.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.591
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Thank you.

00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:11.370
So we're just out of time.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:15.150
So as we close, what's one
thing we can all do today

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.760
to improve our decision making?

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.440
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
Question ourselves

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.794
before we question the facts.

00:44:20.794 --> 00:44:22.710
Question how we're looking
at the information,

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:24.480
question our frames.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.350
That's one thing.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:26.210
That's a couple of things.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.400
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
No, that's great.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.600
The more the merrier.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.200
TREMAINE DU PREEZ: Yeah.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.783
I was sitting with
a coach last night.

00:44:29.783 --> 00:44:32.400
And she was showing
me this new system

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.230
and profiling tool
that she's looking at.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.410
She was so excited about it.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:37.220
And it had positive
and negative.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.870
And I kept thinking, well,
who decided that those

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:40.800
were positive traits?

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.140
And who decided that those
were negative traits?

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.720
Because in Asia, a lot of
what we as Western people

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.570
think are negative
are super positive.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.930
And my immediate reaction to
any new piece of information

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.020
is to say, oh, hang on.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:53.720
Where does this come from?

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.928
Who decided it was like this?

00:44:54.928 --> 00:44:56.070
And does it work for me?

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.030
And do I accept it?

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.210
So not to say there's
anything wrong with what

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:03.084
she presented, but for me,
it's important to question it.

00:45:03.084 --> 00:45:04.500
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's great.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.615
Thank you so much.

00:45:05.615 --> 00:45:06.420
And thank you for coming
[INAUDIBLE] today.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.020
TREMAINE DU PREEZ:
It's a pleasure.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.020
Thank you for having me.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.370
[APPLAUSE]
