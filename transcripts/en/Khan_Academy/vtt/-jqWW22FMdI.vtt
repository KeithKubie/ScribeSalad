00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:01.454
- [Instructor] So we have a circle here,

00:00:01.454 --> 00:00:03.527
let's say that we know
that its circumference

00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:06.944
is equal to six pi, I'll write it, units.

00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:10.795
Whatever our units happen to be.

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:12.211
Let's see if we can figure out,

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:15.967
given that its circumference
is 6 pi of these units,

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:18.689
what is the area going to be equal to?

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.288
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:22.724
on your own.

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:24.581
And first, think about
if you could figure out

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:26.909
the area for this particular circle,

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.175
and then let's see if we can come up

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.518
with a formula for
given any circumference,

00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:33.903
can we figure out the area and vice versa.

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:35.623
Alright now let's work
through this together.

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:36.591
The key here is to realize

00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:39.407
that from circumference
you can figure out radius

00:00:39.407 --> 00:00:42.327
and then from radius
you can figure out area.

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:46.721
So we know that circumference,
which is six pi,

00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:50.888
so we know six pi is equal
to two pi times r, radius.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:55.735
And so what is the radius going to be?

00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:58.750
So the radius, we're
talking about that distance,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.271
well we can divide both sides by two pi,

00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:03.751
so let's do that.

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.598
If we divide both sides by two pi,

00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:09.181
to solve for r, what are we left with?

00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:12.014
Well we have an r on the right hand side,

00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:15.294
we have r is equal to pi divided by pi,

00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:16.501
that's just one.

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.985
Six divided by two is three.

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:21.888
So we get that our
radius, right over here,

00:01:21.888 --> 00:01:23.888
is equal to three units.

00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:26.927
And then we can use the fact

00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:30.317
that are is equal to pi, r squared,

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:32.088
to figure out the area.

00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:36.255
This is going to be equal
to pi times three squared.

00:01:37.777 --> 00:01:39.443
Oh and you have to
write parenthesis there.

00:01:39.443 --> 00:01:42.932
Pi, times three, squared,
which is of course

00:01:42.932 --> 00:01:45.285
going to be equal to nine pi.

00:01:45.285 --> 00:01:46.900
So for this particular example,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.972
when the circumference is six pi units,

00:01:48.972 --> 00:01:50.818
we're able to figure out that the area,

00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:54.034
this is actually going to
be nine pi square units,

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:56.028
or I could write units squared.

00:01:56.028 --> 00:01:57.812
Cause we're squaring the radius.

00:01:57.812 --> 00:01:59.868
The radius is three units,

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:03.525
so you square that, you
get the units squared.

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:06.428
Now let's see if we can come
up with a general formula.

00:02:06.428 --> 00:02:10.595
So we know that circumference
is equal to two pi r.

00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:15.928
And we know that area is
equal to pi r squared.

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.905
Can we come up with an expression

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:23.923
or a formula that relates directly between

00:02:23.923 --> 00:02:25.578
circumference and area?

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.289
And I'll give you a hint, solve for,

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.785
you could solve for r right over here,

00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:34.559
and substitute back into
this equation, or vice versa.

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.041
Pause the video, see if you can do that.

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:38.350
Alright, so let's do it over here.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.457
Let's solve for r.

00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:42.490
If we divide both sides by two pi,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.077
do it in another color,

00:02:44.077 --> 00:02:46.613
so if we divide both sides by two pi,

00:02:46.613 --> 00:02:48.917
and this is exactly what we did up here,

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:50.175
what are we left with?

00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:52.580
We're left with on the right hand side,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.150
r is equal to c the
circumference divided by two pi,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.317
the radius is equal to the
circumference over two pi.

00:03:01.432 --> 00:03:03.621
And so when we're figuring out the area,

00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:07.788
area, remember, is equal to
pi times our radius squared.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.899
But we know that our
radius could be written

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.459
as circumference divided by two pi.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.523
So instead of radius I'll write
circumference over two pi.

00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:18.273
Remember, we want to relate between area

00:03:18.273 --> 00:03:20.083
and circumference.

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:22.313
And so what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:26.480
We get area is equal to pi
times circumference squared,

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.979
over two pi squared is four pi squared.

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:36.608
Now let's see, we have a pi,

00:03:36.608 --> 00:03:39.988
if we multiplied this out,
we'd have a pi in the numerator

00:03:39.988 --> 00:03:41.401
and a pi in the denominator,

00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:43.838
or two pi's in the
denominator being multiplied.

00:03:43.838 --> 00:03:46.021
So pi divided by pi squared,

00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:50.303
is just one over pi, and
so there you have it.

00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:54.470
Area is equal to circumference
squared divided by four pi.

00:03:57.356 --> 00:03:58.843
Let me write that down.

00:03:58.843 --> 00:04:01.867
So this is a neat, you don't
tend to learn this formula,

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.651
but it's cool that we
were able to derive it.

00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:07.616
Area is equal to circumference
squared over four pi.

00:04:07.616 --> 00:04:09.068
And we can go the other way around.

00:04:09.068 --> 00:04:10.813
Given an area, how do we
figure out circumference?

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:12.434
Well you could just put
the numbers in here,

00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:14.093
or you could just solve for c.

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:17.176
Let's multiply both sides by four pi.

00:04:18.437 --> 00:04:20.750
Let's multiply both sides by four pi,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.207
and if we do that, what do we get?

00:04:23.207 --> 00:04:27.102
We would get four pi
times the area is equal to

00:04:27.102 --> 00:04:29.054
our circumference squared

00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:30.395
and then to solve for the circumference

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:33.133
we just take the square
root of both sides.

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:37.947
So you would get the square
root of four pi times the area

00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:40.280
is equal to r circumference.

00:04:41.755 --> 00:04:43.932
And you could simplify this
a little bit if you wanted.

00:04:43.932 --> 00:04:45.713
You could take the four
out of the radical,

00:04:45.713 --> 00:04:46.699
but this is pretty neat,

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.874
how you can relate circumference and area.
