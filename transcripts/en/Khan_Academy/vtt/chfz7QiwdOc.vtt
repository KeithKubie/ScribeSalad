00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.930
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.610
is think about how a person's
environment or experiences

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.980
affects their political perspective,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.880
their political attitude.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.920
So one way to think about it
is how is your socialization,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.670
your political socialization?

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.820
How does that drive your
political attitudes?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.510
And I encourage you pause this video,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.620
think about your own political leanings

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.510
whether you lean to the left
or you lean to the right,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.870
where did that come from?

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.910
Was it just you in a vacuum
thinking about things

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.530
or were you influenced by your family,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.940
your friends, your
school, maybe the media,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.060
maybe something that you're part of,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.470
maybe a club or church,
mosque, synagogue or temple

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.530
and this is actually an area of study

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.340
for political scientists
and as you can imagine,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.440
some of the things that I just mentioned

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.250
are significant factors
that people have studied

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.730
in terms of what develops
people's political attitudes?

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.320
If you come from a family
of staunch Democrats,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.860
you're more likely to be a Democrat

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.500
or at least lean to the left.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.130
If the environment of your school

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.660
or what you're exposed to in school

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.150
leans one way or another, you are likely,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.250
more likely to lean in that direction.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.040
If your friends go one
direction or another,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.630
that could be a very powerful influence.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.050
Obviously, what you're
exposed to in the media

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.360
and out of all of these,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.580
the one that's maybe the most studied

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.530
is the notion of family and
to appreciate this idea,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.270
let's look at this
diagram right over here.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.880
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.280
and see if you can make sense of this

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.203
before we do that together.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.200
Alright, it says Percentage
Intergenerational Resemblance

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.200
in Partisan Orientation
and this date is from 1992.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.000
So it shows three different scenarios,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.240
one scenario where we are looking at folks

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.420
where both parents are Democrats,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.250
another scenario where
we're looking at folks

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.040
where both parents are Republicans

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.930
and then another scenario
where there's no consistent

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.310
partisanship among parents
so either they are split

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.400
or maybe they are independent

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.420
and actually, if we look at
this third scenario first,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.930
you see that it's a pretty
symmetrical distribution.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.510
Green shows, of people whose parents

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.600
showed no partisan preference,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.610
17% are pure independent,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.730
about 18% lean towards the Democrats,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.520
16% lean to the Republican.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.010
That's about the same.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.170
14% are weak Democrats.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.880
14% are weak Republicans.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.680
10% are strong Democrats.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.030
10% are strong Republicans.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.060
So it's a pretty balanced
distribution here

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.420
but then if you look at the scenario

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.250
where both parents are Democrats,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.110
you see that of those
folks, only, what is this?

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.270
This is eight plus six is 14 plus seven.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.050
Only 21% are Republicans.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.510
And if you go the other way

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.640
where both parents are Republicans,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.640
you have only 18% of those
folks become Democrats.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.520
So this is just interesting
food for thought.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.990
A lot of us really like to
believe, including myself,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.210
that hey, I've come to
all of these conclusions

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.600
based on completely impartial thoughts

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.300
about how the world should be

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.490
but we are influenced by our environment

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.290
and especially from our family

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.390
and frankly, even the folks
who go in a different direction

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.420
than their families,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.240
that might have been
because of their family.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.140
Maybe they decide that hey,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.020
that always frustrated
me one way or the other

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.410
so I'm gonna go the other way

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.160
or I'm gonna rebel a little bit

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.770
and I'm gonna go the other way
because I am a free thinker

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.070
but even in that situation,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.693
you are being influenced
by your environment.
