00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.860
One of the constantly surprising aspects of
relationships is just how much reassurance

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.230
we need to believe that we are actively wanted
– and, equally, how easy it is to forget

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.930
this awkward fact both about ourselves and
the other person. The standard narrative of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.749
love tells us that insecurity about being
wanted is going to be at its height at the

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.390
start of the dating period, when we are acutely
– and rather sweetly – conscious of the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.910
many ways in which our partner might not be
keen on taking things further. But, we assume,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.840
once a relationship has started, once there
might be children, a home and an established

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.000
pattern of life, then surely the fear of being
unwanted should disappear.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.750
But far from it. The fear of being unwanted continues

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.740
every day. There could always be new threats
to love’s integrity. Just because we were

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.829
loved yesterday does not ensure a sense that
we will be needed today. More perniciously,

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:12.710
if a fear is left to fester, it can lead us
to adopt a defensive position where, because

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.950
we assume we are unwanted, we start to behave
in a cold and detached way, which encourages

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.100
the partner to act likewise. Two people who
are, at heart, very well disposed towards

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.789
one another can end up in a cycle of each
denying that they need the other, because

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:36.070
they cautiously and pre-emptively assume that
the other person no longer wants them. In

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.619
order to try to calm these fears and cycles
of unwarranted detachment, we should be sure

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.709
to institute an apparently small but in fact
crucial ritual into our lives: a morning and

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:55.569
evening kiss. Every morning, before parting,
no matter how much in a rush we both are,

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.349
we should give one another a proper kiss on
the lips, for at least seven seconds which

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.439
is – in reality – a very strangely long
time. Lean in close together, don’t think

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.240
about the many things you have to do in the
hours ahead. Simply concentrate on the sensation

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.730
of their mouth on yours, feel your nose against
their skin. Don’t break off abruptly at

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.820
the end: keep looking at each other for another
few moments and give a smile. The same should

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.340
be repeated every evening at the point of
return. When we kiss we are tapping into a

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.450
central channel of emotional connection. Intimate
physical contact affects us in a way that’s

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.870
both distinct from, and in many ways superior
to, words or ideas. We are sensuous creatures

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.960
to at least the same degree as we are rational
ones: a smile or a caress can therefore reassure

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.820
us far more deeply than can an eloquent phrase
or a well-articulated fact (‘of course I

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.430
love you…’). As babies we were soothed
by touch long before we could understand language,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.560
and we therefore continue to need physical
contact to believe, truly to believe, that

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.070
we have a place in another’s life. Normally
a kiss follows from a tender feeling: we have

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.900
an emotion first and then we express it. But
there’s another way our minds can work,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.850
a way in which a feeling follows from an action.
The morning and evening kiss should hence

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.100
come first, independently of whether or not
there is as yet a tender emotion. But then,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.460
almost for certain, if we go through with
the kiss, the emotion will occur (it’s very

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.990
hard to kiss and feel nothing). We may need
to make that rather odd-sounding move in love:

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:53.840
a small effort. The morning and evening kiss
should be a ritual. A central feature of rituals

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.060
is that we do them whether we feel like doing
them or not. The kiss should take place even

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.150
if you’ve just had a rather sarcastic argument
or if you are racing to an important early

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.260
meeting – or if you are feeling resentful.
Better feelings will follow from it. When leaving

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.200
the house and heading to the station, we should
no longer only ask whether we have remembered

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.280
the keys or the report. We should always ask
ourselves if we have done a far more crucial

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.480
and love-sustaining thing: exchanged a seven
second kiss.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:35.360
Our Relationships Reboot Cards inspire conversations that can help to rekindle love between you and your partner.
