00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:09.090
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Thanks everyone for
coming. So, before I introduce our distinguished

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.160
guest, we actually have a couple of additional
guests that I thought I would mention. So,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.100
we have Steven Zierk and his mother, Marina.
Actually, I'm not sure his mother's name really

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.279
matters because from this moment on, you're
gonna be known as Steven Zierk's mother, for

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.330
the rest of your life. So, Steven has just
returned from Greece, where he won the World

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.089
Youth Chess Championship sponsored by the
International Chess Federation.

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:47.170
[applause]

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.539
Turns out that Steven is actually a senior
at Los Gatos High and took classes with my

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.109
son, my nephew and I'm sure is looking out
for my younger daughter, Hannah, who is a

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.699
sophomore. So, Steven, thank you for joining
us. You can sit down.

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:02.699
[laughter]

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.850
So, back in March, I read an article by Garry
Kasparov in the New York Times Review of Books

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.229
and it was a review of this book called "Chess
Metaphors," by the Spanish author, Diego Rasskin-Gutman,

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.460
and I'm passionate about issues related to
innovation, as most of you know, and a bunch

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.000
of Garry's comments in the article basically
focused on the poor state of innovation in

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.630
computer chess. And one of the things that
he observed was that because brute force programs

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.210
played chess so well, there was little innovation
on any other kind of approaches. And another

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.009
one of the things in the article that many
of you guys mentioned was that it talked about

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.789
how mixed human plus computer teams could
compete in chess and the outcome of one of

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.060
these tournaments was that amateur players,
with basically garden-variety PCs, won against

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.200
much more formidable opponents. So, it turned
out, if you read the article, that weak humans

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.250
plus machines plus very, very good process
trump a strong computer by itself, but even

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.930
more surprisingly, a strong, even more surprisingly,
a strong human plus a computer with not as

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.650
good process, which is a compelling argument
for very good UIs I think. But there was lots

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.140
of applicability, I thought, in this article
to some of the things that we think about

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.299
at Google and many people suggested that we
should bring Garry here, so, we did. If you

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.470
don't already know, Garry Kasparov became
the youngest undisputed world chess champion

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.260
ever when he won the title at age 22, in 1985.
Steve, you have four more years.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.090
[chuckles]

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.580
So, 20 years later, he retired from chess
as the highest rated player in the world;

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.170
many people consider him the greatest player
to ever play the game and he's a widely published

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.459
author on a whole bunch of different subjects,
from leadership, on leadership and strategic

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.621
thinking and he's a significant player and
active in Russian politics. So, I thought

00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:14.459
we'd get started with Udi. I think we have
a slide. Udi--

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.459
[laughter]

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:22.879
played a simultaneous match with Garry in
2005. I suppose I could ask Garry what the

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.209
outcome of the match was, but I don't think
it was particularly remarkable.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.209
[laughter]

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.830
So, Udi, I'll just ask you. How many moves
did you last?

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.830
[laughter]

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.380
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: I actually lasted 23 moves,
which was a lot more than I expected.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.730
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Woohoo!

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.730
[clapping]

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.000
Where did you play?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.049
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: This was in San Francisco.

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.049
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: In San Francis--

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.049
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: In San Francisco, yes, the,
it was right after the--

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.129
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: So, I know Udi has some
questions, which I thought maybe we could

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.129
start with --

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.129
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: About the game?

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.129
[Udi and Garry laugh]

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.129
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Actually, I can tell you a story
about this game.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.129
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Ok.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.129
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: I think you might enjoy this--

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.129
&gt;&gt;Garryi: Go ahead, [ ].

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.659
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: So, when somebody asked me just
before we played-- this was a simultaneous

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.860
game-- somebody asked me what do I think my
odds are. I thought about it for a second,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.040
I said, "Well, I think about a billion to
one." And he said, "No, you got it wrong.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.609
You'll have to make every move exactly perfect
for about 50 moves and even if you know chess,

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:18.640
it'll be about five choices per move, so it's
five to the fifty. It's way over a billion."

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.640
[laughter]

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.180
And I said, "No, no, no, no. You got it all
wrong. That's not how I figured it out." I

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.330
was trying to figure out in my head, what
are the odds of the chandelier falling on

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.380
his head in the middle of the game?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.380
[laughter]

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.560
The odds are, the odds are much better that
way. So then, the game was played in The Palace

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.270
Hotel in San Francisco and we enter the game.
You can see there -- it's a really big room,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.471
huge, high ceiling with a huge chandelier
right in the middle.

00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:53.740
[presenter laughs]

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.860
So, during the game I had to--

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.610
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: There was no earthquake
that day.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.500
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: That's right. So, luckily, the
odds were right and the chandelier is still

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.840
there, but I had to avoid from laughing and
looking up through the game. So, that's my

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.030
story; I'm sticking to it.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.940
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Just to follow this, the
subject you touched is briefly about the numbers.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.940
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Ok.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.090
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: And the odds. Say, this,
this, when we talk about chess and computers,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.410
the general crowd always gets confused, saying,
"Wow. It's a chess, with the game, 64 squares,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.490
32 pieces. So, how long does it take for machine
to, to finish the game off like it happen

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.521
with checkers to solve the game?" So, just
people don't understand that if, I don't know

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:38.580
whether we can calculate the number, but according
to the so-called Shannon paper, published

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.520
in 1950, the number of all legal moves in
the game of chess is ten to the power of 120.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.460
It's quite a big number. It says, it's considered
is the another tentative number of ten to

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.620
the power 78, which is the number of atoms
in the observable universe. So, that's why

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.660
chess so far is safe from being cracked by
the computers. But, of course, it's the, so

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:11.470
the Moore's Law was good enough to guarantee
that in the, from the practical terms, chess

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.310
was solved by computers in less than 50 years
because machines now are probably beating

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.770
every player; capable of beating every player.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.760
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: I was about to say, when it
come to Google, they say things like this,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.940
you just present a challenge.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.940
[laughter]

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.940
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Challenge at what?

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.940
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: To do that.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.410
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: To do that? So, which number
you have in mind?

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.590
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: The ten to the 120.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.590
[Garry laughs]

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.930
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It's good, you know?

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.730
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Maybe we'll go with
both questions from the audience and if you

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.270
guys can give us the Dory questions, we'll
try to incorporate as many of those. Udi and

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.730
I also have questions, but if we could flip
here to the Dory, that would--

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.730
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Lemme, lemme start with --

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.450
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: but I know Udi's got
some questions to start with.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.450
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: My questions.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.450
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Go, Udi.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.790
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: So, obviously in chess--

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.790
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Nice start.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.940
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Wanna do this?

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.940
&gt;Garry: Nice start.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.940
[Garry laughs]

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.940
Yeah, by the way--

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.940
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Ok.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.630
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: that's a very good question
because it's--

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.501
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Our tradition is that
we read the question--

00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:05.501
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Ok, fine.

00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:08.690
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: so that they can all
see it. The first question, by the way, the

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.400
first thing Garry said just to show you Udi
and I have worked hard to prepare some brilliant

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.760
questions, he's a fan of James Serwicki and
when we told him about Dory, he immediately

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.660
said, "Well, that must be better than whatever
the two of you think." So, he likes the first

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.470
question better than ours in any case. The
first question is, "Can you explain what made

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.120
you claim that game two move 37, presumably--

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.230
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Yeah. We shift to E4.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.830
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: "was shift to E4, was
a move that a computer couldn't have made?

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.880
Do you still believe IBM cheated?"

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.280
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: No, it's--

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.280
[laughter]

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:47.870
It's -- I say, they say, but we can probably
try to reach a scientific conclusion in measuring

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.080
our statements. The only problem is that at
the end of the match, they dismantled Deep

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.120
Blue and I said, "They killed the only partial
witness."

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.340
[laughter]

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.910
It's actually related to the subject that
you touched, it's from in my article, about

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:10.640
man versus machine; an actual man plus machine.
And when I, when we talked about this game--game

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:18.120
two-- and I made a claim and I'm still behind
this claim that there was some kind of artificial

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.470
interference that time human interference.
People ask me, "What did you mean that, was

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:28.860
it Anatoly Karpov, a very strong player, behind
the computer?" Which is, it just showed us

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.400
the crowd didn't actually understand the whole
nature of possible interference. Because when

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.959
we have a game, say, game between two computers,
one or two advices from humans could change

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:44.330
everything because you don't a very strong
player actually to help machine, to guide

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:51.370
machine. And just to give this human judgment,
intuitive judgment, strategic judgment, to

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.480
make sure that machine doesn't go wrong way.
And other way around. Say you have two humans

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.939
playing; one or two advices--quote/unquote--
from the computer, could be, could be decisive.

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:05.660
Even a hint that there is the combination
there, so because very often, one would play,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:12.170
we don't know whether the, it, something that
is tempting is going to work. I remember I

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:17.500
played it in, long time ago in 1996, at a
very big tournament. I played against Viswanathan,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.600
the current World Champion, and I thought
I was winning and I saw the combination, but

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.860
it was too long and I just calculated for
about half an hour; just move seven, move

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:32.370
eight. I smell that there was a blood there,
but I, eventually I decided to go for a safer

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.850
route, also keeping advantage and then after
the game, my coach asked me why did I do that?

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.610
I said, "Look, I couldn't see it." Then he
said, "Wow. The machine, even in '96, already

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:46.279
showed that it was winning." So, just a hint
that it was the right way to go, could it

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:50.980
force me to go deeper and to find a solution?
Now, what's happening in game two and why

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.270
I made this claim is that Deep Blue, again,
from what we know about this computer and

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.590
the problem is that there's not enough information
to analyze because, as I said, they dismantled

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:07.110
it and all scientific tests made later, when
they put the games I played against Deep Blue

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:12.199
to be analyzed by other computers--modern
computers--much weaker computers in term of

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:16.750
brute force of calculation, but was more chess
understanding, showed that Deep Blue was not

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:22.180
exceptional. So, the machines today, they
are doing better by going through, through

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:29.259
all these games. And to make a very solid
positional move instead of winning three points,

00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:38.949
gaining decisive material advantage was highly
unusual for computer of that strength. What

00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:45.220
I wanted to see, I wanted to see the logs.
So, they never produced the logs and it's

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.749
actually, same things happen in game five.
But again, ok, it was my mistake. I didn't

00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:58.760
put enough pressure to secure the integrity
of the game and recently, by the way, there

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.490
was an interesting interview of one of the
"seconds" – quote, unquote, seconds, assistants

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:07.749
of Deep Blue, Spanish Grand Master Miguel
Illescas for, in the chess magazine, New In

00:11:07.749 --> 00:11:11.961
Chess, the most popular chess magazine, and
some of the stories he told about this match,

00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:17.410
they were again, could be used as a consequential
evidence to support my, my theory. Even the

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:24.329
fact that upon the request of the team, the
IBM team, the IBM corporates changed the,

00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:31.319
the guards next to my green room, making sure
that these guards speaks Russian to communicate

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:36.259
all information they could gather for my conversation
with my coach. Ok, consequential evidence.

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:39.879
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: So, just following up
on that, if we assume that IBM did cheat,--

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:44.240
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: No, IBM wanted, let's, let's,
let's, let's, let's, let's, let's use in a

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.240
diplomatic statement--

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.240
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Assume there was a human,
there was a human--

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.240
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: it's for IBM--

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.240
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Oh, you're a, you're
a diplomat now, I forgot.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.240
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: we need, we need, I'm not
a diplomat, you know.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.970
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: I'm not a diplomat,
so I was gonna posit that they cheated.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.819
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Yeah, but, I don't want
group of lawyers too often, yeah. I, they

00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:59.959
didn't even hide the fact that for them it
was about winning or losing. So, they did

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:04.480
everything to win. And certain thing that
happened in the match, even the fact is that

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:11.449
they were very following the story of Miguel
Illescas, they even knew the opening I would

00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:16.500
play in the last game. Yeah, ok. By accident,
probably, considering the fact that I never

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.259
played it before in my life and never after.

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:19.259
[laughter]

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:25.519
Yeah, it's, IBM shares jumped 22 percent during
two weeks, so that was a big--

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:26.519
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: They got what they wanted.

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:27.519
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: They did?

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:32.470
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Ok, that's happened, those
are two. They wanted to win badly and for

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:40.339
me, it was more of the scientific or social
experiment and I expected this to be, to continue,

00:12:40.339 --> 00:12:44.879
and I asked for the rubber match because I
won the first match in Philadelphia. They

00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:48.999
won the second match and as I said, they immediately
dismantled the computer. That was a really

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:50.689
bad sign.

00:12:50.689 --> 00:12:57.610
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: So, what kind of things
would tell you, if you were engaged in a match,

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.759
that would be a clear tell that a human had
become involved? Intuitively, what are the

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:05.889
types of things that would actually just,
almost be a smoking gun to you that would

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:06.889
say that--

00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:12.259
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It's the, yeah, but, again,
let's do the opposite now. In a big chess

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:19.709
playing website now, for instance, a playchess.com,
you have this anti-cheating system. So, the

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:24.270
computer actually looking for games played
by some players and the moment it sees too

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:30.980
many games made by computers or, not made,
but potentially made by the computer, it assumes

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:38.470
that it is cheating. So, it's, as for the
game, game two or other games I played with

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:44.680
the computer or computers playing each other,
you could, if you know enough about the machine,

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.759
if you know enough about the decision making
algorithm and about the priorities, because

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:55.800
every machine at the end of the day has to
operate with a preordained system of priorities.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.209
For instance, it's all about numbers. If you
put sort of the very high numbers on king

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:08.249
security--king safety-- so, it will stay the
same way. You cannot, machine cannot regroup

00:14:08.249 --> 00:14:13.499
these priorities based on the care of the
position. So, if you can understand, more

00:14:13.499 --> 00:14:19.569
or less, the concept behind this decision
making algorithm, you will feel immediately

00:14:19.569 --> 00:14:24.829
that there is the, there was an interference.
And ten years ago, I said I would need 15

00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:29.800
to 20 games to identify the playing program,
whether it was Fritz or Junior or another

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.259
one. Now, machines are getting sort of more
sophisticated. There is sometimes some kind

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:44.949
of intuitive element in the game because they're
more flexibility in sacrificing the material,

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:52.559
actually accepting the fact that other factors
could trump this material advantage, but in,

00:14:52.559 --> 00:15:00.200
back in 1997, it was impossible. So, machine
turning down very generous offer to win huge

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:09.439
material for positional, to, for a move to
increase positional pressure; I didn't believe

00:15:09.439 --> 00:15:10.439
that.

00:15:10.439 --> 00:15:11.439
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Hmm.

00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:13.619
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Actually, Ken Thompson is here
in the audience.

00:15:13.619 --> 00:15:14.619
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Yeah.

00:15:14.619 --> 00:15:15.619
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: And I remember--

00:15:15.619 --> 00:15:16.619
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Ken was watching the screen.

00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:17.619
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: hearing from him--

00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:18.619
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: I saw him.

00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:20.990
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: that he had some inside information.
I don't know if you want to share with us

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.010
later about that.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.010
[laughter]

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:29.769
Ken was one of the judges of that, that game.
I actually wanted to ask you, lemme take one

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:31.761
question, a general question about decision
making. Or you rather go with?

00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:39.189
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: No, no. It's up to you.
I'm a guest.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.189
[laughter]

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:43.180
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: And, by the way, there's very
simple way to add intuition to computer programs

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:49.399
and I've learned that a long time ago that
you just introduce bugs.

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:50.399
[laughter]

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:58.100
I'm very good at that, too. So, my question
really is that part of being a really good

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.389
player is not just making the right moves,
but knowing how much time to spend thinking

00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:07.550
about every move. And that's one thing we
don't do in business that much. We usually,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.990
the time we spend is proportional to the importance
of the decision.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.490
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: How do you know the importance
of the decision?

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.110
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Estimate. But not even that,
I'm sure that's not even been decided yet.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.720
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: How much time you spend
to estimate, to make the correct estimate?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.720
[laughter]

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.600
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: So, my question to you exactly
is what should we do? How much time should

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.709
we spend and how do we decide how much time
to spend on a decision? Cause that's what

00:16:26.709 --> 00:16:29.079
you do in every game.

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:35.519
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: In chess, we are, I'm retired,
so my chess experience is five years old.

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:40.959
So, I don't play professional chess now. But
in chess, you are under time constraints.

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:46.730
So, you have whatever, two hours for 40 moves
or half an hour for the whole game, so you

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:53.760
know exactly your, the time allowed for you
to make all the decisions. So, you have to

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.959
adjust. Obviously, if you play rapid chess
or bullet chess--

00:16:56.959 --> 00:16:57.959
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Sure.

00:16:57.959 --> 00:17:01.630
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: you have to understand that
you sacrifice the quality of your decisions

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:08.130
to make sure that you are not losing on time.
So, at the end of the day, as I already in

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:13.070
my book, "How Life Imitates Chess", every
decision, whether it's made at the chess board,

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:19.730
in business, at home, in the White House,
its all, every decision contains components

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.670
of material, time, and quality. And while
material and time is understandable, then

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:31.480
the quality is a factor that we all have to
adjust to our decision making system. When

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:38.500
one can become comfortable with micromanagement
or just looking at the big picture, at the

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:44.490
end of the day, it's all unique. So, I don't
think that there is the universal advice for

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:50.600
anybody who wants to make an intelligent decision.
Some people should do it quicker because if

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:56.610
they spend more time, they going around. So,
some people should take more time because

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:03.030
they need to look at every element. It's absolutely
unique as DNA or fingerprints.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:07.440
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Ok. So, it looks like
all the Googlers wanna get better at chess,

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.390
so the next question is, "What is the best
way for somebody who does not quite have the

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.370
time to devote their life to chess, to improve
their game?"

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:18.770
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Now, the counter question
is if you don't have time to devote your life

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.520
for chess, why do you want to improve the
game?

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.440
[laughter]

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:30.300
So, it's just to beat your neighbor, to impress
someone or to catch up with your kids. So,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:37.740
now with computers, I don't know how much
time you can allow to play chess while you're

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:44.680
here, so but definitely on, with the computer
technologies, you can do a lot, even without

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:51.130
reading books. But, I think that's always
the limitations because so many kids now and

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:57.200
so many people who have more time to spend
on chess and it will be quite a challenge.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.560
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Ok, let's go to one
in the audience here.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.560
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Frank?

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.840
&gt;&gt;member #1: So, you were the youngest World
Chess Champion, too.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: I was.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.530
&gt;&gt;member #1: But you couldn't be the World
Chess Champion at 21, right? Can you talk

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.680
about the politics around what happened with
that match where you didn't become?

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:21.710
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: You mean 1984, yeah? It
was long time ago and he's definitely, you,

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.330
you're somewhat of a chess expert because
you, I guess you read enough books to remember

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.770
this match. How old are you?

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.120
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: You weren't born.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.120
[laughter]

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.120
&gt;&gt;member #1: Yes.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.120
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: How old are you?

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.120
&gt;&gt;member #1: 29

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.120
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: 29--

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.120
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: You were born.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.330
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Just ok, just--

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.330
[laughter]

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:46.050
Yes, yes, yes. Nursery school. Yeah. I was,
as you remember, I was trailing behind badly;

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:52.280
losing five to zero, so Karpov had to win
one more game to retain the title. He couldn't

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.330
win this game. Eventually, I won three more
games, was catching up, and then the match

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:04.240
was stopped and started again seven or eight
months later--eight months later. And there

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.450
was a clear case of interference by Soviet
officials. I think that they just believed

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:21.140
that it would be too much pressure on Karpov
to continue the game. I didn't like it, so

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.940
the official decision made by International
Chess Federation stated clearly that Karpov

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:32.560
agreed; it's part of debate. So, that's, look,
at the end of the day, I won the title and

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:41.130
this match was a great lesson for me because
it probably made the ultimate mark on my character.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:50.340
So, trailing bad, so badly, losing beyond
any hope to survive and eventually surviving

00:20:50.340 --> 00:21:00.120
and beating Karpov eight months later; it
was a proof to me that there's no situation

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.190
you, in your life where you have to give up.
So, that was a very, very good lesson. So,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.060
I'm grateful to Karpov for help me to, to
build up my character.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.060
[laughter]

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.060
&gt;&gt;member #1: Thanks.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.060
[applause]

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.440
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Why don't we let--

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.910
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Ok.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.930
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: I wanna take the next question
from the Dory. This is--

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.540
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Nah, but someone is ready
about to go for it.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.540
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Ok, go for it.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.540
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Please.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.370
&gt;&gt;member #2: Great. I'm really curious about
what you would tell us about your learning

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:33.380
curve? So, at 23, you're the best player in
the world. Were you better at age 30? Were

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.900
you better at age 40? When you retired, were
you the best you had ever been? Can you just

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.750
talk a little bit about, did you ever plateau
and some of the factors around your learning?

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:54.430
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: I'm always very cautious
when asked to compare players from different

00:21:54.430 --> 00:22:03.860
epochs. So, that's – let me start -- I was
 -- with general response. Now, you ask me

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:17.410
to compare Garry Kasparov with 1985 to 1995
and 2005. I play chess and I, my professional

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:23.360
chess career I mean could be divided in probably
in some sections. I'm actually writing now

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.170
the book about my best games, get Kasparov
and Kasparov, so I'm working now the fourth

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:34.550
volume. So, that's probably why I'm too sentimental
to talk about those early days and it ends

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:41.770
with the World Championship match in 84-85.
I think that probably I had two peaks in my

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:50.490
career. One was the late 80s, 89, when I broke
Fischer's record, the rating, 2785, which

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:58.800
was, many people believed it would be sustained
for very long. I crossed 2800 mark and when

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.960
I, and now not many players did it. I mean,
right now I think there's three or four. But

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:11.070
at that time when there were no players in
2700 categories, so only Karpov; that was

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:20.110
quite an accomplishment. And then it was probably
inevitable downside in the career because

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:26.590
I was, in early 90s, I had to face a younger
generation. And that for me was the biggest

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:33.720
challenge because I succeeded in being ahead
of the next generation. That's what probably

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.210
never happened before and that's what probably
kept Fischer outside of chess because he was

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:46.420
not sure he could beat Karpov in 1975. And
so, the second peak was probably 1999-2000,

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:58.780
again, that was the, my, year breaking record,
2851, which is still way above the level of

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:03.960
the best players. And then I lost the World
Championship match, probably also inevitable

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:11.940
because, whether you like it or not, but subconsciously
you become complacent. So, just, even if you

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:20.790
understand everything, at certain point, you
lose your determination. So, you want to say,

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:25.630
you want to optimize your game, or your business,
and you don't want to make any changes. So,

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.670
and again, if you don't disrupt your business,
other people do.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.670
[laughter]

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.460
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Udi, don't get complacent.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.570
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: No, no, no, no, and everybody.
That's--

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:35.570
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: I've learned that.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.350
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: That's the problem now.
That's, it happens with everybody, yes. So,

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:44.070
and then it was the last challenge for me,
after losing this match, and I don't know

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:48.380
if you know this, I haven't lost the match
because I was going down; I lost the match

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:54.170
in the middle of my longest winning streak
in a tournament. I won ten tournaments and

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:59.650
I was exactly in the middle. So, after losing
the match, I won a few more top tournaments

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:06.990
and then, again, probably it's inevitable--maybe
just – it's in the human nature. So, at

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:13.780
some point you lose your passion to search
for new horizons. Because for me, chess was

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:21.360
not just about winning or losing--so not for
IBM—yes, I wanted to make the difference.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.020
I wanted to find something new. I wanted to
make a make a contribution to the game. And

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:31.940
at one point I recognized that already I did
more than I could have ever thought of and

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:37.360
by 2002, 2003, I was mentally preparing myself
to do something else.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.230
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Well, the next question
relates to how we can do something new and

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.640
inspirational. "We once believed that if we
could build computers to play chess or pass

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:51.020
the Touring test, we would gain valuable insight
into human cognition. We were wrong. Is there

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.370
a new challenge that can inspire us to create
machines that are truly intelligent?"

00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:05.660
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Yeah. Because, because practical
chess was solved by, with simple increase,

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:13.970
in brute force of calculation, so there was
no need to look for another path just to make

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:20.840
intelligent machines. But I believe that chess
is unique playing field to look for the combination

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:30.770
of this, of the machine's power and a humans
abilities. So, it's like to solve the Moravec's

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:36.130
paradox because it's exactly what happens.
We are good at something that machines are

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:44.760
bad at and vice versa. So, by creating this
the platform for human intuition to be added

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:54.420
to machine's brute force of calculation, I
think chess computers, this kind of competition,

00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:01.511
could offer some assistance to those who are
working on their, on other things. Because

00:27:01.511 --> 00:27:06.000
I think it's just what's happening with, even
with a search. So, you want to optimize it,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.090
but you don't use the visual power of a human.
Let's say you have the--

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:14.990
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: I can't talk about that.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.990
[laughter]

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.930
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: No, no, no, but it's just,
you say it's just the, if you have O'Reilly

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:23.440
books--I don't want to use Paris Hilton, which
is, it's too known--but O'Reilly books in

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:34.410
the search. So, you will be dealing with two
different elements. So, let's say you have

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:41.960
a simple visual above the search where one
is the Fox News logo and one is the computer.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.530
So it can immediately, the human takes probably
a split second to separate, so just clicking

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:51.950
one button. So, with a machine it takes much
longer. So, in chess that's a good playing

00:27:51.950 --> 00:28:00.870
field to identify how you can do these things
by adding this, the human insight to the machine's

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:01.870
power.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.510
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Right. But if you take
that further and assume humans can bootstrap

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:09.680
the algorithm by looking at any one specific
result and saying, "This could be improved

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:15.520
by doing X or Y", how do you then scale that
in such a way that you can take those human

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.810
insights into what the bootstrapping human
would do to the algorithm and then make the

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:21.810
algorithm better?

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:26.240
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: But it's the, I'm not talking
about the merging it, I'm talking about the

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:32.640
interface. So, how you add it because you
know that machines are very good at something,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.600
so, but they're not good at recognizing the
visuals. So, and that's one example. And I

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:48.490
believe there are many other examples. It's
all; it's more about interface rather than

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.490
the merge.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:50.490
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Hmm. Ok. Next question.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.020
&gt;&gt;member #3: [Speaks in Russian]. Welcome.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.350
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: [Speaks in Russian].

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:57.330
&gt;&gt;member #3: [Speaks in Russian], yes. So,
I have a question about intuition and gut

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:04.970
feeling. And so, the question is do you ever
rely on a gut feeling and intuition in making

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:09.250
a decision in chess? And do you think such
thing exists?

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.250
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Oh, it does exist.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.250
&gt;&gt;member #3: Is it valid? Is it valid?

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:19.230
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It's the most valuable quality
of a human being in my view. Yeah, it's probably

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:24.290
 – we live at a time when we want just to
touch something before we can make our opinion

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:30.350
about the subject. I believe that intuition
is like any other muscle. So, like people

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:36.800
now, if you go to the gym, you improve your
physical conditions. They know that training

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.220
memory they're also exercises, but intuition
is the same. And so you have to learn how

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:49.680
to trust your intuition. My view is that we
similarly undermine the importance of intuition

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:55.210
because intuition means taking too much risk.
And we, whether we like it or not, we live

00:29:55.210 --> 00:30:03.400
in a risk adverse culture. And intuitive decision
very often cannot be explained into terms

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:11.630
that should be required by corporate culture
or by your other family members. So, in my

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:17.410
view, by adding this quality of intuition
to the decision making process, we can dramatically

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.410
improve the results.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:23.330
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: So, I see Steven is
way in the back of the line, but winning the

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.710
chess championship under 18 should allow you
to cut in the line.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.220
[laughter]

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.720
To be clear, it doesn't mean you get a job
at Google, but you do get to ask a question.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:40.050
&gt;&gt;Steven: How important would you say psychology
is in chess? So, basically like playing against

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:48.900
an individual opponent's weaknesses and what
limitations would you say this puts on computers?

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:57.870
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: The psychology is an imminent
element of any game between individuals because

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:07.350
we know that our opponents -- they have some
strengths and weaknesses and looking at the

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:14.080
games, you can analyze these potential weaknesses
and if you have two very strong players are

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:21.310
facing each other in the match, then the winner
is more likely not someone who comes up with

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:31.740
just a brand new idea, but someone who could
push the game into the direction that is,

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:38.771
will suit his strengths and will undermine
his weaknesses. It's like if you use a metaphor

00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:46.010
from the military metaphor, so in a medieval
battlefield, if you have cavalry, you're looking

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:50.680
for a valley. If you're fighting against cavalry,
you'll be looking for the hills. So, it's

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.160
about creating the environment where your
strengths will manifest and your weaknesses--

00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:01.420
and again, all weaknesses are relative. When
I played Anatoly Karpov, we were very good

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:06.490
at almost everything, but still I was more
dynamic player, he was more strategic. So,

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:12.360
it was very important to push the game in
the direction that could fit my playing style

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:19.680
more than his. And that's why, that is the
element of psychology and, by the way, it

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:27.950
could actually work in a very strange way
when you're facing the computer because many

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:34.720
computers, even today, they still have their
own strengths and own weaknesses. And if you

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:43.320
can understand so it may help you to design
the game which will be the most unpleasant

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.320
for certain computer.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.110
[laughter]

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:51.900
Because it's actually machine, it might sound
very odd, but machine definitely has a quote,

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:57.390
unquote "personality" and it very much depends
on the people behind the computer. So, some

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:01.500
of the machines are playing more aggressive
chess; some play less aggressive chess. And

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.380
again, I don't know whether it's an irony
or not, but the Israeli-made computers are

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.240
more aggressive than the German-made computer.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.240
[laughter]

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.710
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: It's challenging Silicon
Valley great, Jim Barksdale, who basically

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:18.740
said, "Who wins in a fight between an alligator
and a bear? It depends if it's in a swamp

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:26.190
or the forest." Thank you. Next, how do you
 -- jump to the Dory and then we'll do the

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:30.830
next one here. "How do you avoid making mistakes
and maintain your peak performance in a long

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.390
session of chess games?"

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:38.810
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Let's forget about avoiding
mistakes. We don't make mistakes, we're dead.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:43.890
So, just the making mistakes is a normal decision
making process and again--

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:44.890
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Yeah.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:48.890
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: I want to refer again to
this risk adverse culture because what is

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:54.850
this in business and life, we want to limit
our ability to make mistakes. It's just, making

00:33:54.850 --> 00:34:02.190
mistake is like a crime. No. It's a normal
part of the thinking process. So, limiting

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:08.450
mistakes I think is just, it's first you have
to kill the fear. So, less you fear of making

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:14.501
mistakes, it dramatically reduces the chances
that you will make one. Because, most of the

00:34:14.501 --> 00:34:21.079
mistakes, they have a psychological root,
so just you can't display all your abilities

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:30.269
to make a right decision. So, I believe that
the dominant player at the chessboard in the

00:34:30.269 --> 00:34:36.509
long match was one who could be more resolute
in the decision making. So, more confident

00:34:36.509 --> 00:34:41.909
in making decisions. And as for the physical
stamina, when I play chess, I spend quite

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:46.490
a lot of time by training myself because I
believe that the physical conditions were

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:52.849
quite important to keep your psychology at
the right level. It's just, it always boosted

00:34:52.849 --> 00:34:53.849
my confidence.

00:34:53.849 --> 00:34:57.880
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Now he's channeling
Eric Schmidt, "Don't be afraid to fail." An

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.890
excuse I've used regularly for the last ten
years.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:03.890
[laughter]

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:08.349
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It's, I would even go further.
It's just, it's -- "afraid" -- it's some kind

00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:14.430
of, it's defensive. It's more aggressive.
I mean, you have to damn sure you will fail

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:19.339
a certain point. So just recognizing that
you, some kind of failure is inevitable, I

00:35:19.339 --> 00:35:21.400
think helps you to boost your performance.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.529
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Very good. Actually, lemme,
I have a suggestion cause I wanna, I have

00:35:26.529 --> 00:35:30.450
an idea for you that might improve chess,
I was thinking before.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:31.450
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: My chess?

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.450
[laughter]

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.250
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: No, chess as a whole. So, the
problem with chess, one problem is that it's

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:36.839
hard to make a living out of it. Only the
top, very, very top player in the world can

00:35:36.839 --> 00:35:39.460
make a living cause there's no--

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.890
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Because, chess is, chess
is not a very professional game.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.809
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Yes, well because it's hard
for people to follow--

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:49.990
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Because it's run by people
with very sort of limited reputation.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:52.720
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Besides the politics of chess.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.720
[laughter]

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.599
If you look at poker, for example, poker got
to be extremely popular because they figured

00:35:57.599 --> 00:36:01.539
out a trick that people can watch it by showing
some secret information that's not available

00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:06.600
to the players. What if you did something
like this with chess where after every game,

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:11.970
after every move, the player will go aside
to a soundproof room and say exactly what

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:16.039
he wants to do and what he thinks the opponent
will want to do. And then the winner will

00:36:16.039 --> 00:36:18.790
be not just a winner, but who made the guess
better.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:21.119
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Who were voted by the public,
yes?

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:22.369
[laughter and clapping]

00:36:22.369 --> 00:36:27.839
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: But the question is that might
be viewable. People might want to watch it

00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:30.190
because it would be very interesting to see
who gets better and you better and what was--

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:35.410
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: But one of the, it's this
man plus machine chess what I--introduced

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:40.720
in 1998-- I called advanced chess. One of
the ideas was that when you go through this

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.970
process of -- we have the same, we have access
to the same hardware, we can choose our software,

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:50.359
but we goes through some lines and we analyze
it. On the screen that we don't, we don't

00:36:50.359 --> 00:36:54.130
see the screen. On the screen you actually
could see the whole process; what I'm looking

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.130
at--

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.130
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Right.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.640
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It's, I was, I had this
kind of an idea that at certain point we'd

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:08.910
have to share it with the general public,
but still it's a bit difficult to explain

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:15.660
all this combinations and the ideas behind
every move because in poker you just look

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:20.440
at the numbers. The machine immediately gives
you those. So, that's it. So, the rest is

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:26.130
psychology and you don't have to mobilize
your brain stem to understand what's going

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.130
on.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.130
[laughter]

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.109
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Sure, but psychology is kind
of interesting. In fact, while there is a

00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:35.999
computer that plays very well in chess, there
is no one that plays poker. Very well.

00:37:35.999 --> 00:37:40.660
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Yeah, because machine gives
you odds, but machine, again, same problem.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:46.680
How do you translate into be a bluff into
numbers? So, the element of bluff definitely

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:51.890
creates, creates, it's a grey zone. So, like
Twilight Zone for the computer.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.069
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Absolutely.

00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:56.599
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: You want idea how to decode
bluff?

00:37:56.599 --> 00:38:03.749
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: How to decode bluff? Well, you
do your odds and you sometimes randomly win.

00:38:03.749 --> 00:38:14.319
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: But, it, the whole idea
of, the best players they base their bluff

00:38:14.319 --> 00:38:18.340
on reading whatever information they can read
from the face of the opponent, so again, how

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:23.270
you can translate it into the numbers?

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.549
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Of course. That's why it's hard.

00:38:25.549 --> 00:38:26.549
[pause]

00:38:26.549 --> 00:38:27.549
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Go ahead.

00:38:27.549 --> 00:38:34.799
&gt;&gt;member #4: Many people consider great chess
players has talent and intelligent or gifted

00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:41.630
and you have been trained by, have been trained
by Botvinnik, and you have helped many players

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:48.529
to get better and you have improved a lot
during your career. So, how much percentage

00:38:48.529 --> 00:38:56.230
do you think in the chess ability that is
contributed by the talent and how much percentage

00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:02.200
by the hard work and practice?

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.630
[pause]

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:10.400
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It's a very vague question
because are you talking about world champions

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.800
or just chess players in general?

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.920
&gt;&gt;member #4: Ok, if I've, if I start off by
just considering yourself we cannot distinguish,

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.109
but you have seen many, many players. Somebody
might have--

00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:25.990
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Yeah, but it's this, let
me say. To become the World Champion, you

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:31.140
need an exceptional talent. It may not be
enough, but it should be there for you to

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:40.019
become number one, or at least be top five,
let's say. So, I cannot give you again exact

00:39:40.019 --> 00:39:44.319
level one can achieve without having unique
talent, but definitely there is a certain

00:39:44.319 --> 00:39:48.460
level that can be achieved if you have ordinary
talent. You still have to have some talent

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:55.160
for chess. But the correlation between these
numbers? I don't know, but undoubtedly you

00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:00.240
need talent. But some players with unique
talent never became the champions because

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:08.009
it also needs character, maybe some element
of luck and ability to work hard. But talent

00:40:08.009 --> 00:40:13.450
is, is a number one condition for you to become
the best in the world, or one of the best

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:14.450
in the world.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:15.450
&gt;&gt;member #4: Thank you.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.450
[pause]

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:17.450
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: All right.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:18.450
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Sure.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:25.239
&gt;&gt;member #5: We've talked a little bit about
the game of chess and as far as studying it

00:40:25.239 --> 00:40:30.130
with computers. Now, with the advancement
of computers to the point that they can brute

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:36.440
force a game of chess, how do you feel this
has affected the game on the higher level,

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.390
with the newer generations of chess players?

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:46.130
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It's probably again, it
probably was inevitable, but it's some kind

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:53.759
of computerized mentality because they look
at certain geometry of the board, so it's

00:40:53.759 --> 00:41:01.579
this geometrical assumptions they replace
strategic understanding. Because they learn

00:41:01.579 --> 00:41:07.989
a lot at very early age. Today, 12, 13 year
old kid knows much more about chess than Bobby

00:41:07.989 --> 00:41:12.830
Fischer did in 1972 because just if he knows
how to use the mouse. So, he goes through

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:18.119
the, yeah, through these millions of games
and you absorb the information, but learning

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:22.579
this information doesn't mean that you can
understand it and let's not forget that many

00:41:22.579 --> 00:41:27.390
things that this kid learns today, they were
invented by Bobby Fischer because Bobby Fischer

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:34.480
was the first one actually to, not to invent
them, but to bring them to life. And many

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:40.999
of these technical ideas not only opening,
but also in the middle game. So, I think that

00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:46.950
today we have young chess players and the
average age is definitely getting younger,

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:52.809
so between these years, 50 years, 60 years
ago, the peak of the chess player was 35,

00:41:52.809 --> 00:41:58.680
40 years when--that's why I was the youngest
one to win a world championship at age 22.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:06.109
So, if you look at the modern chess, now Magnus
Carlsen, number one rated player, just, he

00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:14.299
will be turning 20 at the end of this month.
So, chess is getting younger, but they gain

00:42:14.299 --> 00:42:20.450
this information, they become very, very strong
players, but probably at the expense of less

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:26.510
comprehensive approach. It's very natural.
I don't think that, say, if you look somewhere

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.839
else, you will not see the same phenomenon.

00:42:28.839 --> 00:42:30.021
&gt;&gt;member #5: Thank you.

00:42:30.021 --> 00:42:32.494
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: So, if we just shift
to another subject I know you're interested

00:42:32.494 --> 00:42:39.839
in, after you retired in 2005, you ran for
political office. Or suggested it--

00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:45.180
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It is this; I'm not an American
citizen. I live in Russia, so in Russia we're

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.130
not trying to win elections, we're trying
to have elections.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.690
[laughter]

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.260
[applause]

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:58.380
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Well, you're also particularly
interested in trying to have change. I think

00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.380
you mentioned in your book that's--

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:02.309
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Yeah, well that's exactly
the change I want. I want my country to implement,

00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:07.079
just to have Russian people to speak when
they don't like the course of the country

00:43:07.079 --> 00:43:16.539
as it happened here 24 hours ago. And so far,
we haven't succeeded but I believe that this

00:43:16.539 --> 00:43:20.640
is the only way for my country to survive
in this harsh reality of 21st Century.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.070
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: So, you mentioned at
a protest, I think a week or so ago, --

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:28.259
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Well, it's a constant process.
It's not as big as in France, but definitely

00:43:28.259 --> 00:43:29.259
less violent.

00:43:29.259 --> 00:43:31.619
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: I think you said, "Putin
and his cabinet should resign."

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:33.299
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Yes, it must resign.

00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:36.249
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: And you've had some
predictions that you've gone on the record,

00:43:36.249 --> 00:43:41.230
maybe in 2008, saying they wouldn't make it
through 2012. Do you still believe that?

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:45.319
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: I still hope so. [audience
laughter] It depends, it depends very much

00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:51.519
on the situation of the country, but also
it depends very, it depends a lot on the oil

00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:58.799
crisis because that what, this influx of money
props up Putin's regime since Russian economy

00:43:58.799 --> 00:44:04.920
and the-- it's not in good shape-- and the
infrastructure, most the Soviet-built infrastructure,

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:11.920
is about to collapse. If you travel outside
of Moscow, not in Skolka, but somewhere else

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.410
further down, you will just recognize that
this country, it's like travelling in a time

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:20.890
machine. You will see that most of the country
still lives in a very dire conditions.

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:24.999
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: And if you could achieve
the kind of regime that you think the people

00:44:24.999 --> 00:44:28.150
would like, what changes would you make to
address these issues?

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:33.550
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Look, I definitely know
this, the wealth created in the country should

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:39.369
be used not to buy soccer clubs in England
or basketball clubs in the United States,

00:44:39.369 --> 00:44:46.019
but to be invested in Russia and we have hundreds
of billions of dollars being invested or taken

00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:50.670
out of the country by Russian oligarchs, and
I believe that this money can be wisely used

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.650
to improve conditions of our vast country.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:58.259
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Should we go back here?

00:44:58.259 --> 00:44:59.259
[pause]

00:44:59.259 --> 00:45:03.079
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: I think that gentleman was first.

00:45:03.079 --> 00:45:04.849
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Oh. All right, I'm not
looking to my right.

00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:05.849
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It's the second one. We're
outflanked.

00:45:05.849 --> 00:45:06.849
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: We'll head for a valley.

00:45:06.849 --> 00:45:09.940
&gt;&gt;member #6: I saw an interview you did last
year about training Magnus Carlsen and they

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.700
briefly mentioned the idea of the level of
discipline that it takes to compete at the

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:20.630
highest levels. I was wondering if you could
elaborate on, as an instructor of such a student,

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:26.749
how do you bring about that, those levels
of focus and determination that it takes to

00:45:26.749 --> 00:45:28.680
get to the top?

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:33.339
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: I would very cautious using
words "instructing a student" to describe

00:45:33.339 --> 00:45:42.420
my relations with Magnus. What I think I did,
and I was quite happy with this, was I helped

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:47.359
him to learn how to study the game of chess.
That's the, that was one of the unique things

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:52.529
I learned also from Botvinnik is the value
of being part of a Soviet chess school when

00:45:52.529 --> 00:45:59.970
the experience was transmitted from generation
to generation. And Magnus, as I was talking

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:07.609
about this phenomena just a few minutes ago,
he learned a lot by just clicking the mouse.

00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:13.999
So, he got an appetite for studying the game
of chess the way I did. And I think it was

00:46:13.999 --> 00:46:18.660
very, very helpful because it helped him to
expand his horizons. Also, what helped me

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:24.329
to work with Magnus is that his chess style
is, his natural talent is different from mine,

00:46:24.329 --> 00:46:30.839
so it's more like Karpov. He's a very quiet,
positional player with a very good, with a

00:46:30.839 --> 00:46:38.749
phenomenal ability to actually recognize the
positional elements in each position and very

00:46:38.749 --> 00:46:43.660
sharpened dynamically. So he could learn how
to do other things in chess. So, it was a

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:52.089
very good extra value added to his chess education.
So, I enjoyed it immensely and I'm very happy

00:46:52.089 --> 00:47:00.500
to see that my work produced such impressive
results.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:06.839
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: One more from the neglected
line over here, I guess.

00:47:06.839 --> 00:47:15.539
&gt;&gt;member #7: So, much of Google's technology
works on the notion of the wisdom of the crowds

00:47:15.539 --> 00:47:18.989
as displayed by the Web; the connectivity
of webpages, etc., yet the games of, when

00:47:18.989 --> 00:47:23.499
you played against the world and recently
when Magnus Carlsen played against the world,

00:47:23.499 --> 00:47:32.170
the world showed a rather fractured approach
to the playing side. Can you say anything

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:37.489
more about this, or elaborate upon why you
think that might be?

00:47:37.489 --> 00:47:40.109
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Yes, but I think we have
been dealing with, especially the game you

00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:49.819
mentioned, Magnus Carlsen played with the
world, it's a very special exercise because

00:47:49.819 --> 00:47:56.789
it's not the, not about generalities. So,
there's the, and you can't install these big

00:47:56.789 --> 00:48:03.240
numbers to ensure the quality of the decision.
When Magnus played the world, there was three

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.760
Grand Masters, relatively strong Grand Masters,
but still weaker than Magnus, offering the

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:14.239
moves. So, and what's happened is that this
moves, very often they were contradicting

00:48:14.239 --> 00:48:21.249
each other because they played their own games.
So, adding players to the process didn't help

00:48:21.249 --> 00:48:26.279
to improve the quality of the decisions. When
actually I played a Microsoft match when we

00:48:26.279 --> 00:48:31.520
had not two minutes per move, but two days
to make a move, that game was probably one

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:39.819
of the best games ever played because the
group of the strong chess players, they created

00:48:39.819 --> 00:48:46.829
a very powerful algorithm by using computers--it's
about the process, also-- and picking up the

00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:53.660
best moves. And at certain point, the game
was simple phenomenal and I just still don't

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:57.849
understand how they could make this terrible
blunder at the very end, probably this complacency,

00:48:57.849 --> 00:49:03.089
and they lost. But the game had to actually
end up in a draw and it was a very, very high

00:49:03.089 --> 00:49:04.089
quality game.

00:49:04.089 --> 00:49:07.069
&gt;&gt;member #7: Thank you and thank you for joining
us.

00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:12.359
&gt;&gt;member #8: [speaking in Russian] I have
a bit of a philosophical question for you.

00:49:12.359 --> 00:49:13.510
Earlier you said that--

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.720
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: You mean the others were
not intelligent, yes? That's the question?

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.720
[laughter]

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.170
&gt;&gt;member #8: They were very intelligent; this
one probably is not intelligent. Earlier you

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:22.109
said that any computer can beat any player
today by analyzing--

00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:26.410
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: No, I didn't say any computer
or just any player; I said just the strongest

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:27.410
computer, ok but--

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:32.299
&gt;&gt;member #8: A strong computer can beat any
chess player today by analyzing any one the

00:49:32.299 --> 00:49:35.240
ten to 120th possibilities of moves that are--

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:40.410
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: No, no, no, no, I didn't,
you, Udi, please help. Did I say that? Ten

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:41.570
to the power 120? No.

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:44.980
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: Ten to 120 is all the possible
moves ever possible in chess.

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.349
&gt;&gt;member #8: Ok, but if a computer can analyze
all those moves, it can potentially beat any--

00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:51.579
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Can you imagine the number?
Ten to the power 120?

00:49:51.579 --> 00:49:52.579
[laughter]

00:49:52.579 --> 00:49:54.160
&gt;&gt;member #8: I can. It's a big number.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.160
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Big?

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.790
&gt;&gt;Udi Manber: It's more money than we make.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:58.790
[laughter]

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:02.480
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: It's even more than the
amount of princes, yes?

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.390
&gt;&gt;member #8: Ok, the question that I have
is if a computer can beat a human, it seems

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:12.549
to me like chess is a game that's deterministic;
there's no chance, there's no free will. Do

00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:16.329
you think that your mind works the same way
that it's deterministic? Do you think that--

00:50:16.329 --> 00:50:24.950
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: But again, let's move back
to the limitations of the game of chess. So,

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:30.799
probably the number of all legal moves probably
was a wrong example, but right now if you

00:50:30.799 --> 00:50:38.670
look at the end games analyzed by the computers,
the computer solved all four pieces end games.

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:45.279
So, including kings. So, that's fine. Then
solved all five pieces end games. I think

00:50:45.279 --> 00:50:51.630
they solved most, probably almost all six
pieces. Now, they are just approaching seven

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:58.079
pieces. I'm not sure it will happen soon,
if it happens at all. Maybe the limits will

00:50:58.079 --> 00:51:03.029
be eight pieces, now, may be because the numbers
since you start looking at it, this data,

00:51:03.029 --> 00:51:09.339
they grow exponentially. Now, the chess game
is an ultimate end game of 32 pieces. So,

00:51:09.339 --> 00:51:14.670
that's why there's no chance a game of chess
can be solved. Theoretically, it cannot be

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:20.720
solved. But what happens is that the game
played by the humans is not perfect, so one

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:28.700
of the biggest problem, the human, strongest
human player experiences while playing the

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:35.789
strong or relatively strong computer, is the
different level of resilience. When we play,

00:51:35.789 --> 00:51:41.229
two humans play the game. So, and I'm getting,
so I have a superior position. Very often,

00:51:41.229 --> 00:51:49.380
this psychology works now in my favor because
my opponent is losing his will to defend.

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:55.510
And very, in chess we say that the mistakes
do not walk alone, so you always have more

00:51:55.510 --> 00:52:01.819
mistakes because it's a pressure. So, winning
the game of chess between two humans doesn't

00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:08.319
require the same energy as to beat a machine
because machine doesn't care. So, it's the,

00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:13.231
when you look what is a good position or bad
position, starts from each, every move it

00:52:13.231 --> 00:52:23.499
starts from the scratch. So, when you play
the machine, you have to make sure that the

00:52:23.499 --> 00:52:27.940
quality of all of your moves, all, literally
all the moves, will be almost perfect. It

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:32.390
doesn't happen in the game of chess. When
you look at the best games as I played against

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:37.249
Karpov or Kramnik played against Anand, I
bet you you'll find many not mistakes, but

00:52:37.249 --> 00:52:44.220
inaccuracies. So, inaccuracy is a natural,
some kind of a small mistake, is a natural

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:49.170
part of any decision making process; against
the machine, it's deadly. Because small inaccuracy

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:56.760
could kill the result of your very hard work
that you, all you accomplish in previous two

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.980
or three or four hours of a game.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:04.260
&gt;&gt;member #8: Don't you think those mistakes
are also deterministic in your mind, though?

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.079
That they're based on some sort of decision
or some past experience or--

00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:13.809
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: No, it's just again, it's
the mistakes. It's part of whatever weaknesses

00:53:13.809 --> 00:53:19.460
we are performing at a certain moment. You
could be tired. Your mind can be blind by

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:23.609
whatever, by family problems or crash of the
stock market, so whatever. So, you have a

00:53:23.609 --> 00:53:31.010
lot of problems so we have fundamental problem
of concentrating all our abilities to this

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:38.109
specific problem and I believe that if we,
to continue this experiment, man playing versus

00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:49.499
machine, it should, we should change the rules
and a key alteration should be related to

00:53:49.499 --> 00:53:54.570
the overall result. It could be four games
match, six games match, eight games match,

00:53:54.570 --> 00:54:01.359
but we understand that the longer we play,
so the better chance for the computer because

00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:07.390
it will play almost steady game while humans
could, the quality will fluctuate. I believe

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:13.240
that what we have to find out is whether the
best human player at his peak can beat the

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:20.670
best computer. So, if human player wins one
game, that's it. Because we don't have to

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:26.479
look for the longer, for the long competition
to prove that we are better. It's very important

00:54:26.479 --> 00:54:31.259
to find out that at the peak of our performance,
we're still capable of competing or even beating

00:54:31.259 --> 00:54:34.460
a strong computer, which is very, very difficult
now.

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:37.680
&gt;&gt;member #8: Thank you.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.680
[pause]

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.549
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Go ahead.

00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:42.390
&gt;&gt;member #9: Hi, my name is Mila.

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:43.390
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Hi.

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:49.230
&gt;&gt;member #9: First of all, Garry, thanks so
much for coming over to Google to visit us.

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.660
And let me shift the subject back to politics
again if you don't mind. I have two questions.

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:59.739
What's your take on the Khodorkovskii's case
and do think the justice will prevail in the

00:54:59.739 --> 00:55:05.579
outcome of his trial in December this year?

00:55:05.579 --> 00:55:06.579
[pause]

00:55:06.579 --> 00:55:12.499
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: We do not have elections
in Russia. We do not have justice in Russia.

00:55:12.499 --> 00:55:17.970
So, I'm quite pessimistic about the outcome
of his trial, which is a shame for my country

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:23.950
and it's a tragedy for Khodorkovskii and the
employees of YUKOS. Which again, not sure

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:28.960
how audience here is, how much people know
about this case, but YUKOS was the most successful

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.520
oil company in Russia. By the way, the most
transparent oil company in Russia. The company

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:40.570
that paid most taxes per barrel of oil and
because of the success of Khodor--, Mikhail

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:45.719
Khodorkovskii and his team and his willingness
to merge with multinational corporations and

00:55:45.719 --> 00:55:51.339
to bring this transparency to Russia and to
make it a standard. I believe that's why the

00:55:51.339 --> 00:56:03.599
company was ruined and it ended up in the
hand of Mr. Putin's cronies. I made this very

00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:08.950
green prediction in 2004; as long as Putin
stays in power, Khodorkovskii stays in jail.

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:17.499
And now it's a second trial, which is, it's,
it makes even Kafka pale by comparison because

00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:22.499
first time Khodorkovskii was convicted for
not paying taxes. Now, he's convicted for

00:56:22.499 --> 00:56:31.229
stealing the, everything, the entire oil production
that YUKOS extracted. And, in fact, if he

00:56:31.229 --> 00:56:36.640
didn't pay the taxes from that, how he could
steal it? So, that's the, but it, the whole

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:48.599
process is a terrible display of a lack of
rule of law in Russia and cruelty of Putin's

00:56:48.599 --> 00:56:57.549
regime and also corruption because I already
said YUKOS and its most precious part of the

00:56:57.549 --> 00:57:05.319
company, now owned by Putin's closest, closest
friends. I hope that Khodorkovskii can leave

00:57:05.319 --> 00:57:14.210
jail alive because this is one of the most
brilliant executives in Russia and hopefully,

00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:22.019
one day, his talent could help the country
to come back to the civilized world.

00:57:22.019 --> 00:57:26.289
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: So, is the Internet
and online tools and access to information

00:57:26.289 --> 00:57:31.170
and information transparency and the kind
of things that we tend to preach here as being

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:36.749
the lifeblood of democracy -- are these things
helping increase the odds that there's gonna

00:57:36.749 --> 00:57:43.690
be change in Russia, or are they simply allowing
the existing regime to reinforce its hold

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:44.779
on power?

00:57:44.779 --> 00:57:51.719
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: Now, Internet plays a very
important role in beefing up the opposition

00:57:51.719 --> 00:57:58.349
in Russia. We don't have the same phenomenon
as in China. So, the Russian stories this

00:57:58.349 --> 00:58:04.420
day, they are not as aggressive in limiting
the Internet access because it's very much

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:14.910
part of this Putin's, not a deal, but his
philosophy in dealing with the, with the population.

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:18.739
Private life is some kind of a guaranteed
unless you are interfering with politics.

00:58:18.739 --> 00:58:26.130
So, as long as you don't mind Putin's business
by robbing the country, your personal life

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:32.170
will not be under any threats. So, that's
why Internet has been rapidly growing in Russia.

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:40.259
I think now the number is 41 or 42 million
people somehow connected to the Internet in

00:58:40.259 --> 00:58:45.480
Russia, but obviously not more than ten percent
of this crowd and those numbers probably they,

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:50.050
they are similar to the rest of the world.
Ten percent are interested one way or another

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:58.319
in politics. And out of this ten percent,
maybe one-third to a half could be interested

00:58:58.319 --> 00:59:03.609
in reading alternative source of information.
So, that's why the audience which is related

00:59:03.609 --> 00:59:08.280
to our website, and we have very few websites
in Russia because the media, the mainstream

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:13.319
media is under a hundred percent control of
Kremlin, so we have about a million and a

00:59:13.319 --> 00:59:20.239
half, two million people following what we
are doing and it's, but this number grows.

00:59:20.239 --> 00:59:24.249
So, that's why you see more and more people
on the Moscow streets or St. Petersburg, and

00:59:24.249 --> 00:59:29.130
what is very important the information exchange.
Now, anything that happens in Vladivostok

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:36.799
or in Siberia or in Urals or in other parts
of Russia, very, very soon makes the news.

00:59:36.799 --> 00:59:39.880
But on the Internet asides in Moscow.

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:43.940
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Rosenberg: Ok. So, we're almost
out of time, but maybe we have time for one

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:44.940
more question here.

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:50.549
&gt;&gt;member #10: Hi. You wrote a book called
"How Life Imitates Chess" and you've talked

00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:54.650
about peak performance in other areas, whether
it's business, politics, etc. Is it constructive

00:59:54.650 --> 01:00:05.440
to think about life as a game? And if so,
can you share your secret for

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.440
winning the game of life?

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.440
[laughter]

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.499
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: No, I, winning the game
of life. Wow.

01:00:08.499 --> 01:00:09.499
[laughter]

01:00:09.499 --> 01:00:13.089
&gt;&gt;member #10: What does that, what does that
mean? Is that what peak performance is, to

01:00:13.089 --> 01:00:16.660
view it in that way? Can you talk about how
somebody would go about achieving peak performance

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.440
in other areas other than chess?

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:26.009
&gt;&gt;Garry Kasparov: I, when I wrote the book
I had an idea of just starting a dialogue

01:00:26.009 --> 01:00:33.900
with an individual who had a desire to improve
his or her performance in decision making.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:39.799
What I always didn't like is just to provide
universal advice. Somehow it goes against

01:00:39.799 --> 01:00:43.440
the conventional wisdom that you can have
an advice how to improve your performance.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.880
I believe that we're all different, we're
all unique. And something that may work for

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.599
me will not work for you. So, it's very important
we start analyzing our own performance and

01:00:53.599 --> 01:00:58.160
looking for, as we talked about today already
about strengths and weaknesses. And then you

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:04.550
create your own formula, which might be not
working for me and when people trying to analyze

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:09.039
their own performance, sometimes they get
upset if they look at their qualities, they

01:01:09.039 --> 01:01:14.230
say, "Oh, I'm too arrogant." Or "I'm just
very defensive." It doesn't make any difference.

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:18.609
You could be very good in attack; you could
be very good in defense. At the end of the

01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:22.920
day, you have to understand what you're good
at and what you're not good at. So, you can

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.250
have a tennis player who has a very powerful
serve, who's rushing the net and someone who

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:32.660
plays very defensively. Both could be number
one. It's very important that you look inside

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:39.830
first. That's the, that's my advice. I, when
I hear this -- some of the big names in the

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:46.979
industry providing the audience in a massive,
the huge audience with this tip and advice

01:01:46.979 --> 01:01:52.969
that can work for everybody, I don't think
it's – they're doing a good service because

01:01:52.969 --> 01:02:00.859
we are different. And by, without recognizing
what's inside of us, we cannot come up with

01:02:00.859 --> 01:02:06.709
the right decision making formula. It may
not be winning at the end of the day, but

01:02:06.709 --> 01:02:14.019
I believe that it's all; it's a lot to ask
to make all the difference. So, and I think

01:02:14.019 --> 01:02:20.089
that we, almost all of us, probably all of
us, we underperform because there's a huge

01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:29.440
potential and what keeps us, what keeps us
behind is a fear of to make mistakes. So,

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.900
it's about courage. So, and again, we're going
back to these, to the modern culture. So,

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:42.660
I, if you look at back in the history timelines,
so there's the great explorers, I mean, today

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.739
I don't think Magellan or Columbus could get
venture capital.

01:02:45.739 --> 01:02:47.549
[laughter]

01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:55.279
Yeah, it's very important to understand it,
why the, I mean, you can't expect let's say

01:02:55.279 --> 01:03:02.339
a ten percent annual return without taking
risk. So, otherwise, we move into the Bernie

01:03:02.339 --> 01:03:08.319
Madoff's world. So, we have to take more risk.
We have to recognize that risk and mistakes,

01:03:08.319 --> 01:03:17.829
they're inevitable for those who want to make
progress. So, it's another, it's a very long

01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:23.539
story, actually. I'm working another book
now with my friends, Peter Thiel and Max Levchin,

01:03:23.539 --> 01:03:29.170
and its tentative title is The World of Fake
Values, and we talk about what we believe

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:36.670
is the, I'm afraid to say, technological stagnation
of, in modern days. And it's very much related

01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:44.459
to complacency and the risk adverse culture.
