00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.560
&gt;&gt; In this video,
we're showing you

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.140
how to make your own
custom clothing designs.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.980
Surprisingly,
all it takes is a little bit

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.880
of bleach
and some freezer paper.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[Captions by Jeffrey D. at Y Translator]

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.620
Here's what you're going
to need to get started.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.560
You'll need a shirt
or other article of clothing

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.820
that is mostly made of cotton or linen.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.000
Other types of cloth may not
react very well to the bleach.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.980
A household iron,
some freezer paper,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.390
a spray bottle,
a razor blade,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.780
and of course, the bleach itself.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.400
I have here printed-out
one of the King of Random logos,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.880
and this is the design that we're
going to put onto one of these shirts.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.460
To transfer this design from a piece
of paper onto the cotton shirt,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.740
we're going to be
using our freezer paper.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.160
Freezer paper is just paper
that's designed to wrap stuff up

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.860
before you put it
into the freezer.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.720
It's pretty much
plain paper on one side,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.280
the other side
has a shiny waxy surface.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.020
When I first started
researching this project,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.430
I thought it was probably
going to be better

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.620
to just use something
like contact paper.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.380
Contact paper is a sticky clear sheet
with a backing that comes in rolls.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.080
I thought it would be
really good for transferring

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.040
a stencil design
onto a shirt.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.100
But it turns out,
there are some real advantages

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.960
to using the freezer paper instead.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.920
Because one side of the freezer paper
is like normal paper,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.400
you can write on it with pens,
pencils or markers very easily.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.000
Contact paper being plastic,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.160
that doesn't work so well.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.240
We're going to stick
our freezer paper onto our shirts

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.820
by using heat from an iron.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.040
And again, that's one of the advantages 
of the freezer paper,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.600
is it doesn't stick until you
hit it with the iron.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.300
So you have all the time
in the world to perfectly position it

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.720
just where you want it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.720
Combine that with the fact
that the roll of freezer paper

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.140
is usually really big
so you get great coverage.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.620
Which prevents
over-spray onto your shirt.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.440
Let's tear off a good size sheet
of our freezer paper

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.220
and get ready
to transfer our image.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.080
You want to take the design
and place it face down

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.280
onto the waxy side
of the freezer paper.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.400
Despite the wax coating,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.660
a little bit of masking tape

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.920
should do a great job
of holding your design in place.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.540
Now you can see that with
a black printed design,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.460
you can see right through
the freezer paper

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.240
on to what you're going
to want to cut.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.040
To help increase the life
of both your razor blades

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.567
and whatever
you're working on,

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:06.760
it is best if you have 
a cutting mat that you can use.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.800
Now, how this is going to work
is you'll cut out everything

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.140
that you want to
bleach onto your shirt.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.540
It's kind of going to be
the reverse image of what we've got here.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.060
I'll be using a black T-shirt
and the bleach will turn it lighter.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.940
If you cut the design entirely
out of the freezer paper,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.160
it may be difficult to keep
all of the pieces aligned

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.320
just where you want them.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.150
Small pieces will be harder to keep
flat when you lay them on the shirt.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.750
For example, if I were cutting
out this T and K piece

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.320
which is all joined together,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.970
I would cut most of the way around it.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.040
But in the corners,
I would leave a small piece

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.200
where I don't cut.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.860
That will leave the design
connected to the rest of the paper

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.060
until I'm ready to remove it.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.780
You may want to trace over your design

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.720
using a pen or pencil 
on the freezer paper,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.700
or maybe you prefer
to just use your knife,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.660
and cut directly onto the pattern.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.180
Either way works just fine.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.240
Using a sharp knife 
with a good point,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.420
carefully cut out 
all the pieces from your design

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.200
leaving a few
connecting points

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.700
so that they don't completely
come off of the freezer paper.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.600
With our design prepped,
we now need to move on

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.720
to prepping the T-shirt
to be ready to be bleached.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.680
Before you bleach
a new article of clothing,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.480
you want to be sure
you wash and dry it

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.440
to remove any coatings
that may be on it.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.140
We now want to cut out
a piece of cardboard

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.980
that can fit inside this shirt.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.600
That will both help it keep its shape,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.800
and prevent any bleach

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.140
from getting through
the front onto the backside

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.319
while it's being bleached.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.820
Since my cardboard does have
gaps in a couple of spots,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.660
I'm just going to cover
those with some duct tape.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.900
[Music]

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.320
Once you have your piece of cardboard

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.720
cut to the right size and shape,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.080
fit your T-shirt over it.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.440
It's not necessary to have
a piece of cardboard that fills

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.989
the entire shirt the way
I have it on this one.

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.900
It really only needs to be large enough
to fit your whole design on it.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.770
But this way, I'll be able to use
the same piece of cardboard

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.640
for any other design
I do in the future.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.420
With the cardboard inside the shirt,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.100
you want to take your iron
and press the whole thing down,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.780
so it is nice and smooth.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.440
This will help the
freezer paper stick to it better

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.040
and your design
will turn out nicer.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.860
With the T-shirt nice and flat,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.860
it's time to position
the design on the shirt

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.020
where you're going to want it.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.420
First, let's remove our pattern
from the back of our freezer paper.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.060
Now we can position it
right where we want it,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.909
and this part right here
is why freezer paper is much better

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.170
than contact paper.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.540
'Cause for contact paper,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.620
it would stick as soon
as it touched the shirt,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.500
and you wouldn't be
able to reposition it at all.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.020
The freezer paper covers a pretty
good amount of the T-shirt,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.240
but it is possible
to get some over-spray.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.920
The bleach solution could
travel through the air a little bit,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.370
and land on parts of the shirt
that you don't want bleached.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.800
So it's a good idea to make sure
that every part of the surface is covered.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.480
You can use some old newspapers,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.680
some additional cardboard

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.420
or more freezer paper to do this.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.100
[Music]

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.300
With the whole t-shirt covered,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.580
it's time to remove the pieces

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.040
that we've cut out from our design,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.960
and expose the t-shirt underneath.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.160
Carefully go through your design

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.600
and lift up the cut-out
pieces by the edges.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.120
If you've made your connecting point
small enough,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.810
they should tear through easily.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.900
But if not, you can very carefully
take your razor blade and finish the cuts.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.180
Be sure you don't cut down
through the T-shirt itself.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.100
[Music]

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.580
Just to be sure that
none of the edges have peeled up

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.100
so the bleach will get under them,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.560
let's hit it with the iron again.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.120
You may have noticed
that I haven't removed

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.420
the second half of the design yet.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.860
And that's because
we're going to try

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.870
and make this
in two different stages,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.480
so we have two levels
of brightness on our t-shirt.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.700
We'll use 1/2 bleach and 1/2 water
in one of these little Spritz bottles.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.480
We'll also want to be sure that we have
several paper towels easily at hand.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:40.300
[Music]

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.620
Be sure you don't have any excess
bleach on the outside of the bottle.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.140
[Music]

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.040
With the mix of bleach
and water in the spray bottle,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.840
you're now ready
to spray it over the design.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.740
I really like these Spritz bottles

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.940
because the evenly 
distribute your solution

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.940
without laying it on too heavily.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.560
If you get too much of it on,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.260
it can soak through the shirt,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.040
and down under
the edges of the design.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.000
So you really only want a light
misting on the surface.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.540
We want to dilute the bleach
because chlorine bleach by itself

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.760
is actually powerful enough

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.040
that it can dissolve the fibers of the shirt.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.260
If you apply it directly,
it can eat right through the cotton.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.340
We'll spray on our bleach solution

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.560
covering all of the
exposed parts of the design.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.920
And then immediately,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.280
we'll dab off all of the extra
liquid with some paper towels.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.120
We do that to make sure
it doesn't soak down into the cotton,

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.100
and under the design,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.199
and to try and keep our freezer paper

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.620
from getting too wet.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.740
If it gets soaked,
will have a very hard time

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.220
pulling it off of the shirt later.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.280
In a matter of seconds,
we can see the effect

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.180
of the bleach on the black shirt.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.520
It's obvious that some areas have received
a little bit more bleach than others.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.160
So we'll do a second layer
and try and hit those darker spots more.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.580
Our first layer
has changed pretty well.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.860
Generally you can keep
adding more and more bleach

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.640
and give it a little bit more
time to react

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.360
and it will
get lighter and lighter.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.900
You have to decide
what color you want.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.800
When bleaching a black shirt,
it will usually start out sort of orange,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.600
and then as you get more
and more bleach on to it,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.980
it will turn peach
and then almost white.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.080
After a few separate
treatments of the bleach,

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.259
the first half of our design
is where I want it.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.720
Now, we'll peel off the right side
and cover all of it with more bleach.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.380
That should leave us
with the left side being very light

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.460
and the right side
being sort of a dark orange.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.420
If you want a very light,
almost white color,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.040
it can really help to iron over
the bleach as it's drying.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.340
Be aware though,
this puts chlorine gas into the air.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.600
So you should never do it indoors,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.460
where you'll end up breathing the fumes.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.360
Once your design is to the
color and shade that you want,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.280
it's time to remove all
of the masking and stencil,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.920
and stop their reaction
using some cold water.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.220
The pattern doesn't look
quite as good when it's wet.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.820
But after a quick trip to the dryer,
it should look good as new.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.400
If you don't feel like using a stencil,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.820
you can use other methods
to apply the solution onto the shirt.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.740
You can spray it
directly from the bottle.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.860
Maybe flick some drops on with your hand,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.220
or even use a paintbrush.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.800
If you want to add the bleach
to a lot of the parts of the shirt

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.760
but just mask off
a few portions,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.920
you can use tape,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.020
and either cut out
your design from that,

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.720
or just lay the tape down
in the design that you want.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.360
Something else that's
fun to do with these shirts

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.660
is after you've stripped
the color out with some bleach,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.200
you can add a little bit
more back in if you want to.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.860
I have here  some alcohol based ink.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.520
This is basically blue
permanent marker ink,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.560
and some rubbing alcohol.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.860
I'm going to add the rubbing alcohol
into the Spritz bottle

00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:26.930
and then several drops
of our blue ink.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.280
At that point, we should be able
to add that on

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.340
using the spritzer to our shirt
once it's been dried.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.960
To test how much color we get,
let's try spritzing

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.440
onto our freezer paper.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.800
We can see that the blue is very subtle.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.360
It doesn't change the color
drastically or quickly.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.340
That's better if you're 
spraying onto these shirts

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.900
because if it's too concentrated,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.889
and you don't have your sprayer
positioned exactly where you want it,

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:51.520
the color is going to go
in the wrong spot.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.920
Having a very dilute color
as much more forgiving as you can go in

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.399
and add little bits of color
at a time until you reach

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.420
the shade you want.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.220
YouTuber NightHawkInLight
had a video on bleach shirts as well.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.880
And in his, he had a shirt
with a rocket on it.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.760
I thought that sounded
like such a cool idea

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.020
that I wanted to try on my own.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:26.500
[Music]

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.460
As a reminder, don't store your bleach 
solution in a plastic bottle long-term.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.260
The bleach could do damage
to the bottle causing it to leak.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.520
This method of shirt designing is fast.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.180
It's fun.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.520
And combining a bunch
of these techniques,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.460
you can come up with
some really cool stuff.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.079
Guys, there's still more
for you to see.

00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:44.120
That little box up at the top

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.100
will transport you directly
to our last video.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.080
Go check it out.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.279
Little box at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.300
you should be watching next.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.900
And if you hit the bomb,
you'll become a subscriber,

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.920
so you'd never miss out on
another video again.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.140
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we'll see you on next one.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:57.820
Talk to you then.
