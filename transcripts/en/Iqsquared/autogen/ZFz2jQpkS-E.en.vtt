00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:44.190
been decimated under Trump but actually
 

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.040
been decimated under Trump but actually
the the the decimation had already

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.050
the the the decimation had already
 

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.519
the the the decimation had already
started all the disregard for the State

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:49.529
started all the disregard for the State
 

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:51.319
started all the disregard for the State
Department had started and it was really

00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:51.329

more 911 than Trump that did that well

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.110
more 911 than Trump that did that well
 

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.470
more 911 than Trump that did that well
this is a new extreme and we've never

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480
this is a new extreme and we've never
 

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.990
this is a new extreme and we've never
seen the sort of flagrant wholesale

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000
seen the sort of flagrant wholesale
 

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.180

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.190
disregard for the culture of expertise
 

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.400
disregard for the culture of expertise
that we're currently seeing and the

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:04.410
that we're currently seeing and the
 

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.350
that we're currently seeing and the

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360
attendant firings and the empty
 

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.329
attendant firings and the empty
ambassadorships around the world but

00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339
ambassadorships around the world but
 

00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:09.590
ambassadorships around the world but
you're absolutely right that there is

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600
you're absolutely right that there is
 

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.130

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:14.310
that was an inflection point where
 

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.530
that was an inflection point where
foreign policy became much more

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540
foreign policy became much more
 

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.930
foreign policy became much more
militarized and you know Brian could

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940
militarized and you know Brian could
 

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.680
militarized and you know Brian could
also speak to that but even before then

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:21.690
also speak to that but even before then
 

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.930

the Clinton administration had a similar
kind of sentiment of a turn inward and a

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:28.579
kind of sentiment of a turn inward and a

economy stupid was the mantra that James
 

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.319
economy stupid was the mantra that James
Carville brought to the table and the

00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:36.329
Carville brought to the table and the
 

00:14:36.329 --> 00:14:37.819
Carville brought to the table and the
result of that was that we gutted the

00:14:37.819 --> 00:14:37.829
result of that was that we gutted the
 

00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:39.650
result of that was that we gutted the
State Department then and it had very

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660
State Department then and it had very
 

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.449
State Department then and it had very
disastrous results closed a lot of

00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:41.459
disastrous results closed a lot of
 

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:42.740
disastrous results closed a lot of
embassies closed to government agencies

completely that there's a very large
 

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.630
completely that there's a very large
wing of the Democratic Party that is

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640
wing of the Democratic Party that is
 

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.860

for me the reason why I think this story

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:25.850
for me the reason why I think this story
 

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.430
for me the reason why I think this story
is important is forward-looking it's

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440
is important is forward-looking it's
 

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.200
is important is forward-looking it's
twofold one is how do we secure our

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:29.210
twofold one is how do we secure our
 

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.300
twofold one is how do we secure our
elections going forward and the second

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:31.310
elections going forward and the second
 

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.370
elections going forward and the second
thing is if a president is willing to

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:33.380
thing is if a president is willing to
 

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.780
thing is if a president is willing to
put himself in that compromised position

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:34.790
put himself in that compromised position
 

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.670
put himself in that compromised position
and is willing to get overtures from

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:36.680
and is willing to get overtures from
 

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.860
and is willing to get overtures from
Russian intelligence and that person is

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:38.870
Russian intelligence and that person is
 

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:39.820
Russian intelligence and that person is
in charge of our national security

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:39.830
in charge of our national security
 

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.220
in charge of our national security
that's a problem and so I think that

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:42.230
that's a problem and so I think that
 

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.690
that's a problem and so I think that
there is a

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:42.700
there is a
 

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.130
there is a
real issue here that's not about

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:44.140
real issue here that's not about
 

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.410
real issue here that's not about
relitigated 2016 it happened he was

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:46.420
relitigated 2016 it happened he was
 

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.210
relitigated 2016 it happened he was
elected but it's forward-thinking and

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:48.220
elected but it's forward-thinking and
 

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.950
elected but it's forward-thinking and
saying is our national security at risk

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960
saying is our national security at risk
 

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.140
saying is our national security at risk
and is our election integrity at risk at

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:52.150
and is our election integrity at risk at
 

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.030
and is our election integrity at risk at
risk and I think both those seem to be

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.040
risk and I think both those seem to be
 

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.830
risk and I think both those seem to be
yes and that brings us very nicely to

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:10.910
two quick points I mean one is I think
 

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.060
two quick points I mean one is I think
that one thing that I deeply agree with

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.070
that one thing that I deeply agree with
 

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:14.590
that one thing that I deeply agree with
mark on is that the Democrats need to

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:14.600
mark on is that the Democrats need to
 

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.630
mark on is that the Democrats need to
win if they want to change things for

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640
win if they want to change things for

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:19.670
for the way that they see see fit and
 

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:20.950
for the way that they see see fit and
that's that's something I think that's

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960
that's that's something I think that's
 

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.900
that's that's something I think that's
lost in American politics is that you

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:22.910
lost in American politics is that you
 

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.099
lost in American politics is that you
can win the argument and lose the

00:44:24.099 --> 00:44:24.109
can win the argument and lose the
 

00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:27.040
can win the argument and lose the
election and I think the 2018 election

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:27.050
election and I think the 2018 election
 

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.620
election and I think the 2018 election
is the most important election in modern

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:29.630
is the most important election in modern
 

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.210
is the most important election in modern
American history and the reason I think

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:31.220
American history and the reason I think
 

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.520
American history and the reason I think
that even more than 2016 is because

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:33.530
that even more than 2016 is because
 

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.230
that even more than 2016 is because
because Trump was this trial balloon in

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240
because Trump was this trial balloon in
 

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.750
because Trump was this trial balloon in
2016 he was this person who you sort of

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760
2016 he was this person who you sort of
 

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.130
2016 he was this person who you sort of
thought let's let's roll the dice with

thought let's let's roll the dice with
 

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:42.370
thought let's let's roll the dice with
him now we've seen what he is and if

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:42.380
him now we've seen what he is and if
 

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.849
him now we've seen what he is and if
he's if 2018 is a is a continuation of

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:45.859
he's if 2018 is a is a continuation of
 

00:44:45.859 --> 00:44:47.380
he's if 2018 is a is a continuation of
Republican control of the House and

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:47.390
Republican control of the House and
 

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:48.880
Republican control of the House and
Congress all Republicans are just going

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:48.890
Congress all Republicans are just going
 

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.890
Congress all Republicans are just going
to double down on trumpism if there's a

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:50.900
to double down on trumpism if there's a
 

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.510
to double down on trumpism if there's a
rebuke to them they will reform the

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520
rebuke to them they will reform the
 

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.980

important the other thing I'll just
 

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.460
important the other thing I'll just
quickly add is that we also need

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:57.470
quickly add is that we also need
 

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:01.060
quickly add is that we also need

now part of that is gerrymandering where

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:10.220
now part of that is gerrymandering where
 

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.650

demographic sorting which is something

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640
demographic sorting which is something

next two election cycles turn out to be
foreign policy elections and I say that

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:53.740
foreign policy elections and I say that
 

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.750
foreign policy elections and I say that
because of just how extreme the

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760
because of just how extreme the
 

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.680
because of just how extreme the
decimation of America's diplomatic

decimation of America's diplomatic
 

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.510
decimation of America's diplomatic
standing in the world is just how

adventures that have such incredibly
 

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:23.850
adventures that have such incredibly
high stakes and could so rapidly turn

high stakes and could so rapidly turn

great fear that this could become both a

great fear that this could become both a

great fear that this could become both a
real crisis on the ground and also a

Ronan's right because I mean you we're

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:40.450
Ronan's right because I mean you we're
 

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:44.840
Ronan's right because I mean you we're
all living in the same world and it's

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:44.850
all living in the same world and it's
 

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.760
all living in the same world and it's
it's a there's always this feeling that

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:47.770
it's a there's always this feeling that
 

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.700
it's a there's always this feeling that
within 24 hours everything could change

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:50.710
within 24 hours everything could change
 

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.850
within 24 hours everything could change
and of course that's always been true

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:52.860
and of course that's always been true
 

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:57.600
and of course that's always been true
really but now now it feels most

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:57.610
really but now now it feels most
 

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:58.760
really but now now it feels most
immediate and

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:58.770
immediate and
 

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:00.260
immediate and
you know we can make predictions about

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:00.270
you know we can make predictions about
 

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:02.630
you know we can make predictions about
what will happen in the midterms but who

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640
what will happen in the midterms but who
 

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.910
what will happen in the midterms but who
knows what's going to happen from now to

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920
knows what's going to happen from now to
 

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.390
knows what's going to happen from now to
then I have never had an a year and some

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400
then I have never had an a year and some
 

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.230
then I have never had an a year and some
months passed more slowly in my life and

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240
months passed more slowly in my life and
 

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.680
months passed more slowly in my life and
and so it that now seems that now seems

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:15.690
and so it that now seems that now seems
 

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:18.290
and so it that now seems that now seems
a long time from now but that then leads

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300
a long time from now but that then leads
 

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:19.700
a long time from now but that then leads
to what I think should probably be the

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:19.710
to what I think should probably be the
 

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.370
to what I think should probably be the
final question actually before we get

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:21.380
final question actually before we get
 

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.660
final question actually before we get
thrown open to people and that is if

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:23.670
thrown open to people and that is if
 

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:27.200

all the time right that I think is a
 

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:53.730
all the time right that I think is a
very dangerous scenario the second one

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:53.740
very dangerous scenario the second one
 

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.340
very dangerous scenario the second one
is the possibility of just democratic

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:56.350
is the possibility of just democratic
 

00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:58.620
is the possibility of just democratic
decay and this is just in very succinct

00:58:58.620 --> 00:58:58.630
decay and this is just in very succinct
 

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:00.300
decay and this is just in very succinct
terms if you think about what I said

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:00.310
terms if you think about what I said
 

00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:01.860

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:08.260
broken and I think that's where we're
 

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.330
broken and I think that's where we're
heading right now well then that's where

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:09.340
heading right now well then that's where
 

00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.680
heading right now well then that's where
you get to that any question over there

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:10.690

what we're calling Republicans and
Democrats but I think that the divide is

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:48.410
Democrats but I think that the divide is
 

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.799
Democrats but I think that the divide is
actually much more profound than party

01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:50.809
actually much more profound than party
 

01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:55.719
actually much more profound than party

it's not as simple as we just need to
buy to pass a bunch of laws and and

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:00.630

nobody will have guns anymore and we

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:03.030
nobody will have guns anymore and we

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:11.730
on to the legal stuff
 

01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:14.060
on to the legal stuff
particularly I guess we should talk a

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:14.070
particularly I guess we should talk a
 

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:15.320
particularly I guess we should talk a
little bit about before we get to the

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:15.330
little bit about before we get to the
 

01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:18.290
little bit about before we get to the
Supreme Court about the federal

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:18.300
Supreme Court about the federal
 

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.270
Supreme Court about the federal
judiciary you think at the moment you

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280
judiciary you think at the moment you
 

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.280
judiciary you think at the moment you
were looking in you look at some of the

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:22.290
were looking in you look at some of the
 

01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:24.500
were looking in you look at some of the
big things that Trump has wanted to do

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:24.510
big things that Trump has wanted to do
 

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:26.780
big things that Trump has wanted to do
and has been stymied doing them it is

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:26.790
and has been stymied doing them it is
 

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:28.720
and has been stymied doing them it is
the judges at the moment isn't it who've

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:28.730
the judges at the moment isn't it who've
 

01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:30.920
the judges at the moment isn't it who've
stopped in does that carry on does he

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:30.930
stopped in does that carry on does he
 

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:32.360
stopped in does that carry on does he
get to appoint new ones what goes on

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:32.370
get to appoint new ones what goes on
 

01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:34.700
get to appoint new ones what goes on
there so I think that this will be the

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:34.710
there so I think that this will be the
 

01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:36.200
there so I think that this will be the
most lasting consequence of the Trump

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:36.210
most lasting consequence of the Trump
 

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:40.130
most lasting consequence of the Trump
administration is they are appointing a

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:40.140
administration is they are appointing a
 

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.680
administration is they are appointing a
huge number of federal judges at an

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:42.690
huge number of federal judges at an
 

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:45.050
huge number of federal judges at an
unprecedented pace I mean 16 appellate

01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:45.060
unprecedented pace I mean 16 appellate
 

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.460
unprecedented pace I mean 16 appellate
court judges now and there's five more

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:46.470
court judges now and there's five more
 

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:48.470
court judges now and there's five more
in the wings which is which could

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480
in the wings which is which could
 

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.730
in the wings which is which could
potentially transform the American

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740
potentially transform the American
 

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.970
potentially transform the American
judiciary so the rule of law I think

01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980
judiciary so the rule of law I think
 

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:55.670
judiciary so the rule of law I think
though is is also under attack I mean I

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680
though is is also under attack I mean I
 

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.960
though is is also under attack I mean I
think that there's a real attempt to

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:56.970
think that there's a real attempt to
