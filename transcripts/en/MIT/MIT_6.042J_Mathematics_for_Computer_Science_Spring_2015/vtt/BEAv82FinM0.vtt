00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.390
Now, conditional
probability will

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.260
let us explain a lot of
the confused arguments

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.100
that people brought
up about Monty Hall.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.120
And we'll see that it is
a little bit confusing

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.540
and where there is some
correct sounding arguments that

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.250
give you the wrong answer.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.190
So let's go back and
look at our Monty Hall

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.785
tree that allowed us to
derive the sample space

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:27.400
and probability space for the
whole process of the prize

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.600
being placed and the
contest picking a door

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.660
and Carol opening a door.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.030
Now, this tree was
way more complicated

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.030
than we needed if all
we were trying to do

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.760
was figure out the probability
of winning if you switch.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.474
But having the
tree will allow us

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:42.140
to discuss a whole
bunch of other events

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.890
in their probabilities
that will get

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.310
us a grip on some of
the arguments that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.950
gave the wrong answer.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.650
So let's look at the
event, first of all

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.150
that the goat is at 2.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.630
Now, this is the branch
where the prize is at 2.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.120
And so in all the other
branches the goat is at 2,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:07.690
l which means that we have
these eight of the 12 outcomes

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.680
in the event-- goat is at 2.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.620
Now, let's also look at the
event that the prize is at 1.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.450
That's just this
branch of the tree, OK?

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.110
So one of the arguments is
that when the contestant is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.880
at the point where they've seen
that the open door and they're

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.750
trying to decide whether
to stick or switch,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.270
they know that the
goat is at the door 2.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.550
Say without loss of
generality that that

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.870
was the door that they
got to look at behind,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.330
that Carol opened.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.790
And so we want to ask
the probability, given

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.410
that he picked 1, what's the
probability that the prize is

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.750
at 1 given that
the goat is at 2?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.880
That means that if
you're at door 1

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.640
then you should stick if
that probability is high

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.460
and otherwise you
shouldn't stick.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.500
So we can look at this event,
the prize at 1 given the goat

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.900
at 2, and what we can see
is that it's taking up

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.460
exactly half of the
outcomes for goat at 2

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.130
and the same kind of outcomes--
red ones and green ones.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.590
The red ones are worth an
1/18 and the green ones

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.470
are worth a 1/9 in
probability, and that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.250
implies that the probability
that the prize is at 1 given

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.640
that the goat is at 2 is 1/2.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.610
It really is.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.020
And that's the argument
that people were saying.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.030
They said, look, when
the contestant sees

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.660
that the goat is at
door 2, and they're

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.880
trying to decide whether
the goat-- the prize is

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.350
at the door-- is it door
1 or at the other door,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.530
and it's equally likely.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.780
And so it doesn't matter
whether they stick or switch.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.600
That's a correct
argument but it's not

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.840
calculating the probability
of the stick strategy winning.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.810
Why?

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.580
Well, because there's
more information that's

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.850
available than goat is at 2.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.765
The contestant not only
knows that the goat

00:03:06.765 --> 00:03:08.850
is at 2 and trying to
figure out the probability

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.110
that the prize is at
1, but the contestant

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.990
knows what door he picked.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.180
So let's suppose that the
contestant did pick door 1

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.800
and learned that the goat
was at door 2, that's

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.030
a different event.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.590
If the blue one is marked
off at the places where

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.550
the contestant
picks one, this is

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.710
where the door is picked-- is
1 and here's 1 and here's 1.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.180
This 1 splits into one event,
this 1 splits into one event,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.610
but this choice of 1
splits into two outcomes.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.360
And so when we look at the
event that both the goat is at 2

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.230
and the contestant
picked 1, which

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.970
is what the contest
really knows when they get

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.050
to see that there's
a goat at door 2,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.740
we wind up with the overlap
of just three outcomes.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.870
Two outcomes that have
probability 1/8 and one outcome

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.730
that has probability a 1/9.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.880
It's just those three.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.670
And the result is that the
probability that the prize is

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.460
at 1 given that you
picked 1 and the goat

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.380
is at 2-- so this is
the event-- goat at 2

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.730
and picked 1, these
three outcomes.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.950
The prize is at 1 is
these two outcomes, which

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.490
are each worth an
1/18 and this is

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.800
an outcome that's worth a 1/9.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.630
So the prize at
1 outcomes amount

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.080
to 1/2 of the total probability
of this event, goat at 2

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.740
picked at 1.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.080
So, again, the
probability that the prize

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.630
is at 1 given that the
contestant picked 1 and saw

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.430
the goat at 2 is a 1/2 also.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.460
That's confusing.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.420
So it seems as though the
contestant may as well stick

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.440
because at the point that he
has to decide whether to stick

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.060
or switch, and he knows where--
he sees where the goat is

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.210
and he knows what
door he's picked,

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.610
it's 50-50 whether he
should stick or switch.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.520
The probability that the prize
is at door 1 that he picked

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.740
is a 1/2, so it really doesn't
matter if he stays there

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.240
or if he decides to switch
to the unopened door.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.020
But wait a minute,
that's not right

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.980
because the contestant not
only knows what door he picked,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.010
not only knows that there's
a goat behind a given door

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.330
that Carol has opened,
but he knows that Carol

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.020
has opened that door.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.560
That's how he got to know
that the goat was there.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.990
So let's go back and
look at the tree.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.180
What basically the
previous two arguments

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.614
are conditioning on
the wrong events.

00:05:41.614 --> 00:05:43.530
It's a typical mistake
and one that you really

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.360
have to watch out for.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.300
So if you use the correct
event, what we're looking at

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.910
is the contestant knows
that they've picked door 1.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.410
That's the outcomes of picked
door 1 are marked here.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.710
In addition, the
contestant will get

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.515
to know, for example,
in a play of the game

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:04.260
that Carol has opened door 2.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.390
Carol opening door 2 is
quite a different event

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.250
from the goat being at 2.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.540
This is a picture of
the outcomes in Carol

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.020
opening door 2, and we're
interested in the intersection

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.650
of them.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.740
That is, just this
guy that's in both

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.070
and this guy that's in both.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.640
There they are.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.255
And so what we
can do is identify

00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:29.030
that the event that you
picked 1 and that Carol opened

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.250
door 2 consists simply of two
outcomes-- one worth an 1/18

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.540
and one worth a 1/9.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.150
Now, of these two outcomes,
which one has the prize at 1?

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.070
Well, only that one.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.750
Remember the first component
here is where the prize is.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.920
And so the prize at 1
event among the given

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.040
picked 1 and opened 2 is
just this red outcome.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.730
Now, the red outcome
has probability

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.050
1/18 and the green
outcome has probability

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.400
that's twice as much.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.210
So that means that relative
to this event, the probability

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.680
that the prize is at 1 given
that you picked 1 and opened 2

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:19.200
is actually 1/18 over
1/18 plus 1/9, or 1/3.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.890
So given that you picked 1 and
you get to see what Carrol did,

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.780
the probability the prize
is at the door you picked

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.250
is only 1/3, which means
that if you stick you only

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.450
have a 1/3 chance of winning.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.200
You should switch.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.310
And if you do, you'll have a
2/3 probability of winning.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.740
So when we finally condition
on everything that we know,

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.490
which is the contestant
knows what door he picked

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.770
and what door Carol
opened, then we

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.580
discover that it correctly--
as we deduced previously--

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.530
that the probability of
switching wins is 2/3.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.890
So we're not trying
to rederive the fact

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.370
that the probability of
switching wins is 2/3.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.160
We're trying to illustrate a
very basic blunder that you

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.970
have to watch out for, which
is when you're trying to reason

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.150
about some situation and
you condition on some event

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.520
that you think summarizes
what's going on,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.800
if you don't get the
conditioning event right,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.540
you're going to get
the wrong answer.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.680
So it's easy to see how
many people got confused,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.550
and, in fact, finding the
right event can be tricky.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.560
When in doubt, the 4 step
method with constructing

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.460
the tree where you're
not even thinking

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.130
about conditional probabilities
but you're just examining

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.330
the individual outcomes
is a good fall back

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.750
to avoid these kinds of
confusing situations.
