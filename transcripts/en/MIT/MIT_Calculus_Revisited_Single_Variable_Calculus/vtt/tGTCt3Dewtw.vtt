00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.500
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.790
The aim of our lecture today is
to present what is perhaps

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.840
the singly most powerful
recipe for evaluating

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.160
indefinite or, for that matter,
definite integrals.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.920
It's called integration by
parts, and therefore, today's

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.420
lecture is called 'Integration
by Parts'.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.940
And what I want to emphasize is
essentially that this is a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.960
technique which shows us how to
find indefinite integrals,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.510
but then in theory, it
changes nothing over

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.319
what we've had before.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.530
This is essentially, as we've
mentioned, a recipe for being

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.000
able to simplify or reduce
indefinite integrals to things

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.960
that we can handle.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.390
Well, it centers around
the rule for

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.660
differentiating a product.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.150
And to show you what I mean by
that, let's just barge right

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.050
into this thing.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.460
In differential notation, we
call the 'u' and 'v' our

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.260
differentiable functions
of 'x'.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.690
The differential of 'uv' is 'u'
times the differential of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.830
'v', plus 'v' times the
differential of 'u'.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.190
And solving for 'udv', just
transposing, we have that

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.820
'udv' is the differential of
'u' times 'v' minus 'vdu'.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.960
Now, what we do is
we integrate both

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.580
sides of this equality.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.920
On the left-hand side,
we have interval udv.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.270
On the right-hand side, recall
that the integral of the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.145
derivative just gives us back
the original function.

00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:02.580
In other words, if we integrate
the differential of

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.210
'uv' up to an arbitrary
constant, we get

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.150
back 'u' times 'v'.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.480
The integral of 'vdu' we'll just
denote by integral 'vdu'.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.740
And observe that there's really
an arbitrary constant

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.210
coming from this term, an
arbitrary constant coming from

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.130
this term, an arbitrary
constant

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.280
coming from this term.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.920
But since the sum and difference
of arbitrary

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.460
constants is still an arbitrary
constant, we can

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.950
neglected all the constants
here, and just lump them

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.730
together, and at the
end write plus 'c'.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.330
Or we can leave the 'c' off,
making it implied that the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
arbitrary constant is contained
in the symbol

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.820
integral 'vdu'.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.390
All right, now we've done
this, but a much more

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.060
important question would be--
or exclamation, for that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.550
matter-- would be so what?

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.210
See, who cares whether this
happens to be true or not?

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.280
The answer is we care.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.270
That's why we're making
up a lecture on it.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.510
And the reason that
we care is this.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.490
That frequently, for a given 'u'
and 'v', 'udv' may have a

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.040
completely different nature
about it than does 'vdu'

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.230
insofar as being able to
find the integral.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.490
Now again, the best way to show
what we mean by this is

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.040
to choose a particular
example.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.680
Let me start, just arbitrarily
here, picking a couple of

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.930
simple functions for us to
differentiate or to integrate.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.300
Let's pick 'u' to equal 'x'
and 'v' to equal 'sine x'.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.330
Now, it's simple to see from
this example that in this

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.970
case, if 'u' equals 'x' and 'v'
is 'sine x', then 'dv' is

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.356
''cosine x' dx'.

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:40.380
In fact, let's write that down
so we can see it here.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.790
Notice that in this particular
case, integral 'udv' is

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.670
integral of 'x 'cosine
x' dx'--

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.260
'udv'.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.500
On the other hand,
what is 'vdu'?

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.350
'v' is 'sine x'.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:01.790
Then since 'u' equals
'x', 'du' is 'dx'.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.550
Therefore, 'vdu' is just
integral ''sine x' dx'.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.200
Now, look at these
two integrals.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.640
This one we can integrate
just by looking at it.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.760
It's minus 'cosine x'.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.649
This one, well, offhand, we
don't know a function whose

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.720
derivative with respect to
'x' is 'x 'cosine x''.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.360
However, by this recipe, we now
have a way of showing how

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.070
to 'udv' once we know
integral 'vdu'.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.140
In other words, in this
particular problem, letting

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:46.890
'u' equal 'x' and 'dv' being
''cosine x' dx', we can

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.240
proceed as follows.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.480
Namely, by this recipe,
we get what?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.130
Integral 'x 'cosine x' dx' is
equal to-- this is 'udv'

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.790
equals 'u' times 'v'.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.370
Recall that 'u' was 'x', 'v' is
'sine x', so 'u' times 'v'

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.010
is 'x sine x', minus
integral 'vdu'.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.460
But 'v' is 'sine x', 'du' is
'dx', so we wind up with this.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.160
But now we know that the
integral of 'sine x' with

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.740
respect to 'x' is minus
the 'cosine x'.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.640
The minus and the minus cancel
to give me a plus.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.330
And I wind up with that the
integral of 'x 'cosine x' dx'

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.770
is 'x sine x' plus 'cosine
x' plus an

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.790
arbitrary constant, OK.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.760
That's all integration
by parts really is.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.970
All we do here is we evaluate
one integral by knowing

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:38.970
another integral.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.600
And by the way, what I meant
here when I said that one did

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.710
not have to change any of the
theory, what does the integral

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.720
mean here anyway?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.600
What we mean by this is what?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.240
Find all functions whose
derivative with respect to 'x'

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.100
is 'x cosine x'.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.780
Now, what integration by parts
did for us was it showed us

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.330
how to get this result.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.620
But if we didn't know how to get
this result, observe that

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.030
we check the answer the
same way as always.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.100
Namely, one thing that hopefully
we can do is

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.600
differentiate this thing.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.040
And if we differentiate
it, let's see.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.140
This is a product.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.490
It's the first factor times the
derivative of the second.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.380
That's 'x cosine x'.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.430
Plus the second factor times the
derivative of the first.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.100
That's just 'sine x'.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.720
The derivative of 'cosine
x' is minus 'sine x'.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.350
The derivative of
a constant is 0.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.440
And if we now sum up the pieces
that we have here, we

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.900
wind up with 'x cosine x'.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.650
Exactly what we were supposed
to get, OK?

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.190
Now, you see again, nothing
has happened in theory.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.680
All we have now is a technique
that allows us to explicitly

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.210
solve certain problems that
we couldn't have solved

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.420
otherwise, even though we
could've stated them before.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.570
For example, let's go back to
a problem that technically

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.150
speaking we could have presented
before we got to

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.340
this unit of our material.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.930
Let's support that the region
'R' is the region bounded

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.240
above by 'y' equals 'cosine
x', below by the x-axis

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.490
between the y-axis at
'x' equals pi/2.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.040
What we want to do is take this
region 'R' and revolve it

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.530
about the y-axis.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.100
And what we'd like to find is
what volume is generated when

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.160
the region 'R' is revolved
about the y-axis.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.020
Now, when we talked about
volumes and cylindrical

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.420
shells, we already
had the recipe.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.630
Recall that to rotate this
about the y-axis, just to

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.940
refresh memories here, if we
call this 'x' and we call this

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.620
'y', the element of
volume was what?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.010
Well, you swung out a
circumference '2 pi x' times

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.460
height 'y' times
thickness 'dx'.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.590
In other words, that the volume
when this was rotated

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:50.620
about the y-axis was just 2 pi
integral 'x 'cosine x' dx' as

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.850
'x' goes from 0 to pi/2.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.300
You see, I rigged this
particular problem so we

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.800
wouldn't have to waste the fact
that we've already found

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.040
out what the indefinite
integral of 'x

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.650
'cosine x' dx' is.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.870
In other words, we get down
to this step here.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.180
Now, by the first fundamental
theorem of integral calculus,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.490
we know that whatever this
integral is, it's also equal

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.830
to 'G of pi/2' minus 'G of 0',
where 'G' is any function of

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.670
'x' whose derivative with
respect to 'x' is the

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.690
integrand here, which
is 'x cosine x'.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.040
Now, you see, this part, or up
to here, we could have got

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.610
this result without
today's lecture.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.370
The only thing that we learned
to do today that we couldn't

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.059
do before was the idea of how
we find a function whose

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.900
derivative is 'x cosine x'.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.030
In fact, what we
found was what?

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.289
A function whose derivative is
'x cosine x' is just 'x sine

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.390
x' plus 'cosine x'.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.220
So by the first fundamental
theorem, the answer to our

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.810
volume problem is that it's 2 pi
times the quantity 'x sine

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.330
x' plus 'cosine x' evaluated
between 0 and pi/2.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.660
Putting in 'x' equals pi/2,
this term is pi/2.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.240
This term is 0.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.890
Putting in the lower limit when
'x' is 0, this term is 0.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.030
This term is 1.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.740
We subtract the lower limit.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.310
That gives us a minus 1.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.860
And therefore, the volume that
we get is simply 2 pi times

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.860
pi/2 minus 1.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.830
Again, notice then, that the
only new thing that we had to

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.890
do here was devise a way for
finding a function whose

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.510
derivative with respect to
'x' was 'x cosine x'.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.330
By the way, I think you'll
observe over here that I

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.210
started in kind of a rigged
fashion, namely, I started

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.040
with a specific 'u' and 'v'.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.290
It might be interesting to see
how would one tackle this

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.500
problem if one had just been
given the 'x 'cosine x' dx'

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.040
and had to work from there.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.960
In other words, instead of
working backwards now, let's

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.310
present the problem as it
would come up in a real

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.430
problem, namely, all of a
sudden, we find that we have

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.990
to integrate 'x cosine x'.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.100
And the idea go something
like this.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.120
You see, we say lookit.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.790
If this 'x' weren't in
here, this would be

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:02.940
pretty easy to handle.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.130
So why don't we do this?

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.260
Why don't we call this piece
here 'u' and call

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.060
this piece here 'dv'.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.730
Then, you see, 'du' would
just be 'dx'.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.200
'v' would just be 'sine x'.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.230
In other words, the differential
of 'sine x' is

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.970
'cosine x dx'.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.640
See, if 'u' is 'x',
'du' is 'dx'.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.480
If 'dv' is 'cosine x dx', 'v'
is equal to 'sine x'.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.070
I suppose, technically speaking
here, I should put in

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.060
plus a constant, but I'll show
later why we can disregard

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.010
this constant.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.290
Roughly speaking, it just hinges
on the fact that we

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.770
want only one solution.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.330
But we'll talk about
that later.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.380
For the time being, I'll just
leave out the fact that

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.590
there's a whole family
of functions.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.170
All I want is one function
whose differential

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.140
is 'cosine x dx'.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:54.520
At any rate, I now apply my
recipe, namely, integral 'udv'

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.260
is equal to 'u' times 'v'--

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.100
that's 'x sine x'--

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.580
minus integral 'v', which
is 'sine x', times 'du',

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.050
which is just 'dx'.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.740
In other words, integral 'x
'cosine x' dx' is just 'x sine

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.210
x' minus 'sine x dx'.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.620
But I know how to integrate
'sine x'.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.500
It's just minus 'cosine x'.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.720
Therefore, replacing integral
'sine x dx' by minus 'cosine

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.500
x' plus a constant.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.860
The minus cancels here.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.830
I wind up with the same result
as before, only now hopefully

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.410
in terms of a smooth flow
not that didn't

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.950
presuppose the answer.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.860
Namely, this integral
is 'x sine x' plus

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.000
'cosine x' plus a constant.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.400
And by the way, I should
mention here that this

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.060
technique does require a certain
amount of ingenuity.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.300
In other words, in a given
problem, where you're not told

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.580
what to call 'u' and what to
call 'v', where you have the

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.820
choice of picking what's going
to be 'u' and what's going to

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.610
be 'dv', there is a certain
element of insight that one

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.880
needs to guess wisely.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.470
In this particular problem,
it's kind of obvious

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.360
which way to guess.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.370
But let me, just to give you the
experience, show you what

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.270
happens when you guess
incorrectly.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.600
For example, given the same
problem, why couldn't I have

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.100
said gee, I think I'll let
'cosine x' be 'u', and what's

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.290
left over, namely, 'xdx'.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.790
That will be 'dv'.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.850
Now, notice that mathematically,
no harm is

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:21.760
done this way.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.080
Namely, if 'u' is 'cosine x',
'du' is minus 'sine x dx'.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.040
If 'dv' is 'xdx', 'v'
is 1/2 'x squared'.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.260
And now, applying the recipe,
integral 'udv' is what?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.460
It's 'uv'.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.050
That's 1/2 'x squared' times
'cosine x' minus

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.140
the integral 'vdu'.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.780
But 'vdu' is already minus 1/2
'x squared' 'sine x dx', so

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.020
minus that is plus
1/2 integral ''x

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.670
squared' 'sine x' dx'.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.920
And I wind up with the result
that the integral 'x 'cosine

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.820
x' dx' is 1/2 'x squared'
'cosine x' plus 1/2 integral

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.690
''x squared' 'sine x' dx'.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.460
And there is absolutely nothing
at all wrong with

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:12.420
this, except that the chances
are if I didn't know how to

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.640
find the function whose
derivative was 'x cosine x',

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.330
what is the likelihood that
I know a function whose

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.760
derivative is ''x squared'
'sine x' dx'?

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.140
In other words, here's a case
where replacing 'udv' by 'vdu'

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.930
gave me an equivalent integral
to evaluate which was more

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.830
cumbersome than the first.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.140
In fact, somehow or other, it
would seem that by multiplying

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.560
through here by 2 and solving
for ''x squared' 'sine x' dx',

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.940
that it would seem that somehow
or other this would be

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.560
a way of simplifying
the integral ''x

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.210
squared' 'sine x' dx'.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.170
In other words, if you had
started with this, I think

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.110
you'd accept the fact, well,
this still isn't as nice as

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:57.430
I'd like it, but it does seem
less complicated than this.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.730
You see, at least the power of
'x' is only to the first power

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.050
here, whereas here it's
the second power.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.790
In fact, this leads
to a technique

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.170
called a reduction formula.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.270
Again, using hindsight rather
than foresight, having

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.850
motivated the integral ''x
squared' 'sine x' dx', let's

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.640
see how I could have solved this
particular problem if I

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.380
didn't know what the answer was
going to be in advance.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.000
You see, I say to myself, you
know, this x squared here is

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.980
bothering me.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.270
If that 'x squared' weren't
here, this would be pretty

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.280
easy to handle.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.560
Well, the best way to knock the
'x squared' down is to let

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.840
'u' equal 'x squared',
in which case,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.910
'du' will be '2xdx'.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.710
In other words, your second
power will now be replaced by

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.660
a first power.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.810
It's not perfect, but at least
there's hope here.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.660
At any rate, what I'm saying is
motivated into calling 'u'

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.670
'x squared' and therefore
letting 'dv' be the rest of

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.870
this integrand, which is 'sine
x dx', we wind up with the

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:59.190
fact that 'du' is '2xdx' and
'v' is minus 'cosine x'.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:03.105
Well, you see now, remembering
that 'u' is 'x squared', 'dv'

00:15:03.105 --> 00:15:07.420
is 'sine x dx', the recipe tells
us that integral 'udv'

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.360
is 'u' times 'v'.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:16.290
That's minus 'x cosine x'
minus integral 'vdu'.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:21.480
But integral 'dvu' is integral
twice 'x 'cosine x' dx' with a

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.550
minus sign.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.040
The minus sign in the recipe
makes it plus.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.350
And we therefore wind up with
that integral ''x squared'

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:33.470
'sine x' dx' is equal to minus
''x squared' 'cosine x'' plus

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.650
twice integral 'x
'cosine x' dx'.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.640
By the way, just to refresh your
memories on this, if we

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.880
come back and compare this with
what we had over here,

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.820
it's exactly the same thing.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.080
The only difference now
is that we arrived

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.980
at this thing directly.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.220
Now you see the point is, having
reduced this to this, I

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.190
can now use integration by parts
again to simplify this.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.150
In other words, what I would do
next is let 'u' equal 'x'

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.490
and 'dv' be 'cosine x dx'.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.730
But let's face it, I've already
done this problem.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.950
Time is getting short.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.390
Why do it again?

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.670
The point is that integral 'x
cosine x' using integration by

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.540
parts again is going to come
out to be 'x sine x' plus

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.060
'cosine x' plus 'c' because
that's what we got before when

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.310
we used integration by
parts to do this.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.190
At any rate, what I would now
do is replace integral 'x

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.200
cosine x' in here by this, OK?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.060
And if I do that, I have what?

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:40.750
Integral ''x squared' 'sine
x' dx' is equal to what?

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:45.470
Minus ''x squared' 'cosine x''
plus twice times this, which

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.600
is twice this.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.340
That's what?

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:53.050
2 'x sine x' plus 2 'cosine
x' plus a constant.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.310
And by the way, again notice,
if I wanted to check whether

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.840
this was right, the one thing I
can do if somebody gives me

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.320
this is what?

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.690
I can differentiate it
with respect to 'x'.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.560
When I differentiate it with
respect to 'x', if I get ''x

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.040
squared' 'sine x'' as my result,
this is correct.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.630
Otherwise, I've made
a mistake.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.740
But the idea is keep in mind
that these can always be

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.250
checked because they're
inverse derivatives.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.670
They can always be checked by
actual differentiation.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.849
And again, notice the beauty
of this technique.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:29.310
If somebody said construct the
function whose derivative with

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.730
respect to 'x' is ''x squared'
'sine x'', notice how

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:37.630
difficult it would be to try to
piece this thing together.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.800
See, notice the difference
between being able to check

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.060
that this is a right answer and
how one would find this.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.980
This is the technique of a power
of integration by parts.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.190
In fact, in making up exam
questions, this is exactly how

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.000
professor sometimes do this.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.610
That what you start with is you
start with this, then give

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.300
a person this problem and tell
them to differentiate this.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.140
And that whole mess simply
comes out to be ''x

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.270
squared' 'sine x''.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.830
And that's why a lot of times
when you have a messy problem

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.190
to differentiate and you look
at the answer in the back of

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.060
the book, you become amazed to
see that the thing really

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.910
simplified.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.330
Again, notice the idea.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.630
The integrand here is
relatively simple.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.350
What we have to differentiate to
get that relatively simple

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.960
integrand is not quite
so simple.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.150
But enough about that.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.970
Let me just go on with
a few more examples.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.450
See, I have plenty of examples
in the exercises to keep you

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.980
busy and to give you
drill on this.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.450
All I'm trying to do now is to
motivate places where one

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.520
would want to use integration
by parts.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.700
Well, let me show you one
place it might be used.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.820
One place that it's always worth
trying is when you look

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.680
at the integrand, haven't the
vaguest notion as to how to

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.210
integrate it, but you are able
to differentiate it.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.600
You see, you've got
nothing to lose.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.370
The worst that will happen is
that the resulting integral

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.660
vdu will be no easier to handle
than the original udv,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.800
but at least there's a chance
that something will work.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.720
But let me give you
a for instance.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.290
I see I've written this
rather badly.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.570
This is not 'Stan'.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:10.080
This is the integral of inverse
'tangent x dx', OK?

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.210
Integral inverse
'tangent x dx'.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.780
What function has its derivative
equal to inverse

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.720
'tangent x'?

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.870
Well, you see, the thing I do
know hopefully is what the

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.320
derivative of inverse
'tangent x' is.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.100
The derivative of inverse
'tangent x' with respect to

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.430
'x' is '1 over '1 plus
x squared''.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.760
And by the way, if you don't
know this, there's no hope of

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.360
even beginning the integration
by parts. in other words, we

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.440
have to assume that we
can do something in a

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.280
problem like this.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.070
At any rate, knowing this,
what do I do next?

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.180
I say, well, since I know how
to differentiate the inverse

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.500
tangent, that's a very natural
thing to call 'u' because I

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.170
can certainly find 'du'.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.030
Moreover, the nice thing is that
calling 'dv' 'dx', if I

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.870
can integrate anything,
it's certainly 'dx'.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.280
Namely, what I'm saying is if
'u' equals inverse 'tan x' and

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.790
'dv' is 'dx', then 'du' is 'dx'
over '1 plus x squared',

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.980
and 'v' is just equal to 'x'.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.320
Now, therefore, integral inverse
'tan x dx', in other

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.870
words, integral 'udv',
is just what?

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.150
It's still just 'u' times 'v'.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:18.200
That's 'x' times inverse
'tan x' minus 'vdu'.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.730
That's minus integral
'x' times 'dx'

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.790
over '1 plus x squared'.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.530
Now, look what happens
in this case.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.580
Obviously, with time being short
and having other places

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.520
to show you my failures, namely
in the exercises, I

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.120
picked one that worked nicely.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.260
Here's the case, you see, that
the integral inverse 'tan x

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:43.590
dx', by using parts, becomes
replaced by integral 'xdx'

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.300
over '1 plus x squared'.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.880
This is one I can handle
from before.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.500
This is one where the
substitution 'u' equals '1

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.150
plus x squared' works
very nicely for me.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.160
Or if you're getting glib with
these things, just observe

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.970
that this integrand
is 1/2 natural

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.630
log '1 plus x squared'.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.810
Because how would you
differentiate natural log '1

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.010
plus x squared'?

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.760
It would just be what? '1 over
'1 plus x squared'' times the

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.370
derivative of this,
which is '2x'.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.750
The 2 and the 1/2 would cancel,
and we just have left

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.280
'x over '1 plus x squared''.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.540
In other words, again, notice
that the answer here is what?

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.710
This is the function that one
would have to differentiate

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.730
with respect to 'x' to wind
up with inverse 'tan x'.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.810
I'll show you another example
in a few minutes.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.800
What I did just remember is that
I mentioned why we can

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.370
drop the arbitrary constant.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.250
Let me just take a minute here
and show how this problem

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.600
should have really
been worked.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.180
If we wanted to be precise here,
we'd say OK, 'u' equals

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.620
inverse 'tan x'.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.850
Therefore, 'du' is 'dx over
'1 plus x squared''.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.220
That part's fine.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.810
Then we say, OK, 'dv' is 'dx'.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.850
Now, if 'dv' is 'dx',
what must 'v' be?

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.280
Well, 'v' could be 'x', but it
must be something of the form

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.950
'x' plus some constant,
which I'll call 'c1'.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.240
Could I have chosen 'v'
to be 'x plus c1'?

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.240
Why not?

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.490
In fact, what would have
happened if I did that?

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.620
Notice that what would have
happened in this case is that

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.490
'u' times 'v' now would simply
have been 'x plus c1' times

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:20.060
inverse 'tan x', whereas
integral 'vdu', instead of

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.610
being 'xdx' over '1 plus x
squared' would have been ''x

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:26.840
plus c1' dx' over '1
plus x squared'.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.090
In other words, leaving the
constant in, I would get this.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.810
And now all I want you to see
here, and I've done this just

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.860
for this particular example,
and in the exercises we'll

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.100
work it out in general.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.430
The whole idea is this.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.880
This, of course, can be written
as two terms, one of

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.880
which is 'x inverse tan x', and
the other of which is 'c1

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.990
inverse tan x'.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.770
This also can be written
as two integrals.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.150
Namely, with the minus sign
kept aside here, this is

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:58.390
integral of 'xdx' over '1 plus
x squared' and plus integral

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.500
'c1 dx' over '1 plus x squared',
the minus making

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.440
this minus.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.270
But we know that the integral
'dx' over '1 plus x squared'

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.050
is inverse 'tan x'.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.350
In other words, if we now
separate these into

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.030
pieces, we have what?

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.600
'x inverse tan x' minus
integral 'xdx'

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.660
over '1 plus x squared'.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.040
And notice that the 'c1' term
drops out because we have 'c1

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.670
inverse tan x' occurring
twice.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:32.160
It's this term here,
and it's also

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.340
this part of our integral.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.050
And see, with the minus sign
here, they just cancel out.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.020
And that's why we really don't
have to keep the arbitrary

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.400
constant in there, but if
we wish to, we may.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.080
At any rate, let me summarize
with just one more problem to

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.570
make sure that we have the
technique down fairly pat.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.660
Let's suppose we were given
integral 'log x dx'.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.890
What we certainly do know I hope
by this time is that the

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.580
derivative of 'log x' with
respect to 'x' is '1/x'.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:04.090
Since I can differentiate 'log
x', it becomes very meaningful

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.270
to try letting 'u'
equal 'log x'.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.620
If I do this, 'u' is 'log x'.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.520
'dv' is 'dx'.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.340
'du' then becomes ''1 over
x' dx', and 'v' is 'x'.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.240
And now I put in plus 'c' in
parentheses here to indicate

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.080
that if you wanted to
use it, you could.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.900
At any rate, what happens now?

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.150
Integral udv, integral 'log x
dx' in this case is 'u' times

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.530
'v', which is 'x log x',
minus integral 'vdu'.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.830
Well, you see the 'x' times
the '1/x' is just 1.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.920
Therefore, 'vdu' is just
'dx', so minus that

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.870
is just minus 'dx'.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:43.170
In other words, minus the
integral 'vdu' is just minus

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.450
integral 'dx'.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.100
And now, you see I have
what? 'x log x'.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.020
And this is very easy
to integrate.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.890
It just happens to be minus
'x', then I tack on the

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.600
arbitrary constant.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.830
Again, to check whether this
was the right answer, all I

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.720
have to do is differentiate 'x
log x' minus 'x' with respect

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.070
to 'x' and see if I get 'log
x', and I will, OK?

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.220
Now, how would I use a problem
like this, say,

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.740
in a practical situation?

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.280
Well, for example, suppose I
wanted to find the area of the

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.060
region 'R' where 'R' was the
region bounded above by the

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.540
curve 'y' equals 'natural log
x', below by the x-axis, on

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.710
the left by 'x' equals 1, and
on the right by 'x' equals

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.580
'b', where 'b' can be any number
you want right now as

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.630
long as it's bigger than
1 in this diagram.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.820
Notice that the definite
integral says that the area of

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.110
the region 'R' is the definite
integral from 1

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.250
to 'b', 'log x dx'.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.930
And the first fundamental
theorem of

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:39.320
calculus says lookit.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.720
If you happen to know a function
whose derivative with

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.100
respect to 'x' is 'log
x', you can evaluate

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.460
this thing very quickly.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.140
Namely, it's just 'G of b' minus
'G of 1' where 'G prime

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.470
of x' is 'log x'.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:54.050
Well, you see, we do know a
function now whose derivative

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.160
with respect to 'x' is
'log x', namely, 'x

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.050
log x' minus 'x'.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.550
Consequently, to solve this
problem, all I have to do is

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:06.010
evaluate this between the limits
of 1 and 'b', which I

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:09.780
won't bother doing
right now, OK?

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.180
Now, here's the idea.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.940
What we've really learned here
is one more powerful technique

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.870
for evaluating integrals.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.620
How we arrive at integrals
in no way changes in this

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.710
particular lecture.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.260
All we have now is what?

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.500
A new technique whereby we
evaluate udv by being able to

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.080
evaluate equivalently vdu.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.040
At any rate, that finishes up
what we had in mind for today,

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.760
and so until next
time, goodbye.
