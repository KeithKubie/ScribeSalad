00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.670
Thank you so much David for the introduction and invitation.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.930
I would like to tell you a little bit about the work that we have been doing in our lab.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm an engineer by training.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.070
By the way, I'm a chemical engineer who turned bio-engineer.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.160
So, I'm going to tell you about my perspective on

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.580
solving an important problem in designing therapeutics.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.930
My lab works in the field of drug delivery,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.060
so that's pretty much what I'm going to talk about today.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.240
But an important aspect of drug delivery is

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.330
dealing with the barrier that the body has posed.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.850
So, I'm going to tell you about what those barriers are,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.680
why are they problematic,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.680
and what can we do to overcome them.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.305
But before we start talking about the future of therapeutics,

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:49.085
I think it's worthwhile taking a look at the current landscape.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:53.780
What are some of the important drugs out there that have changed our lives?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.150
Depending on what your favorite drug is,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.800
you may have a different view on this,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.320
but maybe one way to look at this is,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.980
look at the drugs which had been a huge commercial success.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.200
These five drugs are the most blockbuster drugs to date,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.800
that have been designed by the pharmaceutical and biotech industry.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.670
They cover a number of diseases of some common themes there.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.475
Cardiovascular comes up as a key area,

00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:23.270
arthritis, and today they have made

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.540
a lot of money to pharmaceutical and biotech companies.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.240
Starting with Lipitor, the most blockbuster drug in history,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.195
has made about $150 billion,

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:36.145
all the way to Plavix to $84 billion.

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:39.015
That is really a great story,

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.460
because when I tell people,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.430
my friends and family,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.615
that I'm working in the field of drug delivery,

00:01:45.615 --> 00:01:48.785
in their mind these are the example that they see.

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:50.270
They have impacted their lives,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.530
they have improved their lives,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.085
so that's actually the positive side of what we do.

00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.710
But there is a dark side to what we do.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.665
The dark side being that the cost of developing new drugs is currently very high.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:06.740
Now these numbers, I have gotten from a reference and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.665
numbers might be different depending on who you talk to.

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:16.805
But roughly, it takes about three billion dollars and 12 years to make a new drug.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:18.920
When your drug is successful,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.465
like the ones I listed here,

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:23.400
that's wonderful, but these are only few examples.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.520
A lot of drugs don't make that much money.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.560
So when you look at the cost to benefit ratio of the pharmaceutical and biotech industry,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.740
that does actually raise a concern as to how can we

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.450
sustain the kind of innovation that we need to move this field forward.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.190
This three billion dollar is a lot of money.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.020
I think it's very interesting to put that in perspective.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.830
So this thing here,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.755
this is Mars Rover Curiosity and it took off from planet Earth.

00:02:57.755 --> 00:03:00.765
It's landing on a foreign planet,

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:02.350
moving around, taking pictures,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.420
sending data, and the cost of developing this thing is about $2.5 billion.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.980
So, isn't it interesting that it's cheaper to send

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.495
something to a place that most of us have never seen,

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:19.145
only seen in pictures,

00:03:19.145 --> 00:03:22.250
and which is still millions of miles away,

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.305
but it takes as much money, if not more,

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.160
to send something down our throat,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.485
into our body to treat a disease.

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:32.665
Why is that? I guess maybe,

00:03:32.665 --> 00:03:36.640
a simple answer is that we understand the laws

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.600
of physics much better than we understand the laws of biology,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.970
but nevertheless, to me that's a big problem.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.400
How can we understand body better,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.710
and how can we make sure that we can make

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.440
the drugs in a more effective way and cheaper way.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.515
Now, how do we do that?

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:55.450
How can we bring the cost of drug development down?

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.120
There are many aspects of that problem.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.830
Again, depending on who you talk to,

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.625
you might get a different answer.

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:05.630
But to me, the art and science of developing

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.790
a new drug is really fighting this war between safety and efficacy.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.440
What I mean by that is,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.965
when you're doing your experiment in a Petri dish,

00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:16.680
on a bunch of cells,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.340
or on a model substrate,

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.485
and trying to look for a molecule that can become a drug,

00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:23.210
there are many success stories.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.595
Now chemotherapy drugs for an example,

00:04:25.595 --> 00:04:29.430
there are many molecules that can kill cancer cells in the test tube,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.020
but when you try to take it to animals and humans,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.200
that's where most things fall because the barrier or the burden of safety is so high,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.445
that we are not able to dose the patients at the dose that we need to,

00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:45.275
to make the drug effective.

00:04:45.275 --> 00:04:50.090
Whenever there is a tug of war between efficacy and safety,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.850
safety always wins because the first rule of

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.075
drug development is that you do not want to do any harm.

00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:58.580
So because of that,

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.530
many drugs that we hope will reach the patients are not delivered properly,

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.090
are not dosed properly,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.090
and the burden basically leads to the fact that many drugs

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.705
are essentially sub-optimal in the way they are delivered.

00:05:11.705 --> 00:05:14.375
Again, maybe one simplest example is that,

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:16.780
if all you want to do is to kill cancer,

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.150
if you can deliver that drug selectively to the tumor side,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.095
many more drugs can be effectively used for that application.

00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:30.010
So, why is it that it is so difficult to control where the drug goes into the body?

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.100
That entire problem comes from biological barriers.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.270
The body is not designed to distribute the drugs the way we want.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.225
It is designed to control its own metabolism,

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:44.930
and there are very complex set of principles that dictate that.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.420
Most of the time when you deliver drugs,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.345
you are fighting those and not using those.

00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:52.415
Let me give you a few examples.

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:55.625
So, body's outermost barrier, skin,

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:59.315
one of the most formidable barrier that the body has built,

00:05:59.315 --> 00:06:02.275
because the skins job is to keep things out,

00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:04.200
and without that, we wouldn't survive.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.290
If we lose the ability of the skin to form the protection layer against the pathogens,

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.190
against water loss, we would dehydrate in a very short period of time.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.015
So, thankfully because of the skin,

00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:17.630
we are all alive.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.840
But now imagine trying to deliver drugs across the skin,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.325
the skin does not allow it.

00:06:22.325 --> 00:06:26.510
There are very few small molecules which can cross the skin if you put on it.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.270
But try putting a protein or a peptide which

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.300
is really where the therapeutic landscape is going to,

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.190
less than one percent of

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.200
the topically applied drug will enter the skin if you are trying to deliver a protein.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.340
The problem continues if you try to deliver the drug by pill.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.655
Won't it be nice if you can deliver proteins orally?

00:06:46.655 --> 00:06:49.055
But when you deliver proteins orally,

00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:53.635
less than 0.1 Percent of what you ingest will end up in a blood circulation,

00:06:53.635 --> 00:06:57.920
because the GI track is not designed to transport proteins,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.990
it is designed to digest the proteins.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.550
So whatever protein we consume,

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.100
it's going to be digested into its building blocks.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.525
Even if some protein escapes from the stomach into the intestine,

00:07:08.525 --> 00:07:13.430
the mucus layer on the intestine and the epithelium of the intestine is going to make it

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:19.255
very difficult for this protein to enter from the mouth into bloodstream.

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:20.970
Again, for the most part,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.280
that's good because we don't want the proteins we eat to end up in the blood circulation.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.510
But if you're trying to deliver insulin orally for diabetic patients,

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.325
you're not going to be able to do that if you don't design a good system.

00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:35.250
If you go inside the body,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.900
the barriers don't go away.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:43.100
For example, if you're trying to deliver a nanoparticle which can carry you a drug,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.800
imagine injecting that into the blood circulation,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.770
and you want it to go to a specific tissue,

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.500
but the liver is going to take the biggest cut because

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.140
liver's job is to make sure that no foreign circulating particles exist in the body.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.920
So, most of the nanoparticles eventually end up in the liver and the spleen.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.640
So if you're trying to target something like tumors,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.290
you're going to have very few particles left which can do that effectively.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.110
If you're trying to deliver the drug into the brain,

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.725
which is again one of the most formidable barrier that the body has built.

00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:18.020
Brain is a highly privileged organ.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.250
It doesn't really want things from the blood to freely enter into the brain.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.760
It has built a very sophisticated barrier which

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.060
not only prevent the entry of foreign things into the brain,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.180
but whatever enters the brain is pumped back into the blood.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.020
So, very advanced barrier built between the brain and the blood,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.270
which makes it very difficult to deliver drugs into

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.255
the brain for the treatment of neurological disorders.

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:44.180
So when you look at these numbers,

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.915
one percent delivery efficiencies,

00:08:47.915 --> 00:08:50.495
they really bother me as an engineer.

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:55.655
When you look at other parts of engineering where people have developed new technologies,

00:08:55.655 --> 00:08:57.710
like transportation for example.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.840
If I were to tell you that you can take a taxi,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.235
but only one percent of the time you will reach your destination,

00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:06.070
we would never take that taxi.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.720
If you think about airplanes,

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.640
that level of efficiency is not acceptable,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.820
but somehow in the field of drug development,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.200
this low efficiency which had become a building block,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.515
instead of trying to overcome it,

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:20.090
we try to work around it.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:24.260
That ultimately leads to high costs and long-term development times.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.900
So our goal in the lab has been to understand,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.495
how can we overcome these barriers,

00:09:30.495 --> 00:09:33.500
develop mathematical models to predict them,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.280
and develop new tools and technologies to overcome these barriers so

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.240
that we can deliver the drugs through the route that we want,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.620
to the location we want.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.240
With those sort of technologies,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.005
I think the cost and time of drug development can come significantly down.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:53.585
Another key challenge that we are going to face in the field of drug delivery,

00:09:53.585 --> 00:09:57.845
is that the therapeutic landscape is changing dramatically as we speak.

00:09:57.845 --> 00:10:01.460
So if you look at how drugs have evolved over a period of time,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.250
if you go back in history,

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.265
most drugs were small molecules.

00:10:05.265 --> 00:10:09.600
They were extracts from plants' natural molecules.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.500
I wouldn't say it was easy to deliver them,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.875
but easier than the drug that we're facing today.

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:17.240
The biggest challenge there,

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.695
was how to solubilize those molecules, molecules like Paclitaxel.

00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:26.035
So a lot of effort earlier was focused on figuring out solubilization.

00:10:26.035 --> 00:10:29.630
Then came small peptides and proteins like insulin,

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.950
almost a 100 years ago,

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.380
that increased the challenge of delivery.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.785
Then came antibodies, which are not only much larger

00:10:36.785 --> 00:10:40.190
in size compared to typical proteins like insulin,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.440
but they are also required in large doses.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.305
So that adds another layer of complexity.

00:10:45.305 --> 00:10:47.770
Then came nucleic acid,

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.635
where you not only had to deliver them into the body,

00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:53.240
but you basically had to deliver them across

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.880
the cell membrane and sometimes into the nucleus.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.610
So that adds another layer of complexity.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.945
More recently, cells have really come to the table as therapeutic agents.

00:11:03.945 --> 00:11:06.080
These are living entities.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.770
When you deliver them into the body they can do their own things.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.130
So as you go from small molecule to cell,

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.355
your requirements change dramatically.

00:11:16.355 --> 00:11:20.030
So our delivery technologies had to really take that into

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.310
account and be as sophisticated as the drug itself.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.795
Because that landscape is changing constantly,

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:32.090
it's needing constant innovation in terms of technologies,

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.760
and that I think is a key challenge for people who are working in this field.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.910
So let me give you a couple of examples as to what kind of

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:46.100
drug delivery technologies we are working on and where they are in terms of delivery.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.090
One of the key areas in the lab has been trying to

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:54.080
figure out how can we deliver proteins and peptides across the skin,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.520
so things like insulin,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.165
can we develop a patch or a transdermal patch for insulin?

00:11:59.165 --> 00:12:03.860
There are some patches out there like nicotine, testosterone, estrogen.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.295
You can buy a patch for those but they're all small molecules.

00:12:07.295 --> 00:12:09.335
If you try to deliver something large,

00:12:09.335 --> 00:12:11.120
it's not going to cross the skin.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.215
Why is that? Because the skin is a fantastic barrier.

00:12:15.215 --> 00:12:19.175
What you see here is a cross-section of skin.

00:12:19.175 --> 00:12:23.910
If you look at the top-most layer of the skin,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:30.590
this layer here, this is the main reason why your skin is a good barrier.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.420
That's the part that flakes off.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.335
It's only 15 microns in thickness, so extremely thin,

00:12:36.335 --> 00:12:40.805
but it's a fantastic barrier to transport up molecules into it.

00:12:40.805 --> 00:12:44.405
Once the drug crosses this top-most 15 micron,

00:12:44.405 --> 00:12:47.930
it can easily go through the rest of the skin and get absorbed into

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:52.610
blood circulation where the blood capillaries are located right in this region.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.300
If you look at the structure of that top-most layer,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.720
it's literally like a wall where the bricks

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.125
are made up of dead cells which are filled with proteins.

00:13:03.125 --> 00:13:05.210
In this case, it's mostly keratin,

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.395
and the space in between those bricks is filled with lipids.

00:13:09.395 --> 00:13:13.550
These are not ordinary lipids that you find in cell membranes.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.775
These are the lipids which have very long chain.

00:13:16.775 --> 00:13:18.980
What that means is that they exist in

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.735
a very solid gel-like phase and that makes them very difficult to cross.

00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:29.510
Even one lipid bi-layer of this kind is enough to stop the entry of the drug.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.295
In the case of skin,

00:13:31.295 --> 00:13:37.370
the drug has to cross about 50 to 100 of those before getting into blood circulation.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.735
So that's the level of challenge we are dealing with for transdermal delivery.

00:13:41.735 --> 00:13:45.575
So we had been figuring out how to overcome this.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:49.535
The first tool that we developed makes use of ultrasound.

00:13:49.535 --> 00:13:52.970
So this is the device that actually came out of the research.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.160
It's a device about this big.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.900
This particular piece sits on our desk and there's a handpiece.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.580
You put that handpiece on the skin wherever you want to make the skin permeable.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.380
When you turn the device on,

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.445
it sends sound waves at high frequency, the ultrasound waves.

00:14:10.445 --> 00:14:12.455
In about half a minute,

00:14:12.455 --> 00:14:14.000
you make the skin permeable,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.080
about this much spot on the skin is made permeable and that spot

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.640
remains permeable for about 18 to 24 hours.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.805
During that time, you can put the patch that drug diffuses

00:14:25.805 --> 00:14:29.240
across that open spot and enter the blood circulation.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.975
The way it works is that ultrasound causes cavitation,

00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:35.165
it forms pockets of gas.

00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:39.350
So this gas bubbles form on the surface of the skin and they expand.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.675
At one point, they collapse.

00:14:41.675 --> 00:14:43.520
That collapse is very sudden,

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.015
it sends a shockwave and that shockwave can make the skin permeable.

00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:52.025
So this device was approved by the FDA for delivering local anesthesia.

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:55.325
It has been used to deliver a number of other molecules.

00:14:55.325 --> 00:14:59.105
It's been tested in clinical studies to deliver vaccines.

00:14:59.105 --> 00:15:01.220
Many other studies have been done with

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.545
additional molecules which are difficult to deliver.

00:15:03.545 --> 00:15:05.000
About a couple of years ago,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.805
this device was used in another clinical study.

00:15:07.805 --> 00:15:12.170
In this case, it was a different challenge but also dealing with the barrier.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:17.600
So here, we were trying to use ultrasound for the treatment of acne.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.655
The idea was the following,

00:15:19.655 --> 00:15:22.145
that when somebody has acne,

00:15:22.145 --> 00:15:25.430
the sebaceous glands, the sweat glands are overactive.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.820
They are producing a lot of sebum and that blocks

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.940
the channel and that leads to

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.750
the formation or the growth of bacteria and eventually, inflammation.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.610
So we wanted to send these nanoparticles into the deep glands.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.220
These are core-shell nanoparticle.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.870
They have a silica core.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.155
Surrounding the core is a shell of gold.

00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:50.255
When you hit them with laser,

00:15:50.255 --> 00:15:54.035
the gold shell absorb the laser and becomes extremely hot.

00:15:54.035 --> 00:15:58.070
The temperature of that nanoparticle can become hot enough to

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:02.495
basically locally charge the tissue but it's extremely local.

00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:05.209
So even a few microns away from that nanoparticle,

00:16:05.209 --> 00:16:06.365
you don't feel any heat.

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:07.970
So it's a very local,

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.755
very focused way of inducing heat or imparting heat to the tissue.

00:16:12.755 --> 00:16:15.170
The only challenge is that how can you get

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.310
those nanoparticles into the gland where it needs to work,

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.830
and that's where ultrasound came to the rescue.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.255
We put nanoparticles on the skin,

00:16:24.255 --> 00:16:28.495
applied ultrasound, and particles were delivered deep into the gland,

00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:32.200
and then we have done with laser and you can essentially

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.650
kill the local sweat gland and that has beneficial effects.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.615
So this was tested in a number of

00:16:38.615 --> 00:16:42.665
human volunteers and was published a couple of years ago,

00:16:42.665 --> 00:16:48.670
led to very interesting benefits in terms of the appearance and the progression of acne.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:53.590
But we were also interested in developing simpler to use formulations.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.390
By formulations, I mean a gel or an ointment that you can put easily on

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.960
the skin that has its own benefits in terms of reaching to a large skin area,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.310
in terms of simplicity,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.130
in terms of cost of development.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:14.165
We're wondering, what would be a good foundation to develop a technology like that.

00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:18.275
We started thinking about ionic liquids in that context.

00:17:18.275 --> 00:17:23.795
So ionic liquids are basically liquid salts just like sodium chloride,

00:17:23.795 --> 00:17:26.075
except that in the case of sodium chloride,

00:17:26.075 --> 00:17:30.230
you have a sodium and a chloride ion, they're very small.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.790
So they form a solid.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:36.350
If you take a large cation and large anion, they form a liquid.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.830
We did a lot of studies to understand how do

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:44.600
the properties of ions relate to their outcome.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.700
Out of that study came

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:52.565
one particular ionic liquid which is a combination of geranic acid and choline.

00:17:52.565 --> 00:17:55.460
We like these two molecules for a number of reasons.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.890
So geranic acid is a natural molecule.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.190
It's present in oranges and lemongrass.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.865
It's currently used as a food flavorant.

00:18:04.865 --> 00:18:09.260
It has a very citrusy kind of aroma to it.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.760
So it's used as a food enhancer or an aroma enhancer.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:19.295
Choline is present in a number of natural ingredients, predominantly eggs.

00:18:19.295 --> 00:18:24.620
But more importantly, it's taken as a dietary supplement by large number of individuals.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.510
So we said that's interesting.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:31.205
If you take these two molecules with a history of use in humans,

00:18:31.205 --> 00:18:33.125
and by combining them,

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:36.784
if you get a new ionic liquid that can do something very interesting,

00:18:36.784 --> 00:18:39.065
that would be a fantastic opportunity.

00:18:39.065 --> 00:18:43.820
We did that and out of that came the ionic liquid that we call CAGE.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.925
It's an acronym for choline and geranic acid.

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:48.650
It looks like this.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.435
CAGE is a viscous liquid,

00:18:50.435 --> 00:18:54.395
almost like a honey consistency liquid in that bottle there.

00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:57.095
The liquid only has two molecules,

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.640
choline and geranic acid.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.095
But the way they come together,

00:19:00.095 --> 00:19:03.875
they form this very interesting liquid which can solubilize drugs,

00:19:03.875 --> 00:19:07.145
which can enhance the transport of drugs into the skin.

00:19:07.145 --> 00:19:11.645
One molecule that we are very interested in delivering is insulin,

00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:13.220
as I mentioned early on.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.810
So we said, let's see if we can deliver insulin with CAGE.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.475
So we took CAGE,

00:19:19.475 --> 00:19:21.785
we added insulin to it.

00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:25.550
In the beginning, we did a simple transport experiment.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:30.455
We took pig skin and put insulin on the surface of the skin.

00:19:30.455 --> 00:19:33.470
Here is the control experiment where we put insulin,

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.050
insulin hardly anything goes through,

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:40.355
that's to be expected because insulin has essentially no skin permeability.

00:19:40.355 --> 00:19:43.445
But when we deliver insulin from CAGE,

00:19:43.445 --> 00:19:46.130
we see deep penetration into the skin.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.310
Here up to about almost a millimeter into the skin,

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:54.795
we see insulin entering in significant quantities which is very difficult to do.

00:19:54.795 --> 00:19:56.980
So that was very exciting.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.140
Is it really biologically active?

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:05.995
So we did an experiment in a rat model where we put insulin in cage on the rat,

00:20:05.995 --> 00:20:08.260
and that data is shown here.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.110
So if you look at the red graph,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:15.160
that's the glucose level of the rat where we have put insulin in cage on the surface,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.790
and you see a steady decrease in the glucose concentration,

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.020
and the glucose concentration remains low for a long period of time.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:28.760
So you can get that sustained delivery of insulin across the skin into blood circulation.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.000
In contrast, if you just use a salient solution,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.920
you hardly see any penetration.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.160
The blue line here is positive controls.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.435
So if you inject it, that obviously works,

00:20:40.435 --> 00:20:42.740
you do see a drop in glucose level,

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.630
but just a quick drop and a quick recovery.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.495
So there is a certain change in the glucose level.

00:20:49.495 --> 00:20:52.345
In contrast, if you put a patch on the skin,

00:20:52.345 --> 00:20:55.480
you can potentially get sustained release over a long period of time.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.530
So that's where a transdermal patch can make a significant impact.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.110
Not only it can deliver the drug into the body,

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.215
but it can change the rate at which it goes into the body.

00:21:05.215 --> 00:21:09.380
It can also provide a new feature in terms of therapeutic benefits.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:15.220
Oral delivery as you know has been a holy grail so to speak where question is,

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.740
can you deliver proteins and peptides using a simple pill?

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.420
Pill has its own appeal in the sense that we're all used

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.950
to taking pills, vitamin, headache medicines.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.975
So if we can deliver many molecules that way,

00:21:28.975 --> 00:21:33.065
the thought is that would be certainly welcomed from the patient.

00:21:33.065 --> 00:21:38.950
So here, I'm showing you some data of where we made a pill that contains same cage,

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.545
ionic liquid and in which we are suspending

00:21:41.545 --> 00:21:45.830
insulin and we're delivering that to rat in this case.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:50.120
If you look at the graph on the right-hand side just for the moment,

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.945
what it basically shows you is that compared to

00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:56.620
a quick drop that you see in the case of injection,

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.270
you can get a sustained drop in glucose levels when you deliver this orderly.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.030
So it was very interesting because there are

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.150
very few technologies that I'm aware of where

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.835
the same kind of technology platform works

00:22:09.835 --> 00:22:13.030
against multiple platforms and multiple barriers.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.155
In the previous slide, I showed you that it enhances transport across the skin.

00:22:17.155 --> 00:22:20.335
Here, it's enhancing transport across the GI tract.

00:22:20.335 --> 00:22:24.565
So it has some very interesting features that we are currently exploring.

00:22:24.565 --> 00:22:26.980
In the context of order delivery,

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.465
cage does a few things.

00:22:28.465 --> 00:22:30.190
It's a good enzyme inhibitor.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.440
So it inhibits the enzymes in the stomach.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.110
It's a good view catalytic agents.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.135
So when the drug reaches the mucus layer,

00:22:37.135 --> 00:22:40.880
it can clean it out and enhance transport across the mucus layer

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.445
and it also is able to open the tight junctions in the epithelium,

00:22:45.445 --> 00:22:46.985
so can enhance the permutation.

00:22:46.985 --> 00:22:51.850
So it can address all key barriers that are faced in terms of protein delivery.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.455
When you go inside the body,

00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:55.570
your barrier certainly don't go away.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.835
As I mentioned, they exist in different form.

00:22:57.835 --> 00:23:01.335
So that's also something we are quite eager to explore.

00:23:01.335 --> 00:23:03.010
The thought here is that,

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.765
you would take a drug,

00:23:04.765 --> 00:23:07.210
encapsulate that in a nanoparticle,

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.265
it could be a polymeric nanoparticle, could be a hydrogel,

00:23:10.265 --> 00:23:12.190
could be a liposome, and you want

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.725
that nanoparticle to go to a certain tissue in the body.

00:23:15.725 --> 00:23:21.655
Now obviously, that doesn't happen as effectively because nanoparticles get cleared.

00:23:21.655 --> 00:23:23.395
While we are looking at it,

00:23:23.395 --> 00:23:26.320
a question we started asking is,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.240
why is it that there is such a huge contrast between how the body deals

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.685
with foreign entities like nanoparticles compared to its own cells?

00:23:36.685 --> 00:23:39.935
If you think about circulating cells,

00:23:39.935 --> 00:23:43.745
each one of them has a feature that we wish

00:23:43.745 --> 00:23:47.430
and hope that our synthetic nanoparticles can accomplish.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.290
For example, if you want your nanoparticle,

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:54.475
if you want your drug to stay in circulation for a long period of time,

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:56.230
look at the red blood cells.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.080
Each red blood cell stays in circulation for

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.490
about four months and after its time is up, it gets cleared.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.255
But, there is no therapeutic.

00:24:07.255 --> 00:24:08.890
There is no small molecule,

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:10.150
there is no large molecule,

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:15.250
no nanoparticle which can come close to staying in circulation for four months.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.255
If you want your material,

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:23.610
your therapeutic to bind selectively to blood vessel or somewhere in the body,

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.455
look at what platelets do.

00:24:25.455 --> 00:24:29.960
So platelets are inactive in their native state,

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.110
but whenever there is damage to the blood vessel,

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.260
they get activated, they bind selectively and amplify

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.640
the signal to really induce the formation of the clot.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.305
So that self-amplifying highly targeted mechanism of binding

00:24:43.305 --> 00:24:45.600
is inherent to the platelets in a way that

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.060
is very challenging for a nanoparticle to mimic.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.620
If you want your particles,

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.025
you are therapeutic to go deep into the tissue,

00:24:52.025 --> 00:24:53.990
look at what macrophages do.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.340
Now, macrophages stay in the circulation for a long time.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.410
Their job is to do immune surveillance.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.875
But, whenever they sense something wrong in the tissue,

00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:06.010
they escape the blood vessel and go deep into

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.460
the tissue in a way that nanoparticles cannot.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:14.690
If you think about how drugs and nanoparticles navigate themselves in the tissues,

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.765
they do so by diffusion,

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:18.670
and diffusion is extremely slow.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.745
So it takes a long time for them to go deep into the tissue.

00:25:21.745 --> 00:25:25.030
So many people who are developing therapies for cancer,

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:29.015
they have realized that the drugs can access the surface of the tumor,

00:25:29.015 --> 00:25:32.880
but not deep inside because of the poor diffusion into the tissue.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.285
But, macrophages had no such problem.

00:25:35.285 --> 00:25:37.525
They can go straight deep into the tumor.

00:25:37.525 --> 00:25:40.820
So the question we have been asking is,

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:46.000
what can we learn from these natural examples and how can we adopt some of

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.095
those principles into designing

00:25:48.095 --> 00:25:51.265
synthetic carriers which can deliver drugs in a better way.

00:25:51.265 --> 00:25:53.950
If you look at the contrast between

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.405
natural cells like red blood cells and synthetic materials,

00:25:58.405 --> 00:26:00.520
what are the differences between

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.625
these two systems which can drive such different response?

00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:08.095
If we get better at synthesizing newer materials,

00:26:08.095 --> 00:26:11.350
and if you understand the biological systems in a better way,

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:16.690
can we mend the two and begin to coexist in this intermediate range where we can

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:21.955
use biomimetic strategies to overcome some of the key hurdles in drug delivery.

00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:24.605
Now, when you look at these two systems and you say what is different,

00:26:24.605 --> 00:26:26.540
and you say, "Well, a lots of things are different.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.690
Their surface is different,

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.280
their competition is different."

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.260
But as an engineer, I really got intrigued by the differences in the physical properties.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.905
Their shapes are different,

00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:38.665
their flexibility is different.

00:26:38.665 --> 00:26:41.080
So question we've been asking is,

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.930
these physical parameters, do they really make

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:47.140
a difference in terms of their behavior in the body?

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:52.945
So the first step was to make synthetic particles that can span different shapes,

00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:56.980
which is very difficult to do because if you're making a material or making

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.180
a particle or sphere is energetically most favorable shapes.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.105
So going away from that always poses a challenge.

00:27:04.105 --> 00:27:06.535
So one of my talented graduate students,

00:27:06.535 --> 00:27:09.385
Julie Champion, who was a faculty member at Georgia Tech,

00:27:09.385 --> 00:27:13.150
she figured out a way to make particles of different shapes starting

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:16.810
from disk to rods to UFO-shaped particles,

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.505
if somebody wants them.

00:27:18.505 --> 00:27:20.525
Then she started asking,

00:27:20.525 --> 00:27:23.060
does it really make a difference?

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.915
One of the first experiments she did,

00:27:25.915 --> 00:27:28.610
was she fed them to the macrophages.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.730
Long story short, it turned out that,

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.150
it made a huge difference.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:36.790
Whether or not particles went inside the cells in a way that depends on the shape.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.790
So if you have a macrophage and if you have

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:44.155
a rod-like particle that approaches the cell with the pointy end,

00:27:44.155 --> 00:27:46.105
it got internalized very quickly.

00:27:46.105 --> 00:27:48.550
But, if the same particle come from the side,

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.500
it was not able to get internalized.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.670
So from the cell's point of view,

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:57.845
shape made a huge difference in terms of the outcome of this interaction.

00:27:57.845 --> 00:28:02.020
That led us to all kinds of interesting questions as to how

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.860
to other aspects of particle interaction are impacted by the shape.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:11.004
We found out that if you take an antigen lack of vaccine and put that on the particle,

00:28:11.004 --> 00:28:14.530
the way the immune cell pursues that vaccine is very

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:19.405
different depending on whether you have a sphere or a rod-like particle.

00:28:19.405 --> 00:28:24.715
That may have some origins as to how pathogens are processed by the immune system,

00:28:24.715 --> 00:28:28.210
where pathogens that come in very unique shapes could have

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.630
some potential advantage in terms of their inherent immunogenicity.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:38.495
The way the body generates an allergic response to nanoparticles also depends on shape.

00:28:38.495 --> 00:28:44.215
So those of you who are active in the field of nanomedicine may be aware of this that,

00:28:44.215 --> 00:28:49.810
allergic reaction to nanoparticles is a huge concern for some of the nanoparticles.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.515
A couple of years ago, we showed that simply taking

00:28:53.515 --> 00:28:57.175
a sphere and turning that into a rod-like particle,

00:28:57.175 --> 00:29:02.020
you can essentially mitigate most of the allergic response in the animal model.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.370
Same thing happens with respect to particles softness.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.934
So here, we made particles of the same material,

00:29:08.934 --> 00:29:10.775
but we changed their softness.

00:29:10.775 --> 00:29:12.685
We made a soft version of it,

00:29:12.685 --> 00:29:16.900
which is almost like a gel cell membrane like elasticity,

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.685
and we made a hard virgin,

00:29:18.685 --> 00:29:21.755
and when we inject these two particles in the blood,

00:29:21.755 --> 00:29:25.790
we found out that the softer particles circulate for a much longer time.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:30.080
They escape the clearance by the immune system much more significantly,

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.310
and that basically gave us an idea as to how important these elastic properties are,

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.535
which in hindsight makes sense because

00:29:37.535 --> 00:29:41.605
most materials or most entities in the body are soft.

00:29:41.605 --> 00:29:44.785
Made from either proteins, or lipids,

00:29:44.785 --> 00:29:46.190
and compared to that,

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.970
most synthetic materials are very hard.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.465
So inherently, they stand out as foreign entities.

00:29:52.465 --> 00:29:56.880
So softness is a key parameter in our mind.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.525
So, when you combine these two parameters,

00:29:59.525 --> 00:30:04.310
the shape and the elasticity that is inherent to biological systems,

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:09.170
we started wondering if we put them together can we make some interesting materials?

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:13.530
So, our first attempt at that was to make synthetic red blood cells,

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:18.370
and by that I mean particles that physically look like red blood cells.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.600
So, the picture on the left those are our particles sRBC.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.870
So, this synthetic red blood cells made from proteins and polyelectrolytes,

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.760
and on the left-hand side,

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.160
you see natural mouse red blood cells.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.410
So, if you compare the morphology of these two,

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:37.910
you can begin to imagine the structural similarity that we're quite excited about.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.890
Just like natural red blood cell,

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:43.579
these soft particles can squeeze themselves through small capillaries,

00:30:43.579 --> 00:30:46.280
they can carry oxygen if you load hemoglobin into them.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.540
So, you can begin to build for

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.380
a complex architectures and functionalities into these particles.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.970
Going one step beyond,

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:57.095
we wondered whether we can mimic platelets to make synthetic platelets.

00:30:57.095 --> 00:31:01.400
That is an important medical problem because there is currently

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.625
no synthetic material that you can inject

00:31:04.625 --> 00:31:08.060
in the blood as a replacement for natural platelets.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.890
So, If somebody's bleeding profusely,

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:14.165
there is no treatment other than natural platelet that you can use.

00:31:14.165 --> 00:31:17.105
But the problem with Max-Cut platelets that you cannot store them,

00:31:17.105 --> 00:31:18.455
so that's always a challenge.

00:31:18.455 --> 00:31:20.045
So, we made these particles.

00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:23.990
These are completely synthetic particles we made using albumin.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.470
They have a similar size and shape like natural platelets,

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.900
and we put targeting ligands on them to make

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.585
them bind to the blood vessel minute is damaged,

00:31:32.585 --> 00:31:35.705
and we did a simple test to see if the stop bleeding.

00:31:35.705 --> 00:31:38.210
So, compared to a salient control,

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.310
the synthetic platelets were able to reduce

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:43.340
the breeding type dramatically and currently we are building on

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:48.545
to that to see if we can move them to the next stage of development.

00:31:48.545 --> 00:31:53.150
While we are trying to mimic the principles of natural cells,

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.740
we realize we're not quite there yet,

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.805
so it's more of a lifelong query than a quick fix.

00:31:58.805 --> 00:32:01.820
We wondered while we are working on it,

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.250
can we somehow make use of

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:08.990
the circulatory cells to bring on some of these functionalities into synthetic particles.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.405
So, for example, if we cannot design

00:32:11.405 --> 00:32:14.870
a nanoparticle that can stay in circulation for a long time,

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:18.230
can we just make them hitch a ride on red blood cell?

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:22.610
So, we designed nanoparticles which are attached themselves to red blood cells.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:26.630
So, you can see a red blood cell with number of particles attached to it.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:31.025
The underlying question was actually quite fascinating.

00:32:31.025 --> 00:32:36.890
Now, imagine that complex of red blood cell and nanoparticles arriving in the liver,

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:42.160
and the macrophage is looking at it and it sees a foreign signal coming from

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:47.655
the particle and self signal coming from the red blood cell who's going to win,

00:32:47.655 --> 00:32:49.550
and what tips that balance?

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.010
So, it lead us to very interesting set of questions

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.025
which I'll be happy to discuss with you at a later time.

00:32:55.025 --> 00:32:57.830
But the first key question we wanted to ask is,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.660
does it stains circulation?

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.344
So, compared to free particles,

00:33:02.344 --> 00:33:04.535
which get cleared from the blood before we know it,

00:33:04.535 --> 00:33:06.275
this is an experiment in a rat.

00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:12.695
So, these free particles most of them got clear even before we could measure.

00:33:12.695 --> 00:33:14.960
If you simply put d one red blood cell,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.645
this time circulation for a much longer.

00:33:17.645 --> 00:33:22.850
If you put polyethylene glycol on the surface of this exposed particle,

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.700
you can keep them in circulation for even longer,

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.760
you can keep them in the circulation for days,

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:34.565
so that really opens up new functionalities from these particles.

00:33:34.565 --> 00:33:36.170
So, what happens to them eventually?

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.855
The particles do come off over a period of time.

00:33:38.855 --> 00:33:41.990
What happens is that when these complexes of

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.829
red blood cells and nanoparticles go to small capillaries,

00:33:45.829 --> 00:33:49.085
the red blood cell gets stretched and its particle

00:33:49.085 --> 00:33:52.370
gets attached to the endothelium the surface of the blood vessel.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.355
So, it's a great way of transferring a particle

00:33:55.355 --> 00:33:59.240
from the red blood cell to the surface of the blood vessel.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.985
Red blood cell itself is basically let go,

00:34:01.985 --> 00:34:03.410
it continues to circulate.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.680
So, if you look at the circulation of red blood cell itself,

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.540
it is not impacted.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.920
Turns out that the strategy has been used by pathogens.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.990
So what you see here is an electron micrograph of hemoparty nella,

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:20.810
it's a bacterium that's found in cattle,

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:24.710
and it has found a way to attach itself to red blood cell,

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.520
and by doing so it can avoid clearance from the circulation.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.975
So, some really smart pathogens have figured it out way before we did.

00:34:32.975 --> 00:34:35.330
This strategy works for a variety of particles.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.810
So, here we have used hydrogen nanoparticles,

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.230
liposomes, polymer particles, protein particles,

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.600
they all work about the same principle because it's

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:50.000
a very physically driven mechanism not chemistry specific.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.655
These particles tend to go to the lungs.

00:34:52.655 --> 00:34:57.535
They do so because lung has largest number of capillaries per unit mass.

00:34:57.535 --> 00:35:00.415
So, when these complexes go to the lung capillaries,

00:35:00.415 --> 00:35:04.375
the particles are dislodged from the red blood cell by the endothelium.

00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:08.120
So, it's a great way of targeting nanoparticles with the lungs.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.410
If you don't want lungs,

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.045
if you want them to go somewhere else,

00:35:11.045 --> 00:35:12.170
you can do that as well.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:16.520
So, here we get this red blood cell nanoparticle complexes in the artery,

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.335
and then they go to the brain.

00:35:18.335 --> 00:35:23.475
So, here we are getting about 10 percent of the injected dose to go into the brain.

00:35:23.475 --> 00:35:26.680
The significance of that is that number is among

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.080
the highest fraction of nanoparticle

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.125
delivered to the brain compared to what people have seen.

00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:35.530
Even the best performing antibody that people are discovering for

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:39.620
the purpose of entering the brain is not able to come even close.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.530
So, we are very excited about the potential of targeting

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:47.255
nanoparticles to different organs and based on this principle.

00:35:47.255 --> 00:35:49.715
Once you like hitting right,

00:35:49.715 --> 00:35:53.510
why stop at red blood cells start hitching ride on all kinds of cells,

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:57.860
and we like to ride on macrophages and monocytes.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.670
We like them because they know how to get deep into the tissues.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:06.815
So, here we figured out a way to attach a particle to macrophage.

00:36:06.815 --> 00:36:09.200
The difficult thing about macrophages that unlike

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.290
red blood cells which are happy to take your particle,

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:15.200
macrophages want to eat it too because that's their job.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.615
So, we figured out that if you make a disc shaped particle and that is flexible,

00:36:20.615 --> 00:36:22.400
it can attach to the macrophage,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.065
but not get internalize.

00:36:24.065 --> 00:36:27.095
If you give them spheres, they will just gobble it up.

00:36:27.095 --> 00:36:31.460
This little particle can go for a ride wherever the macrophage goes.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.725
The macrophage really holds onto it.

00:36:33.725 --> 00:36:35.180
So, it doesn't go anywhere,

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.555
and it's thin enough so that it doesn't hinder the macrophage,

00:36:38.555 --> 00:36:42.260
so it's a great way to get into different tissues in the body.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.330
So, what we're doing with it right now,

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:48.785
our main target is to use this for the treatment of cancers,

00:36:48.785 --> 00:36:51.440
with the idea that if you take a large tumor,

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.925
any typical large tumor,

00:36:52.925 --> 00:36:55.775
it has macrophages in massive quantities.

00:36:55.775 --> 00:37:00.695
That happens because macrophages is a key part of body's innate immune system,

00:37:00.695 --> 00:37:02.090
so when tumor develops,

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:05.345
these macrophages go in there and monocytes as well.

00:37:05.345 --> 00:37:09.755
The initial approach is to attack the tumor,

00:37:09.755 --> 00:37:12.740
but the tumor override that signal and they become

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.085
essentially part of the tumor because they're very plastic in nature.

00:37:16.085 --> 00:37:20.000
So, we are delivering cytokines from these backpacks,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.450
so that we constantly reminding the macrophage to take on

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:27.440
an anti-tumor phenotype so as to launch an anti-tumor response.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.945
So, currently we're in the middle of the studies,

00:37:29.945 --> 00:37:35.300
and I hope to have more to tell about that in the coming months to a year.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.330
Where we see this field overall going is that,

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.630
we as materials scientists had met a lot of

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.870
progress in making different kinds of materials, liposomes,

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:48.890
nanoparticles, and the interface between

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.540
the material world and

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.070
the cellular world coming from red blood cells macrophages and T-cells,

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:58.145
they existed in two different parts of the world.

00:37:58.145 --> 00:38:03.800
But as we get better and better in terms of designing complex nanoparticles and either

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.530
using them as an inspiration to make

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.040
this particles or simply feature ride on them for the time being,

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.625
we can begin to blend a gap between these two and that I

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:17.135
think really opens up new opportunities

00:38:17.135 --> 00:38:20.840
especially as the world-up therapeutics is

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.815
beginning to think of cells as a key part in the drug landscape.

00:38:24.815 --> 00:38:27.050
So, let me end my talk here,

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.985
and maybe save some time for questions.

00:38:28.985 --> 00:38:31.100
This is the slide I showed you early on in terms

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.575
of the biological barrier that we're facing.

00:38:33.575 --> 00:38:36.290
With the technology that we had developed in the lab,

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:40.475
we are making significant progress in terms of overcoming these barriers.

00:38:40.475 --> 00:38:41.675
So, for a skin,

00:38:41.675 --> 00:38:43.280
we had gone from one percent,

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.750
to about 20 percent in terms of delivery of insulin and nucleic acids.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:51.230
Foreign testing, we had gone from very low number for

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.455
oral uptake to high double-digit transport of proteins.

00:38:54.455 --> 00:38:57.365
In terms of delivering particles within the body,

00:38:57.365 --> 00:39:00.845
less than one percent going to the tumor and other target tissues,

00:39:00.845 --> 00:39:05.855
we can go up to a high number in terms of targeting or something about the brain.

00:39:05.855 --> 00:39:11.335
So, that's a significant improvement in the delivery efficiency across the barriers.

00:39:11.335 --> 00:39:12.700
But the bigger impact,

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.080
I think of these numbers,

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.875
is that the current therapeutic world is very

00:39:17.875 --> 00:39:21.920
focused in terms of how certain molecules can be delivered.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.980
For example, when somebody is developing a protein drug,

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.335
you immediately think about only injections,

00:39:27.335 --> 00:39:30.620
automatically discounting the possibility to use transformer

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:34.295
or oral because of this high barriers.

00:39:34.295 --> 00:39:37.115
Once you start crossing these barriers,

00:39:37.115 --> 00:39:40.010
that really open some an impacting way.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.800
Once you take away that stereotype,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.330
in terms of which route can be used for which molecule that really enables

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:51.935
not only delivery of these molecules but also impact discovery of new drugs.

00:39:51.935 --> 00:39:54.755
That's where I see the future and

00:39:54.755 --> 00:39:59.420
huge impact of delivery technologies on the therapeutic landscape.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.325
So let me end here.

00:40:01.325 --> 00:40:06.650
I want to end my talk by thanking you for all coming here on a Wednesday evening.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.325
I want to thank all the students who had done this wonderful work that I presented.

00:40:10.325 --> 00:40:13.760
The top picture here is a drawing by one of my students.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.160
So, one fine day I go to the lab and I see this drawing on the fume hood,

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.515
and it shows how our lab works.

00:40:20.515 --> 00:40:22.960
So, everybody in the lab has a job.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.455
So, somebody's responsible for purchasing supplies,

00:40:27.455 --> 00:40:30.439
one person is responsible for injecting animals,

00:40:30.439 --> 00:40:32.340
and this is me.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.110
My job is to stay in my office and say.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:37.825
"Sounds great", which is exactly what I do.

00:40:37.825 --> 00:40:41.635
So, I'm deeply thankful to all their hard work and thank you again.

00:40:41.635 --> 00:40:43.240
Thank you for the invitation,

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.910
and if there's time I'll be happy to answer questions.
