00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:17.149
Coral reefs are some of the most
spectacular ecosystems

00:00:17.173 --> 00:00:18.324
on the planet.

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:20.317
They're also some of the most vulnerable.

00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:21.873
But how can we protect the reefs

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:23.961
and the animals and plants
who rely on them?

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:25.415
And how can we make sure

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.564
our protected areas aren't hurting those
who use reefs to survive?

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:30.255
These are some of the big questions

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.348
facing marine conservation
biologists today.

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:33.769
Let's take Fiji, for example.

00:00:33.793 --> 00:00:36.445
Fiji is series of islands
in the South Pacific Ocean.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.469
To help balance the need
for conservation and making a living,

00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:42.161
scientists had suggested
that instead of one big park

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.797
which provides a lot of coverage
for one reef system

00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:46.561
while leaving the rest unprotected,

00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:49.109
a better way is to create
a system of protected areas

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.607
nested together like pearls on a string.

00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:53.600
This idea is called connectivity.

00:00:53.624 --> 00:00:56.558
In this way, scientists can protect
lots of different habitats

00:00:56.582 --> 00:00:59.691
while not excluding people
from their traditional fishing grounds.

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:03.493
Now, the only way this string-of-pearls
kind of reserve network is going to work

00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:05.576
is if each park is connected
to other parks.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.354
There are two main benefits to this.

00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:08.860
First of all, insurance.

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:10.652
If something bad happens to one park,

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:12.572
say, an oil spill or coral bleaching,

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:14.691
then because that park
is part of a system,

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:17.874
it can be reseeded from other parks
that escaped the event.

00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:19.827
The second benefit is representation.

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:21.518
By conserving many different areas,

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:24.691
scientists ensure that lots
of different habitats get protected.

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:28.112
This way, they can make sure
all the different marine habitats in Fiji,

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:31.127
such as coral reefs,
mangroves, and sea-grass beds,

00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:32.437
are all represented.

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:36.224
This way, we don't unduly settle
any particular village or group of people

00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:39.481
with the economic burden of having
their fishing grounds off-limits.

00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:41.602
By sharing the cost
around the communities,

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:44.091
they can also share the benefits.

00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:46.242
So if we agree
that rather than one big park,

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:47.613
we should have lots of parks

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:50.058
of different sizes
and covering different habitats,

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:53.300
then scientists need to make sure
those smaller parks are connected,

00:01:53.324 --> 00:01:56.329
because if they're not,
they probably won't be self-sustaining.

00:01:56.353 --> 00:01:57.593
But how do we know that?

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.634
That's where genetics and DNA come in.

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:01.904
By looking at how closely related

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:04.396
the fish in each one
of these small reserves in Fiji

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.570
are to each other,

00:02:05.594 --> 00:02:06.790
scientists can figure out

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:10.029
how much migration is going on
among the reserves within the system.

00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:12.875
Now it's important to look
at a variety of different species

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.966
because there's no guarantee
that what's going on with these guys

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.680
is what's going on with these guys.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.820
But if we look closely
and at enough species,

00:02:19.844 --> 00:02:22.201
we can see whether or not
the necklace is working.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.789
What scientists have found
so far is that, in general,

00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:28.085
there's a fair amount of connectivity
amongst the parks within Fiji.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.889
But it's not just a big free-for-all;

00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:32.086
rather, it seems that, for some species,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.715
babies born in the far west
are having a hard time

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.795
making it to the islands in the far east.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.733
To help deal with that,
conservation biologists are suggesting

00:02:39.757 --> 00:02:42.393
that there be enough parks
in both the east and the west

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:43.956
to keep the populations healthy.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.512
This isn't just in Fiji, either.

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:48.456
Lessons about reserve connectivity
can help across the world.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.219
In places like Indonesia, Papua New Guinea

00:02:51.243 --> 00:02:52.405
and the Bahamas,

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.161
scientists are using a variety
of tools to help understand

00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:57.319
how individual parks
can function together,

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.815
so that their sum is greater
than their whole.

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.125
And this way, we can keep
the beautiful necklace

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.977
that is our coral reefs, intact.
