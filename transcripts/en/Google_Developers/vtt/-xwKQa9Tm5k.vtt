00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.570

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.764
So many developers
building cool stuff.

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:16.680

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:18.721

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.991
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
You should cheer up,

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.900
because a new version
of Google Play Services

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.930
has just been released.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.250

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.750

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.040
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
For you developers,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.800
this means it's time to go out
there and build better apps

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.430
using Google Play Services.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.400
Let's check out the highlights.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.750
Welcome to release 8.4
of Google Play Services.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.610
Let's start this off
with new announcements

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.900
for the App Invites API.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.920
As you may recall, you can
already add your own custom

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.800
image that your
friends will see when

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.370
they receive an app invite.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.870
Well, in this release, we took
that concept even further now

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.390
allowing you to put any custom
content for the entire invite.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.780
This gives you the power to
truly customize the invite

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.020
to perfectly match your
context and make the invite as

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.780
attractive as possible.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.390
And now turning to the Maps API.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.110
As you know, it's been
possible to draw polygons

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050
on maps for a long time.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.680
For example, here we have a map
of Mountain View in California,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.360
and here we have drawn a polygon
around the Moffett Airfield.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.680
And here's a polygon
around my favorite working

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.920
place, the Googleplex.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.010
The cool thing we
introduced in this release

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.370
is that you can add a Click
Listener to these polygons.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.560
So for example, if
the user clicked

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.980
on the polygon around
Googleplex, then

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.850
your app could
automatically zoom

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.130
into the entire area you have
defined for that polygon.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.960
So this brings user
interactions to the next level.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.340
Turning our attention to the
Play Games Player Stats API.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.190
Remember that in
a previous release

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.460
we talked about
how important data

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.260
is to understand
game player behavior,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.080
and that the Player Stats
API in Play Game Services

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.070
puts structure to
it, allowing you

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.020
to turn this data
into actions based

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.680
on user spending, engagement,
and progression in your game.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.280
Well, in this release
we've extended this concept

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.910
by allowing you to look into
the future, because we're now

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.350
giving you two probabilities you
can take actions based on-- how

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.310
likely your users are to churn
and how likely your users are

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.930
to spend money
over the next week.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.740
And this is almost
like magic since it's

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.170
giving you a hint of what
might happen in the future.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.560
Prior to this release, it
could have looked something

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.415
like this.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.180
Luckily that was
how it could have

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.910
looked like before this release
of Google Play Services.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.400
Now both of these probabilities
are part of Player Stats API,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.200
giving you the
power to understand

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.960
player behavior at a
level previously only

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.220
available to big studios.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.010
And we also have
some announcements

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.720
for Fused Location Provider.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.670
As you know, Fused
Location Provider

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.390
can combine
information using GPS,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.970
cell tower, and Wi-Fi signals to
accurately determine position.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.130
In this release, we
have greatly improved

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.470
how Fused Location
Provider detects location

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.830
from cell towers.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.430
Before, location was retrieved
using only the primary cell

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.930
tower.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.170
But now, Fused Location Provider
also uses other towers nearby

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.000
to provide accurate location.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.290
And we've also improved location
detection from Wi-Fi access

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.350
points, particularly in areas
where GPS is not available,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.240
such as indoors.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.980
And you get even more
with this release,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.680
because we have also
important announcements

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.850
for the Nearby API.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.790
Remember the Nearby Publish
Subscribe Architecture

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.980
which allows your app to detect
and retrieve data from beacons?

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.820
Well, in this release we've
enhanced this capability

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.150
so your app does not have
to be in the foreground

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.640
to detect a beacon.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.650
You can now get notified
when a beacon is nearby,

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.260
even when your app
is in the background.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.080
Check out the release blog
post for more information.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.430
And for the Mobile
Vision API, we now

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.000
have added support
for Aztec Bar Codes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.650
And that's it for the
highlights of this release,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.170
but check out some of these
other resources as well.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.910
Now it's your turn

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.090

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.751
So go out there and
create some great apps.
