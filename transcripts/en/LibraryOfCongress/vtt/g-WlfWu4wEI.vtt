00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.640
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress in Washington,
D.C.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.360
&gt;&gt; Author Sherri Duskey Rinker has wonderful
memories of reading with her grandmother as

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.980
a young girl.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.310
And since becoming a mom, she creates new
memories reading regularly with her son.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.990
We're fortunate that she's also written many
children's books of her own so that we could

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.409
actually read together with our own loved
ones.

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:37.340
Her books include "Good Night, Good Night,
Construction Site," "Silly, Wonderful You,"

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.410
and the "Steam Train, Dream Train" books.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.290
Author-illustrator John Rocco has also brought
us many children's books.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.190
I bet you read some of these yourself.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.310
"Moonpowder."

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.420
"Blizzard."

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.530
"Blackout."

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.910
"Wolf, Wolf."

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.460
"Fu Finds a Way."

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.460
Or "Beep!

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.460
Beep!

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.660
Go to Sleep!"

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.530
Well, their new book "Big Machines" the story
of Virginia Lee Burton comes out this week.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.460
And you can meet the authors and have books
signed between 11:30 and 12:30 p.m. today.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.799
So let's give a warm welcome to Sherri Duskey
Rinker and John Rocco.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.630
^M00:01:20
[ Applause ]

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.149
^M00:01:27
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Hi guys.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.149
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.319
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Oh, my word.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.880
That was kind of lame.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.930
Hi!

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.979
&gt;&gt; Hi!

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.280
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: I'm so excited to
be here.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.280
Are you guys excited?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Woo!

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.280
Okay.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
So I'm Sherri Duskey Rinker.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.280
Oh, I should've had you guess which one of
us was Sherri Duskey Rinker and which one

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.280
was John Rocco.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.280
Would you have been able to guess?

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.280
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: I'm Sherri.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.700
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: You could guess.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.700
I know.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.869
So we're here to tell you a story.

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.249
Did you want to say something, John?

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:56.449
I'm a microphone hog.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.219
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: I just wanted to say hello.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.219
Good morning.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.219
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.989
&gt;&gt; For coming to the Library of Congress town
square.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:08.399
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Okay.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.399
All right.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.260
So John and I wrote a story.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.060
We got an idea together for a book.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.920
And just like all stories that are awesomely
great, our story starts out -- how did it

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
start out?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.510
What does that say?

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.260
Once upon a time.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.970
We, in a land called "Folley Cove "-- and
there's a picture of Folley Cove far, far,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.710
far away -- or maybe about an eight hour drive
from here.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.360
There lived a very magical person.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.470
And this you may already guess is Virginia
Lee Burton, who's an author and an illustrator

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.110
and gave us amazing, amazing books like "Mike
Mulligan and his Steam Shovel" or "The Little

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.110
House."

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.670
Do any of you know those stories?

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.670
Some of you.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.310
[applause] So, as we were researching all
about Virginia Lee Burton, we learned some

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.490
amazing things about her.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.030
Like she was a dancer.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.590
Do any of you take dancing lessons?

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.650
Some of you?

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.750
And she even when she was young she loved
to write stories.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.010
Do any of you like writing stories?

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.150
Me too.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.460
And she liked to draw and do art.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.210
And this is a picture of her in her studio.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.470
And she loved to teach.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.390
When I was young, I loved to play school.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.200
Did any of you like that?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200
Love playing school.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.900
Well, Virginia Lee Burton grew up to be a
teacher and to teach people how to do art.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.290
She had a special technique where she cut
things out of wood or linoleum and made pictures.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.160
And then they would ink up the linoleum plate
and they would put paper or fabric on them

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.130
and they would step on it.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.750
And they would peel off the paper or fabric.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.370
And this is the art they created.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.550
You can see me holding it.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.550
Go ahead.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.310
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: I want to interject for a second.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.260
If you notice in this picture, do you see
what's on her skirt?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.140
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: And the curtains.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.360
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: Do you see the unicorns and
the trees?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.180
So she made that art and then she made her
own clothes.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.039
Which I thought was pretty cool.

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.340
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: She decorated her
own clothes.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.430
And her own things around her house like her
curtains and her place mats and tablecloths.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.139
And so did this whole group of people that
she taught how to do this.

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.430
So you can see.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.820
And then when John and I were researching
for our book, we got to meet her son.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.540
Do you recognize John in that picture?

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.210
He looks different, doesn't he?

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.610
What's different about John?

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.960
Yeah, he shaved off his beard.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.390
Do you like the beard or you like him clean
like this? [inaudible speaker] You like the

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.390
beard?

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.390
Clean?

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.390
Yeah.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.390
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: Okay.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.390
We need to take a vote.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.390
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Okay.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.390
We'll take a vote later.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.390
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: Maybe I'll grow it back.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.390
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: So we got to hold

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.690
some of the original things that Virginia
Lee Burton created.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.370
And that's us with her son.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.090
His name is Aristides.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.530
And this is a piece of art that was created
from that piece I was holding.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.270
And this is her group of designers that she
inspired in Folley Cove.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.290
This is Virginia Burton.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:23.210
She was an amazing, joyful, vivacious person
that people loved to be around.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.280
She made people smile just by being the personality
she was.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.980
And she loved acting and dancing and throwing
big, spectacular parties.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.610
And she loved her garden.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.210
And they inspired her to create her art.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.310
And she loved animals.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.630
And that also inspired her.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.040
But mostly she loved -- because she was a
mom -- can you guess?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.380
Her boys.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.000
She had two sons.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.420
Aristides, her oldest.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.490
And Michael.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.840
And this is her with her husband George and
the boys.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.080
And just like I have done, I was inspired
to write because of the things my boys loved.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.620
And she was inspired to write because of the
things her boys loved.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.639
So, Aristides loved trains.

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.300
Any of you train people?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.230
So, I wrote a book called "Steam Train, Dream
Train."

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.580
And John did a book called "How to Train a
Train."

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.270
So we both really love trains too.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.710
And Aristides liked trains.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.330
So Jinnee wrote a book for Aristides called
-- what is it called?

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.520
"Choo Choo."

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.450
And Michael loved steam shovels.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.300
This is a steam shovel -- an actual steam
shovel from a long time ago.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:52.210
And Jinnee looked at the steam shovels and
she created -- do any of you know this book?

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.800
Mike Mulligan -- you have it?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800
Well, that's awesome.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.540
It's such a great story.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:06.340
So, Jinnee wrote lots of books all inspired
really by her kids and the things she loved.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.419
She wrote "Choo Choo" and "Mike Mulligan"
and "Calico the Wonder Horse" because her

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.320
kids liked comic books.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.610
"The Little House."

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.130
"Katy and the Big Snow."

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.850
"The Saw and the Robin Hood" which is John's
favorite Jinnee Burton book.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.510
"Maybelle the Cable Car."

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.680
And "Life Story."

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.500
She was inspired by everything around her
to write and create.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.590
Most especially her boys but her garden and
the beautiful place where she lived and the

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.090
animals around her.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.560
And all of that inspired us.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.190
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: That was great, Sherri.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.330
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Thanks, John.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:54.570
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: So I want to talk to you a
little bit about how Virginia Lee Burton went

00:07:54.570 --> 00:08:00.350
about creating books because in the process
of making this book I was very inspired by

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.300
how she made the pictures and how she designed
the book.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.790
This is a page from her book "Choo Choo."

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.760
And if you look on the left-hand side, you
can see the text.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.410
And on the right-hand side, you see the picture.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.460
Now she made these books a long, long time
ago.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.380
Eighty -- almost 80 years ago or more.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.490
Some of them.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:31.840
And so there wasn't a precedent -- there wasn't
so many ways to make children's books.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.870
Usually, it was, okay.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.060
The words go on one side.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.849
The picture goes on the other.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.150
And in this case, she did that as well.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.029
But you see how she laid out the words?

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:46.710
Do you see how the train is moving from the
city to the country?

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.170
And how it's winding its way over those hills?

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.380
She decided to emulate that movement with
the words.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.080
And that helped tell the story.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.310
And as you read her books, you'll see that
this kind of design would go into all of her

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.560
books.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:12.350
In this book which is about "Katy and the
Big Snow," you can see that she incorporated

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.450
the text into the picture.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.460
So I'll read it.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.220
Then after she had found the broken down truck
plows, she started home.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.730
^M00:09:21 The fire department had put out
the fire.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.320
And there you see the fire trucks.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.310
The doctor had saved his patient.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.490
And you see the little ambulance.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.190
The water department had repaired the main.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.420
The telephone and electricity were on.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.130
The mail could go through.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.620
And the police could protect the city.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.670
Thanks to what Katy did.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.050
So you see how the text and the image work
together?

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.920
They're almost in this dance.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.850
That's one of the incredible things that Virginia
Lee Burton brought to children's books.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.110
It was no longer about text on one side, picture
on the other.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:03.390
She started to integrate the words and the
pictures to help tell her story.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:09.070
You can see from this image from "Maybelle
the Cable Car" how the words actually connect

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.430
the two drawings into one bigger shape or
bigger design.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.730
No hill too step for Maybelle.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.120
No matter what the weather -- wet or dry -- she
could not slip.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.490
She had her grip.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.190
And three kinds of brakes besides.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.940
"Ting, ting, ting."

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.540
And you can see this image.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.980
You might be familiar from "Mike Mulligan
and the Steam Shovel" where Mary Ann, the

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.230
steam shovel, is just digging away at the
dirt.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.790
And there's smoke flying.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.560
And there's steam coming out of the engine.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:48.670
So you can see how she used patterns and designs
to create this circular motion.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.260
And not only does it create a sense of motion
but it creates a sense of energy.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:59.600
You can see how strong and powerful Mary Ann
is as she digs away at that hole with just

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.940
the sun peeking out from the clouds.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.500
And you can see this kind of patterning in
the book "The Little House."

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.940
You see the clouds going across the sky.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.940
A little cloud.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.110
A little bit bigger cloud.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.740
An even bigger cloud.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.000
And a bigger cloud.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.620
Same with the trees.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.709
And you can see these overlapping shapes that
help make the image.

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:26.250
Now the wonderful thing about the little house,
if you look at it again -- and I had this

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:32.050
experience as a kid when I looked at the book
"The Little House" which was that the house,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:38.140
itself, never moves as you turn the page from
this page to this page.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.390
Nothing happens to the house.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.020
It stays in the same spot.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.550
It's the same size.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.950
And the world around the house keeps changing.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.640
And that was the one of the incredible things
because it was almost like,, what's going

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640
on here?

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.450
The house, which is what the story's about,
is right there in the center.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.560
And everything around it is changing.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.680
And that book is about change.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.730
When Virginia Lee Burton and her husband first
bought their home in Folley Cove, they actually

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.070
picked it up and moved it away from the road.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.750
And I think that was the inspiration for this
book.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.130
Was the idea that we don't want to be so close
to everything that's happening.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.580
We want to be back a little bit.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.160
And that's what eventually happens with the
little house in the book.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.860
They pick it up and they move it back to the
country as the city built up around it.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.240
So what we'd like to do is read the book.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.870
Sherri's going to read it to you.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:40.940
And as she's reading it, I'm going to try
to draw some of the characters from Virginia

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.980
Lee Burton's stories.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.270
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Okay.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.410
You guys ready?

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.420
All right.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:53.510
So all of this stuff about Jinnee Burton was
so inspiring that's what inspired us to create

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.650
our book.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.310
So I'm going to read.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.890
John's going to draw along.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.370
And everyone root for John cause he was worried
he couldn't keep up.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.610
So come on.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.260
Let's say, Go, John.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Go, John.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.260
Go, John.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.260
Okay.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.260
You ready?

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Here we go.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.260
"Big machines."

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.060
The story of Virginia Lee Burton.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.710
Who, by the way, was my favorite author growing
up when I was growing up.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.110
And I hope you can see how pretty John's illustrations
are.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.920
I love them.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:29.930
This is Virginia Lee but everyone in seaside
Folley Cove simply calls her "Jinnee."

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:36.290
Anyone who meets Jinnee will tell you that
she is quite magical.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:42.480
[pause] She makes things grow in an enchanted
garden.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.130
She talks to the chickens and the sheep.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.380
And even the little pit mouse.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:53.019
And, of course, they share all their secrets.

00:13:53.019 --> 00:14:04.089
[pause] And everyone who knows Jinnee will
tell you she can fly.

00:14:04.089 --> 00:14:12.209
But of all the very special things about Jinnee
perhaps what's most amazing about her is what

00:14:12.209 --> 00:14:17.120
she creates with her very magical wands.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.540
What are her wands?

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.610
Can you tell?

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.610
They're her art materials.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.610
Right?

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.920
That's how she creates her magic.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.810
With a few taps of a wand, Jinnee creates
animals.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.160
She can also make the seasons change.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.450
And conjure heroes and horses and people of
all sorts.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:41.130
And even a very good dinosaur.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:46.870
But for her sons Aristides and Michael, she
makes the most wonderful things of all.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.140
The things they love best.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.820
Big machines.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:57.370
[pause] It begins with a line.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.370
Black and rough.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.650
Then a squiggle.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.030
And a rub.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.579
As little Aristides watches, a puff of smoke
appears.

00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:05.579
Clears.

00:15:05.579 --> 00:15:08.019
And then, Woo!

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:09.019
Woo!

00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:10.730
A whistle cries.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.980
Do more!

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.610
Do more, Aristides shouts in return.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.320
So Jinnee draws and draws.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.350
It's a train.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.770
I see a train, says Aristides.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.399
With each sweep Choo Choo comes more to life.

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:26.920
She zips and zooms down the tracks.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.570
So Jinnee draws and draws.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.680
Choo Choo rings her bell.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:38.190
And with Jinnee's magic, begins to tell the
story of the time that Choo Choo escaped.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:45.100
To Aristides's delight, Choo Choo chugs off
to exciting, even dangerous adventures.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:52.370
But, of course, in the end, she always comes
home safely.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.980
Michael loves watching big trucks hard at
work.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.980
Good job, John.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.980
[applause] Woo!

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.980
Okay.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.980
Are we ready?

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.980
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: I'm ready.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.180
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Okay.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:07.540
Now he is going to draw Mary Ann the steam
shovel.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.990
Michael loves watching big trucks hard at
work digging and building.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.570
Constantly moving.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.040
And so Jinnee watches trucks too.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.380
She observes patiently.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.920
Closely.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.100
And she begins.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.540
First, the lines.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.190
This time layered and sketchy.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.570
Then the circles.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.430
Then the brush bursts of red.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.700
A rumble.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.700
A power.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.740
Before dirt flies.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:38.180
And right before Michael's eyes, a bucket
loads and lifts clearing earth to make canals.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.920
Cutting through mountains for railways.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.560
Leveling land for highways and runways.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.930
Digging deep into the earth making foundations.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.490
Smoke blows from her stack.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:56.720
There loud and proud, strong and steely, always
hard at work Mary Ann.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.230
A steam shovel.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.019
Michael jumps with joy.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:07.610
Now Michael has a truck to call his very own
and Michael and Mary Ann smile at each other.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.110
Friends forever.

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:14.370
And soon more big machines burst to life.

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.530
First, there -- [inaudible speaker] Oh, okay.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.530
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: That's okay.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.530
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: John's behind.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.780
Do you want me to keep going or do you want
me to slow down and sing something?

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.360
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: No, I'll catch up.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.670
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Oh, okay.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.600
And soon more big machines burst to life.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.470
First, there's just paper.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.470
White.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.470
White.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.470
White.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.470
Jinnee touches it.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.470
And pop.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.470
With a whoosh of black.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.630
Some strokes of red and green.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.590
Aristides and Michael meet Katy.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.830
Katy is a beautiful bright crawler tractor.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.230
She can roll on her thick, black treads.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:50.740
She can plow with a bulldozer blade -- she
can push with a bulldozer blade attached.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.470
But best of all Katy can plow.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.120
The city of Geopolis is buried in a giant
winter storm and the people are counting on

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.120
Katy.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.530
She's the only one big and strong enough to
clear the way.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:09.840
Katy is rough, tough, and ready to plow the
miles and piles of snow.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.500
No amount of snow can stop her.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.250
Follow me she says as she revs.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:22.590
And with a "chug, chug, chug," Katy is off
to dig out the town of Geopolis while Aristides

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.919
and Michael cheer her on.

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:28.660
^M00:18:26 Jinnee makes more lines.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.170
This time wavy and curvy, swoopy and swervy.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.670
Like music lines flow along.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.700
Color joins in free and watery.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:48.440
[Background music] And soon -- [laughter]
"Ting, ting, ting."

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:55.190
There is Maybelle the cable car climbing up
and down the giant hills of San Francisco.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.600
Our day is not done.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:02.310
It's just begun she sings while Aristides
and Michael wave "clingity, cling."

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:07.790
Maybelle rolls away to do the job she loves.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.380
And there's a picture of Jinnee with the actual
Maybelle.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.000
We have five minutes, John.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.200
Keep drawing.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.440
Next, Jinnee makes a little house.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.830
Pink and smiling surrounded by apple trees
on a hill covered with daisies.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:26.610
That doesn't seem like our kind of story,
say the boys pouting.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:31.120
Don't worry, says Jinnee as she keeps working.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.920
Suddenly before their eyes, Mary Ann is there.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.210
Then cars appear racing along.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.620
Tractor and trolley cars.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:44.809
And there a tow truck pulls a car with a flat.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.300
Trains and buses.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.540
Even a subway.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:54.940
Big construction vehicles roll in smoky and
strong hauling heavy loads.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.350
Jinnee draws and draws.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.350
Roads.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.350
Buildings.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.350
Traffic.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.510
People all in a hurry.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.919
It's much too much.

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:03.330
Skies darken.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.289
The little house sags.

00:20:05.289 --> 00:20:09.230
And Aristides and Michael are worried.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:14.520
And then just like that the little pink house
is saved by a truck.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.520
The boys jump up.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.520
That truck is a hero.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.920
The truck saved the day.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.270
Jinnee smiles to herself.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.690
Well, of course, they see it that way.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.890
Choo Choo and Mary Ann, Katy, Maybelle, and
all of the trucks around the little house

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:38.260
big, powerful heroes, hard working, and happy
and each special and wonderful.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.789
Just like Jinnee.

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:48.150
And that is how here in Folley Cove Jinnee's
big machines and their stories come to life

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.590
quite magically.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:57.030
For Aristides and Michael.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.340
And for you.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.799
^M00:20:58
[ Applause ]

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:03.470

&gt;&gt; John Rocco: Nice job.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.400
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Okay.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.860
So we are not taking questions but we're signing.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.830

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.429

00:21:16.429 --> 00:21:17.429
And -- is there anything else?

00:21:17.429 --> 00:21:18.429
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: Yeah.

00:21:18.429 --> 00:21:25.400
I just wanted to ask you Sherri, when you
thought about writing this book, as a children's

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:31.470
book author-illustrator, what possessed you
to write a book about Virginia Lee Burton?

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:36.289
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: When I was growing
up, Jinnee Burton was my favorite children's

00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:37.289
book author.

00:21:37.289 --> 00:21:38.289
I grew up with "The Little House."

00:21:38.289 --> 00:21:40.280
It was the first story I remember writing
-- reading.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.510
It was a story my grandma read to me.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.750
And when I became a children's book author,
it was my dream to write a story that would

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:52.919
somehow pay tribute to this amazing woman
who was so far ahead of her time.

00:21:52.919 --> 00:21:54.230
She ran a business.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.370
She raised children.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.940
She grew for her garden.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.080
She canned and cooked and had parties.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.160
And taught.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.220
And I think she inspired me.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:10.309
The more that I read about her, the more that
I researched I was inspired to tell everyone

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:16.780
that the world should know what an incredible,
creative talent she was and how much ahead

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.330
of her time that she was.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.520
She was born in 1909 and lived the biggest
part of her life during the depression and

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.250
the years immediately following when she was
raising kids and did so much with so little.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:36.200
So I hope that you guys learned a little bit
about her and that maybe, maybe, maybe you

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.330
are starting to love her just as much as I
do.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.400
So thank you so much for coming.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.520
[applause] Oh.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.760
And can we give those away, John?

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: Sure.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Okay.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.760
We're going to give John's drawings away.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760
Is that okay?

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.910
[applause] Two?

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:55.650
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: So I want to try to teach you
guys how to draw Mary Ann.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:03.280
If you want to learn how to draw Mary Ann
very simply, she's made up of a bunch of shapes.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.240
And I think you guys all know how to draw
a circle.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240
Right?

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.539
And do you know how to draw a rectangle?

00:23:08.539 --> 00:23:09.539
Yeah.

00:23:09.539 --> 00:23:11.559
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: We'll wrap it up.

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:13.230
&gt;&gt; John Rocco: And we'll wrap it up.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.820
Is that what you're saying?

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.820
[laughter] Oh, okay.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.870
I'm just going to quickly draw the shapes
so you guys can draw it at home.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.059
Okay?

00:23:22.059 --> 00:23:24.450

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:29.220
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Rectangle.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.100
[pause] Another rectangle.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.790
[pause] Another rectangle.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.460
I'm here stating the obvious.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.460
Rectangle.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.880
&gt;&gt; A square.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.110
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Oh.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.110
More of a square.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.880
Yeah, you're right.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.380
Oh, that's the mouth.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.500
She has -- wait.

^M00:23:54

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.900
&gt;&gt; Sherri Duskey Rinker: Oval.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.900
Circle.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.900
Circle.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.900
Circle.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.900
Circle.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.110
[pause] Oh, awesome, John.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.110
Okay.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.040
Everyone give John a big round of applause.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.210
