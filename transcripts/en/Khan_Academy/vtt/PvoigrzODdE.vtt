00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:02.603
Voiceover: In the last
video, we saw an egg

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:06.121
from our mothers fuse with
a sperm from our fathers

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.412
to form a zygote that
would keep replicating

00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:12.278
and turn into us, if this...

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:15.870
Let's say this was the
sperm from my father

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.168
that fuses with the egg from my mother,

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:20.498
and then this zygote will keep replicating

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:23.243
and eventually turn into Sal,

00:00:23.243 --> 00:00:26.807
and make a video about fertilization.

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:29.306
So how does that actually happen?

00:00:29.306 --> 00:00:31.775
So now that this zygote has the diploid

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:34.484
number of chromosomes, and once again

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:36.384
they're referring to that as 2N,

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:38.066
where N would be the haploid number,

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.965
2N would be the diploid number,

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:41.541
and in the case of human beings,

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.288
N is 23, so in the case of human beings,

00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:47.275
N is 23 and two times N of course

00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:49.656
would be 46 chromosomes.

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:51.984
I have my full contingency
of chromosomes here.

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.984
I got a Y sex chromosome from my father,

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:56.414
X of course from my mother,

00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:59.588
so I'm going to be a male.

00:00:59.588 --> 00:01:02.532
And so what then happens?

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:05.259
Well now, through mitosis, this zygote

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.618
is going to keep replicating.

00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:11.129
So it will, you know, after one,

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:14.072
so after one, and we're
going to go into the details

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:16.454
of the mechanics of mitosis,

00:01:16.454 --> 00:01:20.734
but after one round of
mitosis, it is now two cells.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:21.658
It is now two cells.

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:22.727
And I'm going to draw it, once again,

00:01:22.727 --> 00:01:24.669
I'm not going to draw it at scale.

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:26.138
It's now two cells.

00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:27.132
I want to make sure I have enough space

00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:28.990
on my little chalkboard here.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.770
It has two cells.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.337
Instead of drawing all of the chromosomes,

00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:32.821
let me just say that each of these,

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.843
in my nucleus, I still have 2N.

00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:38.428
I have the diploid number.

00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:41.360
So each of these two cells

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.575
that it has differentiated to

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:44.423
still have the full contingency.

00:01:44.423 --> 00:01:45.700
That's what mitosis does.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.357
It essentially replicates
the entire cells.

00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:50.814
You have the same number of chromosomes.

00:01:50.814 --> 00:01:51.843
And then this process is

00:01:51.843 --> 00:01:53.012
just going to keep happening.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:57.134
These two characters
are going to replicate,

00:01:57.134 --> 00:02:00.325
are going to replicate, and so then

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:03.030
you're going to have, through mitosis,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.853
and now you're going...

00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:06.920
So this is another round
of mitosis right over here.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.853
Mitsosis.

00:02:07.853 --> 00:02:09.516
So they just keep duplicating themselves.

00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:13.568
And each of these cells
have the full contingency.

00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:16.660
2N, the diploid number of chromosomes

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.025
for, well, in this case
it's going to be 46

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:19.896
for a human being.

00:02:19.896 --> 00:02:20.610
And then this process

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.488
is just going to keep happening.

00:02:22.488 --> 00:02:24.993
So this process is
going to keep happening.

00:02:24.993 --> 00:02:27.053
I'll do dot dot dot to
show that, you know,

00:02:27.053 --> 00:02:28.926
a lot of this has been going on.

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:32.251
So mitosis is just
going to keep happening.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.818
And so eventually you're going to have

00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:35.881
thousands of these cells,

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:37.211
and eventually as we'll
see, you're going to have

00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:39.297
millions and ten millions of them.

00:02:39.297 --> 00:02:41.852
So let me draw them really
really really small.

00:02:41.852 --> 00:02:43.964
There's a bunch of them there.

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:50.340
And each of them, each
of them are going to have

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.456
the diploid number of chromosomes.

00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:55.889
They're going to have 46 chromosomes.

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.399
23 pair of homologous chromosomes.

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.638
So we now have a big ball of these here.

00:03:03.638 --> 00:03:06.677
And these cells, some
of them are going to,

00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:09.050
they're going to differentiate into me.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.059
They're going to differentiate into

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.833
the different parts of my body.

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:14.549
So for example, these
cells right over here

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.448
might eventually,
they'll keep replicating,

00:03:17.448 --> 00:03:19.470
but then it's them and their offspring

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.403
might eventually differentiate
into my brain cells.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:26.211
These cells here will keep replicating,

00:03:26.211 --> 00:03:29.383
and them and their offspring,
I guess you could say,

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:31.391
or the things that they replicate into,

00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.693
might differentiate into my heart.

00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:37.056
These right over here might differentiate

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:40.353
into my lungs, and of course

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.976
all of these eventually will differentiate

00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:45.958
into all the different, and
they and their offspring

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.267
will differentiate into all of the things

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:48.760
that make me me.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.681
And so you have a lot
more of this mitosis.

00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:57.424
You're eventually going
to have a human being.

00:03:57.424 --> 00:04:00.708
So let me just say this
is more mitosis going on.

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:02.653
Mitosis.

00:04:02.653 --> 00:04:04.283
And now let me make an attempt

00:04:04.283 --> 00:04:07.090
to draw a human being.

00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:11.168
That doesn't really look like me, but...

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:13.804
Well, I have a lot of
hair, so that's my...

00:04:13.804 --> 00:04:15.434
I have big eyebrows as well.

00:04:15.434 --> 00:04:17.258
Still doesn't look like me, but anyway.

00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:18.612
You get the point.

00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:25.049
And so, and I'll try
to draw fairly quickly.

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:29.768
But this is obviously not my best

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:31.097
rendering of a human being.

00:04:31.097 --> 00:04:34.396
But you get the general idea.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.444
Nice broad shoulders, that's nice.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:42.834
All right, so let me, let me...

00:04:43.312 --> 00:04:46.635
I'm focusing too much on
drawing this human being.

00:04:48.003 --> 00:04:51.719
Anyway, you get the general idea.

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.171
My stomach isn't quite that flat,

00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:56.397
but anyway, you get the general idea.

00:04:56.397 --> 00:04:58.221
So this, it'll eventually differentiate

00:04:58.221 --> 00:04:59.695
into a human being.

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:02.767
These cells here in pink
eventually differentiate

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:05.980
into the cells in the brain.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.772
These cells here eventually differentiate

00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:09.270
into the cells into the lungs,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.669
and obviously at this scale,

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.223
the cells are way too small to even see.

00:05:13.223 --> 00:05:16.502
These cells differentiate into the cells

00:05:16.502 --> 00:05:18.443
of the heart.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:21.188
Now, I want to draw an
important distinction here.

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:23.397
Because most of the cells that I've just

00:05:23.397 --> 00:05:26.529
depicted here that are
just a product of mitosis,

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.339
these are your, I guess you could say

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:29.609
these are your body cells,

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:31.586
or these are your somatic cells.

00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:34.849
So these, all of these
cells that I'm pointing out

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.273
in your heart, your lung, your brain,

00:05:37.273 --> 00:05:40.633
these are somatic cells, or body cells.

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:41.946
Somatic cells.

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:43.428
And so you're probably wondering,

00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:45.689
well how do I eventually get these

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:47.090
haploid number cells?

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.632
How do I eventually get,

00:05:48.632 --> 00:05:50.037
if I'm talking about a male,

00:05:50.037 --> 00:05:52.626
how do I eventually get
these haploid sex cells,

00:05:52.626 --> 00:05:54.407
these gametes, these sperm cells?

00:05:54.407 --> 00:05:56.375
I'm talking about a
female, how do I eventually

00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.436
get these ova, these egg cells

00:05:58.436 --> 00:06:00.273
that have a haploid number?

00:06:00.273 --> 00:06:03.069
And the way that happens
is some of these cells

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.642
up here are going to
differentiate into germ cells.

00:06:07.642 --> 00:06:10.185
So they're going to
differentiate into germ cells.

00:06:10.185 --> 00:06:14.974
In the case of, and they're
going to differentiate

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.516
when I say into germ cells,

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:18.464
they're going to differentiate
into your gonads.

00:06:18.464 --> 00:06:24.270
In the case of a female,
the gonads are the ovaries.

00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:32.253
And in the case of a male,
the gonads are the testes.

00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:34.430
The gonads are the testes.

00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:38.371
And the germ cells in the gonads

00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:42.518
or the cells that have differentiated into

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:44.768
being part of the testes and ovaries,

00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:46.404
those germ cells.

00:06:46.404 --> 00:06:51.197
So we differentiate
them from somatic cells.

00:06:51.197 --> 00:06:52.918
So there are germ cells there.

00:06:52.977 --> 00:06:56.421
Germ cells in your ovaries and testes.

00:06:56.628 --> 00:07:00.315
They, through the process of meiosis,

00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:02.656
they through the process of meiosis,

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:05.069
can produce the gametes.

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:07.775
So if you're female you're
going to produce eggs.

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:11.599
If you're male you're
going to produce sperm.

00:07:11.861 --> 00:07:14.807
But this is through
the process of meiosis.

00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:18.517
Meiosis you're going to produce sperm

00:07:18.517 --> 00:07:19.911
in the case of a man,

00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:23.046
and you're going to produce ova

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:25.735
in the case of a female.

00:07:25.906 --> 00:07:27.571
And this brings up a
really interesting thing,

00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:30.075
because throughout biology
we talk about mutations

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.728
and natural selection and whatever else.

00:07:33.728 --> 00:07:37.674
And it's important to
realize how mutations

00:07:37.674 --> 00:07:41.013
may affect you and your offspring.

00:07:41.286 --> 00:07:42.575
So if you have a mutation

00:07:42.575 --> 00:07:44.485
in one of the somatic cells here,

00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:47.634
let's say in a skin cell, or in you brain,

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.418
or in the heart,

00:07:49.418 --> 00:07:53.891
that may affect your ability to, you know,

00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:55.450
especially if God forbid it's a really

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.026
dangerous thing like cancer,

00:07:57.026 --> 00:07:58.606
and it happens when you're young,

00:07:58.606 --> 00:08:00.193
before you've had a chance to reproduce

00:08:00.193 --> 00:08:02.363
and you're not able to survive,

00:08:02.363 --> 00:08:05.653
that might affect your
ability to reproduce.

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:07.738
But if this is happening
in a somatic cell,

00:08:07.738 --> 00:08:10.436
it's not going to affect the DNA make-up

00:08:10.436 --> 00:08:12.519
of what you pass on.

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:14.948
The DNA make-up of what you pass on,

00:08:14.948 --> 00:08:17.130
that's determined by what's going on

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.966
in the gametes.

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:23.018
So a mutation, if on the
way to differentiating

00:08:23.018 --> 00:08:25.470
into gametes a mutation happens,

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.118
so if one of these mutate

00:08:28.118 --> 00:08:30.448
and then keep replicating,

00:08:30.448 --> 00:08:32.562
so let's say there's a mutation here,

00:08:32.562 --> 00:08:33.819
and they keep replicating and

00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:36.605
they differentiate into the germ cells

00:08:36.605 --> 00:08:37.964
the mutation is right over there,

00:08:37.964 --> 00:08:40.154
then through meiosis that produces

00:08:40.154 --> 00:08:42.090
some mutated sperm.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.001
Then that would pass on to your, well,

00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:48.535
that has a chance of
passing on to your children.

00:08:48.535 --> 00:08:50.178
Because once again, it might not be

00:08:50.178 --> 00:08:52.269
all of the sperm cells
that have that mutation.

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:54.501
It could be only a handful of the

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:58.411
two to three hundred
million of the sperm cells,

00:08:58.411 --> 00:09:01.542
and so if that mutation
somehow makes it harder

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:03.343
for some of the sperm cells

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:06.299
to kind of function,
either fuse with an egg

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:09.391
or even potentailly
develop and kind of swim

00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:12.918
through fluid, then it still might not be

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:14.914
the thing that makes it.

00:09:14.914 --> 00:09:19.727
So mutations only affect your offspring

00:09:19.727 --> 00:09:24.202
in the situation where those, the cells

00:09:24.202 --> 00:09:26.496
in which they happen are
eventually differentiated

00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:29.747
into things, into gametes that you will

00:09:29.747 --> 00:09:33.245
pass on to your children.
