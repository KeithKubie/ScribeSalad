[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:07.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.540
SPEAKER: So good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.970
Thank you so much
for coming out.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.960
We have an incredible author
and speaker this afternoon.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.060
So without further ado, I'll
introduce Dydine Umunyana.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.110
Dydine is the author of the
book "Embracing Survival."

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.760
She was appointed a youth
peace ambassador in 2013

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.610
for the Aegis Trust,
an organization

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.020
dedicated to the prevention of
genocide and mass atrocities

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.520
worldwide.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.030
Subsequently, in 2015, she
became global mentor for peace

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.220
at Serve to Unite,
an organization that

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.970
cultivates peace through
creative service learning

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.070
and a global engagement.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.260
Dydine is committed
to establishing

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.350
a dialogue between
people for understanding

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.530
their shared histories
and cultural differences.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.630
Through her writing
and public lectures,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.730
her goal is to pierce the
wall of silence that still

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.010
pervades much of our society.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.133
Please join me in
welcoming Dydine Umunyana.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:20.077
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:21.556
You can take that.

00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:22.415
Good to see you.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.540
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.540
SPEAKER: So Dydine, welcome.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.665
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:27.900
Thank you.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.410
SPEAKER: Why don't we start
by taking us back to Rwanda

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.400
in 1994 and
providing the context

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.080
and setting for this
powerful and inspiring story?

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.480
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Well, back
in 1994, I was four years old.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.640
So I was a baby.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.370
And I lived with
my grandparents.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.565
I remember the first day
of the genocide on April 7.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.830
The genocide started April
6, the night of April 6.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.540
So I lived in the Eastern
Province of Rwanda,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.770
and the genocide had
already started in the city,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.440
in the capital city
of Rwanda, and spread

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.670
throughout the country.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.470
In the morning, in
Eastern province,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.760
that's when the genocide
really began where I was,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.800
in my grandparents' house.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.610
And as a child, I remember 5:00
in the morning, my Aunt Agnes,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.930
she woke us all up.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.900
And as I walked in
the living room,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.260
all my cousins were
sitting on the floor.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.120
And my aunt was telling us
that we're going to church.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.860
It was my favorite
activity in my childhood,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.720
to get out of the
house and go to church.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.480
So I was really excited.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.700
And I screamed out loud to
her that I wanted to dress--

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.610
to wear my beautiful dress
that my grandpa gave me

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.820
the Christmas before that year.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.470
And she shushed
me to not be loud.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.080
If I need anything, I
should whisper from then on.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.460
So I was a little scared,
but still wanting my dress.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.420
And my little dress was
a white little dress

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.860
with the three butterflies.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.220
And I loved it so much, so it
was my opportunity to wear it.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.820
And she ran in the room, and
brought it back, and dressed me

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.120
up, and gave me a jar of milk.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.930
We were more than almost
12 children in the house

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.620
because, before the
genocide, the Hutu government

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.730
used to kill or put in jail
the Tutsis who were young

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.320
and seemed to fight back.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.930
So in the preparation of the
genocide, so they can succeed,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.790
that was one of the
things they did.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.520
Aside from buying
machetes and the uniforms

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.220
and all that was also--

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.580
yeah, that was part of it.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.970
So my parents fled Rwanda
before the genocide.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.685
That's why I was in my
grandparents' house.

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:21.980
But when we were about to leave,
she gave everyone, every child,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.530
a little something
to eat or drink

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.320
because she didn't know
where that journey would end.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.370
And so she gave me the milk.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.620
But when we left the house,
the street was full of people.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.340
People had been fleeing
all night from Kigali,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.870
and they had been walking.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.380
It's like a 30-minute
drive from Kigali

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.480
to Eastern Province,
where I was,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.760
but people had been walking,
so they had a lot of things

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.260
with them.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.220
They were carrying mattresses,
and food, children.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.950
It was just a lot of people.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.930
And we joined them.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.870
I didn't write it in
the book, but I always

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.100
had this feeling
of a little shame

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.510
because I was somehow excited.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.880
For me, it was really
exciting, that moment.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.870
And I always felt it, and
I never even told anyone

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.870
because after the genocide--

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.950
when I was growing up, how
did I feel that excitement?

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.100
But as a child, I don't know.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.330
So as we were walking
towards a cathedral

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.610
in the small city
of that village,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.910
there was a lot of
whistles and songs.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.590
The Hutus were singing songs
of hate in the name of god.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.820
And the whistles started blowing
around ever in the hills.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.130
And I don't know what
happened that moment

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.500
because I lost everyone.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.310
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.677
DYDINE UMUNYANA: So you
probably remember in the book.

00:05:57.677 --> 00:05:58.260
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.930
DYDINE UMUNYANA:
And I found myself

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.790
in the home of perpetrators.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.095
So they were my
grandparents' neighbors.

00:06:06.095 --> 00:06:08.000
I played with their children.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.070
And I didn't really quite
remember most of everything

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.710
because they just hated
me, but I didn't really

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.010
know because after
the genocide, when

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.090
I'm united with my
parents, my mom had

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.470
to bring me back there
so that I would not

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.106
end up like my father.

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:27.980
Because my father had
trauma and all of that.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.054
And she feared that I
would have the same thing,

00:06:30.054 --> 00:06:32.220
and she wanted to know what
happened to me because I

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.340
was in this home of perpetrators
and nobody that knew me.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.390
My family wasn't there, so
I was the only one lined up

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.410
with so many other Tutsis.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.550
You know, I was the
little one there.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.670
And they started
killing everyone.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.130
And as they got to
me, I asked for milk,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.830
if I can drink my milk.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.060
And I don't know where I got
the thirst to ask for milk,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.925
but that milk saved me.

00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:06.180
It did because when
they asked for milk,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.580
it was almost a confirmation
to the perpetrators

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.850
that I am a Tutsi child, and
my parents are in the RPF.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.550
They knew me.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.680
They knew who I was.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.520
So--

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.030
SPEAKER: The RPF
is the resistance.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.779
DYDINE UMUNYANA: The
resistance in Uganda.

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:22.230
Both my parents were there.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.570
And of course, those
perpetrators were my neighbors.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.530
So they knew who I was.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.410
They knew my parents.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.180
They knew the whole background.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:35.980
But asking for milk, I
would say this for maybe--

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.890
I don't know if I'm right, but
in Rwanda, before I came here,

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.365
they used to say "Bagels
are for Jewish people.

00:07:42.365 --> 00:07:43.690
They love bagels."

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.960
So it was almost--

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.400
you were in the front of
Nazis, and you were a child,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.133
and you're asking for a bagel.

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:53.230
So it's a confirmation
that you are a Jew.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:08:00.640
So when I asked for milk,
culturally, Tutsis owned cows.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.280
So in our culture,
children of Tutsis

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.140
drink milk in the
morning, and for dinner,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.160
for lunch, everything.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.240
So asking them for milk,
they paused and mimicked me

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.280
because they started
saying, "Oh, you

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.300
wouldn't be a child of Tutsi
if you did not ask for milk.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.410
You wouldn't be a
cockroach or a snake."

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.370
Because they didn't
really see us as humans.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.180
So we were a snake
or a cockroach.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:28.270
But in that moment, when they
were mimicking me really loud,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.730
someone heard them
inside the house.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:36.370
And it was an elderly
man who walked out.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.919
And he saw me in the line.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.260
Almost everyone
was already killed

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.650
and were barely breathing.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.310
And he asked them why
weren't they working.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.560
So the way the propagandas
were on the radios,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.590
they told the young Hutus, the
civil killers, that it's work.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.020
Going out there and to
kill Tutsis, it's a job.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.520
It's work.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.370
You have to wake
up and got to work.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.340
So when he walked
outside, really,

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.620
he was frustrated that
they're not working.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.895
They're just talking.

00:09:09.895 --> 00:09:11.270
SPEAKER: And he
was Hutu as well.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.478
DYDINE UMUNYANA: He was Hutu.

00:09:12.478 --> 00:09:15.330
He was the grandpa
of those kids.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.770
And when he saw me in the line,
I don't know why he got pity.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.820
But he told them
that they should

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.480
be ashamed of killing
an innocent child

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.150
when their wives are
carrying their children no

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.410
different from me.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:34.030
So he rushed and saved me.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.890
And he put me between
a pair of his legs,

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.470
and then they finished
everyone there.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.070
And he threw me under the
bed, under a wooden bed

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.070
in the house.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.120
So that was the first
day of the genocide.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.179
And of course, there
were 99 more days to go.

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:55.780
And I was a child,
so I didn't really

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.280
remember most of those days.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.750
But my mom, when my mom took
me back there, I had to--

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.050
I was almost seven or eight
because I had nightmares

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.700
when I was growing
up, and I would

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.780
dream of dead people, dying,
or people killing each other.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.314
And I would think in
my dreams that they're

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.730
my family, the
people that I know.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.557
So I couldn't really
my familiarize

00:10:18.557 --> 00:10:20.615
my dreams and the reality.

00:10:20.615 --> 00:10:24.140
Like, it would take me
time to go back to sleep,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.670
when my mom would bring
me, everyone, my brothers,

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.260
and our babysitters,
everyone so she will confirm

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.040
to me that it was just a dream.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.870
But when she helped
me, take me back there,

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.430
they started going
away because I

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.460
knew what really happened to
me because I could put then

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.820
pieces of that.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.850
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:51.620
So I believe the stat is, yeah,
an estimated 1 million Rwandans

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.590
were killed during the
genocide, 20% of the population.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:01.700
70% of the Tutsi
population was killed.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:07.250
Give us your sense of
some of the drivers

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.220
of that level of hatred.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:16.020
And what underpinned
that type of activity

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.210
that drove that level of hatred
and genocide in the country?

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.980
You mentioned colonialism,
the power of colonialism.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.146
DYDINE UMUNYANA: That's
where I was going, you know?

00:11:26.146 --> 00:11:26.772
SPEAKER: OK, I'll
let you go there.

00:11:26.772 --> 00:11:27.326
Yeah, sure.

00:11:27.326 --> 00:11:28.451
DYDINE UMUNYANA: That's OK.

00:11:28.451 --> 00:11:30.810
I know because the
more I grow older

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.150
and learn more about how--

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.910
because I couldn't understand
how didn't my people kill

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.240
each other?

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.410
We spoke the same language.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.610
We're all black.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.630
We're in this tiny
little country.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.390
And how in the world--

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.400
how did we end up
killing each other?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.691
I did not really understand it.

00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:51.000
Of course, I would just learn
how my father's entire family

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.620
was wiped out.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.700
You won't learn anything
from my dad except the pain

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.240
that he's feeling because
he was already traumatized.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.750
The Same with my mom.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.310
So it was really a confusion
growing up in Rwanda,

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.020
having that history.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.720
I couldn't quite really
understand the reason

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.390
behind it.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.050
So when I was 18,
I got the chance

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.420
to go to the Rwandan
genocide museum

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.290
and learn the history and
background of the genocide

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.020
for the first time.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.535
And that's the first time that
I was able to have compassion

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:26.600
even towards children
of perpetrators

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.320
because then I started
feeling them, how they feel,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.780
if they know that their
family has done such a thing.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.540
That's like a shame
that you carry on,

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.690
and you didn't even do anything.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.630
So I learned so much about what
really caused the genocide.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.000
But to really understand those
three months of the genocide,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.660
you have to revisit
the colonial era

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.100
because before the colonial
era, the Rwandans did not

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.092
have tribes or ethnics.

00:12:58.092 --> 00:12:59.800
SPEAKER: Or classes,
you implied as well.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800
DYDINE UMUNYANA: It
was classes, actually.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.420
So the Tutsis were
the elite class,

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.090
and the Hutus were
the middle class.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.400
And the Twa, they were poor
and the hunters, mainly.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.230
So they lived together.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.490
They shared everything.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.430
And if you owned
more than 10 cows,

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.840
you would join the Tutsi class.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.837
Because we did not have money
so we count the richness--

00:13:27.837 --> 00:13:29.420
I don't know how to
say it in English.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.544
SPEAKER: Yeah, that's fine.

00:13:30.544 --> 00:13:31.091
Wealth.

00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:32.840
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Wealth,
you count wealth.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.280
It depends on how many
cows that you have.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.610
So when the colonials
came, which I always

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.530
feel like were really--
it was in the early 1930s.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:48.630
And for me, I feel like we can
never give what we don't have.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.530
So when the Germans came
into Rwanda back then,

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.670
you know what was
happening in Europe.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.575
It was the Holocaust
that was going on.

00:13:56.575 --> 00:13:58.700
And that's the only thing
they brought into Rwanda.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.370
So they started categorizing
Rwandans, studying them,

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.380
measuring their noses,
dividing them, and saying

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.271
that the Tutsis are tall.

00:14:08.271 --> 00:14:09.270
They're lighter skinned.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.630
They probably are from Ethiopia.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.990
So they're not from
Central East Africa.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.550
And the Hutus, they're the ones.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.800
So they were really
measuring everyone,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.030
putting them in the classes.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.520
And they gave them ID cards.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.510
And I don't know how my
people, they accepted that.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.810
But I don't know because that
was way before I was born.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.760
But they learned how
different they were.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.150
It took a few decades
for them to really--

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.050
I guess it's easy to
teach hate because they

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.390
learned in only three decades.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.330
And when the Germans
left and gave the country

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.730
to the Belgians--
because the Germans were

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.430
losing power in Africa,
the Belgians had Congo.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.840
And the Congo is huge and
had diamonds and all that.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.410
So they gave Rwanda to Belgium
so they can rule it together.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.030
But really, Rwanda had nothing.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.455
It did not have minerals.

00:15:04.455 --> 00:15:05.850
It didn't have.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:10.130
So it was just a little part
of Africa, small and beautiful.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.550
They can just have
almost a headquarters.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:19.830
So in 1959, they
killed the king.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.070
I'm not 100% sure if
really the Belgians

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.350
poisoned the king in Burundi.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:31.570
But when they did kill the
king, the Hutus took over.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.900
So when the colonials
came into Rwanda,

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.890
they promised they'd
build schools, hospitals.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:43.930
And all those privileges
were for the elite class.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:47.540
So the Hutu children
wouldn't go to those schools.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.580
So really, the conflict began
and from we are having more

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.190
than we are, and
this is our land.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.350
How dare you have all of this?

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.140
So when the Hutus got in
power, they were already

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.335
angry at the Tutsis that
they are not from there,

00:16:02.335 --> 00:16:03.960
and they are having
everything, so they

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.370
wanted to kill everyone.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.540
So the civil war
really began in 1959.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:15.150
And the child, the prince,
fled with a lot of Tutsis

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.920
in the neighboring countries.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.770
And the Tutsis who stayed in
the country lived in fear.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.710
So everywhere in
the country, they

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.020
started learning how the
Tutsis are not humans.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.440
So those propagandas,
the name calling,

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.810
really began in the 1950s.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:35.200
And there was a lot of
civil war in '68 to '72.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:41.575
So really the 1994, it was it.

00:16:41.575 --> 00:16:42.720
It was the time for--

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.920
SPEAKER: So the
culmination of all of that.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.620
DYDINE UMUNYANA: --to erase
the Tutsi race from the planet.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.470
And it was well
organized, well planned.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.490
Because I remember
when I was growing up

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.695
hearing stories on how
the government will give--

00:16:57.695 --> 00:17:03.000
because they used to train
young people who are 16, 15.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.420
And they would train them how to
kill with traditional weapons.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.024
And there's this one weapon.

00:17:11.024 --> 00:17:12.940
They used to call it--
it's really interesting

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.050
because that's the one
they wanted to use on me.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.050
And as a child, I never get it.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.180
Like, even the weapon is
called "no pity for the enemy."

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.500
How can a child be an enemy,
because you really don't even

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.345
know who you are.

00:17:27.345 --> 00:17:31.160
But when they were
training the civil killers,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.940
they gave away
free small radios.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.650
These radios, you could
charge them with the sun.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.360
Now, this is a
very poor country.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.510
But how hatred can
really work, you

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.510
will spend everything you have
to really succeed in hate.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.660
So that's why the
genocide succeeded

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.590
in only three months
and a million people

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.030
were killed because neighbors
were killing neighbors.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.480
And in one night, they
were ready for it.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.460
In one night, those
radios, the only thing

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.210
that was on the radios
was go kill the enemy.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.490
And it just happened like
that, but it was already

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.380
in the hearts of people.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.980
People, they justified it
because they had already

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.680
learned for a long time that
the Tutsis are not human.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.490
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:23.406
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Yeah.

00:18:23.406 --> 00:18:28.950
So I think even in
the world today,

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.470
people justify calling
each other names.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:35.860
And they forget that
when you're doing that,

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.570
you're actually losing
your humanity in you

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.380
because being a human
is having loving,

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.310
and being kind, and having
compassion towards each other.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.350
But mostly, the
perpetrators actually

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:55.470
think of themselves as more
human as the other side.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.410
SPEAKER: So let's
talk about your story

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.150
more directly because
the memoir really

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.250
focuses so much
on the family and

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.070
your familial relationships.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:15.760
And they're a source of
both power and comfort.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.300
But also there was a lot
of difficulty connected

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.180
with the relationship
with your mom,

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.850
especially with your dad,
the separation of them,

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.800
as you mentioned, when you were
a child, but also the valor

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.930
of the extended family,
people like Aunt Agnes, who

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.120
were rescuers in many ways.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.310
So as a child, how did
you process family then?

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:48.780
How did it play a role in
your sense of survival?

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.860
And as you reflect
now as an adult woman,

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.060
those perspectives
on family, how

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.040
are they different or similar?

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.970
DYDINE UMUNYANA: I think
it cultivated something

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.920
in me that was, this
life is not just for me.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.290
And I think it's
kind of like an idea.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.130
It's a savior.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.830
It can save your
soul because then you

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.430
become stronger than you
can think because you're

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.190
living for your siblings.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.290
You're living for somebody else.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:30.790
And I remember at 13 years old,
I couldn't understand life.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.760
I couldn't understand life.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.190
When genocide ended, I
had just met my parents

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.620
for the first time since birth.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.440
So I was really, really
excited to experience love

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.478
from a parent for the first
time, but it was not there.

00:20:45.478 --> 00:20:47.600
Their hearts were
already destroyed.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.790
My parent had lost his siblings,
his nieces, his parents,

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.416
and he couldn't see life.

00:20:53.416 --> 00:20:55.540
And that's the person I
was supposed to learn from,

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.490
how to love life and all that.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.110
My mother was the same.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.340
She was strong, very strong.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.460
She never cried.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.460
I never saw her crying
for her siblings.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.880
But the other day,
for the first time,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.320
23 years later, she
cried for her brothers

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.450
because she was in
a therapy session.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.600
And then she called me, and she
said, I think I'm being weaker.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.710
And I said, why?

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.560
She said, I promised
my family that I

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.510
stayed so that I can take
care of their family,

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.870
their children, but now I am--

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.160
so she never really
took the time to grieve.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:35.810
And I think that's where, even
for me, it was more like--

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.530
even when I was
about to this is it.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.780
I don't really want this life.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.320
Why would god create life
if we're meant to suffer?

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.160
I remember I went into this
lake in the north of Rwanda.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.070
And I had really,
really given up on life.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.050
But when I got there-- we
lived with my father then,

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.980
and he was always traumatized.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.790
And for some reason,
his trauma told him

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:04.580
that it would be easier if
he would be dead, but not

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.390
with machetes.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.440
He didn't want us to
suffer as his family did.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.800
So we really suffered from
that, and we fled all the time

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.580
from him.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.350
And this time, I
said, this is it.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.500
I'm done.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.410
But when I got there,
for some reason,

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.860
I thought of my
brothers and sister.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.640
And I thought, how are they
going to take the news?

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.430
How are they going to
live if I'm the oldest

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.570
and I'm doing this?

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.945
So I cried for them
and fell asleep.

00:22:33.945 --> 00:22:35.690
Thank god.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.030
And I woke up
around 6:00 PM, when

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.970
a guard was kicking me and
kicking me out of the beach

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.660
because children
were not allowed

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.880
to stay there later than 6:00.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.940
So those kind of little
moments saved my life,

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:55.040
but I think it was more because
my family had this value

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.430
of loving the entire family.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:03.740
Even when they found out
you were a long lost cousin,

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.790
you were-- they--

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:09.260
and there's that protection,
that when my aunt--

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.474
my aunt was my age, almost my
age during the genocide, Agnes.

00:23:13.474 --> 00:23:15.140
And she took care of
all those children.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.720
She was the only
adult in the family.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.210
She never had children.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.870
And she had my brother
through all those three months

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.720
on her back.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.350
So even when she tried to
leave him, she did not.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.510
Because you know,
fleeing, running.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:34.015
And now I cannot imagine
myself doing what she did.

00:23:34.015 --> 00:23:35.890
When I think of it, I
am like, would I really

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.210
be able to take care
of all these children

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.130
if anything happens?

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:45.080
But I think when you extend
yourself to be something bigger

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.720
than yourself, it
actually helps you.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.460
It helps you more
than you can imagine.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.790
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:24:00.280
So talk to us about
the escape to Uganda.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.739
How did you get out ultimately?

00:24:03.739 --> 00:24:05.280
DYDINE UMUNYANA:
During the genocide?

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.738
SPEAKER: During
the genocide, yeah.

00:24:06.738 --> 00:24:09.380
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Well, so
in the Eastern Province,

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.170
it's the one main road that
goes all the way to Uganda.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.920
And when we were
fleeing, we were

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.600
heading to Uganda, which we
did not really make it there.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.690
But I remember a few
things because on the way

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:32.280
there, my dad, who was big
in the military in the RPF,

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.240
when he really came back,
he was looking for us.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.530
And he looked for us first,
and he couldn't find us.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.200
So we met in the street,
because he saw my aunt,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.430
and he recognized her.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.630
And then he came to us,
but I didn't know him.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.400
My baby brother did not.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.460
And he wanted to take us.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.740
And my brother cried because he
didn't know who this guy was.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.310
And my aunt looked at me.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.810
She had her way of
looking, and you

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.560
know what she's talking about.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.470
She was a really strong woman.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.280
And she looked at me, and
she said Dydine, you go.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.030
This is your dad,
and we will meet you.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.005
Because she couldn't
really carry all of us.

00:25:15.005 --> 00:25:16.930
So he put me on a motorcycle.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.450
He was on a motorcycle then.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.940
And we actually went back.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.610
So my aunt was going to Uganda.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:31.350
Because my dad was on a mission,
he brought me back in Rwanda.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.920
Those are memories
that didn't leave me

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.780
because when we were going
back, there were dead bodies

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.720
everywhere in the streets.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.020
And I remember, I
was vomiting on him

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.840
because I was holding
him from the back.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.250
And then I tried
closing my eyes,

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:56.790
but it was smelling
because it had been days.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.760
Yeah, so a few days
later, he left me

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.624
in a camp, a soldier's camp,
because he went on a mission

00:26:05.624 --> 00:26:07.040
and left to me
with some soldiers.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.222
And it didn't go well.

00:26:10.222 --> 00:26:12.680
So he had to take me back to
my aunt because I couldn't eat

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.640
or drink or do
anything, and he decided

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.600
to find my aunt
because my aunt told--

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.110
Culturally, because of the
tension that was in Rwanda,

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.640
they already knew
that they did not

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.770
like each other, the tribes.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.390
So even when you
were a child, they

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.630
would tell you, never
eat in a stranger's home,

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.160
or never take anything
from a stranger.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.850
So I couldn't open
my mouth for anything

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.550
from anybody that I
don't know, except it

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.460
was my aunt or someone I know.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.210
So when my dad took
me, I didn't know him,

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.293
and I didn't know anybody.

00:26:43.293 --> 00:26:45.480
So I didn't have even water.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.830
So he decided to take
me, find my aunt.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.230
And we went to the
center, small center.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.550
But things were really
getting bad because then it

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.740
was not just machetes.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.825
The government, the military,
the Hutu government, the XFAR--

00:27:02.825 --> 00:27:05.970
we used to call them the XFAR--

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.950
had started fighting
with the RPF.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.330
So now it wasn't just not
running from somebody,

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.040
it was running from
bullets, from grenades,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.880
and then it was war.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.090
So this place
where my aunts were

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.900
hiding, where the
RPF will rescue

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.810
the rest of the few
Tutsis that are left

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:34.230
and put them in small
centers and guard them,

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:38.430
then the Hutu government would
throw grenades on those places.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.300
So when I got there,
I guess I fell asleep

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.930
when my dad was taking me there,
and I woke up with my aunt.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:52.130
And everything was flying.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:59.800
So yeah, it was those
kinds of moments.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.210
SPEAKER: So the title of your
book is "Embracing Survival."

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:07.910
And if you had to
try and locate what

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:15.270
where those things that allowed
you to survive and to emerge

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.780
to where you are today, sitting
on this stage, where do you

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:24.180
locate those critical things
that allowed you to hold on

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.680
and to survive during that time?

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:37.320
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Well, surviving
the genocide, it's one thing.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.264
Then surviving after
surviving, it's another thing.

00:28:41.264 --> 00:28:42.752
SPEAKER: Right.

00:28:42.752 --> 00:28:44.950
DYDINE UMUNYANA:
Yeah, because it's

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:48.790
really hard because your
life just changes completely.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.870
And of course, you don't
know any other life,

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.240
and that's the only
thing that is around you.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.720
So it's really one way you'll
survive or then you die.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.720
Most of the survivors did not--

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.190
most of them are like my dad,
or they already passed away

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:11.200
after the genocide, or they
became alcoholic, or drugs,

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.990
or prostitute,
just anything that

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:16.210
will just make them not think.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.420
So it was really those
choices that we had.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:26.580
And for me, I guess my
dad was more of, like,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.840
learning from me because
even when I was having those

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.240
nightmares as a kid,
my mom would be like,

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.000
I cannot take it if you
end up like your dad.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.230
And she was really strict.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.710
I remember my biggest dream
was to go to boarding school,

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.650
to turn 12 and go to
a boarding school.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.510
And I remember when I was
going to school, she told me--

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.270
you know, when you're sending
your kid to school, a girl,

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.380
you would tell her some
things like just take

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.980
care of yourself, whatever,
some sweet things.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.020
No, she was like don't
dare get traumatized.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.300
So I really did
carry that with me.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.220
And I knew that if
I'm broken inside,

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.520
that's what I'm
going to be giving.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.870
And I would try so hard
to do what I loved.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.460
I loved singing.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.880
I loved writing so I would
write my emotions down and sing.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.330
I would become a church girl.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.090
So I did all these
little things,

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.150
but I didn't know that
that was my survival

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:36.850
techniques until then I was
here, 3 and 1/2 years ago.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.550
And I remember calling
my survivor friend.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.560
And after weeks,
and I told her, you

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.940
know, I didn't know that
one can sleep all night,

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:51.195
all night long, without
anything, just sleeping.

00:30:51.195 --> 00:30:53.440
So really, for me,
when I was growing up,

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.840
sleeping was luxury,
knowing that you're

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.800
going to sleep and
just sleep all night.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.960
And I guess I ended
up learning how

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.030
to embrace that life,
and just the way

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.620
it was, and love
it the way it was,

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.020
and just knowing that there's
someone out there who's

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:15.440
living a worse life than I was.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.580
That saved me.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.720
And going to the museum,
seeing these children who

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.470
are my age who did not survive,
it made me, for the first time,

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.530
appreciate that person
who walked out and chose

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.030
to save me.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.270
Well, I never met him.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.670
I wish because
when we went back,

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.260
he had already passed away.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.450
We met just his
wife, but I always

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:40.710
feel this gratitude
towards his soul, you know.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.130
And those people are around.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.250
We have a lot of good
people like that.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.170
But he did save me.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:48.920
And for some reason, I just
say like, why am I even alive?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.950
So there is a reason,
and it's not just for me.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.110
It's for the other
children out there

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.810
who are going through
the same thing

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.540
to know that there is hope.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.737
Tomorrow is going to be OK.

00:32:00.737 --> 00:32:03.070
SPEAKER: Which is what you're
devoting your life to now.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.986
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Yeah.

00:32:03.986 --> 00:32:07.880
SPEAKER: So we're going to open
it up for questions, if folks

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.490
want to queue up at the mics.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.510
So bring us up to today.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:18.005
What's the status
of Rwanda today?

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.060
How are you connected
to the country?

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.540
How have things changed?

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.560
What's your perspective there?

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.720
DYDINE UMUNYANA: I think
Rwanda today is OK.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.580
I won't say that it's
perfect because it's only

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:38.630
been 23 years, and
it takes a long time

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:42.830
to teach peace
than teaching hate.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.020
For some reason,
hate is really loud.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:49.436
And when love is quiet and
people don't like to open.

00:32:49.436 --> 00:32:51.660
It's vulnerable.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.930
So we don't get to learn it as
much as when hate is out there.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.810
But we are trying to have
reconciliation, forgiveness,

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.120
having survivors learn how
to forgive because it's

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.880
really more for
the survivor to be

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:10.720
able to live after the
genocide, the survival.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.530
And I love that, after
genocide, they actually

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:19.700
learned that there was
no reason to have tribes.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.260
So though it stirs some
people's hearts and minds,

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.580
but in our ID cards,
there's no tribes.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.630
You're just a Rwandan,
which was a big step.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:35.100
And I hope-- maybe it will take
generations and generations.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.830
But I hope that one
day, younger children

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.500
will look at each other
and just see them,

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.140
see each other as humans,
not thinking twice about it.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.765
Because that's how I grew up.

00:33:47.765 --> 00:33:50.060
I grew up looking
at my classmate.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.800
And the first thing
I'd want to know

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.010
is where they're coming
from, what's their tribe,

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.130
if they're my enemies.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.950
And they're not.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.565
They're just children like me.

00:33:58.565 --> 00:34:02.250
So the country is trying
to move forward and heal,

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.700
but it will take a
very, very long time.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.804
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:34:06.804 --> 00:34:07.720
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Yeah.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.100
SPEAKER: Any questions so far?

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:14.270
OK, so just saying on the topic
of the contemporary situation

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:18.739
in Africa, specifically,
I share with you

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:23.360
an article by Nicholas Kristof
of "The New York Times."

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.540
And the title of this
article was "Conflict

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.949
is More Profitable Than Peace."

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:33.679
And the article was about
the current situation

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.460
in the Central African
Republic and the genocide

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.454
that's been happening there
for about 14 years now.

00:34:42.454 --> 00:34:44.840
And the premise
of the article was

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.100
that for us to
actually eradicate

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.510
poverty and all of the
difficulties in developing

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.110
countries, we have to
first deal with conflict.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:03.030
And apparently 80% of
UN humanitarian budgets

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:07.550
these days goes to
dealing with conflict,

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.570
as opposed to getting people
food and those sorts of things.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:19.250
So what do you think is behind
that kind of intractable issue

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:24.110
of conflict in places like the
Central African Republic, South

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.210
Sudan, Yemen?

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:30.530
What is the answer
there in terms

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:35.570
of dealing with that kind of
conflict that just continues

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.740
to perpetuate itself?

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.660
DYDINE UMUNYANA:
I think, for me,

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:48.670
the UN because they can look
over the whole entire world.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.600
For me, I think it's really--

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.500
because when there's conflict,
it takes a lot of work

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.760
to fix it.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.420
But there's ways that you can
see that conflict is coming

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.170
and prevent it
before it happens.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:01.640
It's really less work.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.760
Then you don't need the Cross.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.840
How do you call it?

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.480
Red Cross.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:14.150
There is a lot of work
when there's conflicts.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.570
And it's not really profitable.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.170
Well--

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:19.753
SPEAKER: Well, his
point was that it's

00:36:19.753 --> 00:36:21.087
profitable for the perpetrators.

00:36:21.087 --> 00:36:22.461
DYDINE UMUNYANA:
The perpetrator.

00:36:22.461 --> 00:36:23.720
SPEAKER: Right, exactly.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.700
DYDINE UMUNYANA: But for me,
I think the perpetrators,

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.300
they think they're
profiting, but they're not.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.930
Because most of
the time, for me,

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.440
I think the perpetrators
doing the genocide,

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.690
where are they now?

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.780
They don't have a life.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.910
They're in prison, or
they're fleeing all over.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:47.584
But can you imagine if you've
taken millions of lives?

00:36:47.584 --> 00:36:48.750
You're not really profiting.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.620
Maybe in that moment.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:55.080
But they just need
to be informed.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.100
And most of the time, we
need to really educate

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.550
people on the importance
of profiting from peace

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.980
because it's more profitable.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.970
We have more joy.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:10.439
You are happy, and when you're
happy, everything makes sense.

00:37:10.439 --> 00:37:10.980
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.010
DYDINE UMUNYANA:
Yeah, so I think

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.030
if they can be able to
prevent it before it happens,

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:20.460
if they can be able to
share this world, because--

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:25.350
I guess I don't know
why, but when one person

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:30.270
said that we share the same
sky, we share the same sun

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:33.360
because we don't have
control over them,

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.380
so we can't really fight for it.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:42.180
But we'd learned people should
think about it the same way.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.750
Because really, what is home?

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:49.440
It's where your heart is because
you just find yourself there.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.030
You never ask where to be born.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:55.050
You never ask the color of
your skin or ask your family,

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:59.026
I really want to be born in
a very, very wealthy family.

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.400
No, that's never
going to happen.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.045
You just find yourself there.

00:38:02.045 --> 00:38:04.710
So why in the world
would you blame somebody

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.930
to be born the way they are?

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.590
It's just more of if you're
educating our children,

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.510
if we're educating--

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:16.970
in the curriculums, they should
really include peacebuilding.

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:19.170
They should teach children
to love each other

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:24.120
and just be as if you're
teaching history, but have

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.430
the importance of peace,
how it affects individuals,

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:34.590
and giving the children
that, just giving them that--

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.612
I think it's wealth.

00:38:35.612 --> 00:38:36.570
Having peace is wealth.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:37.930
It's life.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:41.237
And if we don't have
peace, we don't have life.

00:38:41.237 --> 00:38:50.130
So the UN, they should try
to create a system where,

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.350
if a child is born,
they don't even

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:56.110
think twice that oh, I'm
this color or I'm this

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.300
or that's that.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.950
Just see ourselves
as humans, and we

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:03.300
won't have to deal
with people killing

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.735
each other or the entitlement.

00:39:06.735 --> 00:39:07.410
This is my land.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:08.580
This is mine.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.750
Just knowing that.

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.080
I think the world
is not that poor.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.410
We make it poor when we
have more than we should,

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:19.240
and then there are people
who don't have anything.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.350
So if we can be able to
have compassion, and give

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:27.120
more, and prevent
this kind of killings.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.080
Like in Rwanda, if we
had someone seeing it

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.160
before it happened, I guess
millions of people would have--

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.967
hundreds of people
would have been saved.

00:39:36.967 --> 00:39:37.550
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.590
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Yeah.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.395
SPEAKER: Yes, sir.

00:39:40.395 --> 00:39:41.853
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:39:41.853 --> 00:39:42.978
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:39:42.978 --> 00:39:45.060
AUDIENCE: Your story
is amazing, and you

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.250
are truly inspirational.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:48.630
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.088
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell us if you're

00:39:50.088 --> 00:39:52.410
involved with any
organizations or efforts here?

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.740
As you said, you know,
hate somehow screams

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:02.610
and love is more vulnerable.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.700
So I'm curious about efforts
that you're involved with

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.400
to help teach children or
just people in general about

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.942
compassion, and love, and
acceptance, and tolerance,

00:40:13.942 --> 00:40:15.420
and all of that good stuff.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.545
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:40:16.545 --> 00:40:17.890
I am.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:21.660
I'm involved with
this one nonprofit.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.450
It's called Serve to Unite.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:28.930
And it was founded by a
former white supremacist.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:30.552
He's my friend.

00:40:30.552 --> 00:40:32.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:34.810
I met him the first time--

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.520
at my first talk
when I got here.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.140
It was three months
after I got here.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.610
My English was horrible.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:43.330
But he had patience
to listen to me.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.370
And I learned so
much about his work.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:49.960
And I was curious because
before I came here,

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:54.310
I learned a lot about the
Civil Rights movements

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.710
and all these things,
the history of America.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.580
And it was like, oh,
my god, this is a lot.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.855
And I watched a lot of movies.

00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:04.180
So when I met him with
all these tattoos,

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.480
and he has a really very
heavy voice, because he

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.990
was in rock and roll
when he was young,

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:16.410
so his voice is really strong
he told me about his work.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:19.780
And I asked him,
how did you change?

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:25.540
And he said, you know, I changed
because I had a daughter.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.180
And I was very young,
and I was a single dad.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:33.490
And one day, we were at
the store in the car.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.250
And my daughter saw
a white man walking.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:42.850
And she said, oh, Dad, look at
that nigger, at four years old.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:47.830
So for the first time, that's
when that word sounded wrong

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.840
in his ears.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.330
And he told her to never say it.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:55.690
And he tried, because he had
learned so much compassion.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:59.550
When he was-- he was
at a thing in his 20s.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.070
He had received a lot of
kindness from a Jewish person,

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:07.030
from a black person that helped
him because he always was drunk

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:09.284
or just in misery.

00:42:09.284 --> 00:42:11.200
Because mostly when you
have the hate, really,

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.580
you're hurting yourself.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.920
Yeah, you're not happy at all.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.110
You just want to blame
the entire world because

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.530
of your misery.

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:20.560
But when he changed, he became--

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.640
he's a wonderful soul.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.010
He's an amazing person.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:25.855
Sometimes I tell him,
are you doing this

00:42:25.855 --> 00:42:26.980
because you're paying back?

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.724
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:32.050
So he has this group.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.520
He lives in Milwaukee.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.620
And I speak to the children.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.400
They actually designed--
the children are 14, 13.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.854
They designed this cover.

00:42:40.854 --> 00:42:41.770
SPEAKER: Oh, they did?

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:42.720
DYDINE UMUNYANA:
Yeah, out of denim.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.440
So it's a huge
portrait they made

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.630
when I was finishing my book.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.790
And they sent me a picture,
and I was like, oh,

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.100
my this is going to
be my book cover.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.300
So these children, the Serve
to Unite, they learn peace.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.410
And I share with them my story.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:58.750
And they ask me questions.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:02.950
Really beautiful children,
they're very, very authentic.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:04.720
They tell you what they think.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.790
So there's those programs.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:10.280
And I work with OLASTEO.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.880
My friend Aaron is
here and his wife.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.680
They're the founder
of the nonprofit,

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.890
helping children to learn,
and to go to college,

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:29.180
to nicer schools, children
from underserved communities.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.390
And with Aegis
Trust, that's when

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.810
I started my public
speaking, sharing my story,

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:38.950
and learning the history,
not just of Rwanda,

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:42.460
but what really is relevant
to the entire world.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.220
Because I think we all are
looking for the same thing,

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.280
to be happy.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.852
We just look for it
in different ways.

00:43:48.852 --> 00:43:52.810
But if we can be informed on
how to find it in the right way,

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:54.970
I think we're able to change.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:57.650
And I see with Arnold,
I see my friend who

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.590
used to be a white supremacist.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:06.970
And I met this person
who's in the KKK.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:11.710
Somehow, I find myself
in those situations.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:17.270
But this guy, his name is Chris.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.800
He was reforming.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.640
So he was still in the
KKK, and I didn't even

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.850
know that the KKK still
exists, but it does.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.330
So he was sitting across
from me and trying to reform.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:33.400
But I saw how when we
were talking about love,

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:36.520
and he was really shy.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.210
He didn't want to let it out.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.470
And I asked him
so many questions.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.000
Why do you do this?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.130
And why did you do that?

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:50.700
But when he got to where I asked
him so are you OK with Muslims,

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.970
he was really aggressive,
really aggressive.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:55.140
I got scared.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.430
And then he could talk,
like, really talk.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.670
And he was like, yes, I am.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:03.000
And I was like, how about
children who are Muslim?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.470
And he said, you never know.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:06.764
You never know what
those kids have!

00:45:06.764 --> 00:45:07.940
And I said, why?

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.870
In those dresses!

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.490
And I said, what do you mean?

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:13.420
He's like, maybe they have
something, a bomb or anything.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:17.440
So then he became the
person that he is.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.920
But when he was
learning how to reform,

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.560
when he was trying to be
a nice person in front

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:27.130
of a black girl, he was
really quiet and shy,

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:30.102
and he would even cry
because he told me

00:45:30.102 --> 00:45:31.560
it was the first
time he's ever sat

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.060
across the table
with a black person.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:39.420
And I think if we
can be able to switch

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:45.060
that, he can use that strength,
and that strength in him that

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.810
comes out when he thinks about
what he hates so much, to use

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:51.580
it when he's thinking
about why he loves so much.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.050
And I think we all
have that capacity

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.105
because we grow what we feed.

00:45:57.105 --> 00:45:59.700
We have those two
sides in ourselves,

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:04.920
and if we feed more light
in us, it really comes out.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.040
Because I used to
not be this girl.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.696
I used to be angry all the time
to everyone and everything.

00:46:12.696 --> 00:46:14.306
Are you shocked?

00:46:14.306 --> 00:46:17.655
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's hard to
believe that, seeing you today.

00:46:17.655 --> 00:46:18.780
DYDINE UMUNYANA: I used to.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.340
Thank you.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.500
And I used to.

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.520
Even my mom, I would spend
months not talking to my mom,

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.150
blaming her for not giving
me the life that I want.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:29.090
And she doesn't really have any.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:31.710
But I will still feel
like I want more from her.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:34.230
And whatever that was
not going on in my life,

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:36.120
I would find somebody to blame.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.332
The children of perpetrators,
I would blame them

00:46:38.332 --> 00:46:40.290
that they have everything
and I don't, and it's

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:40.956
because of them.

00:46:40.956 --> 00:46:44.370
So being in a
victimization mode,

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.430
it makes us, like,
giving ourselves

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:51.880
a justification of hating.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.709
And really, when you
hate, for some reason--

00:46:55.709 --> 00:46:56.250
I don't know.

00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:00.070
Because even children, when
they don't want something,

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.220
they come out like
really strong.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.720
It's like, I don't want that!

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.300
And then when they love
something, they may shy away.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.090
But I think that's
what we learn.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.640
So we can really be able
to teach how to be excited

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.030
when something
wonderful is happening,

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:18.420
or we've done
something wonderful,

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.662
then we can make him change
the way we see life and--

00:47:22.662 --> 00:47:23.870
yeah.

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:24.780
SPEAKER: Yes, sir.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.905
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:47:25.905 --> 00:47:26.755
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:26.755 --> 00:47:28.088
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:47:28.088 --> 00:47:28.920
You're incredible.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.940
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.900
AUDIENCE: My question
is more about

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.174
the post-genocide recovery,
specifically the role

00:47:33.174 --> 00:47:34.590
that the government
plays in that.

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:35.280
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Yes.

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.446
AUDIENCE: I think if you
look at the immediate years

00:47:37.446 --> 00:47:40.050
following and the way the that
Paul Kagame has really embraced

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:42.091
international trade and
turned the economy around

00:47:42.091 --> 00:47:44.190
really quickly is undeniable.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:47.340
But then you fast forward to
today, almost 20 years later,

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.392
some people would say
he's an authoritarian.

00:47:49.392 --> 00:47:50.850
I don't know if
that's true or not.

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:52.890
But I'm curious if you
think that you guys are

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.785
in a place where you can
now have more of somewhat

00:47:55.785 --> 00:47:57.540
of a cleaner democracy,
or if you still

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.081
think that there needs to be a
lot tighter government control

00:48:00.081 --> 00:48:01.905
to keep things on track.

00:48:01.905 --> 00:48:03.030
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:07.030
That's a really tough one.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.952
SPEAKER: It's Google.

00:48:07.952 --> 00:48:10.212
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:10.212 --> 00:48:12.020
DYDINE UMUNYANA: I know!

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.606
I did not know what I
was getting myself into.

00:48:15.606 --> 00:48:17.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.690
So Rwanda, it's a very
complicated country,

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:23.250
very complicated.

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:31.530
And as you can imagine,
after the genocide,

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:35.550
the country was a
mess, and we had

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:39.660
a lot of people, different--

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.300
let me see how I'm
going to describe this.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.055
We had Tutsis who fled
Rwanda, the ones I explained,

00:48:46.055 --> 00:48:47.970
in the 1950s.

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.490
So they grew up in
neighboring countries,

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:53.730
in Burundi, Congo,
Uganda, and Tanzania.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:59.490
And after the genocide,
they say the cause

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:03.450
of the genocide or the conflict
was because the children who

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:06.450
were born and grew up in
the neighboring countries,

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:08.730
they were in exile,
and they were never

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:12.120
taken as Congolese or Burundian.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.310
So they were always
refugees there.

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:16.920
So they always wanted
to come back home.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.490
And for the Hutu government
that was in power then,

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:24.610
they told them
that the country--

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.336
Habyarimana, the
president, in his speech,

00:49:27.336 --> 00:49:29.210
he used to-- sometimes
I say, how a president

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.260
can have the kind of speech?

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:36.600
But he would say that Rwanda
is like a glass full of water.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:41.810
And if you try to drop a little
bit of one drop of water in it,

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:43.640
it spreads.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.510
So he would say that
Rwanda is full already.

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:47.380
Nobody can come in.

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.390
If you try to come
in, it will spread.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:52.480
And the spread was blood.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.930
So when the Tutsis
tried to come in 1990,

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.180
they killed a lot of
Tutsis inside the country.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.760
And even publicly, they
would say on the radios

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.090
that if you try
to come in, we're

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:08.320
going to kill your families
so that we have space for you.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.950
So when genocide ended,
after the genocide ended,

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:17.110
the Tutsis who were living
in the neighboring countries

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:18.285
came back into Rwanda.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.970
And the perpetrators fled,
were fleeing to Congo,

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:29.590
where they still have a rebel
group in Congo that is growing.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:32.410
And there were other Hutus
who were going in jail.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.900
And there were moderate Hutus.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.530
And there were survivors,
which was 30% of the Tutsis

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:41.470
in Rwanda, a very small
number of survivors.

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.850
So there were all
these groups coming

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.460
in this little, tiny
country with a difference.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.920
Some of them are excited.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.630
Others have lost everything.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:53.110
Others are coming back home,
or they have a victory,

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:55.300
or they are fleeing.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:59.710
So it was a very, very
difficult country.

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:06.240
And just having all those
mixed feelings, it was hard.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.540
There was not really
a quick solution

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.060
to fix what has just happened.

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:17.880
The first thing was to bury
the dead bodies and move on.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:24.780
So for me as a survivor,
there was no time to grieve.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.120
There was just no time because
you have to live again,

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.050
and on the same
speed as everyone

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:34.020
else who was coming home.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:38.370
Then the economy
was not as horrible,

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:41.730
because they came back with
things, although the houses

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:43.540
were destroyed and all of that.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.780
But that was for the survivors.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.017
And we had to go in that
system, go back to school,

00:51:49.017 --> 00:51:50.100
do this and this and this.

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:54.990
That's why my mom,
now, the trauma's

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:57.990
coming out now because
she never had that time.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:02.070
And now with the
economy and everything--

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:03.810
before I came, I
worked in rural areas.

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:08.020
There are places where people
are really, really hungry.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.680
Really hungry.

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.830
They have one meal a
day, a terrible one.

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:17.260
So of course, that is
happening because also

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:22.160
mostly the entire world stood
still during the genocide.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.760
But after, there was
a lot of non-profits

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.620
that came into Rwanda.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:32.795
So it's a very, very
vague situation.

00:52:32.795 --> 00:52:37.450
I'm 27 years old, and I'm
not even into politics.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:42.670
I don't know how I can make
really touch it or detangle it.

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:45.150
SPEAKER: Do you have confidence
in the current government

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:46.900
that's there?

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:51.480
DYDINE UMUNYANA: So I've never
known any other government.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.270
I've never known any
other government.

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.740
That's the only--

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:59.420
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.630
DYDINE UMUNYANA: The Hutu
government, I was a child.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:04.310
I really didn't
understand the system.

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:07.260
This is the only
government I've ever known.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.350
And of course there's
a lot of change.

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.990
And leading a
country like Rwanda,

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:16.710
it takes a special
kind of individual

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:20.280
to be able to really
control those kinds of minds

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.230
that are completely--

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:27.550
yeah, I don't know how to--

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:28.800
SPEAKER: No, it's complicated.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.758
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Yeah,
it's really complicated.

00:53:30.758 --> 00:53:36.370
It's not perfect, but
at least it's not 1994.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:38.350
Yes, at least we're not there.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.660
And hopefully, we'll
never go back there.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:44.460
Hopefully, we
learned our lesson,

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:49.857
and we will have peace
somewhere in the near future.

00:53:49.857 --> 00:53:50.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:51.815
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:53:51.815 --> 00:53:53.530
I hope I responded well.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:54.380
Thank you.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:57.010
SPEAKER: So we're
basically out of time,

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.369
but one final question.

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:00.160
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.534
I didn't even see
you over there.

00:54:01.534 --> 00:54:03.286
How about you as
the last question?

00:54:03.286 --> 00:54:04.600
Go ahead.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.100
AUDIENCE: OK, I
think an easier one.

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:13.236
There's so much wisdom, and
you've had so many experiences,

00:54:13.236 --> 00:54:15.573
and you're basically
an amazing person.

00:54:15.573 --> 00:54:17.890
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.530
AUDIENCE: What are your dreams
for your life going forward?

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:21.797
What do you want to do?

00:54:21.797 --> 00:54:23.380
DYDINE UMUNYANA:
What do I want to do?

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:25.004
AUDIENCE: Maybe that's
a hard question.

00:54:25.004 --> 00:54:26.962
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:26.962 --> 00:54:28.420
DYDINE UMUNYANA:
I want to do this.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:35.150
You know, I love
inspiring people.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:38.560
I love, especially, children.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.650
And I want to write more.

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:45.710
I want to touch as many
lives as I can before I die.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:47.020
And it's hard.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:53.330
I remember Aaron and I were in
Boise, I think, two weeks ago.

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:58.180
And it was at a human rights--

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.550
Wassmuth Center
for Human Rights.

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:04.460
And the director came to
pick me up from the airport,

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.110
and then he said--

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.810
Dan Prinzing is
really wonderful.

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:12.015
And he was talking to me, kind
of like what you did, kind

00:55:12.015 --> 00:55:15.320
of preparing me for the talk.

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.810
And we were having a
conversation in a car ride.

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:22.150
And then he was asking me
how I feel when I do this.

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:23.720
And I said I'm fine.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.690
But in Rwanda,
culturally, even if you

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:29.432
asked me, what did you have
for lunch, I wouldn't tell you.

00:55:29.432 --> 00:55:32.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:34.400
So we always say,
where are you going?

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.785
I'm going down there.

00:55:35.785 --> 00:55:37.080
Or how are you?

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:40.460
I'm fine, even if I'm dying.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.020
So he asked me that,
and I said, I'm fine.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.810
And then he said, you
know, a few years ago, I

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:49.070
had a friend who was
a Holocaust survivor.

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:53.630
Her name was Rose [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:59.060
And I asked her how she
felt after the talk.

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:06.260
And then she said, you
know, Dan, when I speak it,

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:07.570
you hear it.

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:10.580
And when I speak it, I see it.

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.550
And that really scared me.

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:15.710
Because I knew that this
is what I wanted to do.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:17.780
And I know a lot of
survivors don't do it.

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:21.770
But then I knew that it takes me
a long time to get over a talk.

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:23.480
It takes me at least--

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.870
I have to be able to call my
friends right after the talk.

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:28.220
I have to distract myself.

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:30.770
It takes me at least a
few days or two weeks

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:32.900
to really get over the talk.

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:36.140
And I thought the more I
do it, I would get better.

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.550
So I asked him how old was she.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:40.090
And he said she was 91.

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.096
[LAUGHS]

00:56:42.096 --> 00:56:44.440
And I was like,
that's not promising.

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:48.170
How am I going to live my
70-something years doing that

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.710
to myself?

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:50.223
Maybe I should quit.

00:56:50.223 --> 00:56:54.445
But when he was saying it
I said, oh, that's not fun.

00:56:54.445 --> 00:56:56.320
I don't know if I'm
going to keep doing this.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.220
And he said, but
Dydine, remember, she

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.460
started when she was 81.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:05.150
So she really never talked
about it until she was 81,

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:08.810
and it was all inside her.

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:13.610
And I said, oh, maybe
because I started young,

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:15.332
maybe at 40 I'll be fine.

00:57:15.332 --> 00:57:16.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.280
So I want to keep doing it.

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.090
I know sometimes it's hard.

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:23.210
When I met Aaron, when
I published the book,

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.000
I was quitting public speaking.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.490
I said, I should just go work
somewhere in entertainment.

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:30.924
And I went to CBS and
"Entertainment Tonight."

00:57:30.924 --> 00:57:32.840
And Aaron was like,
Dydine, when you're ready,

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:35.600
just let me know
because you have to be

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.440
out there inspiring people.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.424
And by that time, I would
be sobbing on the stage.

00:57:42.424 --> 00:57:44.090
Of course, I did cry
a little bit today,

00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:48.160
but I used to really,
really cry, like sob.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.240
And I was like,
this is not pretty.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.440
I should just not do this.

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:57.470
So the more I do it, the
more I remember most of them.

00:57:57.470 --> 00:58:00.210
Because the more I think
about it, it comes back.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.910
But I think--

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.100
I take meditation classes now.

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.340
And my meditation
teacher told me, what

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.800
happens to you happens for you.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.410
So it really maybe
happened for me

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:14.340
so that I can help someone else.

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:18.210
So I want to do this
for the rest of my life.

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:21.770
And hopefully, at
40 or 30-something,

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:25.620
I won't be still seeing it.

00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.080
SPEAKER: Well, on behalf of
Google and the group here,

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.040
thank you so much for your time.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:29.520
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.685
Thank you so much for coming.

00:58:30.685 --> 00:58:31.184
Thank you.

00:58:31.184 --> 00:58:32.545
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:32.545 --> 00:58:33.480
Thank you.

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:35.160
SPEAKER: There's
a new book signing

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.320
that will be happening in
the back, if any of you

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.990
would like to get
Dydine's new book.

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.860
Thank you.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.740
DYDINE UMUNYANA: Thank you.
