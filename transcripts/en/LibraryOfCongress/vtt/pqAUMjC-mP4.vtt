afternoon ladies and gentleman.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.080
On behalf of all my colleagues, and
in particular Dr. Mary Jane Deeb,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.750
Chief of the African and
Middle Eastern Division,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.950
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.540
So, without further ado then, I'd
like to call upon Fatemeh Keshavarz

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.120
to introduce our speaker
and the program today.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.920
Thank you very much.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.890

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.590
I see a lot of young
enthusiastic participants.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.890
That's wonderful.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.150
Welcome. So, I'm trying
to keep this short

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.610
so we can actually
get to the program.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.970
I'm Fatemeh Keshavarz.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.230
I'm Director of the School
of Languages, Literatures,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.750 position:56%
and Cultures, and also Director of
Roshan Institute for Persian Studies

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.380
at University of Maryland.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.780
And it's a tremendous pleasure
and honor to be in this series

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.210
which involve basically
collaborating very closely

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.720
with our wonderful colleagues at
the Library here to bring this,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.990 position:56%
events such as this one to a much
broader public than we would be able

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.420
to do on our own just
through the Institute.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.720
So, that's wonderful.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.020
Thank you.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.720
Mary Jane, Hirad, Joan,
everybody here; that's amazing.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.480
Okay, today, we are hosting a dear
friend of mine and a wonderful,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.090
wonderful artist and educator, a
Maestro, who is also a professor,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.320 position:56%
and you don't really have very often
these qualities all come together.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.030
And that's Maestro was
saying [foreign language]

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.780
or I should sometimes feel bad
that I have to call him professor,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.080
was saying [foreign language],

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.930
actually holds a Maseeh
professorship in performing arts

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.830
at the University of
California at Irvine.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.330
And he was born in Isfahan in Iran,
grew up in a family in which art

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.410
and music was very, very valuable,
and even though he trained

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.380
as an architect, he actually
has a Ph.D. degree there,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.400
and later on went to
Florence in Italy

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.240
to do further studies
in architecture.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.840
But he also trained as a
ney player and as a musician

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.240
in the National Superior
Conservatory of Music

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.560 position:56%
in Genron [phonetic], and he studied
with people like Maestro [inaudible]

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.710
and [inaudible], the Master, a
ney player who had a great impact

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.910
on Persian music as a whole.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.250
Now, Maestro Omoumi has played
everywhere in World Music Festival,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.850
in San Francisco, in the
Getty Center in Los Angeles,

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.780
and you know in Asia
society in New York.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.960
I'm not really going to have the
time to go through all of that.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.270
I would like to tell you that
the film that you're going

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.410
to see is going to teach a lot
more than just music and him.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.280
It's about the human relationship
that makes this, the transmission

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.200
of this art possible as well
as the intricacies of the art.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.230
So, I don't know if the
copies are available,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.900 position:56%
but I would highly recommend for you
to go online and get copies of this.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.910 position:56%
It's called Classical Persian Music,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.950
and it's about from
Isfahan to Irvine.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.380
There was actually, this
was made with, first of all,

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.030
support from NEH, and then later

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.030
on from Roshan Cultural
Heritage Institute.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.820
So, we are delighted to
have played a role in that.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.090
I think without further ado,
I would like to invite --

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.690
are you, Hirad, going
to say anything,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.260
or was it -- just a second.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.000
Okay. My friend Hirad is going
to say a couple of words,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.300
and then we're going
to see the film,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.600
and then we will actually
meet Maestro Omoumi.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.270
Thank you so much.

everyone, for joining us.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.620
I also wanted to give you a heads
up on the Persian, essentially,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.270
Persian Book Lecture Series.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.060
We have another wonderful program
coming up next week on Tuesday.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.370
Kevin Shorts will be speaking about
Persian in the 18th, 19th century,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.030
and the finale for this
year is in November,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.770
November 9th, the day
after elections.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.740
This one is Hamid Dabashi's new
work, Persophilia, essentially,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.240
the Love of Things Persian.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.360 position:56%
So, I just wanted to mention that to
you so you can put it on your notes,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.900
and I also want to take a
second here and thank all of you

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.700
for showing up on a busy
weekday, especially during lunch,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.970
and especially from
Fortismere and University

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.990
of Maryland's wonderful staff

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.320
for always working
hand and glove with us.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.470
Thank you very much.

being here during lunch hour

because I know everyone's busy.

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.510

Maestro Omoumi to come up.

&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: And I'm going
to ask for a few questions.

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:17.460
I know we're a little over an
hour, but unfortunately we got

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.510
to start late because of
traffic and everything.

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:23.090
So, if it's okay, feel free to
get up and ask a few questions.

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:25.350
Dr. Amoki Makouk [phonetic],
go ahead.

00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:29.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amoki Makouk: I just wanted
to point out a happy coincidence

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:33.590
that this park and this event
last was used [inaudible]

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:34.890
in [inaudible] in literature.

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:40.350
For too long, we are
unduly separation of quality

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:48.580
and music is strong in all of it,

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:59.190
and I think it really behooves
us all to do whatever we can

00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:05.590
to reconcile these two because
in the future the Persian history

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:11.230
you'll see will always be
[inaudible] minstrel [inaudible]

00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:18.190
tradition is all the time and that
he had talked [inaudible] here

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:24.180
to enjoy this report
they were just reading.

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:33.990
I think it was a book
or a novel, in fact.

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:48.960
This shows that that quality is
separable from songs and music

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.590
in the one [inaudible]
at the arts tradition.

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:54.710
Thank you very much.

00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:56.050

right, a question anyone?

00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:58.850
Thank you, Dr. Kaimi [phonetic].

00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:00.150

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:02.770
&gt;&gt; Joan: I love that
you're an innovator.

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:06.950
I love innovation and all of the
new ways that you were thinking

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:09.880
of the instruments and ways to
use it, and the language, poetry,

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.480
and I saw that something that
almost looked like Latin, you say.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.030
Could you describe other
innovations perhaps

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.330
where you've taken the lyrics
and tried to merge [inaudible]?

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:18.630
&gt;&gt; Hossein Omoumi: Yeah.

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:19.930
That's a great idea, actually.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.230
WE were into core and know
there was play, what was that?

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:22.530
&gt;&gt; Joan: That was it.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:23.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hossein Omoumi: Yeah, it was drat
[phonetic], but today we're talking

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:25.130
about the history of America
with drat for the children.

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:26.430
So, actually, I'm asking
the port to compose the poem

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:27.730
for Pischardif [phonetic]
and for the kids.

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:29.030
So, I'm waiting for the poem
to adapt it; then for the kids

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:30.330 position:56%
to sing this poem and learn music
through the poetry for the children.

meeting and the -- I love that.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.260
&gt;&gt; This is a long story,
actually, yeah.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:01.110
&gt;&gt; I can't say how much
I enjoyed [inaudible],

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:07.470
but I wanted to ask you something.

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:10.740
You wrote an [inaudible].

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:17.790
Are there modern poems in which
that you would get to the music?

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:19.150
&gt;&gt; Hossein Omoumi: Yeah, sure.

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:24.860 position:56%
Yeah. The amount, the huge number
of the melodic patterns that we have

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:30.280
in classical Persian music, there's
some part that we have freedom

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:36.420
to choose any kind of poetic
freedom, and we can see

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:41.130 position:56%
and perform neo-poetry in
classical Persian music in that part

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.160
of classical Persian music.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.880
But there are some
parts that are based

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:51.630
on the classical Persian
poetry, and classical rhythm,

01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:54.730
so we must keep this
poetry of rhythm.

01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:57.510
But where we have freedom,
we can use modern poetry.
