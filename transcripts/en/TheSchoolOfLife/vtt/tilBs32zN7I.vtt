00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.440
The story of the Buddha’s life, like all
of Buddhism, is a story about confronting suffering.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.660
He was born between the sixth and fourth century
B.C., the son of a wealthy king in the Himalayan

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.360
foothills of Nepal.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.329
It was prophesied that the young Buddha — then
called Siddhartha Gautama — would either

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.940
become the emperor of India or a very holy
man.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.120
Since Siddhartha’s father desperately wanted
him to become the former, he kept the child

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.200
isolated in a palace.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.180
Young Gautama had every imaginable luxury:
jewels, servants, lotus ponds,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.120
even beautiful dancing women.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.280
For 29 years, Gautama lived in bliss, protected
from the smallest misfortunes of the outside world

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.019
But then, he left the palace for short excursions.

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.800
What he saw amazed him: first he met a sick
man, then an aging man, and then a dying man.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.530
show these kind of people in India—add them
to the same image one by one

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.039
He was astounded to discover that these unfortunate
people represented normal—indeed, inevitable—parts

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.239
of the human condition that would one day
touch him, too.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.040
Horrified and fascinated, Gautama made a fourth
trip outside the palace walls—and encountered

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.600
a holy man, who had learned to seek spiritual
life in the midst of the vastness of human suffering.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.200
Inspired by the holy man, Gautama left the
palace for good.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.400
He tried to learn from other holy men.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.540
He almost starved himself to death by avoiding
all physical comforts and pleasures, as they did.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.980
Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not bring him
solace from suffering.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.920
Then he thought of a moment when he was a
small boy: sitting by the river, he’d noticed

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.540
that when the grass was cut, the insects and their eggs were

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.240
trampled and destroyed.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.200
As a child, he’d felt a deep compassion for
the tiny insects.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.420
Reflecting on his childhood compassion,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.960
Gautama felt a profound sense of peace. He
ate, meditated, and finally reached

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.980
the highest state of enlightenment:

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.590
Nirvana

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.050
It refers to the “blowing out” of the
flames of desire.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.660
With this, Gautama had become the Buddha,
“the awakened one”.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.400
The Buddha awoke by recognising that all of
creation, from distraught ants to dying human beings,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.980
is unified by suffering.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.480
Recognising this, the Buddha discovered how
to best approach suffering.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.020
First, one shouldn’t bathe in luxury,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.710
nor abstain from food and comforts altogether.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.930
Instead, one ought to live in moderation .

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.340
The Buddha called this

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.880
the middle way

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.040
This allows for maximal concentration on cultivating
compassion for others and seeking enlightenment

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.480
Next, the Buddha
described a path to transcending suffering called

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.880
The four noble
truths

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.850
The first noble truth is the realisation that
first prompted the Buddha’s journey:

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.160
that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction
in the world.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.780
The second is that this suffering is caused
by our desires.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.580
As the Buddha said,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.209
“attachment is the root of all suffering.”

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.459
The third truth is that we can transcend suffering
by removing or managing these desires.

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.110
The Buddha thus made the remarkable claim that we must change our outlook, not our circumstances.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.850
We are unhappy not because we don’t have
enough money, love or status but because we

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.390
are greedy, vain, and insecure. By re-orienting
our mind we can grow to be content.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.390
The people become happier—superimpose smiles
or use a second image of their face

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.860
With the correct behaviour and what we now
term a mindful attitude, we can also become

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.760
better people. We can invert negative emotions
and states of mind, turning ignorance into

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.660
wisdom, anger into compassion, and greed into
generosity.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.210
The fourth and final noble truth the Buddha
uncovered

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.319
is that we can learn to move beyond suffering through what he termed

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.700
the noble
eightfold path.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.500
The eightfold path involves a series of aspects
of behaving “right” and wisely:

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.580
right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.459
and right concentration.

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.660
What strikes the western observer is the notion
that wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.020
realisation. One must exercise one’s nobler
impulses on a regular basis, as one would

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.440
train a limb. The moment of understanding
is only one part of becoming a better person.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.989
After his death, The Buddha’s followers
collected his “sutras” (sermons or sayings)

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.900
into scripture, and developed texts to guide
followers in meditation, ethics,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.459
and mindful living.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.940
The monasteries that had developed during
the Buddha’s lifetime grew and multiplied,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.200
throughout China and East Asia.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.300
For a time, Buddhism was particularly uncommon
in India itself, and only a few quiet groups

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.170
of yellow-clad monks and nuns roamed the countryside,
meditating quietly in nature.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.940
But then, in the 3rd century B.C., an Indian
king named Ashoka grew troubled by the wars

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.040
he had fought and converted to Buddhism.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.620
He sent monks and nuns far and wide to spread the practice.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.560
Buddhist spiritual tradition spread across
Asia and eventually throughout the world.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.910
Buddha’s followers divided into two main
schools:

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.210
Theravada Buddhism which colonised Southeast Asia, and

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.590
Mahayana Buddhism which took hold in China and Northeast Asia.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.700
Today, there are between a half and one and
a half billion Buddhists in both East and West

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.060
following the Buddha’s teachings and
seeking a more enlightened and compassionate

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.400
state of mind.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.200
Intriguingly, the Buddha’s teachings are
important regardless of our spiritual identification.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.580
Like the Buddha, we are all born into the
world not realising how much suffering it

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.200
contains, and unable to fully comprehend that
misfortune, sickness, and death

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.660
will come to us too.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.520
As we grow older, this reality often feels
overwhelming,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.020
and we may seek to avoid it altogether.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.940
But the Buddha’s teachings remind us of
the importance of facing suffering directly.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.800
We must do our best to liberate ourselves
from the grip of our own desires,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.300
and recognise that suffering can be viewed
as part of our common connection with others,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.200
spurring us to compassion and gentleness.
