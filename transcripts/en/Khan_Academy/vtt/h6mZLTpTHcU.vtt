00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.080
So this right over here is the graph of
the function g of t.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.850
It is a function of t, and let's define a
new function.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.200
Let's call it capital G of x, and it's
equal to the definite

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.790
integral between t is equal to negative 3
and t is equal to x.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.250
Of our lowercase g of t, g of t, dt.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.460
So, given how we have just, given how we
have just defined capital G of x,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.900
let's see if we can evaluate some val,
let's see if we can find some values.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.610
So, let's evaluate the function capital G.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.920
At x is equal to 4, and let's also
evaluate

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.930
the function capital G at x is equal to 8.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.860
And I encourage you to pause the video
right now and try to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.560
think about these on your own, and then we
can work through them together.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.340
So let's tackle capital G of 4 first.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.050
So this is going to be, this is going to
be, well, if x is equal to 4.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.390
This, this top boundary is going to be 4,
so this is going to be the definite

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.640
integral of g of t between t is equal to
negative 3, and t is equal to 4.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.210
g of t, g of t, d t.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.550
Now what's that going to be equal to?

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.240
Well, let's see, let's look at this graph
here.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.970
So, we have negative 3, this t is equal to
negative 3, which is right over here.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.990
T is equal to negative 3.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.920
And we're going to go all the way to is
equal to 4.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.190
Let me circle that in orange.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.780
All the way to t is equal to 4 which is
right over here.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.480
So this is.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.740
One way to think about this is this is
going to

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.960
be the area above t-axis and below the
graph of G.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.290
So, it's going to be this area, right over

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.710
here, that is above the t-axis and below
the graph

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.370
of G of T, but, we're not going to add to
it this area because this area over here.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.050
I'll shade it in yellow.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.270
This area I'm shading in yellow over here,
this is going to be negative.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.890
Why's it going to be negative?

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.970
Because we want the area that is above t
and below g.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.350
This is the other way around.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.320
This is below the t axis and above the
graph of g.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.780
So one way to think about it is, we could
split it up.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.790
So, we could, actually let me just clear
this out so we have more space.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.930
So, this, right over here, is going to be
equal to the integral.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.260
I'll do that in this purple color.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:43.394
The integral from t equals negative 3 to
0, of g of dt +.

00:02:43.394 --> 00:02:46.500
I'll do this in the other color.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:56.450
Plus the interval from 0, t equals 0 to t
is equal to 4 of g of t, dt.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.470
Now what are each of these going to be?

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.230
Well this is just a triangle where the
base is 3.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.590
The base has length 3.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.850
The height is length 3.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.400
So, it's going to be 3 times 3, which is 9
times one half.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.870
Because 3 times 3 would give us the area
of this entire square.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.970
But this triangle is half of that.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.730
So it's, this right over here, is going to
be 4.5.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.620
This is going to be 4.5.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.130
And then, what's this area in yellow?

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.400
Well, let's see, we have a triangle, it's
base is, or it's width here is 4,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.610
it's height is 4, 4 times 4 is 16, which
would be area of this entire square.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.420
We take half of that, it's 8.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.440
Now we don't just add it to it, because,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.570
once again, this is going to be negative
area.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.140
The graph over here is below, below the T
axis.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.710
So this, we would say, we would, this

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.270
integral is going to evaluate to negative
8.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.980
Once again, why is it negative 8?

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.720
Cause the graph is below, below the T
axis.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.986
And so what do we get?

00:03:53.986 --> 00:04:00.225
We get g(4) which is this area essentially
minus this area.

00:04:00.225 --> 00:04:05.060
4.5 minus 8 is going to be.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.510
Let's see 4 minus 8 is negative 4 out of
.5 which is negative 3.5.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.900
Negative 3.5.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.510
Now let's try to figure out what g of 8
is.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.940
So g of 8.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.800
And if you couldn't figure it out the 1st
time around, try to pause the video again,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.510
and now that we've figured out g of 4, try
to figure what g of 8 is.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.620
Well g of 8 is, 1 way to think about it,
it's going to be that.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.960
Minus that area and then we're going to
add, then we're going to figure

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.870
out the area and then we're going to have
two more areas to think about.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.090
We're gonna go all the way to 8.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.450
So actually make, draw the line there.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.830
So we're gonna have to think about, we're
going to think about this whole area now.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.790
This whole area now.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.000
And then we're gonna think about this one.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.480
So we could write this is going to be
equal to the integral between.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.770
Actually let me do that purple color.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.050
So it's going to be this, this integral.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.880
Which is the integral between negative, t
equals negative 3 and 0.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.580
G of t, dt.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.820
Plus this entire yellow region right now.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.150
The part that we looked at before plus
this part over here.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.674
So, I'll just write that as, plus the
definated role between t is equal to 0

00:05:22.674 --> 00:05:27.800
and 6 of g of t dt.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.130
And then finally.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:37.150
Plus the definite integral between T is
equal to 6 and T is equal to 8 g(t) dt.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.120
Now we already know that this first one
evaluates to 4.5, so that one is 4.5.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.710
Now what's this one going to be?

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.620
We have a triangle.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.999
Whose base is length 6, height is 4, 6
times

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:59.640
4 is 24 times one half is going to get us
12.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.380
So this is going to be, that over there is
twelve and then finally what is this area?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.660
Oh and we have to be careful.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.380
This is below the t axis and above the
graph.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.450
So this is going to be a negative 12.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.190
And then finally, we have this area, which
is once again going to be a positive area.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.340
It's below the graph and above the t axis.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.220
And so let's see, 2 times 4 is 8 times 0.5
is 4.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.650
So we're going to have.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.010
Plus 4.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.410
Plus 4.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.570
And so what do we have?

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.910
We end up with 4.5 plus 4 is 8.5 minus 12.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.700
So this is going to be equal to.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:50.830
This is going to be equal to 8.8 minus 12
would be negative 4 plus 5.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.620
It is negative 3.5 again.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.890
Now why did these two things end up being
the same?

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.490
Well think about what happened here.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.660
When we went from capital G of 4 to
capital G of 8.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:12.130
We subtracted, we subtracted this value
right over here and we added this

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.240
value right over here and you see that
these two triangles have the same areas.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.670
So we subtracted and added the same amount
to get the same exact value.
