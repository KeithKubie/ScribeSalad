report to the moderator the results of the reworked process.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.900
The moderator should confirm that the fixes have been properly implemented.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.350
Also, the moderator should collect data on the review itself.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.170
Such as the number and types of defects detected, the number of participants,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.470
and the total time spent reviewing. This data should be recorded and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.930
saved, so that the process of reviewing itself is being reviewed and, and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.530
possibly improved if it, if it can be.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.670
Finally, the moderator should suggest these improvements to the review process.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.600
And, take them up with, the organizational, quality people, so

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.820
that o, over time, the effectiveness of the review process itself can improved.
