00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.380
What I want to do
now is just a series

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.570
of problems that really make
sure that we know what we're

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.530
doing with parallel lines and
triangles and all the rest.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.410
And what we have right here
is a fairly classic problem.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.070
And what I want to do is I
want to figure out, just given

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.570
the information
here-- so obviously

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.310
I have a triangle here.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.380
I have another
triangle over here.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.020
We were given some of the angles
inside of these triangles.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.400
Given the information
over here, I

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400
want to figure out what
the measure of this angle

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.850
is right over there.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.616
I need to figure out what
that question mark is.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.490
And so you might want
to give a go at it just

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.570
knowing what you know about
the sums of the measures

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.130
of the angles inside of
a triangle, and maybe

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.630
a little bit of what you know
about supplementary angles.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.740
So you might want to pause
it and give it a try yourself

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.214
because I'm about to
give you the solution.

00:00:50.214 --> 00:00:51.630
So the first thing
you might say--

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.330
and this is a
general way to think

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.510
about a lot of these problems
where they give you some angles

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.300
and you have to figure out
some other angles based

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.630
on the sum of angles and
a triangle equaling 180,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.850
or this one doesn't have
parallel lines on it.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.080
But you might see some
with parallel lines

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.440
and supplementary lines
and complementary lines--

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.100
is to just fill in everything
that you can figure out,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.010
and one way or
another, you probably

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.290
would be able to figure out
what this question mark is.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.310
So the first thing that
kind of pops out to me

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.810
is we have one triangle
right over here.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.030
We have this
triangle on the left.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.440
And on this triangle
on the left,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.254
we're given 2 of the angles.

00:01:24.254 --> 00:01:26.170
And if you have 2 of the
angles in a triangle,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.130
you can always figure
out the third angle

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.650
because they're going to
add up to 180 degrees.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.550
So if you call that x, we
know that x plus 50 plus 64

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.300
is going to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.860
Or we could say, x
plus, what is this, 114.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.240
X plus 114 is equal
to 180 degrees.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.160
We could subtract 114 from
both sides of this equation,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.220
and we get x is equal
to 180 minus 114.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.186
So 80 minus 14.

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:05.550
80 minus 10 would be 70,
minus another 4 is 66.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.690
So x is 66 degrees.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.307
Now, if x is 66
degrees, I think you

00:02:11.307 --> 00:02:13.140
might find that there's
another angle that's

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.580
not too hard to figure out.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.360
So let me write it like this.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.080
Let me write x is
equal to 66 degrees.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.890
Well if we know this
angle right over here,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.630
if we know the measure of
this angle is 66 degrees,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.970
we know that that
angle is supplementary

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.730
with this angle right over here.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.260
Their outer sides
form a straight angle,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.640
and they are adjacent.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.710
So if we call this
angle right over here,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.170
y, we know that
y plus x is going

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.750
to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.860
And we know x is
equal to 66 degrees.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.120
So this is 66.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.540
And so we can subtract
66 from both sides,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.900
and we get y is equal to--
these cancel out-- 180 minus 66

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.760
is 114.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.110
And that number might look
a little familiar to you.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.340
Notice, this 114 was
the exact same sum

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.790
of these 2 angles over here.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.260
And that's actually
a general idea,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.270
and I'll do it on the side
here just to prove it to you.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.124
If I have, let's say that
these 2 angles-- let's

00:03:18.124 --> 00:03:19.540
say that the measure
of that angle

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.490
is a, the measure
of that angle is

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.340
b, the measure of
this angle we know

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.800
is going to be 180
minus a minus b.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.250
That's this angle
right over here.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.290
And then this angle,
which is considered

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.990
to be an exterior angle.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.440
So in this example, y
is an exterior angle.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.220
In this example, that
is our exterior angle.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.090
That is going to be
supplementary to 180

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.650
minus a minus b.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.230
So this angle plus
180 minus a minus b

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.730
is going to be equal to 180.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.920
So if you call this
angle y, you would

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.730
have y plus 180 minus a
minus b is equal to 180.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.990
You could subtract
180 from both sides.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.160
You could add a plus
b to both sides.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.080
So plus a plus b.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.050
Running out of space
on the right hand side.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.820
And then you're left
with-- these cancel out.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.680
On the left hand side,
you're left with y.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.230
On the right hand side
is equal to a plus b.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.089
So this is just a
general property.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.430
You can just reason
it through yourself

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.680
just with the sum of the
measures of the angles inside

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.020
of a triangle add
up to 180 degrees,

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.200
and then you have a
supplementary angles

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.950
right over here.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.940
Or you could just say, look,
if I have the exterior angles

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.220
right over here,
it's equal to the sum

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.972
of the remote interior angles.

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:39.180
That's just a little
terminology you could see there.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.220
So y is equal to a plus b.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.240
114 degrees, we've already
shown to ourselves,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.380
is equal to 64 plus 50 degrees.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.005
But anyway, regardless
of how we do it,

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:50.670
if we just reason
it out step by step

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.090
or if we just knew this
property from the get go,

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.987
if we know that y is
equal to 114 degrees--

00:04:54.987 --> 00:04:57.320
and I like to reason it out
every time just to make sure

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.290
I'm not jumping to conclusions.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.050
So if y is 114 degrees,
now we know this angle.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.192
We were given this
angle in the beginning.

00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:07.150
Now we just have to figure
out this third angle

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.920
in this triangle.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.930
So if we call this z, if we
call this question mark is

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.710
equal to z, we know
that z plus 114 plus 31

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.170
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.460
The sums of the measures of
the angle inside of a triangle

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.770
add up to 180 degrees.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.290
That's the only property
we're using in this step.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:38.520
So we get z plus, what is
this, 145 is equal to 180.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.560
Did I do that right?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.962
We have a 15, then a 30.

00:05:42.962 --> 00:05:45.350
Yep, 145 is equal to 180.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.070
Subtract 145 from both
sides of this equation,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:56.840
and we are left with z is equal
to 80 minus 45 is equal to 35.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.580
So z is equal to 35
degrees, and we are done.
