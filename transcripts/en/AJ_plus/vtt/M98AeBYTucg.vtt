Shafiqa is eight months pregnant.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.590
She was forced to flee her home in Myanmar.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.390
During her escape,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.060
she says she was raped by soldiers.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.940
When Shafika eventually made it to the Rohingya refugee camp,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.340
here, in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, the 25-year-old realized she was pregnant.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.900
The baby growing inside of her â€“ a result of her rape.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.640
This is Shafika's story.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.140
Shafika fled her village in Rakhine state along with her husband and their two children.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.860
They left in the dead of night with nothing but the clothes on their backs.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.040
Soldiers from the Myanmar military first separated Shafiqa from her husband. And then they took away her youngest child

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.580
Shafiqa had lost a child and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.040
didn't know if her husband was alive or dead.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.220
She and her 4-year-old daughter were captives of the Myanmar military.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.240
Shafika says the soldiers would take the women up to a mountain to rape them.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.360
Even though she was weak Shafiqa saw an opportunity and took it.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.320
At least 10,000 Rohingya were killed in Myanmar in 2017.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.980
More than 700,000 have escaped to Bangladesh. And during the Myanmar military's campaign of massacre and rape,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.000
women's bodies became a terrain of conflict.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.400
Shafiqa is not alone.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.720
Although there are no specific figures of how many pregnancies have occurred because of these rapes,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.120
at least 2,700 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence have received help in the camps.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.600
Shafika made it to Ghundhum refugee camp after a treachorous five-day journey.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.000
Here, she was reunited with her husband 20 days later.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.249
More than 60 Rohingya babies are born in the refugee camps in Bangladesh every day.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.520
The conditions for pregnant women in the camps are dire,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.129
especially for survivors of sexual violence.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.860
Shafiqa Is denied citizenship in Myanmar. She'll raise her baby in this camp when it's born.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.010
Despite the perilous conditions

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:28.239
she and her newborn child will have to face in the world's largest refugee camp, Shafika will not go back to Myanmar.
