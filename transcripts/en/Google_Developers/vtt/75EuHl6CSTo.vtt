ROB DODSON: All right, so
yeah, this is me, Rob Dodson,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.422
developer advocate here at
the Google's-- thank you.

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:10.350
That's awesome.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.550
As Peter mentioned, I work
on the Polymer project.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.650
My single goal in
life right now is

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.660
to get web components into
all of your hot little hands.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.090
And as we were talking
about what sort of sessions

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.910
we wanted to do at
this conference,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.660
I was saying I really
want to do something

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.470
about actually
building elements.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410
So I want you guys
to see what it's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.222
like to actually write the code
and work with these things.

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:36.680
What I found
personally is that I'm

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.764
hacking on an idea
over the weekend,

00:00:38.764 --> 00:00:41.430
or I just wake up late at night,
and I got this thing in my head

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.388
and I'm like, I got to
get this out of my head.

00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:44.810
I got to see this on screen.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.650
I found that when I'm
working with elements,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.570
it just makes me crazy
super productive.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.260
Because there's a lot of
really cool APIs and services

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.010
out there that I want
to play around with,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.560
but it's just a bunch of work
to get them all set up in my app

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.950
and plumb it all together and
glue all the bits together.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.420
And when I'm working
with elements,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.400
I can actually take an element
that someone else has created,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.040
which just wraps their
API nice and neat for me

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.490
into a little tag.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.612
And I can just bolt
those pieces together.

00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:16.320
Kind of like LEGO
building blocks, right?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.570
I can put them together
and get my idea.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.830
I can deconstruct them even
and rearrange the elements

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.520
and re-purpose them and use
them in a totally different way.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.540
So, that's what I want to talk
about tonight is how do we

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.150
actually use all these
different elements?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.979
I'm going to start my clock here
so I don't run too over time.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.520
What we're going to do is we're
going to build a couple apps.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.400
You guys are actually
watch me do this live,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.727
so fingers crossed
this goes well.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.310
First thing we're
going to do is we're

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.810
going to build a
Street View Tour.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.684
So we're going to build
this application that

00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:47.730
connects to a back end.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.646
It's going to pull some
data off that back end

00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:50.880
and load it into Google Maps.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.220
It's going to show us a
description of the location

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.994
that we're looking
at in the map.

00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:56.660
And lastly, it's going
to let us explore

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.125
the space using a
Street View element.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.770
So that's going to
be mashup number 1.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.900
Mashup number 2 is going to
be a Map Voice Search element,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.400
so it's going to repurpose the
Google Map element that we're

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.770
going to use in the first
mashup and use it again

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.632
on the second one.

00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:12.090
We're going to be
able to search it

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.410
using either keyboard
or our voice.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.750
And we're going to get it
running on the phone using

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.750
this amazing camera
contraption thing.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.125
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:22.792
I'm just going to hop into code.

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:24.500
If you guys can't see
anything, or if you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.600
see me making
grave mistakes well

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.250
I type out code,
please shout it out.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.140
And-- does anybody know how
to make the sidebar bigger

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.730
in Sublime?

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.646
I don't actually know.

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:36.130
It's OK, you don't
really have to see it.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.205
So what I got here is just a
folder called development--

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:40.840
it's a little hard
to see over there--

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.710
and we got an element inside
of here just called map tour--

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.940
and you can't see the
folder, but that's cool.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.120
And typically what I do, when
I'm starting any application,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.560
is I create a little
bower.json file.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.895
Inside of here, I
find all the things

00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:56.396
that I want to
install into my app--

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:57.978
can the people in
the back of the room

00:02:57.978 --> 00:02:59.363
see this, like, sort of kind of?

00:02:59.363 --> 00:03:00.303
Yeah, all right.

00:03:00.303 --> 00:03:01.136
This is not so good.

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:02.830
So I got a bower.json file here.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.520
And inside, these
are the dependencies

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.510
that my app is going to use.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.436
I got Polymer, we got this thing
called X-tag Imports, which

00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:10.810
we're talk about
in a little bit.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.711
Google Maps, Polymer
UI Card-- bunch

00:03:12.711 --> 00:03:14.460
of really cool different
things that we're

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.300
going to bolt together.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.790
And I'm going to cover
each of these individually

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.081
as we get to them, so you
don't have to worry about too

00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:21.049
much about what's
going on there.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.840
Instead, we're just
going to hop in the map

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.515
tour on Bower install.

00:03:25.515 --> 00:03:26.640
And that's going to go out.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.466
That's going to
crawl the interwebs.

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:30.340
It's going to grab all
these different things

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.715
and drop them into
my application

00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:33.400
so I can start using them.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.690
Whoosh, they're all in there.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.070
That's cool.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.025
All right, so I got all the
stuff that I need to use.

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:41.630
Now I'm going to
open this demo HTML

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.380
file so you guys can see that.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.610
And first thing I
got to do is I got

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.350
to make sure to
load the platform.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.880
A platform layer
is very important.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.560
That's how why we jump our
browser into the future,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.299
so web components work.

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.090
Regardless of the
browser that I'm in, once

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.390
I drop that one line of
JavaScript within there.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.070
I can start using
web components.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.440
Registering my own
elements using Shadow DOM.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.200
And the first thing
that I'm going

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.220
to do, now that I have
these superpowers,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.290
is I'm going to import
the rest the Polymer.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.065
I'm going to do this
using an HTML import.

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:15.972
So I'm using a
little link tag here.

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:17.305
And I grab polymer/polymer.html.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.220
Any time I start
any Polymer project,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.920
I typically just stud
out really quickly

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.400
like a simple Polymer element
that just says, "Hello world."

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.810
I'm just going to clean
this guy up a bit.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.060
So the thing that we're
building is a little map tour.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.900
And inside, I've got a
little template tag here.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.850
Whatever I put into
that template tag, when

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.045
the browser sees my new
element on the page,

00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:50.420
it's just going to grab the
stuff out of the template tag

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.210
and render it for me.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.950
So to verify that Polymer
is set up correctly,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.594
I'll just do Hello world.

00:04:57.594 --> 00:04:58.510
This is really simple.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.260
This is the most basic Polymer
element that you can write.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.790
And hover into my browser.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:17.690
Go to local host 8080.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.260
And-- OK, see, I do
this all the time.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.510
I didn't actually use the
thing after I'd find it.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.030
Lesson number one, do that.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.990
Use the tag.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.550
OK.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.350
There we go.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.260
All right, thank you, for small
miracles, please, thank you.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.060
So we got our map tour showing
up, it says "Hello world."

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.620
That's kind of not the
most fun thing ever.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.260
If I go back to the requirements
for my really cool mashup,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.250
number one is I got to
connect to a back end service.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.230
So, a show of hands.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.920
How many of you have ever
seen or used Firebase before?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.420
Some of you?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.150
OK.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.894
So for those of you
who haven't, Firebase

00:05:54.894 --> 00:05:56.060
is this really cool service.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.220
You can basically upload some
.json to it and it'll create

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.495
a little end point for you.

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:03.120
And then you can
later on be like, hey,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.119
give me that .json back.

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:07.690
Just request it and it'll
send it right back to you.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.110
So, I've got a little
collection here called "views."

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.004
There's only one
item inside of it,

00:06:13.004 --> 00:06:14.420
but it's got a
little bit of data.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.170
It's got some latitude and
longitude for a location

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.540
on a map that I want to
load into the Google eMaps.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.040
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.655
to pull this data
off Firebase and I'm

00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:25.680
going to get it into my app.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.810
And naturally, I know all
of your brains right now,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.191
they're going to $.ajax.

00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:31.440
You're like, ah, OK, I know
how he's going to do this.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.110
But that's not how
we're going to do this.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.693
We're actually going
to use an element

00:06:34.693 --> 00:06:42.782
that the team created
called core-ajax.

00:06:42.782 --> 00:06:44.990
So I think you guys saw a
little bit of this earlier.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.460
So core-ajax is a
custom element that

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.200
allows you to do XMLHttpRequest
completely declaratively just

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.840
using an HTML tag.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.165
So we're going to--
actually, before we

00:06:57.165 --> 00:06:59.210
do that, we're going to
grab this whole map tour

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.900
thing that we've been building,
and we're going to turn it

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.090
into its own file,
maptour.html, and I

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.040
apologize if this is
a little hard to see.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.330
You can ignore this part.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.712
map-tour HTML.

00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:14.850
I'm going to grab Polymer.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.180
This is really like
the standard way

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.013
that you want to build
your custom elements.

00:07:21.013 --> 00:07:24.300
You want to build them in
their own little HTML file

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.796
that you import into your demo.

00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:29.170
So that way when
someone in Bower

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.760
installs your element later,
they can just link to it.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.312
So we're going to
grab maptour.html.

00:07:39.312 --> 00:07:40.770
So what that's
doing is that's just

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.950
grabbing this little file
over here that I created.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.626
This is where we're actually
going to build our element.

00:07:45.626 --> 00:07:47.625
So you're going to verify
things are good still,

00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:48.750
still says "Hello world."

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.250
Rad.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:49.846
OK.

00:07:49.846 --> 00:07:51.720
Now I mentioned we're
going to use core-ajax.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.880
Let's just import that guy.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.380
Core-ajax.

00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:02.960
And the way you can
figure core-ajax

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.822
is pretty straightforward.

00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:06.530
First, you can give
it an auto attribute,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.480
and that's going to say,
hey, anytime this tag-- like,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.350
the parser hits it
or something-- just

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.610
go out and make HTTP
request on my behalf.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.860
I don't want to have to call
a method to tick you off,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.940
I just want you
to do your thing.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.090
And as for where
to go, I'm going

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.420
to grab this URL from Firebase.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.960
Drop that guy in
there, and we're

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.480
going to ask for the
views.json object.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.914
And when that data comes
back from Firebase,

00:08:32.914 --> 00:08:34.330
I'm going to create
a little scope

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.669
variable for it called "views."

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.169
What?

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.640
Oh, thank you-- you guys
are good, thank you.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.390
Whoever said that
gets all the stickers.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:43.890
OK.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.522
Did I do it again?

00:08:47.522 --> 00:08:49.210
Wait, what?

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.350
Response-- response.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.530
OK, all right, response.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.270
OK, so data comes back.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.520
I create a scope
variable called "views."

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.100
And now that's going
to be available

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.120
throughout my element.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.340
Anybody can now bind
to this "views" object

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.673
and play around with this
collection that just came back

00:09:06.673 --> 00:09:07.510
from Firebase.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.750
So I'm going to just
write h1 one here,

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.350
and I want viewsviews[0].name,
and we'll also get

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.225
views[0].latitude.

00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:22.180
So this is just the data that
I have in Firebase there.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.050
I refresh the page, and
I see Heron Island, -23.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.597
And I go back to
Firebase, and that

00:09:28.597 --> 00:09:30.180
is the name of the
location on the map

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.660
that we're trying to get
into our application.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.390
OK, cool, so I didn't write
any JavaScript by the way,

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.151
and we just completed the
first line of our mash up here.

00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.150
We connected to a back
end service, we got data,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.459
and we loaded it into our app.

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:44.000
The next thing I
need to do is I need

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.030
to get into the Google Maps.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.600
And you guys have seen the
Google Maps element a fair bit.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.433
If you actually want
to play around with it,

00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:53.910
it's up on GitHub at
polymerlabs/google-map.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.670
Please go grab it and
mess around with it,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.420
it's a lot of fun.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:06.220
And in my editor, I'm
just going to import

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.670
google-map/google-map.html.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.450
Remember, all these things just
came from that bower.json file

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.700
that I installed from earlier.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.260
So that's where they're
magically appearing from.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.640
So instead of grabbing
a name and latitude

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.380
and just dropping
that into h1, I'm

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.937
going to drop it into
Google map element.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:27.793
So it wants latitude.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.690
This guy, it's
latitude, but thank you

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.805
for-- if you guys were trying
to save me from myself.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.620
And it wants longitude.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.630
And I just know
later on I'm going

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.940
to need to expose the map
property for Street View,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.139
so I'm going to go ahead and
do that so I don't forget.

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:02.180
And we got to write just
a tiny bit of JavaScript

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.390
here-- or, sorry, CSS here to
style the Google Maps element

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.670
so it looks nice on our page.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:17.780
And I set its display to
block and its height to 100%.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.630
So you got data coming from
Firebase into core-ajax,

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.960
and then from core-ajax, it
goes into our Google Map.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.060
Swap back over to our page.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.440
Refresh.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.184
And, whoa, there we go.

00:11:29.184 --> 00:11:30.350
So we got a Google map here.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.641
It's a little hard to see,
like, where is Heron island?

00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:33.480
I'm not quite sure.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.340
So, I'm just going to
add one more attribute.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.530
Show center marker.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.830
And, OK, so these attributes
and everything that I'm adding?

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.950
These are just part of
the Google Maps' API,

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.997
but the element has given
me a nice declarative

00:11:47.997 --> 00:11:49.330
way of playing around with them.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.350
I don't have to get in there
and write a configuration object

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.420
and specifically pass it into
the constructor of Google Maps,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.172
right?

00:11:56.172 --> 00:11:58.130
I can just say, hey, show
me the center marker.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.680
I get it.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.180
OK.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.263
So that's really exciting.

00:12:00.263 --> 00:12:01.260
I like that.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.210
So we got this thing
appearing in Google Maps.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.600
Now I want to do a little
crazy interrupt thing here.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.120
I want to make Polymer
work with x-tags.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.570
I want to actually use both
of them in the same project.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.070
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take our Google Map,

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.260
and I'm going to kind of create
like a Grand Theft Auto style

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.167
heads-up display.

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:20.750
I go ahead and I take the map,
and I put it into a little cart

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.690
down in the bottom
corner of my site.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.480
And then I'm going to drop in a
Street View element after that,

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.240
so that way when you're like
in the Street View element,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.250
you have the map showing
you where you're at.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.990
So, to do that, we've
got another element here

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.210
from the Polymer team
called Polymer UI card.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.742
We're going to actually
put our map inside of.

00:12:37.742 --> 00:12:40.200
I don't if that comes through
super clear on the projector,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.810
but Polymer UI cards
are really nice.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.410
You get these cool,
swipeable Google Now cards.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.860
So I'm going to just
import Polymer UI card.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.760
And I should mention,
after I get this card in,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.140
I'm going to put it
inside of an x-tag.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.170
So when I drop it inside of
this x-tag called FlipBox.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.470
So FlipBox, as Daniel
probably mentioned earlier,

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.550
shows you how to toggle
these things back and forth.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.306
You get these cool
3D flipping effects.

00:13:14.306 --> 00:13:16.180
So I'm going to put two
cards inside of here.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.450
The first one is
going to show my map

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.825
and the other
one's going to show

00:13:18.825 --> 00:13:21.500
an actual description
of Heron island.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.420
This place-- this mythical place
that we're trying to visualize.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.250
So you got your Polymer UI
card, and I'm just going to say,

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:33.540
the Polymer UI card--
and the nice thing

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.580
is I can just scoot
the map up in there.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.270
And I am going to have to
write a tiny bit of CSS

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.370
to position this
thing, and this is

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.022
the last CSS I'm going to write.

00:13:48.022 --> 00:13:49.480
And, let's see, so
we want our card

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.800
to have the width
and height of 275.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.420
And we give it some padding.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.899
And for position, absolute.

00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:00.940
And we're going to put it
in the bottom left hand

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.731
corner of our site.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.690
So the other part
here-- semi-colon!

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:12.630
Ah, man.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.200
Thanks guys.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.610
OK, so we got our card here.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.749
And I believe-- OK, now I know
the projector's messing me

00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:24.290
up right now.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.365
Projector's trying
to wreck my game.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.490
So I'm going scoot this
guy in-- or maybe he's not.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.930
Well, you can see that.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:29.190
OK, cool.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.010
He can see that.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.349
It was cut off during
the earlier demo.

00:14:33.349 --> 00:14:33.890
See that guy?

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.600
OK.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.666
What's up?

00:14:37.666 --> 00:14:39.280
Oh, OK, oh, shit.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.250
Well the science really
wrecking my game.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.870
All right, for you
sign people, here

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.800
look it's over there, OK,
or look at that projector.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.740
OK.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.790
So we got our card down there,
but I mentioned FlipBox, right?

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.498
I want to flip this
thing back and forth.

00:14:51.498 --> 00:14:53.750
Wanted to do some cool stuff.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.820
So we've been working-- myself
and some of the guys on X-tag's

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.210
been working on this project
called x-tag imports, which

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:06.020
actually let you import
x-tags using HTML imports.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.410
Sorry, this is the better URL.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.380
That's my port.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.255
That's the URL you want.
x-tag/x-tag-imports.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.550
So I'm going to import FlipBox.

00:15:17.719 --> 00:15:19.260
So
 x-tag-imports/x-tag-flipbox.html.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.580
Drop that guy.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.606
Basically like the same thing
that we did to the card itself.

00:15:33.606 --> 00:15:35.730
And the Google Map-- we
want to move the Google Map

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.860
into the Polymer UI card.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.760
Then we're going to
take that whole thing

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.885
and move it into a FlipBox.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.730
And yeah, the name x-flipbox
is different from the import,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.907
but that's by design.

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:51.490
OK, so now we just like scooted
this card up into the FlipBox,

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:51.989
right?

00:15:51.989 --> 00:15:52.910
That's kind of cool.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.300
And we're going to
write another Polymer UI

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.535
card for the back space.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:03.781
And we're just going to
give us a div description,

00:16:03.781 --> 00:16:04.780
and use another binding.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.560
And we're still using this data
object coming from Firebase.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.695
So I got my view and what
I want is its description.

00:16:16.057 --> 00:16:17.640
And maybe we'll drop
the name in there

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.806
as well so people know what
heck they're looking at.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.672
Mm, that looks good.

00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:27.536
It's looking good.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.640
Should I be binding to the
description on the map?

00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:39.750
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.550
No, no, yes.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.510
That's on purpose, yes.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.500
So, we see this guy,
what we're going to get

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.040
is-- we need to write a
little bit of Javascript

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.390
to tell FlipBox that
homie's gotta flip.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.860
So we're going to give
it a little bit of an ID.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.590
And we're going to say on-tap.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:04.270
Anytime anybody clicks on you, I
want you to do your flip thing.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.559
Down here in my
prototype, doflip.

00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:13.150
So what I'm doing
here is I'm actually

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.279
just referring to FlipBox.

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:17.650
I'm referring to it's ID
with this .$.flipbox.toggle.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:30.037
Oh, oh, wait, wait,
timeout, timeout.

00:17:30.037 --> 00:17:31.120
We also need a little CSS.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.860
There we go.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.590
So we got our little
card down there

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.120
with the name now showing.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.480
When I click on it, I get
this rad flipping effect.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.000
So you can see, oh,
cool, OK, so now

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.410
I know what the heck
Heron island is.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:50.910
Great.

00:17:57.385 --> 00:17:59.510
Oh, I don't-- oh, sorry,
I didn't want it to remain

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.790
on the back face.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.512
I wanted it to be
hidden on the back face.

00:18:03.512 --> 00:18:04.470
But, yes, you're right.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.136
If I wanted it to
remain in both places,

00:18:06.136 --> 00:18:08.770
I would put the
h3 on both cards.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.440
OK, so this is like the
world's most boring application

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.190
that I've ever built.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.820
It could do so much more.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.040
So the last thing
that I want to do

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.042
is I'm going to go
to customelements.io.

00:18:20.042 --> 00:18:22.500
And, by the way, I recommend
if you guys haven't been there

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.541
yet, please check it out
and play around with it,

00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.540
because there's so much
cool stuff on there.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.440
Like every time I go to
customelements.io, I'm like,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.480
I want to build an app.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.770
And I just start like
finding cool things on here,

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.100
and I'm like, yeah,
I want that one too,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.010
and that one and that one.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.990
And I just start bolting
them together, kind of

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.491
like a mad scientist.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:38.990
So there's an element
here that I've

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.540
got called Google Map
Street View panorama.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.250
I'm sorry that it has
the longest name ever.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.860
I'm probably going to rename it.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.100
So what it does is
it bundles up the API

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.564
for working in Street View.

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:55.094
So I'm just going
to import this guy.

00:18:55.094 --> 00:18:56.385
google-map-streetview-panorama.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.900
We're definitely going
to copy and paste that.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.520
.html, Google Maps-- OK, OK.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.770
And, up here, drop
in into a tag.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.290
Wrap that guy.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.395
And we got to make sure to
bind to the map property

00:19:19.395 --> 00:19:22.060
that we exposed earlier
from our Google Map

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.890
down here so that we
know that maps uploaded.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.240
And if we go back and
we look at Firebase,

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.170
there's all these things
in here like heading,

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.650
and panoid, and pitch.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.369
Things that we need to use
inside of this element.

00:19:36.369 --> 00:19:38.910
So, we're going to bind
panoid="viewspanoid="views[0]panoid".

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.740
And we'll do our heading.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.330
Wow, that was crazy.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.100
We'll do zoom-- I
mean, it was helpful,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.880
but crazy-- we'll do pitch.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.170
OK, heading, zoom,
pitch, panoid, map.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.610
Let's cross our fingers.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.270
Let's see what we get.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.250
Oh, shit.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.690
Oh, my God, we got a sea turtle!

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.526
OK.

00:20:12.526 --> 00:20:13.025
Yay.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.500
There was less rejoicing.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.000
OK.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.930
So, yeah, Heron Island, a
coral cay in the Great Barrier

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.310
Reef featuring sea turtles.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.180
Right?

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.734
So this is actual Street View.

00:20:24.734 --> 00:20:26.150
You can play around
with this guy.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.890
You can see that he's actually
got this other sea turtle.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:34.110
He's like stealthing on him
and about to steal his stuff.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.090
So there's a lot of
really cool stuff

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.190
that you can do just
wiring together elements.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.440
Like, I wrote-- we wrote-- this
is our only line of JavaScript

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.674
really, right?

00:20:44.674 --> 00:20:46.340
And the rest of this--
yeah, thank you--

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.110
and the rest of this
was just elements.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.700
We're describing things,
wiring them together.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.370
Building blocks, right?

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:58.350
OK, so thus concludes the
hair raising text editor

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.780
live coding portion of the talk.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.290
Now we move on to the designer.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.460
So we're going to build this
Map Voice Search thing using

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.410
the designer tool that you
guys have seen earlier.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:13.950
So let's see-- localhost:9000.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.115
All right, so this is
the current gen version

00:21:17.115 --> 00:21:17.990
of our designer tool.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.281
I'm going to make sure you
guys can see that real good.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.430
All right.

00:21:26.424 --> 00:21:28.340
Can you guys see that
good on both projectors?

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.184
OK, got it.

00:21:29.184 --> 00:21:30.030
All right.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.330
Current generation version
of the designer tool I'm

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.650
going to drop a scaffolding
element onto the page.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.000
I'm going to click this
little button to make it fit.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.180
So the scaffold element
gives me, really,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.450
like the bare bones of
a responsive website.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.640
I get a sidebar
that'll collapse for me

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.890
if the viewport is too small.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.414
Got a content area where I
can just drop things into.

00:21:51.414 --> 00:21:52.830
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.210
is I'm going to
grab a Google Map.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.430
My old friend, Google
Map, he's back.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.290
Again, this is the
same Google Map element

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.126
that we were just working with.

00:22:03.126 --> 00:22:05.000
If you look down here
in the bottom left hand

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.840
corner-- this guy
right here, Google Map?

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.260
Same dude, right?

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.760
But this time we just
dropped him onto the page.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.150
And what I want
to happen is when

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.630
I click these
buttons over here, I

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:22.175
want to change between roadmap
view and satellite view.

00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:23.675
So the way we're
going to do that is

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:25.216
we're going to grab
these guys, we're

00:22:25.216 --> 00:22:31.880
going to change their labels,
roadmap, and satellite,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.550
and maybe we'll give them
really cool markers, too.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:35.910
Those markers suck.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.290
There we go.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.920
All right, it's
looking nicer now.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.510
OK, so I've got two buttons
here, and i got a map,

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.969
but they're not talking yet.

00:22:44.969 --> 00:22:46.760
I want them to actually
talk to each other.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.439
So if you hop over to the
code view for the editor--

00:22:49.439 --> 00:22:50.980
I'll try to load
that up for you guys

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.271
so you can see it a bit better.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.920
So you got these
core items here.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.580
This is what I've been
dropping onto my canvas, right?

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.920
Roadmap, satellite, et cetera.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.560
And if you look, we're actually
inside of a Polymer element.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.900
The only thing that we're doing
inside of this designer tool

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.310
is we're just building
one big Polymer element.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.920
And so that means we can use
all the features in Polymer

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.750
in this code editor.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:24.980
So I can say, hey, on-tap,
I want you to show the road.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.300
On-tap, show the satellite.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.870
And then down here in the
prototype for our element,

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:44.740
we're just going to say
showRoad is a function,

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:56.120
showSet is a function, and we're
just going to tell the Google

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.470
Map element to set its
mapType = 'roadmap'.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:08.990
And click on satellite,
set satellite.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.970
A caller function?

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:18.480
That's what-- On-tap, do
I need a caller function?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.900
No, I don't.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.400
This guy right here.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.040
Yeah, it's a declarative
event binding,

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.530
so whatever I pass
it right here,

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.420
it's just going to trigger
that on my prototype anytime

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.590
someone actually
touches the element.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:38.520
So, if we save it,
we can actually

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.882
click this guy and
preview it over here.

00:24:40.882 --> 00:24:44.005
And now I click satellite,
I get satellite view

00:24:44.005 --> 00:24:45.740
and I get the real map view.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.195
Resize the page and I get
responsiveness for free.

00:24:49.195 --> 00:24:51.360
Which is pretty rad, right?

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.020
And If I take this
phone over here--

00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:05.560
So I got a phone, and what
I'm going to try to do

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.016
is preview this over here.

00:25:08.016 --> 00:25:12.210
So I'm going to take this
URL, open the DevTools

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:17.360
and say, Inspect Device.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.137
We're using port forwarding
to forward the port

00:25:20.137 --> 00:25:21.720
that this is running
on to our device.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.920
There we go.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.626
Man, it's like taking a nap.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.840
All right, let's see.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.112
Oh, we so don't have
port forwarding.

00:25:42.112 --> 00:25:43.320
That's cool, we can fix that.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.100
Oh, was there?

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.260
Yeah.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.950
Oh, shit, dude-- OK, thank you.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.850
Thanks man.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:09.670
Yes!

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.040
Oh, my God.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.910
I love all of you.

00:26:14.742 --> 00:26:16.110
All right, yes.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.720
Sweet.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.030
OK, this thing-- whoa, hey,
check it out-- so here's

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.990
my app running on the phone.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:27.230
And all I did was
open up the tab

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.490
that I was working with
over here on the device.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:35.270
And click on it, switch to
satellite mode, hit back,

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.740
roadmap.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.260
Cool, right?

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.940
OK, so now I'm using
this designer tool,

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.980
and actually like
constructing a mobile app.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.070
I'm not even writing
any code to do this.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.014
So, the last trick
that I want to do

00:26:48.014 --> 00:26:50.180
is I want to add voice
search to this whole process.

00:26:52.265 --> 00:26:54.015
So we're going to go
back to our designer.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.030
Enhance-- there we go.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.140
And I want to be able to
search for a location.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.190
So I'm going to drop
a field up in here.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.570
And we're going to just drop
that up in the top left corner.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.530
Because this is just
an HTML element,

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.180
I can actually change its style.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.540
So I can set its
background color to white.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.920
Now you can actually
see it up there.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.310
And I need to bind
that field to the map,

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.830
and I'm going to use another
element to do this for me.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.210
To do the heavy lifting.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.470
So I've got an element here
called Google Maps search.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.720
It's a non-visual element,
so I drop it on the screen.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.386
You're not going to
see anything update.

00:27:45.386 --> 00:27:47.260
But over here In the
Properties Inspector,

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.676
I've got these two
new properties.

00:27:48.676 --> 00:27:50.190
Map and query.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:54.000
If I combine those two,
the Google Map element,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.470
find its map property,
find the query

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:05.090
to the core input, which
is the input field up here.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.670
And then my Google
Map element, I'm

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.900
going to tell it to bind
to the search element

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.680
that I just dropped on the page.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.634
So latitude is Google
Map search latitude--

00:28:15.634 --> 00:28:16.550
wait, result.latitude.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.200
Longitude.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.790
Google Map search
result.longitude.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.520
And zoom is 18.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.770
And I'm going to also turn
off the UI for Google Maps,

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.770
because it's like,
getting in that way.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:40.410
So if I switch to satellite mode
now, and save it, preview it.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.570
So hop into satellite mode.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.480
And looks like-- check
out the Eiffel Tower.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.575
Whoosh.

00:28:47.575 --> 00:28:48.950
All right, so now
we're in Paris.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:52.310
We're looking at the Eiffel
Tower, which is beautiful.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.370
But you know, we're building
a mobile app, right?

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.775
And typing with
these gigantic hands,

00:28:56.775 --> 00:28:58.820
it's like impossible on a phone.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.650
So I would prefer if I could
use Voice Search to do this.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.775
So we're going to go
back to our editor.

00:29:05.775 --> 00:29:07.900
We're going to grab this
little speech-like element

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.880
and just drop it
into our input field.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.960
And we're going to go to our
core input and bind its value

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:24.900
to that speech_mic--
speech_mic.transcript.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.210
So now anytime I talk
into the microphone,

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.700
it goes to the core input.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.790
That gets piped to Google
Maps search, which gets

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.210
piped to the Google Map itself.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.920
OK?

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.780
You guys following that chain?

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.200
So I'm going to save this.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.940
Preview it.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.970
Should be able to look
at this on the phone.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.324
What?

00:29:51.324 --> 00:29:52.195
Oh, fuck.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.690
Don't steal my phone, OK?

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.960
You will all be confiscated
as you leave this event.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.770
Oh, my God, that's super funny.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:06.240
All right.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.880
Well, anyway, guys, the
microphone's here, so,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.560
hold-- OK.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.347
So, please, the microphone.

00:30:12.347 --> 00:30:14.430
Stop laughing, because you
got to be really quiet,

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.620
because we're going
to try to do this.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.205
Roman Colosseum.

00:30:26.926 --> 00:30:28.378
Yeah, what's up!

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.170
OK.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.280
Holy shit.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.510
Peter, I'm sorry I
swore so much on stage.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.160
OK, so, I wanted you guys
to get a feel for what

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.660
it is to actually work
with these elements.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.410
Like I don't want to
do a high-level talk.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:49.950
I want you guys to
actually see these things,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.574
because this is going
to be the future.

00:30:51.574 --> 00:30:54.170
This is going to be the
improved developer ergonomics

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.060
that I think a lot
of us are after.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.850
So, please go check out
the Polymer website.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.600
Hit us up on @Polymer
on the Twitters.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.410
You can find all
my information--

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:07.830
oh, wait-- find all the
information on this slide right

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:08.499
here.

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:10.040
Thank you guys so
much for coming out

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.720
and definitely stick
around for the QA.
