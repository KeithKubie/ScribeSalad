Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.980
And welcome to another rendition of WTR, a.k.a.:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.960
"Was That Real"?

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.440
This is where we look at TV shows that may be forgotten by some,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.840
but remembered by others for just how strange they were.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.860
With that said, when you hear the term "Stephen Spielberg-produced cartoon",

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.000
what's usually the first thing that pops into your mind?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.280
For most people, it's usually "Tiny Toons", "Animaniacs", "Pinky and the Brain", "Freakazoid",

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.940
or, if you wanna go really obscure, you might even think up "Histeria" or "Toonsylvania".

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.840
But there's one that even die-hard fans usually forget about, because-

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260
even mentioning the name usually results in a giant

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.580
[sound of extreme pain and frustration]

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.580
That of course is: "Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain".

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.020
[polyphonic sound of extreme pain and frustration]

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.180
See?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.120
Yup. This actually happened, folks.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.740
Not an episode.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.360
Not a standalone special.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.940
But an entire series that absolutely NOBODY demanded.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.580
Those aware of its existence often ask the same question:

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.920
"Why"?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.340
These two elements seem to have nothing in common, so why put them together?

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.220
Well, to understand, we gotta start at the very beginning.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.600
Pinky and the Brain, the two lab mice bent on world domination from "Animaniacs",

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.000
were doing pretty well with their own spin-off show entertaining kids,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.920
with the same adult edge that most Spielberg cartoons had.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.060
But the studio was concerned just having the two of them wasn't enough.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.040
You know, seeing how a show's success isn't based on the show's success,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.800
but rather on how many toys you can sell.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.440
So, in the middle of their successful run

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.160
the writers were encouraged to put in an extra character.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.000
Oh, not a side character like ones they had before,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.940
but one that would be a permanent addition to the main cast.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.500
Their response was a surreal slap in the face known as "Pinky and the Brain and Larry".

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.800
Without explaining to the audience what was going on,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.100
there was a weird occurrence where, out of nowhere, a character named Larry existed.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.120
And he was squeezed in to do literally nothing but declare himself as Larry.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.620
♪ Pinky and the Brain

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.120
And Larry!

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.680
♫ It's Pinky and the Brain

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.240
And Larry!

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.560
♫ Their twilight campaign is easy to explain.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.300
Larry will explain it!

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.680
Audiences laughed, even though they probably didn't fully get it,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.900
but the message was made clear to studios.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.080
"Pinky and the Brain" worked, because it was only Pinky and the Brain.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.900
And if it wasn't broken, it didn't need to be fixed.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.100
For a while, the stunt had worked, seeing how the pressure to include more characters faded away.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.580
But in 1998, the studio had a new idea.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.380
To combine Pinky and the Brain with a character from the since-then canceled show "Tiny Toons",

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.500
Elmyra Duff.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.940
Intended as a little girl version of Elmer Fudd,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.880
except instead of hunting animals to death, she loved 'em to death,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.800
somebody somewhere apparently really loved this character.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.780
Because, she showed up everywhere.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.480
They used her in dozens of "Tiny Toons" episodes,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.200
had her cameo in both the "Animaniacs" and the "Plucky Duck Show",

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.320
they even tried to give her a spin-off series based on her family that never got off the ground.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.760
While not a bad character, somebody clearly wanted to use her as much as possible.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.600
And here she was again, now being forced into a comedy duo that nobody wanted to do.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.620
And I mean:

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.600
NOBODY.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.800
I know what you're thinking: "Oooh, where's your proof that the writers of the show didn't want to work on it?"

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.460
Right. In the show's. Intro.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.680
Every week, the title song made it clear, that this was being done under protest.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.860
And they summed it up in one lyric:

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.820
♪ So Pinky and the Brain
Share a new domain

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.880
♫ It's what the network wants
Why bother to complain?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.700
There's even another lyric, hinting that the entire project is out of their control.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.560
♫ The Earth remains a goal
Some things they can't control

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.200
♫ the Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.920
♫ Brain...

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.360
You can't get any more obvious than that.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.020
Even the DVD-cover kinda looks a little half-assed.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.160
Eeeh, just draw it fast to see if we can get a few bucks outta this.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.360
So, after years of hearing about this show's existence and finally breaking down and buying the DVD,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.320
is it as bad as everybody has built it up to be?

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.680
Well... how do I put this...

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.880
I'm kinda more disappointed that... I'm not more disappointed.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.760
I mean, yes, it's a bad idea and clearly nobody wanted to do it.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.460
But it's still the same people who did "Animaniacs" and "Pinky and the Brain".

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.580
And for what it's worth, it shows.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.020
Not only is the animation still pretty damn good,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.220
but the voice actors are hilarious.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.060
And the writing -though in a scenario that's hard to be creative in- is still pretty freakin' funny.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.620
No joke. There's a lot of times where I laughed really hard while watching this.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.080
Maybe because they knew this wasn't such a hot idea, there's an extra dose of cynicism

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.460
that made it a bit more pessimistic than usual.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.280
The Brain: Happy ending? There are no happy endings.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.600
Life is an uninterrupted series of humiliating failures.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.460
Whatever.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.700
Pinky: I think Elmyra has seen "Titanic" a few hundred times too many.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.120
The Brain: Let's hope she never rents "A Clockwork Orange".

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.860
Almost like the attitude was:

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.100
"Screw it. If we're gonna be stuck with this, we might as well do the best damn job we can with it."

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.700
And that's evident throughout most of the episodes.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.620
Don't get me wrong: These are by no means masterpieces.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.880
In fact, a lot of the stories feel very rushed.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.620
With most of them being shorts, rather than taking up an entire episode, like the original show.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.880
But, truth be told, it does have some genuinely funny moments.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.020
Not only are some of the lines funny, but the delivery from the voice actors on some of these lines

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.360
that wouldn't get a laugh suddenly turn out hilarious because of how well they say it.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.340
Pinky: If Fred Flintstone knew the giant order of ribs was going to tip over his car, why did he order them every week?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.520
The Brain: I am truly alone.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.360
The Brain: Elmyra. Look at the wall.
Elmyra: Ooooh.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.940
The Brain: It's a magic doorway. Run and jump inside the light.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.780
Elmyra: I see it! I see it!

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.520
There's even kind of a dark humor to how much the show loves to insult Elmyra.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.380
She's just a little kid, but the world seems relentlessly cruel to her.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.920
Talent Show Host: Let's begin the tryouts for our talent show. Our first student is:

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.660
-Oh dear. Elmyra.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.440
[polyphonic sound of extreme pain and frustration]

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.420
But she is always too naive to realize it, so it never comes across as too mean-spirited.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.580
Shopkeep: Get away from my store, before I curse you.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.720
Some of the jokes are enjoyably strange, too.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.780
Like they hint in the opening that someone from the burnt-down lab is trying to hunt them down.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.080
And you wanna know who that somebody is?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.640
Christopher Walken!

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.160
Yeah! No reason why, it just so happens to be Christopher Walken.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.340
Kid: You gonna run him over with your car?

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.540
Walken: You're a very hostile little man.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.480
-Come see me in ten years. I might have a job for you.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.000
Kid: Can I blow up dumpsters?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.120
Walken: Yes. You can. Now go away. You depress me.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.500
It's beyond bizarre, but how can you not chuckle at that?

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.580
There's also a strange choice where they take a carnival owner who's voiced by Tim Curry,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.260
and just... make him look like Tim Curry.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.540
Yeah, they're just... making it look like Tim Curry owns an evil carnival now for some reason.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.380
Wonderful, just wonderful. Save that energy for the next show.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.820
Aaaahahahahah! Boy, I laugh a lot!

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.900
Sure, you're scratching your head, but you're kinda giggling at the idea, too.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.740
There are also some side characters that are surprisingly not bad.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.340
While we never see Elmyra's family, we do see her next-door neighbor,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.300
who she has a huge crush on, despite the fact that he's just a big dumb boy.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.900
In fact, he's even voiced by the same actress who did Nelson's voice, Nancy Cartwright.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.300
Boy: I'll give you fived bucks if you put a dead rat in the potato salad.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.800
-Where's those talkin' mice?

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.320
This gets especially strange, when he falls in love with the Brain disguised as a little girl named Patty-Anne,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.960
and it forms the most bizarre of love triangles.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.020
Elmyra even kind of resorts to kidnapping. It's pretty out there.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.980
There's still references to modern-day commentary, and there's even some VERY impressive writing

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.200
satirizing "The Raven", done entirely in rhyme!

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.420
And for a weekly cartoon show, these are some of the cleverest rhymes ever associated with the poem.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.580
The Brain: "You're demented", I asserted, "preternaturally perverted!",

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.900
-"I refuse to acquiesce you,
you spawn of incubi!"

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.740
Elmyra: "Potty mouth!", her voice came blaring, 
"cranky mouse is always swearing!"

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.500
The Brain: "No, I only was declaring
that your brain's a few cells shy!"

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.700
So, there seems to be a lot of good about it.
Does that technically make it a good show?

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.560
Well, depends on what you're lookin' for.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.480
While there are a ton of laughs, there's also a heavier lean towards smaller kids.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.060
With a lot more songs and child-friendly imagery.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.180
While the "Pinky and the Brain" show was never huge into stories,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.280
they were usually creative and were given time to grow.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.600
Here, the stories seem more like excuses for jokes.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.360
They often don't go anywhere and usually feel like they're more stopping rather than coming to a conclusion.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.960
There's also the problem that Pinky and the Brain worked,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.300
because it was an extreme genius teamed with an extreme moron.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.640
But now, there's two morons. And a lot of it is centered around Elmyra.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.460
So, Pinky almost seems pointless to the setup.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.640
On top of that, as funny as the character Elmyra can be,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.880
she was usually best in small doses.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.340
Remember, originally, she was the antagonist, the person you were trying to get away from.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.500
Pinky was still a protagonist, so you liked being ariound him.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.180
When you designed a character you purposely want to get away from

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.140
and then find out you had to put up with her for 24 minutes, it can be a little bit to stomach.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:16.600
[annoying crying noises]

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:24.300
The great irony in all of this is that the idea of a dumb little girl having a brilliant lab mouse trying to take over the world is actually kind of a clever show idea.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.000
It could potentially be funny if that's what it started off as, instead of what we did start off with.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.620
But, because it's already a combination of already-established ideas that weren't meant to be that,

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.120
it's not allowed to go as far as it could.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.780
So, most of the time we're stuck in Suburbia and not allowed to travel to many other places.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.580
Plus, as good as the elements are that I mentioned before,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.940
you can never really get around the fact that this feels like a forced sellout.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.680
Some ideas, even if they sound like that, are strong enough to escape it,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:59.820
but just saying the title "Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain", it- just sounds like they're grasping at straws.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.380
So if you're wondering whether or not this is actually worth checking out, I would say...

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.200
Yeah, kinda.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.780
Is it as good as the other shows? No.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.800
Does every episode have laughs? No.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.440
But for an obviously forced idea, I think it's worth sticking up for a bit.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.480
It's a testament that even though the people behind it HAD to do it,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.060
they still seemed to give it their all.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:25.120
It would've been so easy just to not try and let this crash and burn.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.480
But, judging by the acting, the writing and the animation,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.700
it's clear that they were at least TRYING to make it work.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.180
And the result, in my opinion, is definitely worth looking at.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.500
Not just as a valiant attempt, but for some reasonably funny moments.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.140
I know, it's weird. I'm defending "Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain".

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.640
And I'm not even defending it as anything that great.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.300
But with such an idea, it's kind of amazing they got this much out of it.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.180
In a strange way, it's something to be admired, even if it doesn't always work.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.040
It shows that even in the toughest situations, you can turn out something, when everybody expects nothing.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.840
In hindsight, if I was a writer or an actor or a producer, and I was offered a job like this,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.320
why wouldn't I wanna work with so many people who not only have great talent,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.140
but also have great reputations as fun people to work with.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.320
It's still being done at a time when cartoons were not expected to be that funny.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.760
At least not for kids!

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.920
So, if you're curious enough to say, "I don't care how bad it sounds,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.540
I just want some laughs from people I know are funny",

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.060
you just might find a little bit in the most unlikely of places.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.160
I mean, come on! It was a lot better than this crossover!

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.660
I'm the Nostalgia Critic! I remember it, so you don't have to!

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.240
Hey, Doug Walker here doing the charity shout-out, and this one's a real cool one.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.340
This is the Starkey Hearing Foundation.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.780
This is an organization that travels across the world to bring hearing aids to those who can't afford them.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.820
They use hearing as a vehicle to reflect caring and change in lives around the world.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.380
Disabling hearing loss affects more than 316 million people,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.420
including 32 million children world-wide.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.680
Yet so many don't have access to the hearing devices that can help them.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:50.420
This foundation has pledged to provide more that one million hearing aids to people in need this decade,

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.960
and currently gives more than 175.000 hearing aids annually.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:01.380
Many of these individuals are hearing for the first time, if you go to their YouTube channel, you can see them hearing for the first time.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.040
From sport stars to former presidents to many other celebrities,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:11.140
they're spreading the word on this wonderful cause to help people young and old finally listen to the beauty of the world.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.820
Check out their site or their YouTube channel, and hear the difference for yourself.
