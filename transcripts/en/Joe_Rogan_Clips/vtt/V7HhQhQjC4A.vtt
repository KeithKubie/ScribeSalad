1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.961
Well,
I've been,

2
00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:05.900
I've been really fascinated by the life that you guys live in Hawaii,
that you,

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.060
it's because I've always had this like idealized,

4
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:13.590
I like one day like move to the big island,
just chill on the side of a mountain,

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.990
stop fucking around,
fly out to do gigs,

6
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:20.220
but live out there where everything's just more relaxed,
you know?

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.230
Is it okay?
You know,

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.070
there's a lot going on and like the Big island is obviously big city.
Yeah.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.600
No one's been,
not the big island has,
it's sort of like la on the beach.
But yeah.

10
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.610
You know,
there's a couple things I think because it is a primal environment.

11
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:39.900
Like we live on Kauai,
which is PR,
pretty heavy duty as far as,
um,

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.720
it's quiet.
There's not a lot of distraction.

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.190
There's a really heavy duty nature.
And,
um,

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.950
and so I,
and I grew up in,
in St Thomas on the Virgin Islands,

15
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:56.670
so I was used to kind of being on an island.
But you're,

16
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.920
you're with yourself a lot.
So if you have things to do that are,

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.970
you know,
productive,
then it's perfect.
Um,

18
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.430
but what you have to always calibrate is like,
um,

19
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.640
the downtime or it like,

20
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.960
it's been raining off and on for like over a year on Hawaii.
Whoa.
Yeah.

21
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.200
So after a while it'd be like Seattle in that way where people,

22
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.530
it starts getting heavy,
but it's sunny too,
right?
It can be,

23
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.500
and it's the weirdest thing about the islands.
Yeah.

24
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.320
There's different climates on this island.

25
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.140
The Big island has desert.
Yes.

26
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.360
Tropical rain forest is a volcano is all this shit.
Every,

27
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.530
I think it has every,
uh,
weather,
um,
climate.

28
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:41.790
Except Arctic,

29
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.030
I believe at least Maui and the big island have sort of every type of climate.

30
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.280
It's crazy that just a little bit further down and it'll be different.

31
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.500
It'll be raining constantly.
Yeah,
exactly.

32
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.360
Or You just go to the other side and it's completely dry.

33
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:57.240
Or they have dwarf trees because they never see the sun,
but then they're,

34
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.770
you know,
200 feet in the places that it's sunny.
It's,

35
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.790
it's pretty trippy.

36
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.670
And you could drive around the whole thing and like how many hours does it take

37
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:08.160
you to drive on the Big Island?
Oh,
the big island,
I don't know,

38
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:11.760
like four hours or something like that thing.
I think so.
Maybe a little more.

39
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.300
Yeah.
You like the big island.
Interesting.
I like Maui.

40
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.590
You do every islands different.
They're all,
their personalities are different,

41
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.850
but I like it.
I mean we've been doing this for over 23 years.
When I met Laird,

42
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:26.940
he was big waves sort of come in winter.

43
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.810
So when low pressures bring snow,
like to the rest of the mainland,

44
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.130
that low pressure can also bring big waves.
And then my season was summer,

45
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:39.170
so we sort of went back and forth.
And that's a really good blend because you,

46
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.600
you can come to California and be like,
oh,
it's a busy world.

47
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:47.250
I can see a lot of people.
I can learn stuff,
I can do stuff.
Um,

48
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.460
and then I also makes you appreciate when you go back to Hawaii or like clean

49
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:56.820
air,
really clean water,
very beautiful place.
Um,

50
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.880
some of the ways,
the ideas about the,
they live there,
it's,

51
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.600
it's simple in a good way.
I don't mean that in any way.
Like a derogatory,

52
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.660
it's like they're not trying to,
they're not angling and trying to get somewhere.

53
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:11.650
It's like,
no,
we're living right.
Um,
but it can be also a very,

54
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.120
a really hard place,
really hard place.
So,

55
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.470
well I think,
you know,
and you're also talking about a warrior culture,
right?

56
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.460
Polynesians.
So you have like this,

57
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.140
this very intense love.
And uh,
you know,

58
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.110
when they talk about the Aloha spirit generosity,

59
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.800
they have like this and then they're very powerful people as well.

60
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.080
And sometimes if they're not living as they're in their most natural way that

61
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:45.370
they were supposed to,
and then you couple it with,
um,

62
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.580
you know,
there's not a ton of opportunities there.
It's hard to live there.

63
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:53.080
It's far away.
It's expensive.
Um,
and,
and sometimes,

64
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.610
you know,
it sounds Cliche,

65
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:59.590
but it's like we really do as human organisms either need to be busy,

66
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.560
so like,
okay,
working from sunup to sundown for our food,

67
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.630
which is how it used to be,
and then you're just so tired,

68
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:07.390
you just go to bed and it's pretty simple and deal.
Let's just survive it.

69
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.730
Or in the world that we live in now,
it's like,

70
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.860
how do we get people doing things that are kind of productive and you think,

71
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.440
oh,
I just would sit on the beach and look at the mountain.
And it's like,
yeah,

72
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:20.230
and after a while you get bored.
And if you're a warrior,

73
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.140
you're either gonna go,
you know,

74
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:27.820
do something with that that is good for you or you might not.

75
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.350
So,
um,
I think there's,
there's a lot,
a lot of that there.

76
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.950
I've learned a lot from that culture.
Um,
but I mean,

77
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.750
they're pretty powerful.
They're powerful group and,
uh,

78
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.510
you know,
it can go the other way pretty quick where it's,
you know,

79
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.550
if there's drugs and alcohol are beefing and like it's all that.

80
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.540
So it's,

81
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.110
that was really disturbing and found out how much drug abuse throughs on some of

82
00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:00.130
the islands.
Yeah.
Crystal Mathis especially sad.
Well,
it's,
it's,
again,

83
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:01.090
it goes back to board and like,

84
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:04.840
think about when your kids have to stay home for one day.
Yep.
You know,
it's just,

85
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.510
and now we have all these,
the internet and all this stuff.

86
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.380
So now you've got your sort of think,
oh,
the rest of the world has a perfect,

87
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:15.760
they're all busy and doing fabulous,
perfect things.
And um,

88
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.240
and it's hard.
Like you got to find people that you're like,
let's do something.

89
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.930
Let's go.
I mean,
can you train alone every single time now?

90
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.170
So you'd have to have a tribe of people that are like,

91
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.450
let's go do this activity.
And sometimes they don't.
It's not that easy.
Well,

92
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.360
so there's,
there's just say there's 70,000 people on the island.

93
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.400
Uncle [inaudible] is probably the least,
uh,
inhabited,
it's the oldest island,

94
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.600
so it has the most erosion,
largest beaches.
Um,

95
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.770
and that's where Larry grew up.
And it's a,
it's a,

96
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.700
it's a really nice,
the loose habitat on the islands,
isn't it?
Well,
yeah.

97
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:56.110
I mean it's not that I don't count it.
Yeah.
I mean,
of the bigger islands.
Yeah.

98
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:59.990
Malkai man,
you wouldn't,
you don't,
you don't mess with Malkai.
No,
no.
That's like,

99
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.040
that's like you,
you got to ask permission to go hang out over there.

100
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.450
Kinda.
Yeah.
It's cool though cause it's like if you know,
if they'd be like,
no,

101
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.290
you gotta,
you can't,
you're out.
You've got to go.
Really.
Totally.

102
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.420
So is great.
Is the people that live there,
you can't like move to Molokai?
Yeah.

103
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:21.020
I mean like you know,
I,
Eddie Vedder has a place on Molokai.
Yep.

104
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.760
And he has had for many,
many years,

105
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:27.530
but I think he probably asked if that was going to be cool.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

106
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.140
Interesting.
Yeah.
It's,
and it's beautiful.

107
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.150
You have some friends that just went hunting there.
Yeah.

108
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:36.230
Beautiful access to your,
yeah.
Yeah.

109
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:40.100
It's a beautiful place and the people are amazing,
but you,
you,
it's not like,
oh,

110
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:43.730
I'm just going to buy a house there or build a house.
There's no way.
No Way.

111
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.720
No Way.
Wow.
That's interesting that you,

112
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.910
all these different islands have their own like rules.
Well neo is a,

113
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:52.930
you can't even,
you can't go there.
You're not even allowed to go.
No,

114
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.130
I didn't even know that was an island.
Yeah,
it's off of [inaudible].
Yeah.

115
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.160
It's skipper that Jamie's big fan of.
Yeah.

116
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.260
He looks like he's been to he house now,
that it's all,

117
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:09.380
but like they probably have the,
you know,

118
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:14.330
the largest percentage of pure of Hawaiians there.
So it's cool.
I mean,

119
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.810
pretty good.
It's gotta be a great,
like I've found that like,

120
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.390
there's a big difference between the,
the,

121
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.600
the culture of say Maui versus the culture of Lanai.

122
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.720
Lanai is more island d to me,

123
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:30.170
whereas Maui seems like little bit gentrified.
We'll also,

124
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.420
the wind cause it Maui so windy,

125
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.720
it brought all the Europeans in the 80s to wind surf.

126
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.230
So you're also have not only mainland us and then Japanese,
um,

127
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.220
culture,
you know,

128
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:47.240
eighties now you're talking about Europeans for wind and wind surfing.

129
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.360
So it has a lot going on.
I think Maui,

130
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.470
it was almost like a surprise how quick it developed and they never had a chance

131
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:58.250
to get on top of it,
if that makes sense.
It does make sense.
Yeah.
