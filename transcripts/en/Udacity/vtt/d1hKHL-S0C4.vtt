00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.760
A set is an unordered
collection of distinct values.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.667
Like arrays and dictionaries, sets can
be initialized with literal syntax or

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.630
initializer syntax.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.550
Notice that if I add two identical
values to my set, the compiler

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.810
doesn't complain, but it doesn't add
that repeated item either because,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.090
of course, sets have no repeats.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.860
You'll find that inserting,
removing, and

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.740
counting items from sets is similar to
working with arrays and dictionaries.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.128
Here I'm adding all of the emoji
trees to the trees set.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:33.286
Oops, except a cactus isn't really
a tree, so let's remove that one.

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:38.190
And remember you can get to the emoji
keyboard by pressing Ctrl/Cmd+Spacebar.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.380
So we can remove the cactus
using the remove method.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.690
And as always if you want to know
how many items are in the set,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.500
you can use the count method which
is available to all collections.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.210
And that should be enough to
get you started with sets.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.310
You'll find they aren't used as
frequently as arrays and dictionaries.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.260
But for more on operations for
defining, manipulating, and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.950
comparing sets, follow the link
in the instructor's notes.
