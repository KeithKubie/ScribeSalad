&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.883
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.450
I'm delighted to be back here at the
Book Festival, one of the great--

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.116
I think the greatest Book
Festival in the country.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.586
&gt;&gt; I wanna say a few words about
my recent book, "Empire of Liberty"

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.946
which is the subtitle, a history
of the early republic 1789-1815.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.483
It's part of the larger
Oxford Project for the history

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.396
for the United States which
is nearing completion.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.690
About a dozen volumes
and I think there are

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.156
about 4-- maybe 4 or 5 left to do.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.776
But they've been commissioned
and that it should finally bring

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.790
to an end a project that
that began in the 1950s,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.833
more than a half century ago.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.753
My assignment was 1789-1815, which
is one of the most extraordinary--

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.663
if not the most extraordinary
period in American history.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.043
I think we should start

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.916
by recognizing how important the
American Revolution is to us.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.036
It is in my mind, the
most significant event

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400
in American history, bar none.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.043
It not only legally created the
United States, but it brought--

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.783
it infused our culture with
almost everything we believe,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.656
our highest aspirations,
our noblest ideals,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840
all of these came out
of the revolution.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.306
Our belief in equality, in
liberty, in the well being

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.086
of ordinary people,
in constitutionalism.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.606
So it's understandable why
we go back to this period.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.450
I have people asked me
at events like this,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.626
what would George Washington think
of the-- of our invasion of Iraq?

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.676
What would Thomas Jefferson
think of affirmative action?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.640
Now, I don't know of any other
culture where people would be asking

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.373
that about past historical figures.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.623
I'm sure David Cameron in Great
Britain is not asked, you know,

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.693
what would William Pitt think
about what you're doing?

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.513
I mean, it just not--
it's just not possible.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.416
So if something peculiar to us-- and
I think it has to do with the fact

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.756
that that event at the revolution
and those people who led it, are--

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.036
who created our political
institutions by which we still live.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.750
And also the values, the
ideals by which we still live.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.940
We go back to them
to refresh ourselves,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.690
to reaffirm what we are as a people.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.286
Now, this period that I'm dealing
within "Empire of Liberty"--

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.666
the term by the way
comes from Jefferson.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.983
That's the term he gave to
what he thought was the United

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.750
States project.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.040
The irony of course in
that is that a fifth

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.793
of the population were--
wasn't slaved.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.190
But the notion that the United
States was a special place begins

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.140
in this period.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.763
They're struggling to
identify themselves.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.186
After all, they were-- by and large,
the majority of the population,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.006
the overwhelming majority
was British.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.420
So, how do you become
Americans when you're British?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.330
This is why the issue of
impressment, the seize--

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.743
the British seizing of American
sailors and the ambiguity

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.276
of citizenship was so
important to this period.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.910
James Madison, as president,
said the reason--

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.793
the principal reason we have to
go to war in the war of 1812 is

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.386
because of this impressment.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.633
It goes to the heart
of American identity.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.360
We didn't even know
what to call ourselves.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.533
The term Columbia was tried
in 1792 at the [inaudible]

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.883
of the-- of Columbus' discovery.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.460
They thought, "Well, maybe
Columbia would be a good name."

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.006
But that didn't stick,
although it sounded good

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.073
because the syllables could be
fitted into a lot of British songs,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.933
you know Britannia Columbia
and so it so very attractive.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.003
Samuel Mitchill who is a senator
from New York suggested Fredonia.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.876
We are the Fredonians.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.210
[Laughter] Well, that didn't
last either and we were stuck

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.780
with Americans, with the [inaudible]
a title that really belongs

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.240
to people of both hemispheres.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.973
Why are we the Americans--

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.486
the Canadians have never
forgiven us for taking that title.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.286
[Laughter] So that was an issue
running through the whole period.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.500
What kind of people are we.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.916
The government was contested
between the Hamiltonians

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.473
who wanted a European-type
state, a fiscal military state

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.046
that could take on the European
states eventually on their own terms

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.026
with the standing army, a big navy,
and a bureaucracy that was equal

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.453
to any of the Europeans versus the
Jeffersonians, the republicans,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.940
the democratic republicans
followers of Jefferson

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.273
who wanted a minimal state and
wanted to use economic sanctions

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.036
as an alternative to the
use of military force.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.143
This was the grand embargo
that we were involved

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.383
in that Jefferson promoted in 1807.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.473
This was what we're
still struggling with.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.393
How do you use economic sanctions
as an alternative to military force

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.100
because the use of military
force is so, so violent,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.796
so bloody anything must be tried,
that's what Jefferson's rationale.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.526
It's a period of enormous
controversy.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.746
We came as close to a civil war
in 1798 as we ever have except

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.710
for the actual Civil War in
the middle of 19th century.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.320
So that-- and people were frightened
that the French were going to invade

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.486
and that a Francophile
president or potential president,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.420
Jefferson was leading a kind of
fifth column of Francophiles,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.296
French supporters who
would create a--

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.633
another French puppet in the United
States that was the federalist fear.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.740
So, it was a tremendously--
tumultuous period.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.810
The population was still
growing, doubling every 20 years,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.096
the fastest-growing population
in the entire Western world.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.540
So, it's-- and this
population is on the move.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.306
It's a period of extraordinary
democratization.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.806
So much popularization
democratization

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.420
that at left those
founders who lived

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.800
into the 19th century
deeply disillusion

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.346
with what they have brought.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.743
It was a-- as you know a
creative period are institutions

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.350
that we still live by, the
Congress, the Presidency,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.866
the Supreme Court were all
created in this period.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.286
It was a period of great
instability, violence,

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.150
city mobs, all kinds of homicide.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.640
Homicide rates skyrocket in
New York City in the 1790s.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.576
It was a period of heavy drinking.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.610
Alcohol became-- we became the
highest drinkers in the world,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.836
5 gallons per person which
we've never attained since

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.233
and was the highest in the world

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.700
with the possible exception
of Scotland.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.100
[Laughter] These are all signs
of instability in the society.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.470
People were simply influx,
moving at enormous rates,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.243
migrating to the west,
more territory settled

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.390
in the single generation
following a revolution then

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.536
in the entire 150 years
of the colonial period.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.036
So people were already
reaching the Mississippi

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.030
in a relatively short
period of time.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.410
It was a period were
college rioting which were--

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.366
we think the 1960s were bad.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.163
There's nothing comparable to what
happened between 1798 and 1808.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.840
Colleges up and down the east coast
rioted, students were expelled,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.176
half the student body of
colleges like Williams

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.913
or Harvard, were expelled.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.250
The colleges weren't large,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.983
be 120 but 60 would be
expelled, enormous instability.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.286
Princeton, the National Hall
was burned to the ground

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.443
by student presumably,
no one knows for sure.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.830
This was a period of great
instability in all areas.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.760
Religion transformed.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.433
The old European religions,
the Anglican Church,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.730
the congregations were surpassed
by these new evangelical religions

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.856
of Methodist and Baptist.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:35.690
Growing by leaps and bounds so
that by 1810, the Methodist who--

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.570
there were no Methodist
in America or in 1760.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.850
By 1810, it was the largest
religious group in all of America

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.650
and growing even more rapidly.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.383
Everywhere, there was a
popularization from art, literature.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.470
John Marshall wrote a 5-volume
biography of George Washington

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.383
which you expected to
make some money from

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.370
and that people would read.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:05.703
Nobody bought it.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.836
They bought a Parson Weems'
short little biography

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.970
which emphasized Washington's youth.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.336
Marshall summed up
Washington's youth in one page.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:14.716
In 5 volumes, he's devoted
one page and nobody wanted

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.350
to read those 5 volumes,
instead they read Parson Weems

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.883
which is still the fastest selling,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.966
most popular biography
of Washington ever made.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.290
He-- Weems is the one who
made up the cherry tree myth.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.150
That's what people
wanted to read about.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.843
They wanted to read about
this young Washington.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.390
Now, the generation was
filled with illusions,

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.323
so many illusions they thought
political parties where awful

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.443
that they should they
should disappear.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:47.310
There should be no
political parties.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.976
Faction was bad.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:51.443
Nonetheless, political
parties emerged.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.510
They wanted to do well by
the Indians in the Northwest.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.390
&gt;&gt; Henry Knox's letters
to Washington

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.456
about how we should
treat the Indians,

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.046
even a modern archeologist
would endorse.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.283
But nonetheless, the popular
movement was so great,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.050
it just overwhelmed all of
these plans laid in the capital

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.403
in Philadelphia that knocks
head for treating the Indians

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.050
in a humane and civilized manner.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.726
There were just too much
popular movement in every area.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.213
The-- and of course the biggest
illusion of all was slavery.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:28.400
All the founders, not a single
one, defended the institution.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.450
It was so-- such a violation of
the meaning of the revolution

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.896
that nobody could defend it.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.563
But they all thought that
slavery would die naturally,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.016
that with the ending of
the slave trade in 1808

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.423
that slavery would simply disappear,
overwhelmed by free labor.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:48.896
Now, they could not
have been more wrong.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.436
Despite the freeing of tens of
thousands of slaves in the north--

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.053
the north was not in
consequential in the north,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:58.503
14 percent of the population
of New York was in slave.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.243
Nonetheless by 1804,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.043
all the northern states had set
slavery on road to elimination.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.176
But in the South, it remained
and grew, despite the dreams,

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.810
the illusions of the founders.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.000
Now, all of them who lived into
the 19th century died this illusion

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.806
with what they have brought.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.340
The society was much
more democratic,

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.673
much more popular than
they ever expected.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.290
Now, before we become arrogant

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:31.496
and condescending towards
this generation of founders

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:35.693
for their illusions, we
should realize that we live

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.180
with illusions too, only we
just don't know what they are.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.323
Every society-- every generation
I think has its own illusions.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.776
In fact, I think history is a
record of exploded illusions.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.246
But this leads in my
mind to the lesion--

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.310
the major lesson of
history which is humility.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.490
Humility is the consequence
of realizing

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.620
that you may not have all the
answers to what is happening

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:04.703
and that future generations
will look back at us

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.583
and say, "What were they doing?"

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.456
Thomas Jefferson for example thought
that in-- as late as 1821 he said,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.540
there's not a young man now
alive who won't die a unitarian."

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.046
I mean, how wrong can he be.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.240
[Laughter] And this is
one of the smartest men

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.786
of that whole generation.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.053
So, we should not be
cocky about what we know

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.500
and we should be much more
humble in our approach to the--

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.613
to ourselves and to the past.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.456
I wanna stop there because
I wanna have questions.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.670
We only have about 15 minutes to go.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.770
We got a very tight, tight program
here because Mrs. Bush is coming

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.906
on board right away and then there's
a whole succession of speakers.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:53.346
So, if we can open
it up to questions,

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.953
I'll be happy to answer them.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.520
[ Pause ]

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.616
&gt;&gt; I guess there are
microphones here.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.150
Go ahead sir.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.743
&gt;&gt; After reading your book,
I have a question about US

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.956
and British relations
after the war of 1812.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.303
Even during the Civil War,

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.433
US relations with Britain were
somewhat rocky because the British,

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:20.390
at least some British
favored the south.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.920
But then by World War 1, we were
their allies, so could you comment

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.193
on how the special
relationship developed?

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:28.643
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a big--
I mean, first of all,

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.340
it's out of my period
as we-- we say.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.506
But, there's no doubt that
Britain was still a principle enemy

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.576
through the 19th century.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.150
I mean, there were people in
America who were anglophiles but by

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.920
and large, we regarded
Britain as an enemy.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.620
It's not until the
1890s-- you're quite right.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.093
The Civil War, we are quite worried

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.493
about Britain recognizing
the confederacy.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.526
And Adams-- Charles Francis
Adams as the ambassador to--

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:58.956
or minister I should say to
Great Britain, headed that off.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.723
But, their special relationship
did not develop until the 1890.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.273
John Hay as secretary of state--
and it come out of a whole new sense

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:17.170
of anglophilia that does prepare the
way for the alliance in World War 1.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:24.416
But it's a-- there are books on this
and it's a very interesting story.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.376
But the special relationship
is really a late 19th

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.743
century development.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.410
Yes sir?

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:31.986
&gt;&gt; Yes, I know the French
monarchy supported us

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.500
in the war with Britain.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.556
Can you say something
about the relationship

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.176
between the United States
new government policy

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.300
and France during the
French Revolution?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:45.866
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a very interesting--
very important question.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.266
Initially, of course we welcomed--

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.110
everybody welcomed the French
Revolution because we saw it

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.356
as a carbon copy of
our own which it was.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:57.140
Lafayette who was involved
in the early stages

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.653
of the French Revolution, he wanted
simply to reform the monarchy.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:04.396
He didn't wanna eliminate
the king and he later ended

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.383
up as the victim fleeing
the Jacobins in France.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.726
But initially, he was
supportive and he sent

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.546
to Washington the key
to the Bastille.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.463
The Bastille in the July 14th
takeover which is initial--

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:23.660
is the initial event in
the French Revolution.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.800
He sends the key to Washington as
a symbol of American contribution

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.906
to the French Revolution.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.086
It-- well our revolution, our
republican revolution came first

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.593
and the French liberal saw that.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.406
That key still stands or it's
hanging on the wall in Mount Vernon

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:45.873
and many of you may
have seen it there.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:47.700
Now, as soon as the French
Revolution turned violent

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.046
and especially after
the Jacobins took over,

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.526
the American society was
deeply split along party lines.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.476
The federalist supported
England, and Jefferson

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:02.736
and his followers supported
France and it contributed

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.490
to the party split
in the United States.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:08.046
Jefferson never really lost his
feeling for France and he felt

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.826
that the American Revolution's
future as a republican state

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.123
in a monarchical world
depended upon the success

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.246
of the French Revolution.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.933
So he made extraordinary statements
and supported the French Revolution.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.493
When his colleague and successor in
Paris wrote back to him and said,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:31.870
"Mr. Jefferson, some of your
formal friends are losing the heads

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.876
in the guillotine."

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.476
Jefferson's response
is quite extraordinary.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.276
He says, "Well, so be it.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.493
If only an Adam and
Eve were left alive

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.763
and left free, that would be okay."

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.140
This led the Irish journalist,
Conor Cruise O'Brien to say

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.173
that Thomas Jefferson was the
Pot Polof the 18th century.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.296
Now, Jefferson never really
would have implemented that.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:01.690
But, he-- his support for
the revolution was deep

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.023
and it split the society and
made the federalists feel

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:08.383
as if they have a fifth
column in the amidst.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.230
And that France might
invade the United States

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:13.720
as it was invading every
other state in Europe

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.953
and creating a French puppet, that's
what created the crisis of 1798.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.270
Yes sir.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.820
&gt;&gt; Is there anything in the
revolutionary and constitutional era

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.453
that could illuminate such
current political phenomena

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:31.950
as the [inaudible] movement,
the tea party movement,

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.076
that deep mistrust of
government and law?

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.543
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:38.973
One thing you should realize
is that the populars--

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.046
popular politics is not new.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.566
Let me give one example from 1808.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.023
Simon Snyder, [inaudible]
governor of Pennsylvania.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.583
Simon Snyder was a son
of a poor mechanic.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.100
He was self-educated, had no formal
education but a very smart guy.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.913
But lacking all of the cultural
attributes of a Princeton graduate

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.303
or a Harvard graduate, and his--

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.383
there was no federalist party
by 1808 in Pennsylvania.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.476
The established Republican Party--

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:10.483
Jeffersonian Republican
Party was appalled

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.403
at Snyder's attempted candidacy
and it split the Republican Party.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:18.553
And the-- Thomas McKean who was the
former chief justice and himself,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.300
a governor-- a former governor
of Pennsylvania called--

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.006
he and his followers
called Snyder a clodhopper

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:29.836
and he had a followers
of clodhoppers.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.950
Snyder took that term
and said, "Wow,

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.906
what's better than being
a clodhopper in a society

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:38.533
of clodhoppers," and he rode
to victory with that slogan.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.360
That what's popular politics
that appalled many people.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.600
Daniel Tompkins in New
York, a Columbia Graduate,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.180
a wealthy lawyer, he knew better.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:51.973
If he's gonna win the governorship
of New York, he had to be what?

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.090
A farmer's boy and he used
that as his campaign slogan.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.403
Not that he graduated from Columbia

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.740
and was a wealthy New
York attorney, no.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.480
That would be a kiss of death.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.080
So, he's a farmer's boy.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:06.563
So you have popular politics of a
sort that is being expressed today.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.730
I think in the Tea Party
Movement and Christine O' Donnell

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.980
and Sarah Palin, there's a class
dimension to this resentment

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:19.533
and its very similar to
what went on with what--

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.813
with American politics in the north

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.376
in the early decades
of the 19th century.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.550
Yes sir.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:29.616
&gt;&gt; Yes, good morning professor.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.043
I was wondering to what extent
did religious aspects have

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.350
on driving revolution, the idea of
America as the city on the hill,

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.630
the new Jerusalem driving out
European control and influence?

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.650
&gt;&gt; Right. Well, I think there is a--

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:46.213
certainly an evangelical puritan
emphasis during the revolution

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.260
but it's a secular as well.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.150
This notion that we were the last
best hope as Lincoln said that comes

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.636
out of the revolution, that we
were the forerunners of revolution

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.196
and that it would spread.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.326
That's why they welcomed the France
Revolution, that this democratic

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:06.423
or revolutionary republican
revolution would spread

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.510
throughout Europe.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.843
And so we supported all

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.976
of the revolutionary efforts
throughout the 19th century

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.576
with one exception.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.176
All the revolutions
starting with the Greek,

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.013
that Latin American Revolutions,
the revolutions of 1848, 1870,

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.770
the French-- Third French
Republic, all of these,

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:25.553
we were the first state in the
world to recognize the new regimes.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.180
Most of-- all of which failed except
for the Third French Republic.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.243
There was one exception of course,
it's the Haitian Revolution,

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.530
we didn't recognized
that new a black state

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:39.953
until the Lincoln's administration.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:42.413
But otherwise, we supported
all revolutions much

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.373
to the chagrin of conservatives.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:47.390
It's more than just
a religious feeling.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.090
It's deeply embedded in our history.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.853
And when President Bush went into
Iraq with some understanding that--

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.270
by some people at least, that
we are bringing democracy

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.936
to the Middle East.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.003
He was responding or echoing
this kind of tradition

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.246
which is deeply rooted
in our history.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.046
Now, we didn't invade other states

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:11.920
but we supported them
diplomatically.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.513
And individuals actually
went off and fought,

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.700
for example in the Greek Rebellion
against the Ottomans in 1820.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.440
So that's been a deeply
rooted part of our heritage.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.940
Yes sir.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.873
&gt;&gt; Can you comment on the role
of the Louisiana Purchase.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.623
Did it add to the sense of people
becoming Americans or did it add

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.256
to the turmoil that you
mentioned in that area?

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.190
&gt;&gt; The question was on
the Louisiana Purchase.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.656
It was of course Jefferson's
wildest dream, getting--

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:41.943
doubling the size of
the United States.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.776
And it was widely supported.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:46.950
A lot of federalists, however,
in New England were very upset

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.210
because they realized that this
would just create more Jeffersonian

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.810
Republicans, all those states,

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.410
western states were thoroughly
Jeffersonian Republican.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.813
So, there were some mixed feelings.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.946
Hamilton supported, however,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.863
although gave no credit
whatsoever to Jefferson.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.653
So, I don't think it added
to American identity.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.406
What was said I supposed about
it is that we didn't learn much

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.673
by absorbing these
multicultural, multiracial area.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:23.310
New Orleans was a very
different place from the rest

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.486
of the United States with Spanish,
French, black, free blacks,

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.693
mixed races, and an understanding
of mixed-- racial mixture.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.230
And the American people
didn't learn much from that.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.193
It-- we had to wait
to an understanding

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.353
of diversity to our own time.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.576
So, the Louisiana Purchase was
not something that brought--

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.786
especially brought us together.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.330
Yes sir.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:51.930
&gt;&gt; I'm fascinated by the
thought that once upon a time,

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.663
we thought we could live
without political parties.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.050
How is it that we came to become
partisan and to think of ourselves

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.803
as federalist or republicans?

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:06.403
&gt;&gt; Right. Well, the dream-- parties
by the term is partisan, partial,

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:07.850
you're not thinking of the
total good and so parties

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.416
for 18th century English
speakers were always considered

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.300
to be a sign of disease
in the state.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.233
There's something wrong, if you
can't promote the consensus.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.586
And to some extent, we've
always believed that.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.756
We've never really been very keen on
political parties despite the fact

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.230
that we have them [inaudible].

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.423
I mean why would we have primaries?

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.570
Why would we have open primaries?

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:33.846
I mean, we've always had movements

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.046
to somehow transcend
parties beginning

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:38.513
with the liberal republicans in
the 1870s, the Mugwump movement

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.166
of the 1880s and then the 1890s

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.600
and 1900 progressive reforms
were designed to bypass parties.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:49.740
When you-- you know,
there's no European party

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.873
that would allow the nomination of
candidates to go out to the people

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:57.613
in general and especially allowing
in open primaries opponents.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.160
So the parties had given
up control of their--

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.286
of the most important
function of a party which is

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.180
to nominate its candidates.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:08.780
No European party puts up with that.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:10.780
So parties have always been suspect.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:12.660
Now nonetheless, they
grew and we finally--

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.080
it wasn't until the 1830s and '40s,
a new generation that finally came

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.786
to terms with party
as a normal thing.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.053
The founders never did.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.253
They always felt that parties
should be-- should go away.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:33.276
Jefferson assumed that his
Republican Party was a temporary

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.630
party and that as soon as the
federalist disappeared, he--

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.216
there were monarchist in his mind.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.613
And as soon as they disappeared,
party government would disappear.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:42.913
And that was the sense that people
had in Monroe's administration.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.433
Air of good feelings,
we've transcended parties.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.043
The federalists have been
wiped out, discredited

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.796
and were entering a new era.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.730
But it was not-- not to be.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.240
Yes sir.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:57.563
&gt;&gt; My question is sorta
along the same lines.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:24:59.976
I'm curious as to your feelings

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.976
and what your thoughts are
regarding the Jackson party machine

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:10.363
and as it relates to sorta
undermining the John Quincy Adams

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.710
administration [inaudible].

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:14.680
&gt;&gt; Well, although I'm not an
expert on the Jackson era.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.006
I think it's open to a
revisionist interpretation.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.486
I think Jackson and his
administration are attempting

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.023
to bring back some
monarchical elements

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.603
that the federalists had
attempted to build in the 1790s.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.336
As you know, Jefferson came
into power as president in 1800

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.570
and he eliminated almost
everything that the--

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.086
that the federalist had
built up, including the bank.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.826
He allows the bank charter--

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.446
or the republicans allow the
blank-- bank charter to lapse.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.006
So, all of the efforts
to build a quasi--

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.676
see Hamilton's program
is quasi-monarchical.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:25:59.540
He will use his patronage--
within a republican framework,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.200
he uses patronage.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.266
He wants to build a standing army.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.400
He is trying to build a bureaucracy.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.200
He is trying to create a kind of
surrogate monarchical substance

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.626
within a republican
framework, because he believes

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.430
that that's the only thing that
can hold the sprawling United

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.436
States together.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:25.103
Now, it turns out that Jefferson
repudiates all of these.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.570
Jackson comes along
and what does he do?

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.290
He builds patronage, all
within a democratic framework.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.190
But he institutes patronage,
the spoil system.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:36.686
He builds a huge bureaucracy
relative to what Jefferson wanted

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.380
and he is not opposed to a
strong army and military force.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.706
So, I think we could
see Jackson trying to--

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.440
and of course, he makes the
presidency a quasi-monarchical

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.586
as Washington had in the 1790s.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:56.966
So, I think we can see that-- and
of course the president remains

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.190
as many people thought he was at
the beginning, an elected monarch.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.570
Our president, article 2
is extraordinarily strong--

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.203
creates an extraordinarily
strong executive office.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.783
And so I think we are open to a
revisionist of the Jacksonian era.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.383
Thank you very much.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.330
[ Applause ]

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:22.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
