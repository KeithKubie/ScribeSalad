00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.350
FRANK BENTLEY: Mobile phones have
dramatically changed how we

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.510
communicate with others and how we
access information in our daily lives.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.300
Mobile phones are truly
pervasive devices.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.140
And mobile experiences must work in the
context of our daily lives, not

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.160
just at a desk.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.140
In this class, we've developed a process
for creating new apps that fit

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.610
into people's lives.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.260
This process involves repeatedly meeting
with users and iteratively

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.370
testing new solutions built extremely
rapidly in their daily lives.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.714
DR. ED BARRETT: Over the next 12 weeks,
we'll teach you how to create

00:00:32.714 --> 00:00:34.930
and present large-scale app
development projects.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.980
FRANK BENTLEY: I'm Frank Bentley, a
Principal Scientist at Yahoo Labs.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.640
The methods that we teach in this class
are what we apply every day here

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.120
to create the future of mobile.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.790
DR. ED BARRETT: I'm Ed Barrett,
senior lecturer in Comparative

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.450
Media Studies at MIT.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.620
This class will give you practical
experience useful for your career.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.560
FRANK BENTLEY: At the end of this class,
you will have experience in

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.340
ethnographic research, design,
programming, and field evaluation of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.630
new applications.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.050
And we'll have taken your idea from a
domain of interest to a successful

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.200
working app suitable
for public release.
