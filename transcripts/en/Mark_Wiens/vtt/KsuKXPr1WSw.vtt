00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.900
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an awesome day.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.270
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Mexico City.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.110
We're staying in the Roma
Norte district of Mexico City,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.760
and this is an upscale, very
trendy area of this city.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.180
But what I love about it is that

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.860
you'll just be walking down the street,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.890
and you will find an abundance
of Mexican street food,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.460
almost on every single corner.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.350
So the plan for today is
we're just gonna walk around

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.490
the neighborhood that we're staying in.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.910
We're gonna go on a
Mexican street food tour.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.810
I'm not even totally sure
what exactly we're gonna eat,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.610
but we're gonna find the
places that are popular,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.170
and I'm gonna share it all
with you in this video,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.003
and I'm hungry.

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.900
(relaxing dubstep)

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.200
We walked over to one of the
main roads in Roma Norte,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.910
and this road is very popular
because a lot of people,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.300
I think more people work on this street

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.180
and there's a metro station very close by,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.650
so there's quite a few street
food stalls, it's busy.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.200
There's a place that I wanna start with,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.060
which is just up the road,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.401
which serves this amazing chicken soup.

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:56.817
Hola, buenos días!

00:00:56.817 --> 00:01:00.067
(converses in Spanish)

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:16.609
(speaks Spanish)
Sí, por favor.

00:01:19.965 --> 00:01:23.215
(converses in Spanish)

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.480
Gracias.
(speaks Spanish)

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.710
This is a stall that Ying
and I have already eaten at

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.470
a couple of times when we just
need something for takeaway.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.740
They serve chicken soup,
it's called Caldo de Gallina.

00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:45.210
He always has a hot pot of
just simmering chicken soup,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.390
and we're here in the morning,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.610
so it's very fresh, the pot is full.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.220
You can see the herbs,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.150
you can see the onions floating around

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.170
in that swimming pool
full of chicken broth.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.190
You can order the chicken breast,

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.680
you can order the chicken leg,
you can order the drumstick,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.310
you can order all the different types.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.660
You can order chicken feet.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.240
I decided to go for the
pierna, which is the drumstick.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.570
- Yam, yam, malo.

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:17.710
- You can also get your
soup with either rice

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.570
or with garmat garbanzo, and
this time I got garbanzo.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.100
I've had rice before, and it's good,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.980
but look at that rich chicken stock.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.520
One of the highlights of eating soup

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.840
is that you got all the condiments,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.930
the onions, the lime, the chili,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.590
and the best thing about eating soup

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.710
is that you get to doctor it up,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.440
you get to season it as you like.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.040
Oh, let me just taste the
chicken broth as is first.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.800
It's really like condensed chicken.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.240
It's a little bit oily, it's very salty.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.360
You can taste the sweet onions in there.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.090
It's delicious from the start.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.630
But yeah, really, the highlight for me

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.790
is adding all the seasoning.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.380
There's some roasted chili
flakes, which is always awesome,

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.790
and then you gotta give
it a squeeze of lime.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.410
Let me go ahead and break
into that chicken now.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.580
Oh, look how soft and
tender that chicken is.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.650
Oh yeah, mm!

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.410
The chicken has been boiled for so long,

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.160
it's not mushy, but it's so soft.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.260
The guy sitting next to me,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.710
I saw a trick that he just
pulled that I gotta copy.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.750
You grab a tortilla,

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.080
and then you go in for some of this salsa.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.670
Right into the center of the tortilla,

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.930
and then you wrap it up.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.770
Now you've got a tortilla
with salsa in the center,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.950
and you can kinda alternate,

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.710
you can kinda dip it, you
can take bites of soup,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.010
you can eat your tortilla.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.560
Chase that with a tortilla.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.260
Oh!

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.610
Oh, that salsa's amazing, mm!

00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:00.190
That's a very cool trick right there.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.890
Oh, that goes so well together.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.900
They just finished chopping
up the habanero and onions.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.570
Oh, this is the seasoning I really will,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.680
oh you can just smell that.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.630
It goes up your nose, just smelling it.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.570
This is what I need.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.353
Oh yeah.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.090
Oh that's good, that bumps up the heat,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.480
that bumps up the flavor.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.570
You've got that sour-ish
habanero flavor to it,

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.320
those onions, those crunchy onions.

00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:40.250
(conversing in Spanish)

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.180
Aw, delicious way to start the day!

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.325
Okay, we're movin' on.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:46.242
(relaxing dubstep)

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.700
Ying and Micah went to go
take their morning naps,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.740
so I'm on my own for a little while.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.740
I'm walking right past the
Plaza de Río de Janeiro

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.190
with Michelangelo's David
statue in the middle.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.050
This is one of the
landmarks of Colonial Roma,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.529
and I'm on my way to go check
out some more street food.

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.446
(relaxing dubstep)

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.860
This is a little supermarket.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.700
They have all sorts of things,
especially import things.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.100
Sometimes we bought some groceries there,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.160
but right on the outside of
the supermarket on the sidewalk

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.376
is a place that I've been wanting to try.

00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:30.709
(conversing in Spanish)

00:05:43.027 --> 00:05:45.510
If you come right at
lunchtime, they are packed,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.480
there's a crowd just
standing around this corner.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.880
They make a number of different
things including tlacoyos.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.410
They're using all-blue corn.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.670
They have about, at least, a
dozen different ingredients

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.220
with toppings that you can add.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.030
I'm not totally sure what I'm
getting, but we'll find out.

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:07.197
(conversing in Spanish)

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.032
(conversing in Spanish)

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.950
It's absolutely beautiful
how they make it.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.570
It's so colorful.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.460
So first, yeah, they fry
that masa with the blue corn,

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.060
and they really let it sizzle.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.640
You can see it kinda
char on both on sides.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.080
And then she fried up those flowers;

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.520
I ordered it with those flowers.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.080
There's beans stuffed in the inside.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.280
Oh, it's just overflowing
with ingredients.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.770
That is absolutely gorgeous.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.820
It's like a trough.

00:07:03.314 --> 00:07:05.390
Oh, oh wow!

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.010
That's so good!

00:07:09.906 --> 00:07:14.340
Oh, the blue corn, there are
beans stuffed into that base.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.240
That's incredible!

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.955
So awesomely good.

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:24.872
(relaxing dubstep)

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:32.282
(conversing in Spanish)

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.570
Next, I ordered a quesadilla with cheese,

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.420
and again, they use that blue
corn, it's just beautiful.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.620
It gives it another
beautiful, colorful notch.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.590
It has a bit of a different taste

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.700
from regular white-colored corn as well.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.980
The entire thing is actually squishy

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.560
because there's so much cheese in there.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.820
And paired with that salsa
verde, that's so good.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.868
That's so much cheese!

00:08:07.868 --> 00:08:10.785
(relaxing dubstep)

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.750
That just blew the taste
buds off my tongue.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.480
You know it's an amazing place

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.550
when there's a crowd standing around it.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.310
And, there is a taxi
driver who just pulled up,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.830
he stopped in a no-stop zone,

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.650
and he's ordering takeaway
out of his window.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.810
You know they're doing good
things when that happens.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.820
We are off to an extremely happy

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.580
Mexican street food tour today.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.220
I feel a happiness just radiating

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.608
because that food is so good.

00:08:39.608 --> 00:08:42.525
(relaxing dubstep)

00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:52.353
Buenos días.

00:08:52.353 --> 00:08:55.686
(conversing in Spanish)

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.300
The next place I'm gonna
eat is this birria stall,

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.250
and I've been eyeing it.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.950
It's packed at lunchtime.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.560
Unfortunately, he's not open yet.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.770
He's gonna be openin' in about one hour,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.310
so I'll just walk around
and get some exercise

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.909
for the time being,
but birria coming next.

00:09:16.909 --> 00:09:18.537
It's one of the ultimate dishes.

00:09:18.537 --> 00:09:21.287
(upbeat dubstep)

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.290
I think I'm the first customer today.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.020
He is just opening up.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.230
Can smell the aroma, smells so good!

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.123
I cannot wait to eat birria.

00:09:59.123 --> 00:10:02.373
(converses in Spanish)

00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:21.853
(speaks Spanish)

00:10:21.853 --> 00:10:25.810
Jalisco is known, that's where
the best birria comes from

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.820
in Mexico.

00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:34.563
Muchas gracias.

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:41.770
Aw, it smells so good.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.610
He said it's sometimes,
birria can be made with goat,

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.420
but this is made with beef.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.040
You can either order tacos,
he'll make the tacos for you,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.400
or you can order a whole bowl,
which he'll chop up the meat,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.010
puts it into a bowl, he adds the soup,

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.190
he adds in some onions,
and then you eat it

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.840
separate with tortillas.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.100
Oh, it smells so good.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.960
This is one of the ultimate
Mexican street food dishes.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.730
Oh, that's stunning!

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.490
That's just meat stew at
its finest, it's so good!

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.770
Okay, now I gotta season.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.300
Some lime juice.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.820
I cannot resist adding in a
couple of these fried chilis.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.170
And then he also said this
is some picante salsa,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.470
which I will also add a
little bit of this in.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.940
Oh man, that is just awesome.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.840
I love it!

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.540
Oh, with that squeeze of lime, mm!

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.490
Those fried chilis are so
fragrant, not too spicy.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.050
Okay, it sorta builds on you,

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.570
and I'll just grab some of
that meat and that whole chili

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.900
and just kinda drain it of the
juice and into the tortilla.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.980
And I think I'll go in for some of these,

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.510
more pickled onions as well.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.050
Put this on top.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.990
And a little more of that salsa.

00:12:27.406 --> 00:12:28.896
Oh, perfecto!

00:12:28.896 --> 00:12:31.813
(relaxing dubstep)

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.364
Absolutely stunning, oh, it's delicious!

00:12:40.364 --> 00:12:43.281
(relaxing dubstep)

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:54.122
(background chatter)

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.600
It's so good!

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.290
And you can tell the people that eat here,

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.380
they are regulars because they
know each other like friends.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.280
This is the type of neighborhood
street food stall that...

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.840
I am living around this area.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.540
I would definitely come here
on a very regular basis.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.200
Birria is one of my
favorite Mexican dishes.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.440
I remember eating it years ago

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.900
with some of my buddies in Arizona.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.840
Yeah, it's awesome,
this was so good, yeah.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.762
Very good, muchas gracias!

00:13:25.762 --> 00:13:29.012
(converses in Spanish)

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.440
What a dish, and he's so friendly, too.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.660
That's the type of dish
you just sit there,

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.220
it just warms you from the inside out.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.700
It's a little bit oily,
but the flavor is abundant,

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.140
and you kinda go there, you
kinda have a conversation,

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.140
you eat, you socialize.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.660
I got a little salsa on my shirt,

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.023
so I think it's time to change.

00:13:50.023 --> 00:13:52.773
(upbeat dubstep)

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.100
Micah just woke up from his nap.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.930
Boy, you look pretty
warm and cozy down there

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.390
on this cold day in Mexico City.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.010
And we are on our way.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.306
It's across the main road
to a place to eat mariscos.

00:14:06.306 --> 00:14:09.056
(upbeat dubstep)

00:14:13.775 --> 00:14:14.849
Buenos dias.

00:14:14.849 --> 00:14:18.182
(conversing in Spanish)

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:21.950
We walked around a little bit.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.860
I was afraid that they might be closed,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.100
but after we circled back
around, finally found this place.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.110
It's just a little
mariscos spot they have.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.160
Bar counter seating, and
then they actually have

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.099
a table set out, too, so we got a table.

00:14:33.099 --> 00:14:36.016
(relaxing dubstep)

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.940
Okay, he said we eat
the tostada de camaron,

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.190
the shrimp tostada, first,

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.410
and then he'll make the octopus.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:56.330
He layered it in shrimp,
then he topped it in onions,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.040
there's cilantro on there,
and then he took the avocado

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.430
and scooped it right from the shell.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.700
Some nice, generous slices of avocado

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.030
and then just a very light sauce.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.150
Looks like there might
some pepper in there.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.050
And that is just simple, beautiful.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.383
(crunching)

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.293
Wow.

00:15:18.662 --> 00:15:20.100
Oh, it's so good!

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.370
Oh, you got that mayonnaise,
the crunchy base.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.790
The shrimp had this wonderful, refreshing

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.120
cold texture to them.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.330
You've got the crunch of
the onion and the cilantro.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.040
You've got the creamy avocado.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.440
It's amazing, incredible,
(exclaims in Spanish).

00:15:36.397 --> 00:15:39.647
(converses in Spanish)

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.700
Squeeze on a little more lime

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.750
although he's already
added some lime on there.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.020
It tastes, like, kinda sour already,

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.270
but an extra bit of lime
is never a bad idea.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.470
And I am gonna add on a little more

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.830
of this tomatoes and onions.

00:16:04.252 --> 00:16:06.585
(crunching)

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.360
That's really outstanding,
that is so good,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.810
it's so refreshing, it's
so fresh, it's so mm!

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.430
Now it's time for the octopus tostada.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.890
Squeeze on the lime,

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:26.990
add on that extra refreshing
tomato-and-onion salsa.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:30.773
Oh, perfect.

00:16:32.255 --> 00:16:34.561
(crunching)

00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:37.478
(relaxing dubstep)

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.480
All the same ingredients, the
crispy base, the mayonnaise,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.120
the creamy avocado, the
onions, the cilantro,

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.970
but instead of the shrimp, it's octopus.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.040
The octopus, it's soft,
but definitely the camaron,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.920
the shrimp, wins.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.003
(crunching)

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.850
I'm blown away by these tostadas.

00:17:01.511 --> 00:17:03.690
(crunching)

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.180
There was no way we were gonna leave

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.460
without having some more tostadas.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.260
We ordered some more of the
camaron, shrimp, tostadas.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.010
They are mind-blowingly delicious.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.380
And they're both topped already

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.170
with some of the tomato
salsa with those onions.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.670
Just loaded, that avocado, those shrimp.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.832
Aw, it's just a thing of beauty.

00:17:22.832 --> 00:17:23.665
Okay.

00:17:24.524 --> 00:17:27.330
(crunching)

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.247
(relaxing dubstep)

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.810
It's just street food after street food

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:48.810
of complete, like,
mind-bewildering deliciousness.

00:17:48.824 --> 00:17:51.741
(relaxing dubstep)

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.370
Just a quick disclaimer,
we've already been

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.160
to this street food stall.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.080
They serve

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:03.750
I mean, it's Mexican style,
but it's very popular.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.560
We've been there once, it was Ying's idea,

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.760
but we didn't order the right thing,

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.070
and when I was standing in
line the last time in ordering

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.350
that I met a friendly man
who was also ordering,

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.509
and he said, "Oh, this is
the one you gotta order."

00:18:17.509 --> 00:18:18.450
But I had already ordered,

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.360
and I didn't order the right thing,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.200
so I thought, "We gotta come back."

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.400
Now is the time.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.960
It's right on the corner
of this park in Roma Norte,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.560
and this is gonna be the
final Mexican street food dish

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.393
of this tour.

00:18:28.393 --> 00:18:30.970
You can just smell the burger, juicy smoke

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.010
throughout this entire intersection.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.820
Here's the spot, right there.

00:18:41.218 --> 00:18:42.930
Uno de queso piña, por favor.

00:18:58.464 --> 00:18:59.297
Gracias.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.440
Yeah, hamburgers are a very, very popular

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.440
Mexican street food.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.890
You'll find them throughout this city,

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.490
but this particular stall, I
really wanted to show it to you

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.170
because you come here
at any hour of the day

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:16.490
and they always, always have
a crowd outside of them, so...

00:19:17.751 --> 00:19:20.650
Not to mention, they've been
making burgers since 1990

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.520
in the same exact place,
their same burger.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.730
And we did eat here the other day,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.270
Ying and I sampled a burger,

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.950
but I had just ordered
the regular plain burger,

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:30.900
but then I got in line,

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.330
and then the friendly man
who was in line after me,

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.090
he said, "Oh, you have to order

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.410
"the pineapple cheeseburger here."

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.335
And, if you pay attention in
line, you'll hear everybody.

00:19:40.335 --> 00:19:43.930
Not one person in line fails to order

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.880
the cheese-pineapple burger.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.790
They flame-grill the patties,
they put on a piece of cheese,

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.360
they grill the pineapple,

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.110
and then I got it with all the toppings.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.650
So, let's just take a look
at what's inside of this guy.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.100
You can see the grilled,
charred edges of the burger.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.490
There's tomato, there's
lettuce, there's ketchup,

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.590
there's mustard, there's mayonnaise,

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.680
and yeah, that whole piece of pineapple,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.220
and the cheese is somewhere
below here as well.

00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:18.030
You can taste the flame-grilledness of it.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.960
You've got the sweet
pineapple, the salty cheese,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.150
the fluffy bun, the tomato, the lettuce,

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.110
the sweet and tangy ketchup.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.260
Yeah, it's all there.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.560
(relaxing dubstep)
Oh yeah.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.840
This is definitely a
burger that could compete

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.453
with the world's most
renowned fast food chains.

00:20:36.453 --> 00:20:39.370
(relaxing dubstep)

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.340
Okay, so we have come to
the end of this awesome,

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.860
it's been an awesome
Mexican street food tour!

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.972
And to be honest, when
I started this morning,

00:20:57.972 --> 00:21:00.296
I had a few ideas of the
places that I wanted to go,

00:21:00.296 --> 00:21:02.570
but I didn't really know, I
didn't really have a plan.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.610
And sometimes, it turns out so well.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.250
Those were amazing dishes,

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.250
all the way starting
from that chicken soup,

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.500
the birrias, oh, those tlacoyo,

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.810
that tlacoyo also was amazing,

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.880
the birria was so good,

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.360
those tostadas were insanely delicious!

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.080
Actually, everything from this entire

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.240
Mexican street food tour
in Mexico City Roma Norte

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.540
was delicious.

00:21:26.875 --> 00:21:27.903
Okay, probably my favorite thing was

00:21:27.903 --> 00:21:30.570
the seafood mariscos tostadas.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:31.407
Awesome!

00:21:31.407 --> 00:21:34.340
(relaxing dubstep)

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.520
And finally, you might be
wondering about the t-shirts.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.470
And I was wearing that
other t-shirt this morning

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.800
and now this t-shirt "I
travel for food &amp; tacos."

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.890
When I arrived to Mexico City,
I got an email from Marissa.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.690
She's from Mexico City,
she owns a t-shirt company,

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.440
and she said, "I wanna
translate some of your t-shirts

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.360
"into Spanish and give them to you."

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.100
And so she gave me these t-shirts.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.720
I think they're absolutely awesome.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.150
Huge thank you to Marissa.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.750
And that's gonna be it for
this Mexican street food tour

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.560
Roma Norte in Mexico City.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.360
I had a fantastic time, and you can, too.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.300
If you just walk around,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.410
there's so much delicious
street food In Mexico City.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.720
You just have street food
after dish after dish

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.170
