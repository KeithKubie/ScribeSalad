00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.300
Hey guys, I'm Trace.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.820
E. Coli, can divide as often as every 20 minutes
in ideal conditions

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.769
Since each bacterium splits into two the math
is pretty easy to figure out how long it would

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.510
take to get to two million.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.119
2 to the power of however many splits!

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.700
If you started with 10 bacteria, in an hour
you'd have 80; in 5 hours you'd have 327,680;

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.890
and in 5 hours and 52 minutes you'd surpass
two million.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.640
They're pretty are awesome.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.360
But not as awesome as you guys. Because you guys got us to 2 million

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.509
When we launched DNews and Anthony, Laci,
Pam, Nori, Ron, Michael, Tom and I thought

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:44.790
"Let's see how this goes…" We didn't know we'd get to 2 million subscribers

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.500
And now we've passed that.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200
Two. Million. Subscribers.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.600
That is so many!

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.800
It took years of hard work and
long days to get here

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.090
I guess we're just not bacteria...

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.920
I couldn't be prouder of everyone we've ever
had on this show and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.690
so today, we've got a special behind the scenes
episode for you.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.550
A lot of you have been tweeting at us for
years asking "How we make a DNews everyday?"

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.950
So now we got a camera, and we filmed the
whole process.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.950
And this is it.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.960
We've had a few DNews teams over the years, but
right now we're Producer Andrea, Associate

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.650
Producers Sophie and Donna, Coordinating Producer
Josh, Editor Courtney, and Audience Development

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.390
Aficionado Mitch

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.040
Plus Intern Megan and of course, Me.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.900
But we get help from other people too like
Jules, Jennie, Janet and Julian!

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.750
All J-names… weird.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.500
Every morning at 8:30, the DNews team gets
together and pitches new ideas to each other.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.720
Some of them are about science, some are about
what's going on in the news, or around the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.720
world!

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.080
We debate the angle DNews wants to take and
then one of the writers -- usually the one

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.490
who's most excited -- gets to run off and actually 
write it.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.390
After that, all the Seeker teams come together
and share what they're going to talk about

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.390
that day.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.940
We've got a lot of talented people here and
we like to find ways to work together!

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.290
Then we start talking about the titles for
the next day’s episodes -- because believe

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.690
me, we want those to be right.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.370
A little clickbait is good, but not too much.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.640
While we're doing that, Janet makes the thumbnail
images.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.560
Sometimes they get a little weird, because,
hey, we want to have fun too.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.940
And sometimes we're talking about some pretty
weird stuff.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.900
At the same time, Mitch posts our video for
the morning and makes sure all of the subscribe

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.030
and “click here” buttons are working correctly.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.010
Then, it's fact checking and b-rolling time.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.489
Sophie and Donna look at scripts, and try
and tell a story with the b-roll you're seeing

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.489
and make sure the facts are straight.

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.420
If they're not, we talk about it and try and
find the right ones.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.409
B-Roll are pictures, videos, animations, papers,
headlines, anything that goes over the top

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.659
of our hosts when we're telling our science-
stories.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.659
Julian was in the office when we shot this,
but he lives in LA; so do Crystal, Ian and Amy!

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.099
Natalia and Sapna live in New York and visit
once in awhile to help out where they can.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.409
We all write our own scripts, but sometimes
we share.

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.349
Before we shoot, we table read.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.620
This is when we read the script out loud to
see how it sounds and rewrite it if we need

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.279
to, so everything makes sense.

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.400
Once we have a good script, the team heads
upstairs to Studio A!

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.790
Matt, Balta or Ciarra will shoot our video
for us

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.200
[Balta] Julian, can I get a mic check?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.000
[Julian] Mic check one two one two. There's officially only one thing cooler

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.500
than giant robots

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.489
and then we take it back down and we give it to Courtney.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.680
The real magic happens when all the elements
come together in the editing room.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.730
Courtney is our rockstar editor.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.719
He also makes some of the animations and helps
make us all look good.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.230
He's editing this video right now!

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.370
Hi, Courtney!

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.489
Once it's edited, and Andrea and the APs look
make sure it looks good, Mitch gets it ready

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.790
to publish.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.439
And we start it all over again.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.980
We have made over 2600 videos for you, and you all
showed up.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.980
Subscribing Two.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.980
Million. Times! And

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.810
I don't think we're ever gonna get over that!

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.810
So thank you.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.959
And thank you to everyone who ever appeared,
or worked with us to make DNews, here for you

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:55.959
every day.

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:56.959
We love you.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:57.959
We do this for you.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.200
And we're not going to stop doing it anytime soon.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.500
We did it guys!

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.500
