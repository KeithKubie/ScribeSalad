00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.990
So it looks like no matter how much you exercise,
you’re sort of screwed anyways.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.429
Hey guys, Amy standing here for DNews because
there’s more research out that shows sitting

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.499
is bad for you!

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.409
We’ve heard this before: sitting is bad.

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.070
We’re supposed to be all up and at ‘em
all day.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.270
But most jobs don’t allow that; a lot of
us are sedentary at work, then unwind in front

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.740
of the TV in the evening.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.750
But you work out three days a week or walk
home?

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.310
That’s good, but it’s not quite enough.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.010
Exercise isn’t the problem, it’s the amount
of time spent sitting.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.460
At least, that’s according to a new study
published in the Annals of Internal Medicine

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.910
from a team of scientists based at the Toronto
Rehabilitation Institute.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.249
The team studied sedentary behaviour and found
that the health hazards associated with sitting

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:45.699
seem to be greatest for people who sit 8 or
9 hours a day.

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.579
The impact was even more pronounced in people
who did not exercise regularly.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.800
Sitting for prolonged periods has a lot of
risks, including a 14 percent increased risk

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.139
of cardiovascular disease, a 13 percent risk
of cancer, and an insane 91 percent increase

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:01.390
in diabetes.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.410
And sitting for a long time with no breaks
for stretching or exercise comes with a 40

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.440
percent higher risk of early death.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.110
The longer you sit the higher the risk, and
the risks aren’t entirely offset by exercise.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.970
Sitting for prolonged periods increase your
insulin resistance, meaning your body can’t

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.370
process the sugar in your blood and move it
into your cells as efficiently.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.340
Sitting also burns an extremely small number
of calories, leading to problems associated

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.390
with obesity.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.350
And if you’re not sitting with your feet
and lower back supported you can develop hip

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.290
and lower back problems, problems that you’ll
have a hard time recovering from if you’re

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.720
already not active.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.600
The study authors suggest getting up and stretching
or moving around for just a couple of minutes

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.930
every half hour or so.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.640
So what can you do to be a little active and
burn some calories exercising just five minutes

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640
an hour?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.180
You can burn about 20 calories walking at
a moderate pace.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.180
If you’re at home, brush your teeth to burn
12 calories and up your dental hygiene game.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.280
If you don’t mind people staring at you,
burn about 40 calories in five minutes doing

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.980
pushups or walking up and down the stairs.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.600
Jumping rope, or just jumping, burns 50 calories
in 5 minutes.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.060
The US Department of Health and Human Services
suggests instead of sitting, you can pace

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.850
around your office during conference calls.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.310
Other tips include using your lunch break
to fit in some physical activity, or getting

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.060
up to go talk to a co-worker instead of emailing
them.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.720
At home, scrubbing your floors to burn about
60 calories in five minutes!

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720
If you scrub during every commercial break
with your evening TV, you’ll be a little

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.450
healthier and have clean floors!

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.560
Or consider doing push-ups or sit-ups WHILE
you watch your favorite shows.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.480
So what do you guys do to stay active?
