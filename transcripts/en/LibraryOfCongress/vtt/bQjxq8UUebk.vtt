00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.270
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.720
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: I know that Susan
was signing books before the event

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.970 position:56%
so, I'm sure that some of you have
already met her but for those of you

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.240
who have not, Susan Jacoby
is a historian and scholar

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.840
who specializes in the history of
atheism and secularism and freedom

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.380
of religion or more precisely,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.520
I think we could say,
freedom from religion.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.400
She is a board member of the
Freedom from Religion Foundation

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.710
and she's an independent
scholar which I find fascinating.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.470
You're not affiliated
with the University?

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.770
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: No.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.770
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: And
you don't have a PhD?

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.070
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: No.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.010
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: So, what that
means to me, as a journalist

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.450
as I have great respect from
people who tackle these complex,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.200
historical subjects without an
institutional support behind them

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.480
or advanced study in libraries

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.940
because inevitably I think
those books turn out a lot

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.340
of esoteric knowledge and esoteric
references that are often written

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.380
to impress other academics.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.820
I can tell you that Susan
Jacoby's writing is,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.890
I would guess because you
are an independent scholar,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.000
very accessible, beautifully
written,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.940
very friendly to a
broad public audience.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.280
Susan is the author of several
books including "Free Thinkers,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.790
A History of American Secularism",
" The Age of American Unreason",

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.970
"The Great Agnostic: Robert
Ingersoll and American Freethought"

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.930
and "Half-Jew: A Daughter's Search
for Her Family's Buried Past".

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.130
And that's a story which is
highly relevant to her latest book

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.510
which we're going to be
discussing today, "Strange Gods,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.080
A Secular History of Conversion".

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.250
So Susan it's a real
pleasure to meet you

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.210
and have this opportunity
to talk to you.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.900
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Likewise.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.180
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: I want everyone
to look at this, this is my copy

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.610
of the book and you know
sometimes interviews, I haven't--

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.910
I'll let you in a secret.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.140
Sometimes interviews don't really
read a book very thoroughly before

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.680
they interview the
author, you can see.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.980
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: No.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.850
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: You can see
that I actually did read this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.760
and it's covered with
post nits-- post notes.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.090
It's a fascinating book, I
love this book very much.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.360
It's really much more than
a history of conversion.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.400
To me, Susan, it seems
like it's really a history

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.780
of intellectual thought
over the past 2000 years,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.610
it's a secular account of the
history of religion in many ways

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.500
but you have focused it in this
unusual way by looking specifically

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.510
at religious conversions.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.570
So what is it that the study
of conversions tells us?

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.340
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Well it tells
first of all that what we all know

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.550
from all sorts of things
that are going on today.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.580
The religious conversion
is a big driver of history,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.850
that whether you're talking
about the triumph of Christianity

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.370
over Paganism in the declining
Roman Empire or for that matter,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.610
I should say this book is almost
entirely about Western History

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.920
because otherwise, it would have
been a thousand pages long instead

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.440
of 600 pages long.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.270
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: And would it take
any more than six years to write?

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.570
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Yeah
and there are--

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.620
and I would say that that book
would be best done by someone

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.890
with a strong Hindu or
Buddhist background.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.640
But, it's a big driver of
history and is always mixed

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.460
up with political changes and
other kinds of social changes.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.370
For example, I don't think that
Christianity, I think Christianity

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.740
in the decline of the Roman
Empire and I don't mean,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.370
I don't share Gibbon's
view that the decline

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.630
of the Roman Empire was caused
by Christianity but the rise

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.280
of new religions to
provide something

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.730
that Pagan Roman society
wasn't providing

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.960 position:56%
for people, was very well into that.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.740
There were lots of conversions
to Judaism as I point

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.710
out in the declining Roman Empire
too and initially of course,

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.940 position:56%
Romans regarded Christianity as
just another form of Judaism but so,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.720
Christianity obviously, the
change from Catholic Europe

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.870
to Christian Europe that included
Protestantism, the reformation.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.390
Again, another huge
change of, you know,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.700
thing about religion
is a driver of history.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.000
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: These are really
turning points, which this year--

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.730
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: These
are turning points.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.630
The-- at the intersection
of religion politics, look,

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.750 position:56%
you can certainly say that without
the reformation, it's quite possible

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.780
that the United States would
not have been settled in the way

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.870
that it was at all and I don't
mean just by puritans I mean

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.240
by people whom the puritans were
persecuting back home who didn't--

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.290 position:56%
but the puritans didn't get to do it
here because people just moved away

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.000
from Massachusetts to New
York and Pennsylvania.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.680
So that's one of the reasons I'm
really interested in conversion

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.120
and then my family background
makes me particularly interested

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.700
and I see some people whom I know
have read some of my earlier books.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.970 position:56%
I was brought up a Catholic and I
didn't find out until I was about 17

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.370
that my father was born a Jew and
he was a convert to Catholicism.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.410
Now, I would have found this
out much sooner, had I not grown

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.110
up in a small town where
there were almost no Jews.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.860
If I'd lived in New York, I would
have realize that Jacoby if you go

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.540
for a back enough is
always a Jewish name.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.840
But I didn't.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.130 position:56%
And my grandmother when she
married my grandfather was a convert

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.580
from Lutheranism to
Catholicism, you know,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.150
to please my grandfather's family.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.220
Can I tell my little story, do
I have time about everyone then,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.380
this is 1919, I mean, nobody
thinks that much of a conversion

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.770
like that today but in 1919
it was something and they went

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.980 position:56%
to the priest to take instruction as
they called it before their marriage

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.260
and he asked out right if my
grandmother was or the family way.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.700
And my grandfather reared up
and he said, she's as innocent

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.300 position:56%
as the Virgin Mary, no thanks to me.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.580
All I've done is kiss her and you
have a dirty mind and he wanted

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.250
to go to a judge to get married
but my grandmother wouldn't let him

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.400
because she thought his
mother would be very upset.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.940
So apparently, they went as my
grandmother told me the story

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.910
and I found him more sympathetic
priest with a less dirty mind.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.580
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: So your father
converted but and then his uncles

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.030
who obviously were Jewish as
well also converted correct?

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.040
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: No, that was my
father's brother who converted.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.350
My Uncle Lassie [assumed spelling]

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.920
who was a famous Bridge
Champion also converted.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.420
He converted a little later in
his life than my father did.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.900
He broke his back he's had as--

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.560
my uncle Lassie who was alive

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.220 position:56%
when I was writing my memoir
Half-Jew told me, he said, you know,

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.490
my Catholic wife pounced and you
know, she thought I was dying

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.470
and so she got me to
agree to being baptized.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.960
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: So, how do
you explain those conversions?

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.720
In other words, in what category
would you put those conversions

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.160
in your family?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.590
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: I would put them
in the category, two categories.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.830
One in the category,
the biggest driver

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.500
of conversion throughout
history has been intermarriage.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.860
And by that, I emphasized, I don't
mean that I consider those put

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.820 position:56%
on conversions or false conversions.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.370
When people fall in love with
someone of another faith,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.100
often they become interested
in that religion.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.070
It's part of this,
you become interested

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.940
in what books another person
reads or something like that.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.490
But in the case of my father's
family, they were also,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.090
they were family, they were
a family of German Jews

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:19.910 position:56%
and like many German Jews, they were
very secular in the 19th century

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:25.500
and I do know that my
father's father was very--

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.490
there was a lot of shame
around being Jewish.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.300
And I think that-- I don't
think it's an accident

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.670
when all three siblings
in the family,

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.080
all marry Irish Catholics
and convert.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.850
Although they didn't really know
anything about Judaism either.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.180 position:56%
So I think there was both falling in
love with someone of another faith,

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.080
very common motivation
but also in the case

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.350
of my father's family's
attitude toward Judaism.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.140
My dad told me, I did ask my
father about this and he said that,

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.860 position:56%
this is how he regarded being a Jew.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.950
He said, I didn't want you
and your brother ever to think

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.000
that if you didn't get
something you wanted in life,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.420
it was because you were Jewish.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.790
Isn't-- that's one
of the saddest things

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.850
that my father ever said to me.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.790
So it's a combination of both.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.900
But my father was also a compulsive
gambler and again, this is involved

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:22.770
in many conversions and it's both
spiritual and non-spiritual in way.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.260
My father felt that the
rituals are religion

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.320
and why not become a Catholic,
your married with Catholic,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.760
you have children being
raised as Catholics.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.210
The rituals of religion would
help him overcome gambling just

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:40.870
as George W. Bush felt that the
religion he adopted would help him

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.160
overcome alcoholism.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.210
And that too, is a mixed kind
of motive, so if you're asking,

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.540
does this have anything to do with
forced conversion in the sense

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.170
of people doing it
because they're going

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.900
to have their property
taken away or be killed?

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.200
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Which has happened?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.500
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: No.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.980
Which is also another
kind of conversion.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.470 position:56%
But I would say it was a combination

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.390
of mixed marriage and
social opportunism.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:08.040
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Those are very
practical motivations right there.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.340
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Yes.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.540
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Now, you know,
I think when a lot of us think

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.190
of religious conversion,
we think the sort

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.050
of the prototypical conversion

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.870
as the one you have
depicted for this is a--

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.170
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: No.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.470
Caravaggio depicted it.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.770
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: That's right.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.070
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: I wish.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Right but it's the--

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.920
it's Saul of Tarsus who is on
his way on the road to Damascus

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:37.000
and he sees a light and
he becomes convinced

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.410
that Jesus Christ has spoken
to him and from that moment

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.030
on he becomes Paul and the most--

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.450
that's the most famous
conversion of all.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.570
Now you-- in this painting, he's
depicted as falling off a horse,

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.660
which I don't think is in
the bible, actually that's.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.960
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: No.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.260
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: So
you must have seen--

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.560
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Because
he had a blow,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.860 position:56%
it's that he had a blow on the head.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.080
It is however, at-- as if
he's been depicted by artist

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.530
and the bible does say
he woke up on the ground.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.560
So that would imply a fault.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.140
And what else would he have
been going to the Damascus to--

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.330
there are only three
ways to get from Damascus

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.360
to Jerusalem and vice versa.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.180
One is on foot, which I don't he
was because he was going to fair it

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.320
out Christians in Damascus
to report them back

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.370
to the high priest in Jerusalem.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.690
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: And whether he fell
off of a horse or was struck by,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.560
you know, something that more
inspiring than a blow in the head,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.880
still, we think of this
as being a conversion,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.920
a true spiritual conversion that
he was spoken to by God or Christ

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.730
and as a result of that
experience, he became a Christian.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.620
But, so that would clearly
would not be in the category

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.920
of an opportunistic or a prophet--

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.520
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: He became
a follower of the way.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.050
Nobody used the word Christian.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.350
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: OK, all right.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.290
But you say in your book
that it's only a tiny slice

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.180
of converts throughout
Western history

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.720
who have converted
for emotional reasons.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.910 position:56%
So, you should defend that statement

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.700
because that's quite
a sweeping statement.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.000
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Well,
I should have said,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.210
I should have said
purely spiritual reasons.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.510
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: OK.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.730
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: And I meant that
for purely spiritual reasons,

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:26.270
I don't mean in my view, the
spiritual or the emotional

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.910 position:56%
and I'm using them
interchangeably and I think they are

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.840
because when you read just
there are many other conversions

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.940
like Saul's throughout history and
when you read about at it's always

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.010
as a highly emotional
overnight experience.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.410
But I don't think since
conversion when you're talking

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.500
about large numbers of
conversions, they tend to occur

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.350
at great times of social upheaval.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:59.690
They tend to occur in societies
which the late Roman Empire was

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.650
that were except during
certain epics, you know,

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.370
we've heard about Nero's
persecution and Diocletian's.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.190
But they tend to occur and I think
that's one reason America has

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.700
so much conversion.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.310
They tend to occur in societies

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.240
where it's possible even
though it may become impossible

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.980
and they may be persecuted
eventually so,

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.320
I defend that statement by saying

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.630
that what I said was
purely spiritual.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.770
I don't say that spiritual
motivation is an important.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.490
I think as I said, I
think for my father,

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.440
the desire to overcome
a personal fault,

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.370
I would call it a spiritual
motivation, but as far as people

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.220
in general, no, do I think
that Ivanka Trump for instance

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.940
who converted because she married
a Jew, fell in love with him?

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.470
Do I think that Ivanka woke
up one morning and said oh,

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.810
I've been wrong all these
years, Jesus isn't the Messiah,

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.780
I really believe in Judaism.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.070
No, she fell in love with and
maybe undoubtedly become genuinely

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.880
interested in Judaism, so
I don't think that the--

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.850
I would defend my statement
by saying that I don't think

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.930
that it's impossible or even
unlikely to have both spiritual

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.620
and non-spiritual motives.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.810
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: We'll get
back to some individual cases

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.500
but as I said before, one of the
things I found most fascinating

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.070
about your book is that by
talking about conversions,

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:28.140
you really illuminate history and
you illuminate these turning points

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.590
of history in these
great changes in history.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:36.140
Talk a little bit about the
growth of early Christendom

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.640
in the declining Roman Empire
and sort of the triumph

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.720 position:56%
over Paganism and how that happened?

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.540
How those great, that
great wave of conversion

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.560
which was really the
first big conversion

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.940
that you write about in your book?

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.240
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Right.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.610
Well, first of all, it didn't
happen, it didn't happen overnight.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:57.180
There were lots of religions
competing with Paganism

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.790
in the late Roman Empire.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.030
Judaism is one of them,
people don't realize

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.220
that because Judaism is an
active proselytizing religion

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.530
and Manicheism which Augustine of
Hippo was originally attracted to,

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:16.560 position:56%
was another one and certainly things
could have turned out differently

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.160
and it could have run out
instead of Christianity.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.440
But once it happened in the late
Roman Empire was a lot of Romans,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.870
particularly well off
Romans were disgusted

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.060
by the decadence of Roman society.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.750
And both Judaism and Christianity,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.610
that's why ascetic
movements too were

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.210
which Christianity
wasn't nearly as extreme

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.090
in as certain forms
of Manicheism were.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.640
So they were attracted
to something that seemed

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.560
to offer a purpose
and an explanation.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.210
And then at the same time, in the
fourth century which is really

00:15:54.210 --> 00:16:02.020 position:56%
when Christianity begins to triumph,
early fifth century, Vandals

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.570
and the Goths overrun Rome.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:10.060
And a lot of wealthy Romans
become refugees in North Africa.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.720
They brought with them
their money to the church

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.370
and money was very important in
that they attracted Christianity

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.780
with not only the religion
of the poor but it was also,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.910
it became the religion of choice
ultimately certainly the emperors,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.000
Constantine and Theodosius.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.360
When your emperor picks
Christianity,

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.870
that also encourages
the upper classes.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.910
Again, it's a mixture of things.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.110 position:56%
Notice, I'm talking about
attraction to a religion that seemed

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.470
to offer more spiritually than
Paganism, but at the same time,

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.820
you're talking about a religion
that your emperor was speaking.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.100
Constantine opened up to
civil service to Christians.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.260 position:56%
You didn't have to-- after
Constantine, you didn't have to give

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.280
up your job in the
Roman civil service

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.070 position:56%
if you wanted to become a Christian.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.450
So I think this thing is--

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.750
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: So it became

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.810
at a certain point then it
became advantageous to--

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.960
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: At certain points,
in parts of the Roman Empire,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:15.060 position:56%
it became advantageous and certainly
by the early fifth century,

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.010
mid fifth century, it was
settled, Christianity won out,

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:26.790 position:56%
Manicheism lost out and then you'd
begin to have anti-Semitism of level

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.910
that had not existed in
the Roman Empire before.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.060
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: And once
Christianity had established this

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.980
foothold, not only in Europe,
but as you say, in North Africa,

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:44.180
it actually took on a more
aggressive form you write about.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.980
And actually, Christians
themselves having been persecuted

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.070
in the early stages of Christendom
became persecutors, you say?

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.630
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Yes
and also different sects

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.550
within Christianity became
persecutors of each other too.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:04.300
Arguing over, over whether the
Roman church was going to survive

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.090 position:56%
or whether the forms which were more
native to North Africa and you know,

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.020
that of course the East or
West split in Christianity,

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.890
Catholicism continues to this day.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:19.550
But the thing that happened in the
Roman Empire, it was not unusual.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.390
It's once the church in
the state got together,

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.600
what situation has there
ever been in history?

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.710
When the church has, had at its
disposal, the power of the state

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.000
to enforce its belief and
by the church, I just mean,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.090
churches just as in John Calvin's
Geneva became a theocracy,

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.380
every bit as bad as theocratics,

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.630
Spain and Portugal
during the inquisition.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.550
There is no incidence in
history of a theocracy

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.280
which is practice religious
tolerance and freedom of religion.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.670
Forget freedom from religion
which is freedom from religion,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.700
freedom of religion
are integrally linked.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.100
They had-- they have to be.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.640 position:56%
There has been no theocratic
society which has ever been tolerant

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.850
of other religions, it wouldn't by
definition be a theocratic society.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.560
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Now, the--
you mentioned the inquisition

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.310
and of course, that is kind
of the prototypical period

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:21.090
where Christians persecuted
Jews and Muslims and for that,

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.120
you talked about the expulsion
when Jews and Muslims were expelled

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.420
from the Iberian Peninsula

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.490
that unless they converted
to Christianity.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.200
But prior to the inquisition,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.000
there was this period
that's called La Convivencia

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.370
where you actually
had Islam, Judaism

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.590
and Christianity coexisting
relatively peacefully,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.890
what happened?

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.090
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Well, what
happen was the Reconquista.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:45.620
When the Christians retook
all of Spain, they then,

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.170
the Muslim rulers were
tolerant of the right of Jews.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.950
They called themselves
people of the book.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.850
They weren't tolerant
of Pagans however.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.860
But they were, the three
Monotheistic religions pretty much

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:04.950
coexisted and we know, here is my
intermarriage, not theory I think.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.010
Theory in the sense of
Einstein, theory of relativity,

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:13.590 position:56%
but we know there was a lot of
intermarriage during La Convivencia.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.040
How do we know this?

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.870
Because there was a massive
DNA study done of people

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.260
on the Iberian Peninsula.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.950 position:56%
It was completed about 10 years ago.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.410
Found out that 20% of all residents

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:36.080
of Spain today possess Sephardic
Jewish genes due to DNA analysis

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.040
and almost 15 percent possess
North African Muslim genes.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.210
Now obviously, this means there
was a lot fully around right

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:50.300
from the start, whatever
people thought about it.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.820
And as happens, when the people

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.110
of different religions have a
fair amount of political equality

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.260
which they did, Jews and
Christians weren't quite equal

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.990
under Muslim rulers, but
they were fairly equal.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.930
They were persecuted
for their religion.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.830
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: But you had
this period of coexistence

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:12.250
which is sadly not very common
throughout Western history.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.090
Whom do you credit for that?

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.650
Do you credit-- it sounds
like you'll credit the--

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.510
there were Muslim rulers
but there was also,

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.140
there were also Christian
monarchs, Alfonso X was--

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.440
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Yes.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.750
There were Christian monarchs

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.430
who didn't share Ferdinand
and Isabella's views.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:33.070
They weren't like, they did
business and not only that,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:38.100
but during La Convivencia in Spain,

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.840
this is the dark ages
in Northern Europe.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:46.800
But in La Convivencia, the
Arabs had translated many

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.500
of the Greek classics which
were lost in Northern Europe

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.420
at that time except in monasteries.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:57.370
They weren't available to an
educated person who was interested

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.100
in the classical heritage.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.830 position:56%
Well this data have been translated
into Arabic by the Arabs and contact

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:08.150 position:56%
between Jews, Christians and Muslims
in La Convivencia in Spain was

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:12.940
such that then got
retranslated back into Latin.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.240
And that--

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Thanks to the Arabs.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.270
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Thanks to
the Arabs, thanks to the fact

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:22.720
that there was-- and eventually a
retranslated, a few centuries later

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.190
into their merging
vernaculars of Europe.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.490
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Yeah.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.050 position:56%
Well that's, it's an important thing
to remember now because you know,

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:33.110
there is so much animosity
between Islam and Christianity

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.520
that there was this period
where it was the Muslims

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.930
who are the most civilized and
enlightened in that part of Europe,

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.760
it sounds like what you're saying.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.070
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: At
that point in Europe?

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.370
Yes.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:46.670
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.090
Now, and then we get to
the Protestant Reformation,

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.270
another one of these
great turning point

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.170
that is itself a story
of conversions.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:23:02.780
And you write the-- the spread of
vernacular bibles, the translation

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.910
of the bible into German,

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.150
another vernacular languages
allowed every literate person,

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:14.390
direct access to the scriptures
without mediation of priests

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.460
and of course, Martin Luther
was instrumental in that he was,

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.040
he translated the New
Testament into German himself

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.660
and he was obviously a big
advocate of bypassing priests,

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.870
encouraging direct contact
communication with God.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:35.940
And you write between roughly
1517 and 1550 huge numbers

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.770
of Europeans changed their minds

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.290
about what constituted the
foundation of their lives,

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.440
encompassing their view of the
universe, of relations between God

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.160
and man, and of the proper way

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.760
for individual human
beings to seek truth.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.780
So talk a little bit about that
because that, on the one hand,

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.650
that is obviously politically
very important but it sounds

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.320
like it had a lot of
spiritual significance as well

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.080
because it really changed
the way people as you say,

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.020
saw their relation to
God, that's a pretty--

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.320
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: They saw--

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.620
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: --
spiritual development.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.920
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: -- their
relation to God as one thing,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.210
a more direct relationship with God

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.210
which is again a religious
issue that's still

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.420
with us in America today.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.990 position:56%
Protestantism, because it encouraged
reading in the vernacular,

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.600
involved a more direct
relationship to God.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.560
But of course, it didn't
take very long,

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.430
less than 100 years before
there became new kinds

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:34.400 position:56%
of Protestants whom the first
Protestant reformers, the Lutherans,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.200
and the Calvinist didn't like.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.530
And they were the Nonconformist
Protestants, the Baptists,

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.350
the Quakers, the Anabaptists,
the Huguenots.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:48.690
Many of whom, our own
founders were descended on--

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.840
descended from which I didn't
know until I wrote Freethinkers,

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.160
that a lot of our founders, their
grandparents were Huguenot refugees

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:02.760
from France, where not only, there
was not only the Catholic church

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.160
that objected to Huguenots
under Louis XIV

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.590
but the Magisterial Protestants
as they're called, the first ones.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:14.750
The Lutherans and the
Calvinists, they also objected

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.990
to Nonconformist Protestants
to like,

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.340
Quakers were persecuted in England.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.450
That's how a lot of them wound
up with founding Pennsylvania.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.620
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: But let's
stick for a moment on that,

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.650 position:56%
the early period of the reformation.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.530 position:56%
Those people who became Protestants,
who converted from Catholicism

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.300
to Protestantism as a result of
the translation of the bible,

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.880
would you consider those
to be spiritual conversions

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.410
or opportunistic conversions?

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.690
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: I would say,
except for the very first ones,

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.950
mostly both, spiritual in
the sense that the chance

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:54.840 position:56%
to read these things for-- and also
probably the vernacular translations

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.210
encourage people to read who--

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.210
more people to learn to read
who wouldn't have otherwise.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.100
We know that the rate
of literacy in Europe

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.170
and Protestant countries was higher

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.550
than in Catholic countries
at that time.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.560
But I would say both.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.240
There's always a tipping point
once your ruler adopts religion,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.110
when something becomes both
pragmatically desirable

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.840
as well as spiritual.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.050
But I would say both.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:25.090
But the first Magisterial
Protestants, I mean,

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:30.590 position:56%
Calvin's Geneva was a pit of horror,
with basically secret police,

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.560
monitoring every home,
having exactly

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.780
like Stalin's communist party,

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:40.550
having rules that governed every
aspect of life, can't have more

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.510
than 16 people over for dinner.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:46.900
There was no reason for that except
they just were so opposed to fun

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:51.390
of every kind, that maybe they
thought too much fun was being had

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.640
if there were more
than 16 people there.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.890
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: And as you say,
it was precisely at that moment

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.810
of religious persecution in
Europe among these rival sects

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.610
that the United States was founded

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.970
and you make it a very
interesting connection

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.620
between our tradition
of religious liberty.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.630
And the birth of the United States
under enlightenment influences

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.120
with what was going on
in Europe at that time?

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Well look, when you
think, think jump ahead a little bit

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:24.370
from the 17th century where
our first colonists arrived

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:28.220
and as we know, the Massachusetts
Bay colony was not religiously

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.640
tolerant at all.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.970
The difference between America
and Europe was that people

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:37.530
who descended, they didn't
get killed there necessarily.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:42.990
They got, they left for New York
and the Salem witch trials happened

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.760 position:56%
at the point where the Massachusetts
Theocracy was breaking down,

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.760
that's my friend Stacey Schiff
has written and that's very true.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.490
But the founders, when they
write the constitution,

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.600
it's less than a 100 years
after Protestants and Catholics,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.320
and Protestants and Protestants
were murdering each other in Europe

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.220
over such earth shaking issues
as, is it OK to baptize babies

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.520
or you do need to wait
for adult baptism?

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.520
This was one of the major sources
of many religious wars in Europe.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.600
And when you think
about the founders,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.090
all having a state religion meant
to them was the kind of trouble,

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.890
they were all educated men,
all of them were educated.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.660
Probably the most educated group

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.690
of people founding a country
wherever existed, what--

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.310
having a state religion meant

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.570
to them was the mess
that was in Europe.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:43.460
And so that's why they wrote
the constitution first of all,

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.500
prohibiting any religious
test for public offers.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.760
And the First Amendment
the way they did.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.620
They saw absolutely no value
in having a state religion

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.160
and a lot that was wrong.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.810
I mean, one of the most
exciting things you know,

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:02.320
reading from before the revolution,
1767, the end of the French

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.130
and Indian war in New York.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:08.280
They have big celebration
to commemorate the victory,

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.110
the British victory
at French in the war.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:17.390
All of the churches and the only
synagogue in Manhattan were allowed

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.170
to participate in this
and read their sermons

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.520
of thanksgiving and so on.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.550
Now, this would have been
absolutely unthinkable in Europe,

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.680
that a synagogue would
have been included in this.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.890
So that the seeds that came to
fruition in the constitution

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:43.770
so shortly afterwards were
already there in colonial America.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.060
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: OK, I've
taken enough of Susan's time.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.700
It's your turn now to--
we didn't really get

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.810
into 20th century America which--

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.110
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Not at all.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.510
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Which is
another whole great story

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.570 position:56%
of conversions in the United States.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:00.020
But anyone have any
questions for Susan Jacoby?

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.310
Yeah, there are sorry, yes?

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.610
There are two mics.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:08.540
One in each aisle, here, if you
would be so kind so we can hear you

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.840
and everybody can hear you.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.170
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you, that was
fascinating and I feel like I want

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:21.500
to replay the video and
absorb it some more.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.200
You bring this extraordinary sense

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:32.680
of how religion affects
geopolitics and frankly, war.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.330
How-- if you, a bit
wishful thinking,

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:42.510
but if you could wave a magic wand
or whatever or counsel the UN,

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:47.640
how would you address the
Middle East crisis and these--

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.260
no but seriously because
these are religious wars.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.890 position:56%
These are ultimately religious wars.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.530
That's really what
they boil down to.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:59.640
Arabs versus Jews, et cetera and
how would you counsel them just

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:05.200
to structure some of these
deals to address the tolerance

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:11.910
of the given religions in a
way that can be a resolution?

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.300
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: I can't
believe you asked me that.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.220
But I'm just going
to answer honestly

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:22.480
and not try and give you nonsense.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.380
I do not think that the situation

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:30.140
in the Middle East is
anything but containable.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.690
The advice I would give
anyone who was in charge

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:39.690
of our country was just as you
couldn't quote when the cold war,

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.000
something, an idea I hate.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.380
There is no way with a certain
proportion of people in that region

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.950
of the world whose minds are
stuck in the eight century

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:58.000
and certain proportion of people in
Israel whose minds are still stuck

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.550
in 18th century Poland and
Russia, but the difference is

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.020
that Israel isn't' going out.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.610
And well Israel is a
whole other question.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:11.580 position:56%
But I don't think that the situation
in the Middle East is anything

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:15.630
but containable, like in the
sense of preventing people

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.620
from murdering their neighbors,

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.310
which obviously we haven't
succeeded in doing either.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:26.070
And I don't think it will be
anything but containable as long

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:30.240
as there is this segment of Islam.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.730
Both the terrorist and
Theocratic states like Saudi Arabia

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:39.740
who by the way not only persecute
Christians and not only hate Jews

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.300
but persecute free thinkers who
blog about things like freedom

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.310
of religion and other
Muslims who don't agree

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.610
with their view of Islam, also.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.820
So I don't have an answer for that.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.640
I don't feel optimistic.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.010
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: You sir?

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.490
&gt;&gt; I just have a quick
question on your feelings

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:07.860
about our government's protection
of apostates on different groups.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.160
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: I'm sorry.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.460
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Apostates.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:15.210
Could you just clarify--
when you say

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:19.170
of different groups,
you mean, overseas?

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.500
&gt;&gt; All of the various ones,
I mean, Muslims usually are

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.260
on everybody's minds but
I'm thinking also of Mormons

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:32.120
and Scientologists and the
terrible things they do

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:37.750
to the people that wished to leave.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:43.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: You mean, wished to
leave their sects, their religions?

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:51.050
I don't-- I don't see that our
government protects Mormons.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:56.770
Mormons place like many religions
like Hasidic Jews for example also.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.740
Any one and I've done a lot
of interviewing of people

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.210
who have left the kinds of
religious sects that try

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.020
to control every aspect
of daily life,

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.170
which not all Mormons are like.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:13.020
But I don't see that our
government protects them.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.840
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Because one
thing if they should do more

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.240 position:56%
to protect people who want to leave.

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.550
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Well,
I don't first of all,

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.460
I know a lot of people
who have left.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.540
I'm only speaking now of America.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.230
I know a lot of people who
have left the Mormon Church.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:32.130
They used to come to our
center for inquiry meetings.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:34.870
I know a lot of people
who have left,

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.270
Satmar and Lubab, your
Hasidic Judaism.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:41.580
And there was tremendous
social pressure placed on them,

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.360
but I don't know what
our government could do

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.660
to make you exercise
freedom of conscience.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:54.280
It's very painful, some of the most
painful interviews I have ever had,

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.740
have been with these
people and what they went

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.240
through because they were not
just leaving their religion.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.160
They were in most cases,
leaving their families

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.540
and the only world
they've ever known.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.950
But I don't think there's
anything government could do.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.550
The government has done one thing
it can do our government has never

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:17.650
for example honored as many,
many ultra-Orthodox Jews try

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:19.990
to prevent women from
getting a divorce,

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:23.180
by not giving them a
gift, a religious divorce.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.900
Our courts have always said
that religious divorce,

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.070
laws governing religious marriage

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:33.830
and religious laws have no
civil standing in other words,

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:37.620
your divorce according to the
laws of whatever state you live

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.160
in whether your husband
gives you a get or not.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.320
But what our government
could do, much less should do

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.590
about giving a woman the
courage to forsake a religion,

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.120
it says only a man
can grant a divorce.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.870
I don't really see what
our government could do.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:59.980
One thing I think that it should
do is I think we should be much

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.670
tougher, have many fewer
religious exemptions

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:08.420
for things regarding medical
procedures and vaccination.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.820
And we've-- This is still a
problem even though it's not as bad

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.960
as it was only 10 years
ago because custody,

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.840
medical custody can be
taken away from parents

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:24.950
who deny lifesaving standard
medical care to their children.

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:27.630
But that's the only place I think

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.030
that the government
could effectively act.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.500
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Let
me ask you a question

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.120
since there's nobody
at the mic right now.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:39.020
You write, you do not consider any
form of secular thought a religion,

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.410
unless the secular
ideology possesses a civil

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:43.870
enforcement mechanism.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.490
I'm sure you know there's been
a big debate in this country

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.290
around separation of church
and state that in fact,

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:54.050
secularism does have
the status of a religion

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:58.300
and when the United States
forbids for example, bible,

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.820
when the US government forbids
bible reading in schools,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.380
it's actually enforcing secularism

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.300
to the disadvantage
of other religions.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.640
This was an argument
that Potter Stewart made

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.940
in the 1960's in the Supreme Court.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.070
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Yes and I
think it's a wrong argument

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:17.420
because the purpose of
public schools is not

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.410
to teach or foster religion.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:24.570
Not to say that when America was
an entirely Protestant country,

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:30.870
it wasn't taking very for granted
to study let's say the bible

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.820
or to recite prayers,
Christian prayers originating

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:40.440
or to recite prayers to God that
affects all children who are not

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.270
of the majority religion.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:46.240
And I'll say something
else also and this is for,

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.330
not everybody here is an
atheist or an Agnostic.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:55.780
I think a lot of this idea that the
government is enforcing secularism,

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.980
by not allowing religion
in that kind

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.710
of a public space is
particularly important.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:07.590
It's in a way, a confession on
the part of some religious people

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.130
of the ineffectiveness of religion,

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:14.070
because if there is anything it
seems to me, it's an obligation

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:19.150
of a parent to do, it is to try
and pass on what you believe

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:23.390
as I don't have children,
but if I did, I certainly,

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:28.220
I don't for example
understand how someone I know,

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:32.540
I know for example an atheist who
is married to a devout Catholic.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:39.000 position:56%
And they both tell their children
what they think and I can understand

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.320
that because to me, a person's
religious beliefs are deeply

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.960
important and while I have lots of
friends who are observant Catholics

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:53.700
and Jews and Protestants, I would
find it impossible to raise a child

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.530
to believe for example in the
virgin birth and all of that.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.680
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Or to make
up his or her own mind.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.180
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Or to,
or children can make up,

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.110
can make up their own minds.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:10.840
They will eventually, whatever you
do, but I would not want to see,

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.780
I-- my child in any case.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.900
I think it is the function of
the church and the family to pass

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.400
on their religious beliefs
to the next generation.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.510
It is not the function of a
public school and I don't think

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:27.660
that makes secularism a
religion, because not studying,

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.910
say the Christian or the Hebrew
bible or the Koran is not saying

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:34.510
that those things aren't good.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.460
It is saying that we don't
teach this in school.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:44.420
I don't teach for exam-- but
what else isn't taught in school?

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.210
It's the function of the home.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:51.080
To some extent, in school, you may
teach people about sexual anatomy,

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.650
but you may not tell
him whether you should

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.730
or you shouldn't use birth control.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.690
That's not anything I
think that is the function

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.250
of a school unless
it's a medical clinic

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.270
for teenagers who come and ask.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.470
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Well that's a hot
button topic subject [inaudible].

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.970
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: No, but
it's related to religion.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:11.270
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Right, yeah.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.750
Sir, we have just a few minutes
left so-- we have two minutes left.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.490
&gt;&gt; In recent times, there's
very really dramatic decrease

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:19.640
in the adherence to Christianity
in Europe, I'm just curious

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.340
about your respective
on the reasons for that.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.150
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: Well,
I think actually--

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:31.230
there's been actually a fairly
dramatic decrease in America too.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:36.080
It doesn't mean they're not
religious but 25% of Americans,

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:41.330
almost 25% now say that religion
no longer plays an improtant role

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.620
in their daily lives so that they--

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.680
they're not, it doesn't
mean they're atheists again.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.940
And that they're not
members of any church.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.960
I think this process is
far more advanced in Europe

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.230
because of Europe's history
of religious persecution

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.420
and separation of church and state.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.660
Europeans who leave their
default church, so Catholicism

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.290
in Southern Europe,
Protestantism in Northern Europe,

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.380
tend to go straight to secularism.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:11.730
In other words, you don't get very
many, many Lutherans in Germany--

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.020
in the Lutheran part of Germany
converting to Catholicism.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.820
You don't get very many Catholics
in Italy converting to Judaism

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:23.440
or wichenism [assumed
spelling] or Islam or whatever.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.380
They go straight to secularism
but that's because I think

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:31.260 position:56%
that if you come from a country with
a history of religious persecution,

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.930
you tend not to be as
eager as Americans are

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:39.340
to substitute one religion
for another.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:45.360 position:56%
I mean, look at Europeans, Americans
often, they're mixed couples

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.860
who choose a third religion like
Senator Harry Reid and his wife

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.000
who was an Orthodox Jewish family.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.060
He was raised a Protestant,
they decided to choose Mormonism

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.280
as the third way when
they got married.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.890
Now, I think frankly this did
have something to do with the fact

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:06.940
that there's a large
Mormon vote in Nevada

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.360
and Harry Reid was
a funny politician.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.220
But even if there weren't politics
involved, that would seem insane

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.990
to most of the Europeans I know,
whatever their religion is,

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.780
so you just go out and pluck
a third religion, you know,

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.000
out of the air, you know?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.300
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Well listen,

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.240
we've only scratched the
surface of this subject.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.600
&gt;&gt; Susan Jacoby: This is the
best interview, I've ever had.

But there's so much more-- there
is so much more in this book.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.700
It's really a fascinating book.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.210
It covers so much territories, this
then took many years to write it.

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.220
So thank you so much, it's
been great, thanks for coming.
