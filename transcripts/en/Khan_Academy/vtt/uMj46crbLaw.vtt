00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:04.083
- [Voiceover] What is
the measure of angle EAC?

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:06.494
So we have this symbol
here, which means angle,

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:09.600
and then these three letters, EAC.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.732
Now to measure angle EAC, we need to first

00:00:12.732 --> 00:00:16.065
find angle EAC down here on our picture,

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:19.241
and the way we can do that
is use these three letters

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:21.952
and we're gonna go in the
order that they're given to us.

00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:24.169
So the first letter we're told is E,

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.556
so the first letter we'll
find down here is E.

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:32.306
From there, we'll go to
the second letter, A.

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:37.275
And then finally, we go
to our last letter, C.

00:00:38.408 --> 00:00:40.817
Again, in the order that
they were told to us.

00:00:40.817 --> 00:00:44.150
So this opening right here is our angle.

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:49.049
We wanna know how many
degrees is this opening?

00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:52.873
The most common way to measure an angle

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:54.384
would be to use a protractor,

00:00:54.384 --> 00:00:56.105
but we're not given a protractor,

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:59.452
so we can't do that, but we
do have enough information

00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:03.432
on this diagram down here to solve this.

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:07.015
What we can see is that
our large angle EAC

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.948
is made up of two smaller angles.

00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:12.115
This first one, angle EAD.

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:19.292
Right here, angle EAD...

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.646
plus from there, it
picks up with angle DAC.

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:29.869
Angle DAC.

00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:38.432
These two angles, this
first one from here to here,

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:41.217
and then the second from here to here,

00:01:41.217 --> 00:01:45.181
when they're combined,
they make the same size

00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:47.061
opening as our angle.

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:49.488
So if we can combine these two angles,

00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:52.334
we will know the measure of our angle

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:54.168
because again, these two combined

00:01:54.168 --> 00:01:56.668
are equal to our entire angle.

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.124
So let's do that, starting with EAD,

00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:02.914
we can see we're told, it's 60 degrees.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.164
That's a 60 degree opening.

00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:10.183
Plus angle DAC has a 75 degree opening,

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:16.563
and so if we combine that,
if we go 60 degrees to here

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.115
plus another 75 down to here,

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:22.647
we've covered our entire angle.

00:02:22.647 --> 00:02:26.064
Our entire opening in 60 plus another 75.

00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:31.730
So we can add these to solve
for the measure of our angle.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.313
Six tens plus seven
tens is 13 tens or 130.

00:02:37.988 --> 00:02:39.949
13 and then that zero is there

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:41.402
because we're talking about tens.

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:44.902
Plus zero ones and five ones is five ones.

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:50.646
And so 130 plus five is 135 degrees.

00:02:54.046 --> 00:02:58.592
So the measure of our
entire angle, angle EAC

00:02:58.592 --> 00:02:59.842
is 135 degrees.
