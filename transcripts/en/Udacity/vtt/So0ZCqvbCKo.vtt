00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.510
I know we just learned a lot of new terminology,

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.820
but hopefully you're able to breeze right through this one.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.570
Now we have three scenarios, a lot of transcription, a

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.160
medium amount of transcription, and no transcription. If we need

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.000
to match the scenario on the right with the scenario

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.640
on the left, so which scenario on the left would

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.320
give us, let's say the least amount of transcription. Well,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.970
obviously if our silencer is bound, that silence is transcription.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.390
Enhancer enhances transcription. So if we've silenced our

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.189
transcription and we don't have anything to help

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.130
enhance, this is probably the scenario which we're

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.610
going to have little to no transcription at

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.780
all. The scenario above it, however, we have

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.210
the enhancer bound and the silencer's unbound. Remember

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.815
the proteins mitigate the effects ,of what these

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:51.050
non-coding regions can do. So a bound enhancer is

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.370
going to enhance transcription, an unbound silencer won't be

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.190
able to silence transcription. And so this is going to be

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.980
our most active transcription here, lots of transcription. So

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.620
the answer to this one is A. And that leaves

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.570
this last scenario, where we don't have a bound

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.260
enhancer, we don't have a bound silencer. The promoter is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.430
left to initiate whatever transcription it can on its

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.760
own. And so we reach the scenario of some transcription.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.990
It depends entirely on the promoter region itself. But in general, there's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.460
going to be some transcription that happens at the site. But because there's no

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.320
enhancer or silencer bound, we're not going to have these extremes show

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.320
up, where we have a lot

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.290
of transcription happening, or no transcription happening.
