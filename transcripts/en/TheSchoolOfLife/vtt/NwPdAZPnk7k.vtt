00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:05.999
We're likely to have grown up thinking that the mainstream Media was our friend

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.570
The common sense natural judge of everything that matters and is important and a reliable guide to existence

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.049
But we might also be realizing that isn't quite true

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.219
Let's take a moment to remind ourselves of some of the things that might be slightly or even very wrong with Mainstream Media

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.879
It's pretty easy to do no one can pass such headlines without giving way to a click

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.870
in order to gain money from advertisers or governments the media has to hook us in and it knows our minds are helpless in the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.410
face of such headlines

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.250
We look to the media to tell us about what matters, but it cares predominantly about what will excite us

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.090
Sometimes the two categories coincide what's most important in the world [maybe] what's most immediately exciting too?

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.489
But usually that's not the case

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.090
We're built to have an almost irresistible attraction to certain stories involving power fame disaster and sex and yet

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.709
We're tempted to yawn about schools developing world problems, and the money supply. We're not evil

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.510
It's just the equivalent of our fatal weakness for processed sugar fat and salt and the media does everything it can to exploit this

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.539
In theory the media has a deeply important function to play in a democracy

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:25.379
It's meant to direct a mass audience to engage with the greatest problems in Society so as to push politicians to make necessary changes

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.229
But as it is the media is obsessed with scandals it focuses relentlessly on the rather thrilling

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.339
Misdemeanors of a few people rather than the large systemic failings that are harder to see and far less sexy to describe

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.689
It gives the population of feeling that it's on the side of the little guy against the big guy

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:51.420
Far from it the sacrifice [of] the odd bigwig [in] a scandal and nothing and reliably take our eyes of pushing for proper large-scale

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.200
improvements

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.839
Most problems in society take time to fix but by constantly changing the topic of National

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.919
Conversation the Media ensures that nothing will remain a priority for long

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.149
One always makes more money getting someone scared about bugs viruses

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.520
Explosions than getting them to a sane correct assessment of the dangers facing them and a melancholy acceptance of death and compromise in General

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.530
One makes more money getting people furious than patient before the challenges of writing or wrong or philosophical in the face of human evil

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.499
It reports in impassive terms about adultery in Hollywood marriage

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.070
Or the bad behavior of a model it pretends to care about so-called

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.040
Transgressions while not admitting that it's at the same time

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.600
Titillating the audience most of whom deepen their unconscious would love a chance to do what's being condemned on the surface the media therefore?

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.119
Hypocritically satisfies both our fantasies and on need to think ourselves normal and respectable

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.609
It's called the news because of an obsession with the notion that the new and important go together

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.200
But much that just happened is far less important that many things that occurred thousands of years ago

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.160
There are things we need that lie further back the most significant bits of information could not always have happened in the last 24 hours

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520
as the news pretends

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.700
When the media is in a serious mood, it will give us six thousand word essays on Global warming

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.969
but [only] a handful of people read it seems the choice is either between a sexy and banal or the serious and

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.730
Starchy in the [utopia] what we need is the most serious issues presented in the most engaging ways

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.019
It's not enough [for] serious journalists to plunk the important stories before us

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.400
They need to work doubly hard to get the story and then also to make it exciting as exciting as the latest from Taylor Swift

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.279
There's nothing wrong with having famous people in a society the reason why celebrities

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.970
Become a dirty word is that we've got the wrong celebs in front of us. We need the media to anoint people with fame

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.260
But fame for doing noble and good things that really help a nation we don't need to get rid of celebrities. We need better varieties

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.239
We like to think we've got a good media because it's free freedom is a wonderful privilege. No doubt but on its own. It's nothing

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.799
We need a media that isn't just free but also good that is able to direct a mass audience towards

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.339
What truly counts which is as it's been since the days of plato

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.489
Justice truth and wisdom
