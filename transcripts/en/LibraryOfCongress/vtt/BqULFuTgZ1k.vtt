&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Well, welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.810
Good afternoon.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.150
My name is Grant Harris.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.380
I am chief of the
European Division.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.190
And I thank you for joining
us today for this event,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.710
International Writing Program,
Celebrating Women's Voices.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.190
The Library of Congress'
Poetry and Literature Center

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.800
and the European Division
cosponsor this event

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.340
in partnership with the
International Writing Program

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.890
at the University of Iowa and
with the Bureau of Educational

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.240
and Cultural Affairs,
which is part

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.090
of the U.S. Department of State.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.700
The European Division is
excited to be part of this.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.310
We enjoy having programs
with the Poetry

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.420
and Literature Center, and it's
great to be able to collaborate

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.920
with the University of
Iowa's literature program

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.490
and the Department of State.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.810
The library has extensive
collections from

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.320
and about every country
in the world,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.210
and that is certainly
true for the countries

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.040
of our three women writers
who will present today.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.370
Having these poets, short story
writers, and novelists here

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.860
from Macedonia, Russia,
and Ukraine,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.690
countries where Slavic
languages are used,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.300
helps bring our collections
alive.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.980
The library already has
numerous publications by two

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.160
of the writers, and we
actually have a couple

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.220
of donations just
now from the third,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.860
so we're well represented.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.530
We've collected the
whole set now.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.640
So, please know that the
collections of the Library

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.710
of Congress are open to
everyone and we would like you

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.980
to come back and use them.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.620
I remind you now to
turn off your cellphones

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.010
and recording devices for
the duration of the program.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.640
Also, please know that
this is being recorded

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.200
for a later Library
of Congress webcast.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.830
When we have the question
and answer session

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.070
after the main presentations,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.630
understand that if you ask a
question you are consenting

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.600
to be part of the webcast.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.190
I now give the floor
to Mr. Robert Augburn,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.010
Director of the Office
of Citizen Exchanges

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.510
at the U.S. Department of State.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.500
[ Applause ]

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.840
&gt;&gt; Robert Augburn: Well,
thank you very much, Grant,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.720
and good afternoon, everyone.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600
On behalf of the U.S.
State Department,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.330
I would like to thank the
Library of Congress so much

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.620
for hosting us today,
and for all of you

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.360
for coming out and attending.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.320
It's especially exciting to
welcome the prestigious writers

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.160
from the IWP, the
International Writing Program,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.490
who will share their work in a
place that, here in the Library

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.450
of Congress, that is so
significant to our country.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.730
I'd like to congratulate
all the writers who are here

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.850
on your selection
and participation

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.020
in this year's IWP
fall residency,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.930
and we're very honored that
you could take the time

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.800
to participate in it.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.100
You know, we, at the
State Department,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.290
as the representatives of
America abroad, we get it.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.600
We understand the
value of literature,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.940
freedom of expression, and
creativity, and we believe

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.430
that this program helps

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.360
to support strong
civil society voices

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.410
in communities around the world.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.620
So, once again, I'm grateful
that you've taken time

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.070
to participate in the program
and really look forward

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.750
to hearing about your
experiences here in the U.S.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.030
and some the influences
behind your work.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.970
As I've hoped you've
experienced during your time

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.900
in the U.S. this autumn,
we're a country of many voices

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.310
and many stories,
and we're delighted

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.280
that during your
time here in America

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.310
that you've had the opportunity
to add your own stories

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.750
and experience firsthand
some of ours.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.840
We're also, at the State
Department, very honored

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.190
to be working with the
prestigious International

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.810
Writing Program at the
University of Iowa.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.100
The IWP staff has
just done wonderful

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.160
in their continued
work on the program.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.340
And through our partnership
with the IWP we hope

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.070
to enable writers
around the world

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.980
to strengthen their voices.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.840
You know, for more than 60
years the U.S. government has

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.090
supported exchange programs
that have brought citizens

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.620
from around the world to the
U.S., and has sent millions

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.190
of Americans abroad, and
writers are often the people

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.750
who shape the narratives
in their countries.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.550
So, your willingness to share
your own expertise is very

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.390
much appreciated.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.580
It's my pleasure now to
hand over the microphone

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.620
to Professor Christopher
Merrill.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.150
He's the Director of the IWP
at the University of Iowa.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.120
He has conducted cultural
diplomacy missions to more

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.240
than 50 countries, and
readers around the world,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.970
in more than 40 languages,
have enjoyed your poetry

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.940
and your nonfiction and
you've done wonderful service

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.340
for the UN National
Commission for UNESCO,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.640
and you're an appointee

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.390
to the National Council
on the Humanities.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.510
So, thank you so much.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.150
[ Applause ]

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.450
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Thank you, Robert.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.750
Thank you, Grant.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.050
Welcome all.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.090
I also want to acknowledge
partners here

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.430
from the U.S. State Department,
Jay Rahman, Nina Murray,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.350
Jill Staggs, our
longtime Program Officer.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.480
My gratitude to Rob
Caspar [assumed spelling]

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.780
and Anya Creighton
[assumed spelling],

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.420
who make this place available
for the writers to come

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.400
at the very end of a
three-month long residency.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.330
The writers, this year, we had
28 writers from 27 countries.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.640
We say to them on the first
day of the fall residency

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.280
that their main mission
is to write.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.250
I hope that by the
end of the time

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.640
in Iowa city they will have
written many new pages,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.580
have made many new friends, and
gathered many new impressions

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.510
about life in America and
about the literary traditions

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.070
of the writers they
share this space with.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.240
We also give them a
bit of a busy schedule.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.340
We don't demand that
they do everything,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.840
but we try to make it
as enticing as possible,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.540
so time does run short, I think.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.180
So, today the writers you see
here on the stage are going

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.780
to give short readings and then
we'll open it up for discussion.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.080
I'll have some questions,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.860
but I hope that this can
become a robust conversation

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.840
between all of us.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.490
Just a quick introduction
of the writers.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.440
You have fuller bios here.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.210
Alisa Ganieva, right here to
my left, is a fiction writer,

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.630
critic, journalist,
from Dagestan in Russia.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.530
Among the books that she has
published in English are Bride

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.250
and Groom and The
Mountain and The Wall.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.810
Her very first book;
however, Salaam, Dalgat,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.930
which tells the story of the
life of a young Dagestani male,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.980
brought her to prominence
in an interesting way.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.670
It was published under
a male pseudonym.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.580
It won the prestigious
debut prize out of something

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.350
like 65,000 entrants,
and there was a lag time

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.980
between the announcement
of the winner

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.320
and the ceremony giving her
the prize, during which a lot

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.550
of speculation abounded
in Moscow about,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.500
who is this young
Dagestani male writer?

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.450
So, you can imagine the
surprise when Alisa turned

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.850
up to accept the prize.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.290
Next to her is Rumena
Buzarovska,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.270
who is a Macedonian
fiction writer, editor,

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.430
translator, and professor.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.430
She has a Ph.D. from the United
States in American literature.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.210
I learned over the
course of the residency

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.290
that in profound ways she
embodies that very conflict

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.070
that we know about between
Macedonia and Greece

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.160
over the name of this country,
because on her mother's side

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.470
of the family she is Greek.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.600
Her first book in English
translation will come

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.180
out next year called,
My Husband.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.530
And sitting next to her
is Kateryna Babkina,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.150
fiction writer, poet,
playwright,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.210
filmmaker from Ukraine.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.640
She published her first
book at the age of 17,

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.780
and for American writers
that's enough to make you want

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.910
to slit your wrists to hear
stories like that [laughter].

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.170
And part of what we do in
the IWP in a UNESCO city

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.990
of literature, as Iowa city is,

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.650
is we hope that we have
cross-fertilization

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.670
of international writers in
discourse with American writers,

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.140
and when they hear that somebody
like Kateryna published a book

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.070
at 17, you can imagine the
collective sigh or chagrin.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.140
She's published three short
story collections, four volumes

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.790
of poetry, two novels, and
during the fall residency we got

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.960
to see part of a film that
she made, the proceeds

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.170
from which were dedicated to
raising money for the treatment

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:43.490
of pancreatic cancer for
children in the Ukraine.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.110
So, Alisa, Rumena,
Kateryna, the floor is yours.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.410
First Alisa.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.870
&gt;&gt; Alisa Ganieva:
Hello, everyone.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.100
It's a tremendous honor for
me to be in this library,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.800
in this greatest
library in the world.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.220
And thank you, Chris, for
your generous introduction.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.070
I'll read two short
excerpts from my book,

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.160
which is called Bride and Groom.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.980
And this, you may guess, from
the title, it's dedicated

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.190
to the matrimonial institution
in my native region of Caucasus,

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.940
or Dagestan, which is
in the south of Russia,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.240
and which became a part

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.560
of Russia 150 years
ago, quite recently.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.340
Iyeda [assumed spelling] strode

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.410
over to us tapping her
heels hollowly on the floor

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.890
and issued a command, don't
you dare try to keep it secret.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.290
If you meet a guy in
Shala, tell him the truth.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.670
I'm not going to
meet anyone else,

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.980
Amishka [assumed spelling],
buried her face into the pillow

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.720
and burst out sobbing again.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.600
What do you mean, won't meet
anyone, thundered Iyeda,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.040
though I'm sure she
didn't believe it herself.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.200
First of all, you could
still get Kareem [assumed

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.500
spelling] back.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.100
Threaten him, pin
him to the wall.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.320
No way, he'll tell everyone.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.720
He's going to do that anyway,
I couldn't stop myself.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.220
He's already proclaimed
it to the rooftops

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.190
that you've lost your owner.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.390
Iyeda jabbed me with her elbow,
sat down next to Amishka,

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.940
and stroked her on the back.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.620
Don't be upset, Amishka,
it won't help.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.100
There are all kinds
of guys out there.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.070
There are even some
here in the settlement

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.940
who could care less whether
you are virgin or not.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.810
You're lying, Amishka,
blurted out amid her tears.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.810
Lying? Take, Rusik
[assumed spelling] who lives

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.340
across the tracks, the one
who takes tango lessons.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.180
Boo-hoo [phonetic],
Amishka just kept bawling.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.110
Look at her, boo-hoo, though
in this case you're right,

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.620
they that Rusik doesn't
believe in Allah.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.480
But there are others, Mordan
[assumed spelling], cool guys,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.430
but the main thing is, don't
try to keep it a secret.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.400
Why, Amishka looked
up from the pillow?

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.100
Well, first of all, Kareem
might go see your new fiance

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.280
and blab everything,
or show at tape.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.060
Did he take any videos?

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.170
I don't know, Amishka
burst into tears again.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.290
Well, let's say he
didn't take any pictures

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:24.040
and won't tell anyone, but
then doctors might let it slip.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.110
What do you mean, doctors?

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.410
Just listen.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.590
One of our relatives in the
city found a fiance for her son.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.890
Everything's fine.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.290
Everyone is happy.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.890
And after the wedding, a
month goes by, and she runs

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.690
into a gynecologist
friend of hers.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.040
The friend congratulates her
and starts questioning her

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.710
about the girl, where they
found her, what her name is,

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.780
and it turns out that this
fiance was one of her clients

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.670
and she had come in
for a hymenoplasty.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.250
So, this relative goes
ballistic, rushes home,

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.760
grabs her daughter-in-law
by the hair, and throws her

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.270
out the door, and
she was pregnant,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.880
though our relatives
refused to recognize the baby

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.800
because they didn't
know whose it was.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.000
Did her parents take
her back, I asked?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.840
Of course not.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.290
She had to go to
Rostov or to Astrakhan

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.890
to start a whole new life.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.590
Amishka lay forlorn and crushed.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.570
She had been her
family's favorite.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.320
It was hard to imagine
her [inaudible]

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.940
out of the comfortable life

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.690
without friends or
anyone who cared.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.750
There are some girls, she
sat quietly and haltingly,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.590
stopping to swallow
the lump in his throat,

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.700
like that prostitute,
Angela [assumed spelling].

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.010
They run around,
ride in guys cars

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.940
with practically nothing
on, spend all their time

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.940
in nightclubs, and then,
as though nothing happened,

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.230
they put on a veil and become
someone's second or third wife.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.010
Don't judge veiled women based

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.910
on Angela's example,
Iyeda frowned.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.210
That's not the point.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.140
It's just that even the
worst of them can get lucky.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.490
But, me, I fell in love,
made a mistake, trusted him.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.080
I also remembered Angela,
she was the daughter

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.760
of a divorced woman who worked

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.870
as a janitor in the
local prison.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.870
She was the talk of the town.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.720
Rumor had it that [inaudible]
himself had seduced Angela back

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.390
in her youth.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.820
After that she passed
from one man to another,

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.480
evidently feeling no
shame for her behavior.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.780
I had seen her cruising
down [inaudible] Avenue

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.640
in the backseat of a car full
of carousing young men howling

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.880
with laughter, or coming back
from the city on the main road

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.230
for some reason on foot in a
short skirt, smiling alluringly

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.410
at all the guys she passed
under a chorus of catcalls.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.420
What? Did Angela take the
veil, I couldn't help asking?

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.440
She did, blabbered Amishka,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.570
and some bigshot crook took
her as his second wife.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.120
He comes out to visit
her sometimes.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.430
Impossible.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.390
My thoughts were all jumbled up.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.760
Maybe you should
take the veil, too?

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.630
[inaudible] I was angry.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.710
[Inaudible] what are
you talking about?

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:04.370
If Amishka covers it's not
because that Angela did it.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.820
I heard a shrieking
sound and shuddered.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.230
Amishka was laughing
hysterically, snorting

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.870
and beating her hands
and feet on the bed.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.450
She was trying to say something,

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.500
but we couldn't understand
a word.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.310
Iyeda ran out again
and brought some water.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.230
The poor girl calmed
down for a second,

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.450
but then burst into tears again.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.810
What are you blabbering about?

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:28.010
Stop howling and tell
us, Iyeda chided her.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.940
Amishka buried her face
in the pillow again.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.130
It's just that I think I'll
have to be part of a hard-sell,

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:39.460
forced on men as a bonus, or
like [inaudible], remember her.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.860
What, [inaudible]?

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.750
What? You don't remember her?

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.510
They lived at the station.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.540
Her eldest sister was gorgeous,
but [inaudible] was cross-eyed,

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.500
scrawny, and hideous to look at,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.500
though basically a
nice person [laughter].

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.830
And? And, so, these matchmakers
come from [inaudible].

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.650
They are after the eldest
sister, the pretty one.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.640
But on the day of the wedding
the bride's mother switched her

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.290
out for [inaudible], because
no one would have taken

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.790
her otherwise.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.390
She was under the bridal veil

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.260
and so they didn't
notice anything.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.560
So, then what?

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.520
Did they send her back?

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.890
No, they left her
in [inaudible].

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.300
The mother-in-law
taunted her for five years

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.030
until she gave her a grandson.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.630
She was a kind person and,
ultimately, they got used

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.130
to her, came to love her,

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.780
and now supposedly her husband
treats her like a queen.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.340
So, you see, I smiled, a
happy ending [laughter].

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:40.600
And there's another excerpt.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.250
After Marat's [assumed
spelling] mother got out

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.230
and they pulled away
from the store,

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.540
the two friends were
finally alone.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.040
[Inaudible] burst out laughing.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.340
What made you think, Marat,

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.010
that my cousin would
be right for you?

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.680
She's a real dragon.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.080
Don't you remember that
time she came out to see me?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.590
Marat did remember.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.340
Sabrina [assumed spelling]
had come just once.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.180
They were about nine years old.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.740
The girls had a tea
party for their dolls

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.230
in [inaudible] making
[inaudible] cutlets and soup

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.930
out of water and
soggy bread crumbs.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.530
Little Sabrina spent the whole
time whining and complaining.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.120
Nothing satisfied her.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.680
She needed to switch the dolls.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.060
She refused to be the guest and
insisted on being the hostess.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.900
Then the boys raided the party
like a plague of locusts,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.170
knocking the neatly groomed and
dressed dolls from their chairs,

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.280
tipping the table over,
sending the refreshments flying,

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.570
and made off with the soup,
the only thing that was edible.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.680
Marat seemed to recall that
[inaudible] had been with them.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.460
[Inaudible] assured
that he hadn't been.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.680
You are mixing him up with
Abduliv [assumed spelling].

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.610
Really? Maybe so.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.620
How's Abduliv these days?

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.920
He's got his engagement
party in a few days.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.540
You're going to, Aunt Hadija
[assumed spelling] said so.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.930
Oh, yes, I remember.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.230
Yes, I am.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.910
He's so gullible.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.680
I could make him
believe anything,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.460
all kinds of weird stories that
I had heard in court, though,

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.190
who knows, maybe they were true.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.980
Anything can happen.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.990
For example, filthy stuff,
you wouldn't like it.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.170
I expect nothing less from
you, Shah [assumed spelling].

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.220
All right then, he's one.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.280
My colleagues told me
about a security guard

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.870
who raped a woman, a janitor,
in a village school, or rather,

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.760
she said that he had raped her,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.140
but the guard claimed
that she consented.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.540
That's the second time today
this topic has come up,

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.880
Marat smirked.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.240
Anyway, this janitor stands by
her story, says she screamed

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.870
and tried to get away.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.730
They decide to check it out.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.600
The teachers would
have heard her

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.710
if she really had made a fuss.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.850
They conducted an
experiment, Shah chortled.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.410
What's so funny?

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.850
Picture this, they set up
everything the way it was

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:51.240
on that day and had them
act the whole thing out,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.470
and the defendant up and
raped her again [laughter].

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.050
What the -- I kid you not.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.660
They fired the prosecutor
for it.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.370
Are all your fables
below the belt?

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.770
[Inaudible] don't play naive.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.280
There was one more story.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.350
This one supposedly
took place in the city

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.430
in the police detective's
office, also rape.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.400
Shah, who does a better job

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.610
of entertaining you
than I do, Marat?

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.480
So, anyway, this one
involves a carrot.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.070
It was material evidence
and was on a shelf

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.310
in the investigator's office.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.750
This coworker comes
in and he's hungry.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.000
Don't tell me he
eats the carrot?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.300
Shah [inaudible] again.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.030
They drove past construction
sites, canopied [inaudible],

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.530
and highway petrol
posts barricaded

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.570
on all sides with sandbags.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.400
Drowsy soldiers holding
automatic weapons peered

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.850
out from behind the sandbags.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.920
So, who is Abduliv
going to marry?

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.580
Marat leaned back in his
seat, a regular girl.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.120
I, myself, helped investigate,
check up on her past.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.910
Everything nice and clean.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.930
Though Abduliv has gotten
himself in some deep shit.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.420
There's a girl on the side and
she's about to have a baby.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.850
What? He's a jackass.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.120
When we were in graduate school
he kept wanting to copy me,

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.090
envying my success
with the ladies,

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.530
and he would spend
his entire stipend

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.640
on this one prostitute
once a month,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.650
because that was the only
way he could get laid.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.910
Shah, again, [inaudible]
his strong, white teeth.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.820
I knew about that, Marat said.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.600
I used to get on
his case about it.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.890
Know what else he used to
do, Shah was on a roll?

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:34.020
He'd buy some Viagra in the
drugstore, gulp it down,

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.690
then go to the [inaudible]
to the prostitute.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.750
The point was, he could plow
her several times in a row

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.530
and save money that
way [laughter].

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.920
Marat couldn't stop himself and
joined in friend's laughter.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.570
Abduliv really was an idiot.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.220
What about the girl
who got pregnant?

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.470
Did the -- did he buy her off?

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.250
It's the prostitute [inaudible]
and she's threatened to come

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.620
to the matchmaking ceremony

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.310
with her brothers
and ruin everything.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.620
Does the bride know about it?

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.140
Not yet, but she will soon,

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.030
Shah smacked his
lips and fell silent.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.830
Thank you.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:16.500
[ Applause ]

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.860
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: Hello.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.160
I'm very honored to be here.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.150
Thank you for inviting me, and
also I'm very happy to be part

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.410
of the International
Writing Program.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:35.200
On a matrimonial note, I
will also read a short story

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.840
that is the opening sort of
my book called My Husband,

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.070
which is 11 short stories
narrated from the perspective

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.300
of the wife in the marriage.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:52.750
And this one was written
in bout of kind of anger,

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.880
and it then propelled
the entire book.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.910
My husband, The Poet.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.550
I met Gohran [assumed
spelling] at a poetry festival.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.510
His hair was already
turning white.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.810
It's totally white now.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.350
And I think he hopes this adds

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.010
to his new sex appeal,
as he once called it.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.000
He said it as a joke, but I
think he actually meant it.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.100
I wanted to ask if his
thinning hair and his scalp,

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.940
with the color and sheen
of lumpy, hardened wax,

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.000
were also part of his new sex
appeal, but I stopped myself.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.660
He's not good at
taking criticism.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.330
He gets mad quickly, and
when he's mad he starts

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.630
with the insults.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.660
This lasts for days until
I do something self-abasing

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.070
to stop him from being
unbearable, such as,

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.610
accidentally reciting a
line from one of his poems.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.860
The other day he got really
mad at me when I refused

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.270
to read the poems he had
written the night before.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.710
I don't have time now.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.610
How about tomorrow, I told him?

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.270
So, you don't have
time for three poems?

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.060
I felt the anger in his voice

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.610
and right away felt
sorry I turned him down,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.930
but it was already too late.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.000
From now on, he'd take
anything I'd say the wrong way,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.880
so I kept quiet.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.900
All right then, go and
nerd out all you want,

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.690
he said, slamming the door.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.580
He tells me to nerd out whenever
I'm preparing to teach one

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.880
of my classes, meaning

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.710
if I really knew
history I wouldn't have

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.610
to prepare for class.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.970
You either know it or you
don't, he once told me

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.530
with a rude look on his face.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.910
When it comes to his poems
I really don't know --

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.680
I really don't want to read
them, let alone listen to them.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.600
He used to subject me
to that torture, too.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.240
When we still loved each
other and before we had kids,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.280
we would make love and afterward
he would whisper poems in my ear

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.090
as we lay there all
sweaty and out of breath.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.820
His poems were always
about flowers of some kind,

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.650
about orchids, because they
reminded him of pussies,

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.900
about southern winds,
or about the sea,

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.290
and there'd always be a
reference to some exotic spices

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.260
and fabrics, like
cinnamon and velvet.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:58.500
Sorry. Something along the lines
of, my taste was like cinnamon,

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.690
my skin was like velvet, for
example, or that my hair smelled

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.700
like the sea, which
I know isn't true

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.550
since my mother told
me that my hair stank.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.970
Either way, in those moments,

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.060
his words used to
really turn me on.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.580
I'd get excited and want
to make love to him again,

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.850
and even though he often
couldn't do it right away,

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.280
I would repeat his
images and words

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.400
to myself and get turned on.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.300
He doesn't do that
anymore, thank the Lord.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.030
I find his poetry so
repulsive that I don't want

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.730
to read a single line of it, let
alone listen to him reciting it.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.190
Sadly, that's something
I still have to do since,

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.910
as I already said, Gohran
tends to get really mad

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.000
and I don't want to expose
our kids to these fights,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.940
or myself for that matter.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.140
Ever since we stopped making
love as much as before,

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.630
he's been reading his
poems aloud to me instead

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.670
of letting me read
them on my own.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.860
I'd watch him standing in
the middle of the living room

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.140
under the bright light
of the ceiling lamp,

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.330
which emphasized bulbous
nose and ashy complexion,

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.030
and it slowly started
to dawn on me

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.150
that his poetry really
wasn't very good at all.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.050
Much of it isn't about
anything other than himself

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.070
and how he writes poetry.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.700
I think it seriously
turns him on, literally.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.880
Here's an example.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.600
The scent she carries
is like autumn,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.150
dissolving like drops
of rain in her eyes.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.050
The words make this poem mine.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.870
Maybe this isn't
the best example,

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.890
but it's if the only
one I know by heart.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.190
Chris, you're making me --

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.020
I know why you're
laughing [laughter].

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.820
I'm sorry.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.340
Because I sometimes happen

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.960
to accidentally recite
the last three lines,

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.990
the words [laughter] make
this poem mine, in an effort

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.230
to get him to stop
being mad at me.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.620
I hum them rather, which
especially strokes his ego

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.770
since he's always
wanted a musician

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.840
to put his poetry to music.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.620
He doesn't realize this
would actually be impossible.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.890
His poems have no rhythm
and often no meaning either.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.600
They're just strings of empty
words carelessly thrown together

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.150
into verses so that the
uninitiated can spot some exotic

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.870
word like cinnamon or velvet

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.040
and think his poetry
really is all that.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.180
That's what I used to think,
too, back when I was still young

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.140
and stupid and fell
for such tricks.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.930
God, was I stupid.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.230
It really is incredible.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.400
I just can't forgive
myself for it.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.500
Anyway, I was talking
about how we met.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.110
As I already said, it
was at a poetry festival.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.670
I was working there
as a translator,

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.150
which was something
I used to do as a way

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.340
to make some money before
I started to teach history.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.140
One evening in the lobby of the
big hotel where all the poets

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.570
and translators were staying,
we all gathered and sang songs.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.540
I now realized that all
the poets were showing off.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.930
Not only did they write
poetry, these sensitive souls,

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.040
but they also understood
traditional music.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.630
They had a musical ear
and they could sing.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.190
That was when Gohran
appeared, too.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:45.720
Fitting with the
style of the evening,

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.580
he wore a white shirt
embroidered

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.490
with a traditional
folklore pattern.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.510
I have to admit, he
really did look good in it.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.240
Gohran, after all,
was very handsome.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.540
Now that I think about it,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.650
that was the reason I
fell in love with him.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.380
His chest was like an
exquisitely shaped sculpture,

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.160
and his shoulders and arms
were so strong and hairy

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.530
that they made you wish
he'd never let you go,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.110
that he'd hold you
inside them forever

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.280
and carry you off somewhere.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.260
Anyway, Gohran didn't
sit with everyone else,

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.440
but a little apart,
leaning against a wall

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.680
with his head tilted to the
side, observing the group.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.620
Suddenly seizing the moment
when everybody had quieted down,

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.190
he straightened up and
started singing a folk song.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.490
It surely must have been
[speaking foreign language].

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:29.610
As I later found out, that's
the only one he knows.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:32.100
With his theatrical
hollering, his eyes closed,

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.750
his head thrown back, and the
apple of his throat bobbing up

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.520
and down, he looked
like a crowing rooster.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.820
I found him ridiculous,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.590
but at the same time couldn't
stop looking at his arms

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.570
and his chest, imagining
him grabbing a hold of me.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.780
When he was done singing people
clapped and he looked my way.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.180
His eyes were a little
teary, probably as a result

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.500
of the exertion from
all the crowing.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.120
Back then I thought they
were full of sorrow.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.210
I felt an urge to console him.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.180
That evening I consoled
him in his room,

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.910
and that's how the
whole thing started.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.250
He's still going to poetry
festivals all the time.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.230
He goes whenever his
work allows it, which,

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.810
by the way, he's lousy at.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.340
I can only imagine what he does
that these poetry festivals.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.590
First of all, he brings
along half a suitcase

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.430
of his thin little poetry books

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.870
with their cheap
laminated covers.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.520
He's had most of them translated
into English and into several

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.130
of the Balkan languages so that
foreigners can understand his

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.140
meaningless blabbering.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.520
The language I speak doesn't
interest him, which is why,

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.820
as if by some miracle,

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.060
he's never asked me
to translate for him.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.220
And besides, he thinks
I'm no good at poetry,

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.790
that I don't get it, since I've
been showing little interest

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.730
in his endeavors lately.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.790
The translations of his
poems, though, are terrible,

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.130
not in terms of content.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.880
His poems are already void
of any content, as they are,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.550
but they're full of
grammatical mistakes, too.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.480
This is because of
his stinginess.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.250
He wants to have his
poems translated,

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.130
but doesn't want to pay for it.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.640
So, he finds some poor girls
and, after seducing them

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.880
with his mature sex appeal, he
gets them to translate his poems

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.540
for free, or for
a miserable fee.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.630
I overheard him haggling
with them a few times,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.890
offering them copies of
his book as compensation.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.270
I find this completely
embarrassing, but what can I do?

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.570
Every time he comes back

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.950
from his poetry festivals he
shows me the pictures of his --

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.850
on his digital camera.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.290
He usually gives the camera
to somebody else and asks them

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.140
to take pictures of him.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.480
So, he has a lot of pictures

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.420
of himself reciting
poetry while standing

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.060
on a podium behind a
microphone and holding one

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.300
of his ugly little
books in his hand.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.500
His poetic expression is
captured in all the pictures.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.540
I tell him this openly
since, for some reason,

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.210
it seems to flatter him.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.740
His eyebrows are slightly
raised, but one's higher

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.570
than the other, as if he
were simultaneously concerned

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.980
and moved.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.820
His chest is sticking out.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.240
His hair is always freshly
washed, usually blowing

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.540
in the springtime breeze

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.000
of the coastal little town whose
festival he especially likes

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.720
the frequent.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.060
The other pictures often
show women, actually,

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.060
they rarely ever show any men.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.570
I'm not worried about
the girls who work

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.220
as volunteers at the festival.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.610
I don't think they'd be
into him since he's too old

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.390
and ridiculous for them.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.060
I think he presents
more of a temptation

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.110
to a different category
of women, those matrons,

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.450
a little on the chubby side with
rolls of fat around their waists

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.750
and underneath their armpits

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.640
where their bras are
cutting into their flesh.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.120
They're dressed in
tight red or black tops.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.220
Their hair is usually black
and they wear red lipstick.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.320
Not infrequently, they have a
dramatic hat on their heads.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.570
Chunky, shiny jewelry adorns
their fingers and necks.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.180
Their goal is to emanate
mature femininity,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.960
sprinkled with a bit of mystery.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.730
They want to smell like cinnamon
and have velvety soft voices.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.700
Let them. Maybe Gohran can help.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.630
I couldn't care less.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.520
At night, though, he'll snuggle
up to me and say, orchid,

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.890
open up, and I open up.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.190
Thank you.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:53.690
The translation of this is,
by the way, Ekaterina Petrova

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.590
from the MFA program in
translation at the University

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.570
of Iowa, and I'm really thankful
for her wonderful translation.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.370
Thank you.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:05.500
[ Applause ]

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.060
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina:
Something is missing here.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.490
Hi. I'm very honored to be
here, as well as to be a part

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.480
of International
Writing Program.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.340
Thank you very much for that.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.900
And, yeah, after listening
to [inaudible] piece,

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.310
I couldn't help recognizing
myself at some parts

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.610
of description of her poem.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:32.800
However, I'm not going to recite
any poetry now, just in case.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.050
I'm going to read the essay
written during my stay at Iowa,

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.590
at International Writing
Program, and translated

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.930
by Hannah Lalif [assumed
spelling], who was a student

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.330
of International
Translation Workshop

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.220
of the University of Iowa.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.960
So, everything comes
from Iowa here and now.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.890
So that one was Grandparent.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:56.780
Whenever you tell me about
it your eyes are shining

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.060
as if you reveal a great secret
to me, as if you open your heart

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.150
and share the most intimate,
the happiest childhood memory

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.680
with me, which might
be as well true.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.320
You tell me about it as if I
don't hear the same scene nearly

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.390
every day from those
people, mostly old,

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:18.090
because the young don't
recall their past that often.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.490
You're Ukrainian,
your face lights up.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.970
Oh, you now what?

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.960
One of my grandparents
came from Ukraine.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:31.730
Wow, I say, for the past
100 times I just said, wow,

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:36.300
and fell silent to open
up a space for the story,

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.580
if there was one, of course.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.230
Over the past three months
that I lived in and traveled

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:46.160
around the United States, I
looked back to my homeland

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.980
and imagined it the way local
people told me about it,

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.020
not the way I personally
knew it.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.720
I saw a boundless slant of
grandparents [laughter],

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.420
gardens with swings,
endless sunflower fields,

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.400
old bikes jingling along
the path, neat little house

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.230
and cozy apartments, smelling
of chicken broth and apple pie.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:16.150
In that country rivers and lakes
were there only for fishing,

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.640
[inaudible] forests
to pick eat mushrooms,

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.870
follow unusual animal
tracks, watch birds,

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.270
and learn plants names.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:28.240
Flat fell there in the
winter so people could go --

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.730
could go sledding and skiing,
while the ice was always nice

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.820
and smooth, perfect for skating.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.210
There was only so
much people remembered

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.030
about their grandparents.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:44.960
In that imaginary
country slow-paced,

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:50.190
[inaudible] passing grandmas,
grandparent [inaudible].

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:53.480
They read their grandparentish
[phonetic] newspapers and books,

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.400
cook their grandparentish meals,

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.210
watch their [inaudible]
grandparentish TV programs,

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.320
listen to their grandparentish
morning radio shows,

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.970
and came up with new [inaudible]
grandparentish stories.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:11.540
How did that imaginary land come
into being, you might wonder?

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.650
Well, the very first
grandparent, or rather,

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:19.550
great grandparent, arrived
to Jamestown in 1607

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.980
in Captain John Smith's ship.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.940
It was only two centuries
later, in 1877,

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.310
that the first significant
weight

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:32.720
of grandparents' immigration
brought 350,000 grandparents

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.440
to the States, where
most of them worked

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.560
at [inaudible] coalmines.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.240
It is a historical
fact that nearly 400

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.890
of those grandparents
[inaudible] as slaves

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:48.330
at the [inaudible] plantations,
sharing those experience

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.820
that most white Americans
were lucky to escape.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.620
And as of 20,000, the
second wave arrived

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.450
between the two World Wars.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:02.250
During and after World War II
the United States got 100,000

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.150
Ukrainian grandparents more.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:08.120
The first wave of grandparents,
still in there, yes,

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.000
[inaudible] on the American
shore in the final years

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.290
of the Soviet Union when
the government was too weak

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:15.540
to support the Iron
Curtain, and immediately

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.840
after the USSR collapsed.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.360
The fifth wave is
rolling right now.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.800
The fifth wave is
rolling right now,

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.970
but it's members have not
become anyone grandparents yet,

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:26.660
that's for sure.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.940
There are as many
Ukrainian grandparents

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.640
in the United States as
people living in San Francisco

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.740
or Austin, and slightly more

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.050
than in Detroit,
Seattle, or Portland.

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.840
What do those people tell their
grandkids when they reminisce

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.520
about the days when they
lived back in the Ukraine?

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.740
What do old people remember best

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:51.090
about their childhood
[inaudible], the time when,

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.890
despite all the hardships,
they were strong, beautiful,

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:57.780
full of hope, when their
hearts were burning,

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.590
and their future is
promised unknown wonders,

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.970
when they could rejoice that
all good scenes were still ahead

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.270
of them.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.870
Those were the times
when they fell in love,

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.690
did not lose their loved
ones yet, did not think much

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.860
about the days passing by,

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.710
the times when they could
change anything for the better.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.000
What memories did
they feel like keeping

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.090
when they became grandparents?

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.730
Only the best ones.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.500
I'm sure I don't need
to tell you about it.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.620
Only the best ones, my dear.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.880
I never heard anyone tell
me so many wonderful scenes

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.310
about my home country as you
and the likes of you did,

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.250
the things you learned
about my land

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.150
from your grandparents' stories.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.560
During various events,
discussions, lectures,

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.910
and readings here in the U.S.,
I talk a lot about my country.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:55.030
I talk about the ongoing war
with Russia that claimed lives

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.500
of more than 10,000 Ukrainians,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.740
about the bloody revolution
we went through a couple

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.340
of years ago, about the Soviet
legacy we are trying to get rid

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.810
of day after day, about our
complicated past with wars

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.510
and plunders, ethics and
tributes, slavery, or,

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.830
as they call it, serfdom.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:19.390
The [inaudible] on our language
literature and [inaudible],

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:24.850
the denial of rights for work,
religious freedom, and identity,

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.610
famine and genocides,
pogroms and mass shootings,

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:32.960
deportations, arrests, tortures,
and concentration camps,

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.330
humiliation, misogyny,
and prejudice.

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:41.050
I talk about all the scenes from
which the grandparents run away,

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:43.820
all the things that
wouldn't let them survive

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.150
and become actual grandparents
if they decided not to suffer,

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.200
leaving everything
behind and flee.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.850
All the scenes I still fight
against in my country today

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.220
since that made us what we are,

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.640
things that we are
working hard to change.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.600
But sometimes when I
meet people like you,

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.970
people with grandparents
whose faces light up dreamily,

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.400
their childhood memories
sparkling in their eyes,

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.550
it appears to me that I could
talk a little bit less about it,

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:22.140
then that kind and blessed
grandparent's land would come

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.310
to life, at least in those
American grandkids' imagination.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:30.160
A Ukraine full of strength
and, yes, hopes and promises,

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.960
a Ukraine where everything
is possible

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.800
and all the good scenes
are still ahead of you.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.100
A Ukraine where everything
will be all right.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.900
Thank you.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:51.010
[ Applause ]

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.000
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.440
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Wonderful.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.740
Is this working?

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.350
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
How's that?

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.560
Okay. A wonderful reading.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.960
And we'll open it
up to questions.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.920
Whenever you raise your
hand make sure you wait

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.280
until [inaudible] gets to
you with the microphone

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.800
so we can get it
on the recording.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.840
I want to begin, I
guess I feel like I have

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.140
to begin with [inaudible].

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.850
This is a part of the poetry
room and she took some shots

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:24.960
of poets so we said --

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.260
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: Oh yeah.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.560
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.300
And another point during
the residency, [inaudible],

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.440
you talked about
how at this point

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.380
in your life you really
want to write about women.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.190
You want to create
women characters,

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:42.470
and yet we have a very
vivid picture of Gohran

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.000
for all of his poetry.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.350
Can you talk a little bit about
what motivates the writing?

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.430
You talked about anger
initiating this book,

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.100
but I think there are other
complexities to this, right?

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.220
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: Yeah,
first I have to say that I burst

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.520
out laughing because
you were laughing,

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.410
and because you've been to this
poetry festival I thought maybe

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:06.380
you recognized the stuff that
happens there [laughter].

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:13.170
And I never married a poet,
or anyone else, but I did --

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:18.000
I did work at that festival
and I saw quite a few poets

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.790
from around the world
[laughter].

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:24.650
And, yeah, and they
would crow like that

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.440
in the middle of the lobby.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.960
And, yes, they do
wear those shirts

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.590
with the traditional motifs

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.410
and this is why I'm
always a little weary

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.120
when I see someone wearing
traditional clothing

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.420
[inaudible] event.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.330
I'm like, I'm not sure
about that one [laughter].

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:44.300
So, yeah, or, you know,
they'll show off that, you know,

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:50.030
they can play some kind of
an instrument, you know.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.530
So, that's what made me
angry, because there's --

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:56.620
you know, this is the thing,
yeah, Gohran is at the center

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.980
of the short story, but he is
like so many Macedonian poets,

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.300
and also like so many
Balkan poets and, you know,

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.600
poets around the world.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.950
But back home it seems like
they really, really are excited

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:12.030
by just writing about themselves
and feeling like Gods.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.960
You know, like men have God

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.920
as someone they can
emanate, you know.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.230
And so, you know,
God then superheroes.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.500
And, so, they are
allowed to do this.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.030
Like they can write
about themselves,

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.100
about how they create,
and then, you know,

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.290
sprinkle us with cinnamon or,
you know, something like that

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:31.060
and then we will
feel great as women

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.140
for being their inspiration
or something,

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.200
so -- or, their audience.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.850
So, I, you know, in ridiculing
that I, you know, don't feel bad

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:42.990
that I wrote about a guy
because I ridiculed them, him.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:46.960
In the book I -- you know, I
don't -- I do write, you know,

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.460
from a man's -- a man's
perspective sometimes as well,

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.760
and it's not like I'm --

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.600
but I will sometimes choose
particularly to tell the stories

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.270
of women, or from a
woman's point of view.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.570
This particular, yeah, they're
all in the first person in all

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.800
of the 11 stories, but they --

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.590
you know, and the women in
them are also problematic.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.350
Like this one is
also problematic.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:09.650
They're not perfect.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:10.950
And I also want -- I don't want

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:13.390
to idealize women
-- is it working?

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:15.990
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: Yeah.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.290
I don't want to idealize
women also.

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.390
I mean, I want to show that they
have -- you know, they're human,

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.770
just -- and they
also have, you know,

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.810
their bad sides and
their good sides.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:27.070
So, but, yeah, I feel like
there's not many women's voices

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:30.390
in literature and
women's experiences,

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.340
so I try to normalize that,
you know, by adding to it,

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.980
because Macedonian
[inaudible] is male, too,

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.730
but Macedonia especially.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.220
So, and I remember writing
this book and, you know,

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.940
speaking to a guy
that I know in a cafe

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.240
and he said, oh,
you're a writer.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.540
So, what do you write about?

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.840
I said, oh, you know,
I write stories.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.140
What kind of stories?

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.440
You know, stories about women.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.740
Would you read them?

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.040
He said, nah, I wouldn't
read a story about a woman.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.810
So, this is -- this
is very common.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.770
And I think, you know, he just
said what other people are

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.250
also thinking.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:03.170
So, yeah, this is
sort of my ideology.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.790
And this particular story was,
yeah, written out of the anger

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:10.840
after reading like for the
gazillionth time a horrible poem

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.780
somewhere in Macedonia
and someone, you know,

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.680
like posting it on
Facebook or in some magazine

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.610
and us having to fawn over it.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:20.370
So, and then I just -- all the
build up from all the years

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.050
that I had been to this
festival, you know,

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:26.150
exploded in this short
story, yeah [laughter].

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.450
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill: Alisa,

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:32.810
when you were reading I
was thinking to myself,

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.550
first of all, you
do dialogue so well.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:39.020
But then I thought, how do
you get all these stories?

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.900
I know you travel back
home from time to time,

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.170
but you must have your ears
alert in a -- in a special way.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:49.710
&gt;&gt; Alisa Ganieva: Yes, I
actually hear all the stories

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.410
from different sources.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:56.660
And now I notice that
many of my acquaintances

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.720
and relatives back home
shun me and stop talking

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.110
when they see [laughter],
because they're afraid

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.770
that they'll find themselves
in a book somewhere.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:06.570
&gt;&gt; They should be.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.120
&gt;&gt; Alisa Ganieva: But, also,
I'm trying not to write

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.840
about real people, and all
of my characters are fiction.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.440
But, nevertheless, many of my
readers recognize their uncles

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.680
and cousins and their
nephews in my novels,

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.970
and they write me letters
asking where on Earth did I find

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.870
out about their family story.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.120
So, the situations
are so typical,

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.680
as in any realistic
piece of fiction,

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.380
that it's very recognizable.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.030
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
And the new --

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.820
is that one of the reasons
why the new novel is set not

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.700
in Dagestan, but
closer to Moscow?

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.660
Do you have to find
new material?

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.960
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska:
It was the course

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.330
of my natural internal
evolution.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.340
I had to step out of the frame.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.450
So, my fresh novel is
not about Caucasus.

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:55.750
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill: Yeah,
can you say where [inaudible]?

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.490
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: It's
called Offended Sensibilities,

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:03.240
and the title, it repeats,
literally repeats the name

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.150
of the fresh articles in
the Russian Criminal Code,

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.550
offending sensibilities
of the believers.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:14.590
It's one of the newly introduced
absurd laws that is used

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:18.950
against dissenters and all
kinds of, mostly bloggers

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:22.030
and journalists and people
who post things online,

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:26.350
or who play Pokemon game
in a church, for example,

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:29.010
or do some other things.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:32.520
And everybody heard
about [inaudible] case,

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.190
which was also linked
to this situation.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.820
And the definition

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.100
of the offending
sensibilities is very blurred,

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.770
and nobody can definitely say
what it means, and this allows

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:50.040
to apply it to anyone
who's not favorable

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.470
for the government, for example.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:52.770
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Would it --

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.700
would you agree that part
of the writer's job is

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.120
to offend sensibilities?

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.420
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: Yeah,

00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.720
I'm always offending
someone's sensibilities,

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.020
and sometimes I enjoy it.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.640
Maybe I'm [inaudible],
no, sadistic [laughter].

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.940
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Kateryna,

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.390
I wonder if you could
talk just a little bit

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:14.740
about going from forum to forum.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.310
You've written plays,
you've written poems,

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.670
you've written films,
you've written novels.

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:22.010
Here's a nonfiction piece.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.270
How do you -- how do you
figure out which forum

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.820
to write what you write?

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.250
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina: I've
been asked this question

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:33.840
so many times, here in Iowa and
also before, and I never came

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.680
up with appropriate answer.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.680
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
That's why I'm asking.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.980
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina:
Because, yeah --

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.970
well, and put in still in
the same situation again.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.160
Thank you, Chris.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.790
I would say it's all
the same thing for me.

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:50.740
Like, transferring the --

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:55.180
some certain kind of
emotional experience.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:02.920
And then, like, you know,
you need to make a chair and,

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.290
depending on what
kind of chair you want

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:09.100
to make, you pick the tools.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.510
Also, normally you can produce
a chair with any kind of tool,

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:17.170
like using this one,
[inaudible] and,

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:20.840
but then you would get different
kinds of chairs delivered.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.140
So, it's the same.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.440
Like I need to transfer
the story

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:28.930
and the emotional experience of
the person being into the story.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:32.930
So, whether it's a play or the
novel or the poem or the book

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:38.780
for children or the essay,
it only depends on the scale

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:43.280
of the story and on
the size of and variety

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.940
of experiences I
want to transfer.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.490
That's it.

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:48.790
Did I explain it well?

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.140
No, I didn't [laughter].

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.440
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
I also want to follow

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.710
up by having you talk just
a little bit about what --

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:58.950
how the children's book came
about and how that turned

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:04.540
into a fundraising campaign for
children with pancreatic cancer.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.990
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina:
Pancreatic cancer.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:09.570
Somebody made a mistake
in there.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.380
I know nothing about
pancreatic cancer.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.950
But, well, the first book

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:15.950
for children I wrote
it occasionally.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:18.330
I wanted to write
a post on Facebook.

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:19.680
It's a long story behind it.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.470
I didn't get a present
for [inaudible]

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:25.410
and I was writing a post for
Facebook about growing up.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:29.400
And at the [inaudible] I ended
up having the book for children.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:33.940
It was no St. Nicholas Day or
present or myself mentioned.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:38.100
And then I was working with this
foundation, Ukrainian foundation

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.490
for fundraising for
pancreatic cancer,

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.350
and it was the first
book for children.

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:46.000
Because the book became
really popular and I wanted

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.730
to get something useful out
of the number of copies sold,

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:52.080
so I made a deal with the
publisher that we're going

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.050
to transfer some money from
each copy sold to the foundation

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:59.070
that fundraises for
sick children.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:00.410
And it worked well.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:04.910
It worked like -- we raised
quite a serious amount of money.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.620
And then starting working
with his foundation I realized

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:12.820
that we know so little about
what sick people really do

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:17.070
and how their life
looks like in reality.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:22.930
Because this tragedy of having
a cancer blocks everything else,

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:27.190
but in reality they are, besides
the cancer and the hospital

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:30.500
and the medication, they
still have their daily life.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.830
Like they are playing,
they are having fun,

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:35.280
they are having their
[inaudible],

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.230
especially children.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:40.510
They are living,
even when they are

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:45.620
like literally already dying,
for sure, they are still living.

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.950
So, I really wanted
to talk about this.

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:51.250
To make people see those sick
people not only as a cancer,

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:54.530
but also still as
people, as personalities.

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:55.980
So, that's the book
is what about.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:00.290
And, yes, and then we also turn
it into fundraising campaign

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:01.590
and it was successful.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:03.510
It was 1 million
of Ukrainian money.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:08.200
I'm very bad in math,
but it's some thousands

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.000
and thousands of
[inaudible] money.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.810
So, it was, I mean, the first
thing that was important

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:19.620
to me is to tell about this
kind of problem in perspective

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:24.440
of daily living with
[inaudible], because normally

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.380
when people -- and, also,
like when I was researching

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.470
in hospitals, meeting doctors
and children, and actually not,

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:33.960
not when I was researching,
when I was volunteering before,

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.540
I saw kids being like really
frustrating when they get

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:40.790
into the hospital, having
these serious health issues,

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:43.740
and because they don't
know what is going on

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.910
and they never had this kind of
experience, similar experience.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:50.410
They never saw it,
so they didn't --

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:51.990
wasn't able to understand
what's going on.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:55.570
And then there was this book,
like it was a stupid book,

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:58.060
totally, about the monkey.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.810
And the guy and the monkey,
so the monkey got sick

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:02.990
and the monkey went
to the hospital.

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:05.440
And monkey was taking
injections and everything.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.800
And then the monkey
got well and went back.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.050
And; however, the book wasn't
funny at all and nice at all,

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.260
but they found this
book really supportive

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:18.230
and children loved it, because
they saw that if this is

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:22.560
in the book, monkey goes to the
hospital, I go to the hospital,

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.530
then like nothing
awful is going on.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:26.520
So, they found it
really supportive.

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.680
So, that was also the reason why
I wanted to have this book done.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.190
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
I should mention

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:35.950
that Kateryna is quite
active on social media

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:38.010
and has a lot of followers.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:42.510
So, you can see how she
documents her life there.

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.080
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina: Yes,
and I love taking pictures.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.160
And then when I was
reading about poet

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.440
with digital camera
[laughter], taking his pictures,

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:53.270
it was like [laughter].

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:57.020
Just what all of us done here

00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.240
when you weren't here
for the sound check.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.560
First thing we done is
like taking pictures

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.980
over there like us really --

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.280
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska:
I participated

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.580
in this, too [laughter].

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.880
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
I should also note

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.180
that at the closing party

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.390
in Iowa city there was
a significant amount

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:13.740
of karaoke, so.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.040
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: Yeah, so,

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.340
we know how to hold
a microphone.

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.640
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.810
Are there questions
from the audience?

00:51:28.510 --> 00:52:29.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.340
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: Well,
we've never heard a story

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.810
from a man's side
before [laughter].

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:34.470
We really want to hear it, too.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:53:34.170
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:37.510
Well, they're not
my feelings, right?

00:53:37.510 --> 00:54:01.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.340
That's the question?

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.940
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.930
You'd have to ask the character,
because I didn't write --

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:10.050
I mean, I'm not the person
in the -- in the short story.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.560
And the short story only
gives you as much as it does,

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.650
and the rest of it is
your interpretation.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:21.400
So, I think my -- what
I -- what I said in it,

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.770
you know, is pretty clear.

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:27.980
And I'm glad that I also
raised this issue as you --

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.610
I mean, what you did now is also
indicative of what I was trying

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:32.470
to say, so, I -- yeah,
that's all I have

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.120
to say about the story.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.450
I hope you can read
it in English

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:40.190
and read it again
when it comes out.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:55:24.540
[ Inaudible ]

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.930
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:27.260
My English is good
because I lived

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:29.880
in the United States
several times.

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:35.010
So, yeah, I didn't -- you know,
I didn't do this on my own.

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:38.800
I was fortunate, in other words.

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:41.200
The -- I don't write in English.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.090
I prefer to write in Macedonian.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.680
And I don't -- you know,
it's 2 million people,

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.120
but it's also a very small
tradition and there's not

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.190
that much literature
in Macedonia.

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:54.050
I feel like I'm actually
doing something when I write

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:57.400
in the language, that
I'm adding to it.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.150
And, regardless, even
poets like Gohran do it

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:04.200
when they write their
crap, but -- in Macedonian.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.910
But I feel like this is
-- this is important.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:10.970
And I don't like to write in
English, but I do translate

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:14.100
into English with help of other
writers, other translators,

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:18.340
so maybe in the future I will
try to translate my own work.

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.700
Thanks.

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:21.760
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
I might just add to that,

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:26.380
we encourage the writers to
write in their mother tongue.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.160
It is the case, from time to
time, that writers want to write

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.920
in English, but at
the very beginning

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.090
of the International Writing
Program we had the poet

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:38.880
[inaudible], who always wrote
only in Slavonian, again,

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.630
a language about the
size of the Macedonian,

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:46.960
and because of translators,
and he had a lot of translators

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.370
over the course of his life, he
became quite an influential poet

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:52.820
in American literary circles.

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:54.320
Because he was writing
in his mother tongue

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:58.970
and then translators brought
the poem into English,

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:02.890
that transmission is absolutely
essential to what we try to do

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:05.650
in the International
Writing Program.

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:08.240
I mean, I might ask
Alisa, you also have --

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.820
you, in effect, you could have
chosen to write in Russian

00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:15.750
or in Avar, I think you made
decisions along this line,

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:17.050
too, right?

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:18.350
&gt;&gt; Alisa Ganieva: Yeah,
so, I have a mother tongue,

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:23.390
which is called Avar, and it's
a very small ethnic minority,

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:26.990
700,000 people, but not all
of them know the language.

00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:28.990
So, I spoke it until I was four.

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:32.120
But then I was -- I started
attending a Russian-speaking

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.610
kindergarten and I was
silent for two months

00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:36.740
because I didn't speak Russian.

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.710
So, our supervisors thought

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:42.230
that I was a very
dumb baby [laughter].

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:46.800
And then the whole of my
education was in Russian.

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.680
And I was raised in
Russian literary culture,

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.830
so our language remained
my household language.

00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:58.440
So, I'm not sure that I'm
capable of writing something

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.840
in literary of ours, because
mine is very dialectal,

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.510
but it sounds peculiar
and it's fun

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:07.130
to pronounce some
tongue-twisters sometimes.

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:09.830
Like [speaking foreign
language], something like this.

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:11.630
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:15.180
[ Laughter ]

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:16.790
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Would you say

00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:19.460
that Avar shapes
your understanding

00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:20.780
of Russian as well?

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:25.440
Are there any structural ways
in which the mother tongue

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:28.900
on your literary tongue?

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.900
&gt;&gt; Alisa Ganieva: Yeah,
any language is separate,

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:38.290
is a different window, like a
poetic window, and point you

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:40.360
to look at the reality.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:45.200
And one of the fun things
I enjoy doing is comparing

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:50.520
of proverbs or some
metaphorical expressions

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:51.830
and different languages.

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:56.930
Like when our people
get angry, annoyed by --

00:58:56.930 --> 00:59:01.340
annoyed by somebody, they say
you're jumping out of my eyes.

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:05.740
So, these peculiar,
these bizarre expressions

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:09.950
that look quite battered and
trivial in other languages,

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:13.670
it's something that
we can learn from.

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:14.970
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
Kateryna,

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:16.270
do you want to [inaudible]
from the --

00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:17.570
you're living in
a country where --

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:18.870
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina:
Russian, Ukrainian,

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:20.170
I knew this was coming
[laughter].

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:24.050
So, I have tell my --

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:25.350
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill:
[Inaudible] predictable.

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:26.650
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina:
My mother tongue,

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:28.670
my first language is Russian,

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:32.510
and that illustrates perfectly
the damage that was done

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:35.050
to Ukrainian culture
and Ukrainian language

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:37.420
by years of Soviet Union.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:42.170
Because both of my parents
and my grandparents were born

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:45.550
at the territories of Ukraine

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:49.880
and when they were children
they spoke Ukrainian and also

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:54.500
like some my great-grandparents
came from Poland

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.720
and other territories.

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.040
Nobody ever was from Russia.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.880
But due to diversification,
like while diversification,

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.120
when I was born all my
family was speaking Russian

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.800
and considering themselves
Soviet people

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.930
with all the Soviet
stuff in their head.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:20.270
So, the only persons peaking
Russian now is my mother.

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:24.020
I do speak to some foreigners,
who like learned Russian

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.400
and don't know Ukrainian,
so just the language

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.490
of communication, I don't
mind Russian language.

01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:35.160
But the Russian policy and
nobody supports of Russian --

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:41.320
like this invading parts
of Russian, I don't want

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.670
to say Russian culture,
because Alisa is also part

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:45.090
of Russian culture,
but, you know,

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:48.590
like the normal one [laughter].

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:52.080
No, I mean it.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.990
And though I write
only in Ukrainian

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:58.970
and I speak in Ukrainian.

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:03.810
Most of Ukrainians are bilingual
due to the Soviet past,

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:06.120
but it's not because the
languages are so close.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.420
It's all because all the
education is at the start of it,

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.900
and all the education
of my parents

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.040
and people their age
was in Russian always.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.830
And you had to speak Russian
together like good positions

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:22.300
for work and to be
teaching, and also writing

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:25.110
in Ukrainian wasn't
easy, and you --

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.610
it's not that you
won't be published,

01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:29.890
but you might have been
taken into concentration camp

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:32.400
for writing certain [inaudible]
in Ukrainian, so it wasn't

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.730
like really safe also.

01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:41.820
And, so, yeah, I mean, my
English is not good at all.

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.020
I'm hardly able to read
this stuff translated

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.770
by the good person with
the good English, so,

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.780
I definitely never going
to write in English,

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.850
but also I don't think I ever
going to do this in Russian,

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:56.170
though my first language
is Russian.

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:59.430
&gt;&gt; Alisa Ganieva: I'll just
add that this situation is --

01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:02.500
works for the whole
Soviet territory,

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.500
because we have the same
linguistic disaster in Dagestan

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.570
when grandparents speak
only their native languages

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:10.300
and grandchildren
speak only Russian,

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.000
so they can't communicate.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.960
And parents who are in
their 50's, they perform

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.280
as translators between
different generations,

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.610
and it's not normal.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:19.910
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill: Yeah.

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:21.210
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: Can I
just add that this would be

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:25.300
like me writing in Serbian or
Serbo-Croatian at the time.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.190
But Yugoslavia was
not, you know,

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:31.070
it was the official language,
but it was not so insistent on,

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:34.750
or, you know, authoritarian in a
way that, yeah, it was official,

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.290
we learned it in
school, but it wasn't --

01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:37.860
it never was our first language.

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.980
So, of course, nobody
who was Slavonian

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.570
or Macedonian would write
or speak that language.

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:45.920
So, just, you know, thinking
of it from the perspective

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.060
that you were taking about
it, it's really tragic.

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.540
And I want to go back to
what you said, you know,

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.150
of the writing of
the first language.

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:54.440
There is something, there's an
intrinsic connection, I believe,

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.530
between the language that
you write in and the culture

01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:59.690
that you're presenting, and
I cannot do that in English.

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:00.990
Like it just won't work.

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:02.290
The idioms will not come out.

01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:04.300
And for me, it's
really important to have

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:06.990
that in my own writing,
to feel that it is set

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:08.290
in a particular place.

01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:10.620
That's what makes it different
from an American writer.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.990
And I'm not ever going
to try to be one.

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:15.770
So, yeah, a good
translation is something

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:19.530
that is able transfer it in
its own right, but never --

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:22.740
but I would never go as --

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.710
you know, I made that decision
a long time ago to never write

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:26.010
in English because of that.

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:30.170

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:33.350

these readings.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:46.970
Kateryna, I -- this isn't really
a question, but just a comment,

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:48.860
because I so loved your story.

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:53.420
We are -- or, not
story, but your essay.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.680
We are so much a
country of grandparents.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:02.790
And I've never thought
in those terms before.

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:08.510
And I hope that your
story [inaudible] I hope

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:14.250
that your story wins its way up
to our central administration,

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.720
because it's so important
to remind us

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.090
that we are a country
with grandparents.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:22.390
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina:
Thank you very much.

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:23.840
By the way, could I
use my chance to ask,

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.140
is there some people

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.440
in the audience [inaudible]

So, that's the situation
normally.

should note that this book,

01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:42.650
this piece will appear

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:45.070
in an online journal
called Off Assignment.

I think you're working on the
edits right now with them, yeah.

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.750
So, it's soon to
appear in English.

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:53.550
I think --

[ Inaudible ]

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:15.100
&gt;&gt; Alisa Ganieva: It's too
easy to fall into this trap

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:20.300
of self-pity, tragedy,
dark colors,

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:24.600
and sometimes it's very
important to put the distance

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:31.180
between the tragedy and
the readers, because many

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.960
of my readers, for example,
they're used to wallowing

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.030
in their sorrows of
[inaudible] of Russia

01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:43.700
with all the Islamic
insurgencies and wrangles

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.470
and political struggles
and corruption

01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:51.260
and police lawlessness, and
sometimes they want to relax

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:55.620
or to find some new
perspective in literature,

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.200
and humor makes it possible.

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:02.080
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina: I would
also say it's much more

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.050
challenging to make
people laugh then

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:08.600
to make them cry
and feel unhappy.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.580
It's always easier to
transfer the experience of pain

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:15.620
and tragedy and panic
or something like that.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:16.920
And, yeah, of course, when girls

who are reading [inaudible]
really suffering

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.650
because maybe it was
less funny [laughter].

01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:25.530
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: I
think also there's, you know,

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:26.990
humor released tension.

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:30.540
It kills sentimentality, which
is something that, you know,

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.280
women are normally
associated with.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.590
So, screw that.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:37.470
And then there is -- yeah,
and it's entertaining.

01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:38.770
So, it's a winner.

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:41.430
The other thing is that women
are not considered funny

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:44.190
traditionally, and it goes
to show that that's crap.

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:46.710
And, you know, it doesn't
-- also, it tells us that,

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:49.660
you know, generally when
you have women associated

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:55.720
with humor, actually humor is
out of the bounds for women,

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.680
because it does everything
that, you know,

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.960
traditionally women
are not supposed to do.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.830

over their bodies.

intellect, and also be,

&gt;&gt; Alisa Ganieva: Iowa city --
Iowa city and the whole state

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:47.580
of Iowa is -- I first
came there in 2012.

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.930
It was my first time
of participating

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.880
in the International
Writing Program.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:55.070
And I was very lucky
to return this year,

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:57.360
thanks to the [inaudible]
College,

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:01.630
which is like one hour
away from Iowa city.

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:05.880
And it's a fascinating
phenomenon, the juncture

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:10.910
of two lifestyles,
farmers, agricultural,

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:15.080
traditional lifestyle
and the vibrant campuses

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.660
with creativity brimming
and with students writing

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.390
and reading and asking
questions.

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:27.470
And it's also a fancy
mixture of Democratic

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.160
and Republican forces.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.620
And, also, it was -- I was --

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.290
it was curious to talk to
my driver, because I try

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:38.770
to [inaudible] every week, or --

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:42.080
and I spend three hours with
a man who voted for Trump,

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:48.010
and it was really interesting to
hear -- to hear his arguments.

01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:54.330
And it was a big contrast
with what is generally thought

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:58.480
in campuses, or in Iowa city.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.490
It's beautiful that you
have all these voices

01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:06.090
and all these diversities,
and I would love

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:09.810
to come back someday,
I don't know when.

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:13.250
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: I don't
know if it's going to --

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.710
it hasn't appeared
in my writing yet,

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:17.020
but this is where I
did a lot of writing.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:21.590
So, I'm that it will, at one
point, this whole experience

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.890
of Iowa will be in there.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:25.790
I find it -- I've never
been to the Midwest.

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:28.130
I haven't before.

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:33.830
And, yeah, it was -- it was
very strangely hospitable,

01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:36.810
on the one hand, but also very,

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:40.690
I wouldn't say there was a
lot of diversity in Iowa.

01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:47.160
But then this kind of
open heartedness I found.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:52.400
I'm still -- my impressions
are still settling.

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.410
It was -- it was strange
to spend three months

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:57.350
in a completely different
environment,

01:09:57.350 --> 01:10:00.640
which was somehow
contrasting in the --

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.290
you know, that we
were on campus.

01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:07.700
And we were just saying,
Kateryna and Alisa yesterday,

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.520
wow, it's so interesting
to see people

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.310
who are not 17 [laughter],
you know what I mean?

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:14.610
So, yeah.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.520
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina: Well, I
have this nice story of my state

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.120
in Iowa, because
like it's really

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.670
like a very contrasting
experience of [inaudible]

01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:29.380
and campus, like liberal
and wise and openminded.

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:34.140
And then some other people from
Midwest who like in the taxis

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.230
or meet somewhere in the
shops and in restaurants so,

01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:41.780
once I showed up for the
late breakfast at one

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:45.980
of Iowa's restaurants, since we
didn't have kitchen in the hotel

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:50.100
for three months, and
there was a waiting list

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:54.510
for like 40 minutes, and then
there would be this couple,

01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:59.120
like [inaudible]
big people, farmers,

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.820
but like wealthy
farmers, they invited me

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.410
because they were first
in the waiting list

01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:07.500
and they got the big
table, so they saw I'm alone

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.440
and they invited me to join.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.750
And I was like regretting
maybe should I or not,

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:15.350
because it means also that you
not only like sit the corner

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:17.720
and have you breakfast, you
have to share the conversation.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.390
And I wasn't sure it was nice.

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:25.070
So, the first thing they sit
and speak, in my broken English,

01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:29.240
but really I wanted to eat, so I
accepted kindly the invitation.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.060
I decided if something
is wrong I'm going

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.800
to pretend I don't
speak English at all,

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.930
or speak English like hardly.

01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:37.690
And, so, they asked
me, where are you from?

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:38.990
And I tell Ukraine.

01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:41.520
And yeah, I don't tell I have
the grandparent from there,

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.000
but the first thing
they tell me, Ukraine,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.080
oh my God, have you had poutine?

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:50.690
And I'm like, whoop, and
then they told me, like,

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:53.370
they were supporting this
since like [inaudible]

01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:56.730
and Black Lives Matter
and they [inaudible] live

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:59.660
in the farm in Iowa city.

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:02.550
They have 80 sheep or
something like that.

01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:04.180
We also saw their sheep later

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:07.650
because they invited some
people to visit them.

01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:10.940
So, it's never what
you expect it to be.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.880
It's always surprising.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.960
Sometimes it's like
surprising in a creepy way,

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.920
but also sometimes
in a really nice way.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.150
And I definitely
wish I knew it more.

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:25.710
So, probably I will come
again and discover it more.

01:12:30.510 --> 01:14:06.500
[ Inaudible ]

01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:10.350
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: So,

01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:11.650
I think we partially
answered this question.

01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:13.580
So, I write in the
language I know the best.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:20.620
And, but I have to say
that two of my novels,

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:25.070
three of my novels, not two
of them, are set in Dagestan

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:27.720
where people belong to
different ethnic minorities.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.570
They speak several
dozens of languages.

01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:36.280
And it's a big linguistic
audacity.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.580
It's a big phenomenon.

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:40.870
And linguists come to
investigate these languages

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:42.410
and to know more about them,

01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:44.880
although they are
disappearing nowadays.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.080
But, still, people
[inaudible] in Russian,

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.890
because it's the only
common language they can use

01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:52.400
to understand each other.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.790
And, so, my dialects
and my colloquial parts

01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:58.580
in my novels are
written in this peculiar

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:02.220
and broken Russian language
spoken by the local people

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:06.560
who use their excerpts
from, and expressions

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.960
from the local mother tongues,
from Arabic, from Turk language,

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.780
from Persian language,
because there were

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.610
so many influences
throughout the history.

01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:20.560
And, also, this is the
language spoken by men and boys

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.330
on streets, and that was one

01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:25.370
of their reasons I wasn't
recognized as a female writer

01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:29.470
after I published
my first long story.

01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:31.920
So, when my personality
became obvious,

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.880
some of the people started
rereading my writings

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.210
to find the traces
of female pen,

01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:43.970
and they said how could you
hear and catch all this --

01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:46.540
all this men's talk,
especially in the slang,

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:51.000
in this very peculiar slang?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.150
So, I think we just
follow our heart.

01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:56.170
We're not conforming
with anything.

01:15:57.330 --> 01:15:58.960
&gt;&gt; Rumena Ruzarovska: I
don't think there's a rule,

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.130
just like there is
no rule in terms

01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:03.600
of whether you can
translate into a language

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.860
that is not native to you or,
you know, your mother language.

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:09.150
Then there's the question of
-- because it's different.

01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:11.680
It depends on how comfortable
you are, how long you've lived

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.600
in that particular culture.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.590
Then there's the, you
know, the mother language.

01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:18.340
What is the mother language?

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.440
My mother's language was Greek.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.790
But she -- this is the
language that she speaks,

01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:25.650
but she doesn't -- that
she doesn't know that well,

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:28.230
because she was raised
in [inaudible]

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.480
where everybody spoke Russian,

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.020
and this became her
mother language.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.920
Because, in fact, her mother
language was maybe the language

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.380
of your school, of
your education.

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:39.270
And then, you know, she was
Macedonian, so now she speaks --

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:40.570
you know, she was very young,

01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:43.030
so then this also
became her language.

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:46.880
So, you know, I think it's maybe
getting [inaudible] to get away

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.730
from the language that
I consider tyrannical,

01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:51.050
and it's not my language.

01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:52.350
It's not Macedonian.

01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:55.380
This poor little language that
nobody likes to speak because,

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:57.560
you know, only 2 million
people can read it,

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.000
and I think [inaudible]
exists for such a short time.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.860
For me, English is tyrannical.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:06.760
People are expecting us to
be translated into English

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.140
and to become someone
somewhere int his world,

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.920
which is such a dream.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.240
Like, I mean, dream in like
the American dream, you know.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.890
It's not going to happen.

01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:20.520
So, but it always
puts us in this --

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.970
it gives us so much pressure
instead of just, you know,

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:25.980
doing what you're
comfortable with.

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:27.870
So, I believe it has to be --

01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:33.050
it has to be individual
for each person.

01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:37.390
&gt;&gt; Kateryna Babkina: In addition
to what both [inaudible]

01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:43.380
and Alisa said, which I share
completely, I have to tell

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.290
that I've been really
lucky to be able to write

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:48.950
in Ukrainian language,
because, well,

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:53.630
once they measured the beauty
of languages, I have no idea,

01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:56.650
some British people, like
British [inaudible] did this.

01:17:56.650 --> 01:18:02.060
So, Ukrainian [inaudible]
the second place in the list

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.310
of most beautiful
languages after the Italian.

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:10.220
I must admit, this language
is then cool for writing.

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:12.290
It is very flexible.

01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:17.970
The syntaxes is so that you can
like twist it anyway you need.

01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:21.120
You can put a lot of double
sentences, and triple sentences,

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.670
and play with the
language and make it funny.

01:18:24.670 --> 01:18:27.440
And, also, you can play a
lot with [inaudible] sound

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.950
and with the order of
words and sentences.

01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:33.080
So, I guess, one of
the best instruments

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.960
for writing one can get,
so why wouldn't I use it?

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.420
&gt;&gt; Christopher Merrill: So,
maybe by way of closing,

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.840
could I ask Alisa
just to give us

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.570
that [inaudible] tongue
twister again [laughter]?

01:18:43.570 --> 01:18:46.510

01:19:17.690 --> 01:19:20.040
for what I say was an absolutely
stimulating conversation.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.540
I say that word intentionally.

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:22.840
Thank you so much.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.640
So, a round of applause, please.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:29.420
