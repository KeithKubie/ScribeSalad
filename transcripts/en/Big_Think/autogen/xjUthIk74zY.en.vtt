00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.531
How do I think . . . I think this age is very
likely to be remembered as a time when we

00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:12.500
made a lot of mistakes in this country.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.029
I think we're . . . You know we went from
a position where we were economically riding

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.370
high, where we were actually liked in the
world to . . . I think we made a lot of really

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.160
big mistakes.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.930
And they're mistakes that can have long term
consequences.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.520
You know the Supreme Court is going to be
. . . going in the directions that it's been

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.030
going in for a long time now, and that can
have serious implications.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:46.260
So I think we're going to look back and think
what a short-sighted, greedy time this was.
