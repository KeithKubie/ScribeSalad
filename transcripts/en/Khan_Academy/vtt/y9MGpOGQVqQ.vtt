00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.790
We're told to solve for y, and
we have this inequality that

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.480
says that the absolute value of
y plus 22 is less than or

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.210
equal to 13 and 1/2 or 13.5.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.260
So a good place to start is
maybe to just isolate the

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.750
absolute value of y on the
left-hand side of this

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.500
inequality.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.590
And the best way to do
that, we can subtract

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.650
22 from both sides.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.050
So let's subtract 22
from both sides.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.580
The left-hand side, these guys
cancel out, that was the whole

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.930
point, so you're just left with
the absolute value of y

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.150
as being less than
or equal to.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.970
And then 13.5 minus 22,
let me do it over

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.590
here, 13.5 minus 22.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.840
My brain imagines, or the way I
process it is, I say, well--

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.760
I always like to put the larger
number first-- I say

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.540
that's the negative
of 22 minus 13.5.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.140
And 22 minus 14 is 8, or the
difference between 22 and 14

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.840
is 8, so the difference between
22 and 13 and 1/2 is

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.430
going to be 1/2 more
than that.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.589
So this is going to be 8.5.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.260
So it's going to be
negative 8.5.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.780
So we get the absolute value of
y is less than or equal to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.220
negative 8.5.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.990
Now, this should cause you some
pause, because when you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.010
take the absolute value of
anything, what do you know

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.860
you're going to get?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.930
If I tell you that the absolute
value of any number,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.410
oh, we'll just say the
absolute value of

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.470
a is equal to x.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.330
What do you know about x?

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.950
You know that x is
non-negative.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.010
It's either a positive
number or 0.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.950
Here we're saying that y is,
when we take the absolute

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.460
value, has to be less than or
equal to a negative number.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.650
It's saying that it has to
be a negative number.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.070
This is implicitly saying that
the absolute value of y has to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370
be negative.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.220
It not only has to be negative,
it has to be less

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.530
than or equal to negative 8.5.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.630
We know that if you take the
absolute value of anything,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.690
you're going to get 0 or
a positive number.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.470
You're going to get a
non-negative number.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.840
There's no number you can put
here whose absolute value's

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.240
going to give you a negative
number, especially one less

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.530
than negative 8.5.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.460
So there is no solution
to this problem.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.770
You cannot find a y that
will satisfy this.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.940
So there is no solution.
