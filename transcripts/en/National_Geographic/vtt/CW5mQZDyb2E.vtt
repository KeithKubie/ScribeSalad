00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
do ter de made a token attempt to

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.330
increase capacity by building a mega

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.960
rehab facility on a military base about

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.120
four hours north of manila our crew is

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.880
the first ever to be allowed inside to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.250
film

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.400
it's a big complex divided into four

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.750
four phases each face can occupy a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.779
maximum of two thousand five hundred

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.529
patients i know no other centres in the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:36.140
world that has the same capacity or the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:38.809
same logistical needs not entirely sugar

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.820
this has been reinforced it i mean the

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.000
whole thing is just they're doing their

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.040
best but this is held together very

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.649
seriously to say the least

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.229
better reconsider going up the stairs

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.489
that they seemed at first the entire

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:58.939
structure is just kind of floating

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:01.040
Christ they build this in three months

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.809
they know they're solving and three on

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.110
the in three months yeah these are all

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.200
prefab expect that this is a temporary

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.180
facility that the end of the day when

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.490
the facilities are no longer needed

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.590
they can be given to the military for

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.240
whatever personal dimension deem it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.420
necessary 60s Danny

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.159
then don't have it could be six years is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.220
the length of the president's term right

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.020
yeah just pick that number on it and it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.700
then Aaron that its up its up to the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.680
next administration want to continue

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.690
with

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.660
so on one hand a 10,000 bed mega rehab

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.600
facility is undoubtedly a good thing

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.479
especially when compared to the violent

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.640
alternatives but on the other it's a

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.530
patchwork solution it's it's a band-aid

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.660
and they said as much

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.810
they're building it on the fly kind of

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.330
popsicle sticks and chewing gum even at

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.820
full capacity this facility will only

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.470
address the needs of a few for every

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.180
addict admitted there are still a

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.270
hundred on the streets fearing for their

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.270
lives
