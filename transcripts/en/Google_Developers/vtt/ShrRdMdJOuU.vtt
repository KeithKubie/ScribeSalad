00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's talk about placement
of the Cast Icon.

00:00:06.027 --> 00:00:08.610
Last time you went to a friend's
place and turned on their TV,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.776
you probably grabbed their
remote, pressed the power

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:13.320
button, and on it came, because
the power button is always

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.046
in a consistent location.

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:16.670
That's why we insist
on having the Cast

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.930
Icon in a consistent location,
at the top of your app.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.090
The actually existence of the
Cast Icon is like a reminder

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.410
that there are Cast devices on
the local network they can use.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.150
So that makes it
simple to work out

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.140
whether there's a Cast
device they can see

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930
and they can control
from your app.

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:37.550
You shouldn't make
your users have

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.550
to dive through a bunch
of menus to try and find

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.590
the Cast button, and
that's another reason

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.680
to stick the icon at
the top of your app.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.730
Because what you really
want is for users

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.440
to feel right at home the
first time they use your app.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.505
And that'll keep them
coming back for more,

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:53.060
and that's the name of the game.
