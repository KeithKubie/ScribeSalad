1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,150
It's just like that the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,720
brought to you by a bunch of
different things. All of them.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,830
Embarrassing when talking in front of a
new guest. One of them is the flashlight.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,450
The flashlight is the number one sex toy
for men and people. That's ridiculous.

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,330
That's preposterous. Why would you want
to be involved in something like that?

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,800
Yeah. Cool man. Why
not? Well, the issue is,

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,300
you know that there's
something pornographic about
it cause it's like, you know,

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,550
it's a visual vagina too.
It's not just a masturbation device.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,190
I think some people have issue with
the fact that it actually looks like a

10
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,850
vagina. I think it would be less
offensive. It was just a hole.

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:39,991
But there's something,

12
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,220
there's a pornographic element of it
being a fake vagina that some people are

13
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:46,590
uneasy with. A Brian ease back, bro.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,110
Everybody is into pulling things
open these days. What's that about?

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,320
Stop that. Um, anyway, it's,

16
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,660
it's a great tool for masturbation and
you're going to masturbate, cut it out.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,860
Everybody does. Let's be real.
This is way better than your hands.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,240
Many ways to masturbate. There's actual
masturbation you can get real fun. Aw,

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,070
you can get four on all
these various various ways.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,040
Don't you feel like there's some people
that get off on bragging and they can't

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,030
wait to talk to you?

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,270
They tell you all the awesome shit
they've accomplished and like every time

23
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:15,901
you're around them,

24
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:19,530
you just like waiting for it and
then they just get it off on you. Oh,

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,600
it's like they just came when your tits.
True.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,411
Yeah.
Well,

27
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:30,210
I think that we all have a desire to be
understood and to be acknowledged and

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,050
appreciated human things.

29
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:37,051
So I feel like if we can try to be
compassionate to that idea than we should

30
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:39,930
have, give it, give it to people. Like my
friend always used to tell me, just just,

31
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,770
just give it their all. Doing the best
they can. We're all doing the best we can.

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,240
Good way of looking at him.
And that's a healthy way of looking at it.

33
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:48,890
Just give it to them. Yeah. I wouldn't,
don't, don't resist. Right. Yeah.

34
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,890
They're not doing anything terrible.
It's just silly. Yeah. Well, you know,

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,680
Jason Silva dropping knowledge
on you bitches. Anyway,

36
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,210
we're still doing a commercial,
unfortunately. Oh, I didn't realize that.

37
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:01,830
That's how we do it, dude. We sneaking
up on people. It's Ninja style.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,850
Uh,
go to Joe rogan.net.

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,350
Click on the link for the fleshlight
and enter in the code name Rogan,

40
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,060
and you will get 15% off.

41
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,470
The number one sex toy for men were also
brought to you by [inaudible] dot com

42
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,380
that's o n n I t.
Makers of Alpha brain,

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,980
the cognitive enhancing
supplement or nootropic.

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,950
Are you aware of nootropics who we're
trying that stuff? Um, well, you know,

45
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:26,430
I'm a big Fan of David Pearson is he
didn't his stick imperative where he's

46
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:30,330
talking about genetically rewriting the
human genome so that bliss becomes the

47
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,650
norm of mental health.

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,060
Know talking about using technology
to augment consciousness, but do it,

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,460
do it in a sort of,
how freaky would that be?

50
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:42,150
If we got to a point we could reengineer
the mind so that you are in a state of

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,520
ecstasy all day. Like you're on.
I'll do. Why not? Steve Silberman,

52
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:48,510
who wrote that article about Steve Jobs
talked about performing a metacognitive

53
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:51,930
hack of the human operating system.
Whether you use like yoga or meditation,

54
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:55,260
to use the mind to watch the mind and
ultimately to upgrade the mind whether you

55
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:55,810
do it,
you know,

56
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,740
our thoughts shape our spaces and our
spaces return the favor like we build

57
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,250
environments and turn go.
We engage

58
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,860
in feedback loops with those environments
and they changed the way we think.

59
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,830
My iPhone changes the way I think my
blackberry changes the way I think the

60
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,880
Internet changes the way I think.

61
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:10,840
Movies I watched changed the way I think
to you or go out of your way to take

62
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:15,100
like healthy foods in your body and
all about brown rice supplements.

63
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:19,450
I take the eyes follow
Kurzweil's like pill. Yeah, I do.

64
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,890
I do as well.
Yeah.

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,960
There's a certain dramatic thing about
Kurzweil in that I wanted to talk about

66
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:29,920
this after we're done with the documentary
or done with the commercial, rather.

67
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,020
His documentary was so
fascinating. Transcendent man.
Yeah, transcendent. So moving,

68
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,250
but also so dramatic because you realize
this guy's not getting any younger and

69
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:43,810
he's on this weird quest to be there
when it all goes down. You know,

70
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:48,100
he wants to see it all go down, man,
that guy. So Do, I guess I do too.

71
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,440
I think, you know, but the,

72
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:54,441
the idea that you can hang on until this
thing just completely fucking changes

73
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,220
right in front of our face.
Yeah. Well, you know, I think,

74
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,130
but it's kind of intuitive because it's
actually coming a lot faster than people

75
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:00,511
think.

76
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:04,690
And it has to do with one of the basic
tenants of his ideas is the exponential

77
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,900
growth curves of technology and what it
calls the law of accelerating returns.

78
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,381
I mean,

79
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,080
the fact that you're the cell phone in
your pocket today is a million times

80
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:12,220
cheaper,
a million times smaller,

81
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:15,610
and a thousand times more powerful than
a $60 million supercomputer was in the

82
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:18,850
1966 40 years ago saying that
it's a billion fold increase,

83
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,120
billion fold increase in
price performance. That's
not stopping. It's so crazy.

84
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,550
So in the next 25 years,
blood cell size devices,

85
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:26,050
trillion times more powerful than that.

86
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,270
Interfacing with your
biological neurons in real time.

87
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,000
And that's not even getting
into the spillover into biology,

88
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,420
which is now becoming an information
technology. Freeman Dyson who's a top,

89
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,940
like one of the top physicists in
the world says in the near future,

90
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:40,690
new generation of artists will be writing
genomes with the fluency that Blake

91
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,310
and Byron and Shakespeare wrote versus,

92
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,130
so it's this idea that the canvas of
life itself is the new instrument for

93
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:49,570
aesthetic design. Das On, you're
blowing my mind here, playing jazz,

94
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,400
playing jazz with biology.

95
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,760
Like imagine how we poverished the world
would have been if we hadn't invented

96
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,970
the technology of oil painting and time
for Van Gogh or the technology of the

97
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:00,700
instrument in time for Beethoven
and Mozart to unfurl through it.

98
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,660
So imagine now that the canvas of life
itself, what might we create with it?

99
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,050
I mean we use the alphabet to engender
alphabetic rapture with Shakespeare.

100
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,350
What are we going to make with life?
That's, that's where we're heading.

101
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,940
And if you go to Joe Rogan,

102
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:17,200
done that and click on the link for on
and.com and then to then Dakota Ne Rogan,

103
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:21,100
you will get 10% off all of our
nootropic product. And just, uh,

104
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,510
just as a disclaimer, Jason Silva is
not on this shit. He's on his own thing.

105
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,410
He's on his own mixture. Uh, but
uh, if you want to try alpha brain,

106
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,330
it's an excellent one.
I use it. I endorse it.

107
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,140
I have a financial stake in it because
I believe in it. It's awesome stuff.

108
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,830
It's fucking the best shit ever. If
you're hung over or if you're jet lagged,

109
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,090
I love it. Jet Lag. Jet Lag is, you know,
I hate jet lag. It's fucking brutal, man.

110
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,240
You have a dry sponge of a brain.
That's a terrible feeling. You know,

111
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,710
until you can pop your head back in.

112
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,070
It's really hard for me because I get
jet lag and then I have to perform like

113
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:54,460
you gotta to go on stage. Jetlagged
your sense, try to shake that shit off.

114
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:55,750
It's hard. But think about it. I mean,

115
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:58,040
think about what your
body is being subjected to

116
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,500
him. You're transcending. It's
the inherent limitations of time,

117
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,830
space and distance. When you're
crossing the world in just a few hours,

118
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,660
your body evolved in a universe in which
that was not plausible and now it is.

119
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,030
Can't be good for us. Well, it
can't be good for you. It's just,

120
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:14,870
it takes a little getting used
to it. It's, it's startling
I think to the system.

121
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,060
I think it freaks your body to fuck.
Exactly.

122
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,840
So for me in the alphabet is
one of the best things for a,

123
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,640
as soon as I land I take it and it
doesn't cure it. It helps. It sounds,

124
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:29,240
and this is no limitless pill, folks,
was just vitamins for your brain.

125
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,320
New Google nootropics. If you're into it,
go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and n. N. I.

126
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,940
T.
We have a bunch of different shit.

127
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,380
Shroom tech sport is a great supplement
for working out shroom tech immune.

128
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,770
This is a immunity enhance supplement.
All these things are explained online.

129
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,150
We're going away out of our way.
They try to make it as clear as possible.

130
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:50,060
With all of these things are and what the
ingredients are, if there's any risks.

131
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,720
He was taking anything for anybody
and as I always say, if you're,

132
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,910
if you're interested in this but
you think it's too expensive,

133
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,040
I urge you to go online and look at our
recipe and copy it. I don't give a fuck.

134
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,910
Go buy the shit and bulk. Aubrey just had,
I have a new scientific and an advisor.

135
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,220
Yeah, I also did, I think you can go to
your website and there's a thread now and

136
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,030
sign up and go on the message board.
There's a thread where there's a,

137
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,920
we have a scientific advisor that's just
hired just to answer questions about

138
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,210
about anet stuff,

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,240
so we're trying to do this as clean
as possible and make it more clean.

140
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,750
Everything you order is a 30 day
100% money back to not, not 30 day,

141
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:33,470
30 pills supply 100% money back guarantee.
If you don't even have to return it,

142
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,930
just tell us he didn't like it
and you get your money back.

143
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:39,260
And we used to have it so that you
could whatever order you ordered it,

144
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,720
you get your money back. But
dudes, we're selling it on Ebay.

145
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,400
They hacked us and they
hacked our silly system.

146
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,580
So we had to change it to the first
30 pills. I ain't hating. You know,

147
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:54,180
you gotta do what you've gotta do,
you know? Um, so, uh, anyway, uh,

148
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,780
just go check all that stuff out on a.com.

149
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,730
O n n I t enter in code name Brogan. Get
10% off. All right, Brian, cue the music.

150
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,280
This is going to be certain.
Yeah, bank epic sense

151
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,410
[inaudible] then it becomes
a totally different thing.

152
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,910
[inaudible] I love it.

153
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,620
Dude. I love the environment you've
created here. Brian. Is that a Ufo?

154
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,350
You're fucking tripping me out.

155
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,100
The idea of artists using genomes
or jeans for for their canvas.

156
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:35,531
Dat is one of the most amazing new ideas
that I've heard that that that just,

157
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:39,500
that statement really makes you like
change the way you look at things like,

158
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,101
oh yeah,

159
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:44,320
really well especially when the guy that
said that phrase is Freeman Dyson who's

160
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,430
considered the world's
most eminent physicists.

161
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:48,800
I mean he's on par with
Einstein and when I mean,

162
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,000
but he obviously is also a poet because
the way he says it in the future,

163
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:57,240
a new generation of artists
will be writing genomes
with the fluency that Blake

164
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,470
and Byron wrote verses.
In fact,

165
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,590
I just saw him speak at dealed the in
Munich and he said that soon we'll have

166
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:04,920
the entire biosphere in the palm of
our hands. So imagine what that means.

167
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:08,670
We might be like evolutions,
secrets reputable, right?
Absolutely. It's inevitable.

168
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,980
If you look at the progress that's
been made, it's not going to stop.

169
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,070
What is great and man is that he is a
bridge and not an end said Nietzsche.

170
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,030
It's so amazing to be here right
now while it's all going down.

171
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,830
This is like the bottom of the funnel,

172
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,150
so know where it happening
so fucking ridiculously fast.

173
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:24,851
It is.

174
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,700
It's the first time in history that we
don't need time lapse photography to be

175
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,790
able to witness it. You know, it's
like a, you don't see a plant growing,

176
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,580
but with time lapse you can actually see
that the plant is alive and that it's

177
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:36,490
growing and that if you could see human
progress over just the last hundred

178
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,020
years through time lapse,
you would literally see that.

179
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:40,480
It's like our thoughts spillover
into the world. I mean,

180
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,980
that's what human imagination is,
right?

181
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,250
Our ability to conjure up
future possibilities, pick
the most delightful one,

182
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,870
pull the present forward to meet it.
I mean the airplane, the jetliner,

183
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,431
the Internet,

184
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:50,830
it all started in somebody's mind or
in a group of minds and then it kind of

185
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:54,730
spilled over. Like we literally live
in condensations of our imagination.

186
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:55,810
Terence Mckenna used to say that,

187
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,300
which sounds psychedelic
except it's literally true,

188
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,053
right?

189
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,650
I've always thought that it's such a
strange thing that the imagination is this

190
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,760
invisible, wistful thing that's inside
your head that doesn't really exist.

191
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:13,990
It's just your imagination. But from
that comes everything that's solid.

192
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,680
Everything.

193
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,830
Everything that's been created has
been thought up in the imagination and

194
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:18,830
somehow or another,
and it's,

195
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,840
it's so weird that we sort of have this
like flippant view of the imagination.

196
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:27,390
I mean we, we, we value creativity
for sure, but just the idea of what,

197
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,800
imagining it's almost like we get to work,
we value

198
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,440
creativity, but we don't give it the
kind of status that it merits. Um,

199
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,340
is it James Glick who
wrote the information?

200
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,790
It's a book that talks about
how the fundamental building
block of reality might

201
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:46,560
actually be information. He talks about
it from bit, so everything is information.

202
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,820
And he wrote a fantastic article where
he talks about how it turns out that our

203
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:54,540
neuro are, are our ideas. Ideas
are just as real as the neurons.

204
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,460
Dane habits and ideas.

205
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,850
It's like a new kingdom that rises above
the biosphere and the Denisons of this

206
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,420
kingdom. Our ideas, ideas have
retained the properties of organisms.

207
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:07,170
They have infectivity, they have spreading
power. They leap from brain to brain.

208
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:09,270
They compete for the limited
resources of our attention.

209
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,160
And here's the most interesting thing.

210
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,800
Even though ideas are
not made of nucleic acid,

211
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,370
they have achieved more evolutionary
change at a rate that it leaves the old

212
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,660
gene panting far behind.

213
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,870
So ideas you know to say that ideas
change the world or they transform reality

214
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:25,320
is not a metaphor. Ideas do
transform reality. In fact,

215
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:29,220
it turns form reality better
than biological evolution
did and Terence Mckenna

216
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,770
actually said that the moment
that we invented language,

217
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:34,950
biological evolution essentially
stopped and evolution became a cultural

218
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:38,640
epigenetic phenomenon because now we're
taking matter of little organization.

219
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:41,940
It goes through our mental filters and it
pops out as iPhones and space shuttles.

220
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,070
I mean this is all the human brain,

221
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,160
the most complex thing in the universe
that's producing the world that we

222
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,930
inhabit and so on and so forth.

223
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,320
Timber Possible. It's impossible to wrap
your head around. That's like the end it.

224
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,160
It's like

225
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,410
trying to figure out where
it's going to go from here.

226
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,810
It's like what the fuck
is going to happen?

227
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,980
What is going to be the next breakthrough
that makes the Internet look like you

228
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,020
know,
like like a lamp?

229
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,900
Well, virtual reality, right?

230
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,130
Terence Mckenna also said where each
increasingly moving into universities of

231
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:13,930
our own construction, right?
Paula Antonelli, uh, from
the Moma in New York City,

232
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,530
she talks about, she did an exhibit
called design and the elastic mind.

233
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,350
And recently they did an exhibit called
talk to me about how we interface with

234
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,230
our technological tools, which is
very much the whole Marshall Mcluhan.

235
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:26,090
Like first we build the tools
and then they billed us and uh,

236
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,470
she talks about existence maximum.
She says that, you know, personal,

237
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,920
personal iPods for example,
allow us to create customized playlist.

238
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,890
So essentially we can all
impose soundtracks on our lives.

239
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:39,490
So we're each living in different
universes because we each are scoring our

240
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,620
lives and instrumenting our
lives in different ways.

241
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,830
And reality therefore is further sort of
a separated into individual subjective

242
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:51,430
universes. So to say that we each live
in our own reality is absolutely true.

243
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:54,370
Instead of living in a sort of consensus
trans where each increasingly moving

244
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:58,960
into our own customized utopias, our
own lucid dreams. And that's amazing.

245
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,690
Is that really possible? Is that
really what's going on? Is it,

246
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:04,780
all of our realities are imaginary
things that we've created that are

247
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:05,890
interacting with others.

248
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,310
Well, Robert Anton Wilson talks
about your reality tunnels.

249
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:12,270
I mean certainly there is an element
of consensus reality where we sort of

250
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,360
respect each other and acknowledge each
other as other entities that we share

251
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,040
space with.
But um,

252
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,420
but certainly like how I perceive
moment to moment reality is a,

253
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:25,050
is edited by my preconceptions,
by my stereotypes, by the way.

254
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:27,900
I was brought up by certain belief
systems and so on and so forth.

255
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:32,901
These things act as filters that skew
how I perceive things and we're all stuck

256
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:35,880
in our reality tunnels and people talk
about illumination and shedding your

257
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:40,280
reality tunnels to seeing sort of
broader, more, you know, interesting, uh,

258
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,200
varied realities and um,
yeah,

259
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:47,400
I definitely think that we're each
in individual Rhea and realities.

260
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,650
Do you think that we're gaining some new,
uh,

261
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,990
cognitive functions and some,

262
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,020
some new abilities to read each other
and to have insight into each other

263
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,320
because of technology?

264
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,160
Yeah,
I mean,

265
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:05,970
I think that the first information
technology was language in the alphabet.

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,280
You know what I mean? People always
like criticize technologies. You know,

267
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,450
when we invented writing,
it's,

268
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,900
it's been said that Socrates use to say
that you should never write anything

269
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:14,520
down because it was
going to rock our brains.

270
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,680
And this technology of writing
was this terrible thing.

271
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,360
And then it kind of becomes so
embedded in who and what we are at.

272
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,630
JC rocks it too,

273
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,460
Jay z and Socrates,
cause Jay Z,

274
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:28,350
I've always been amazed that he doesn't
write a name of his raps down. That's,

275
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,130
he's so brilliant. He just keeps them
all in his head and it's, and, and w um,

276
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,280
Everlast is the same way.
It doesn't write anything down.

277
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,450
Yeah. Well, I mean, I mean
whatever works for each person,

278
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:40,650
but I think that what I'm,

279
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,850
yeah, they, they feel like they
should, as a, as a, as an artist,

280
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,280
the able to spew out all their best stuff,

281
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,650
but even, even language and thinking
in the technology too, I mean,

282
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:52,610
we're still depending on
various components of the
brain to do certain functions.

283
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,970
So I think this,
what do we call this skin bag bias?

284
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:58,760
I mean this assumption that it's better
if it's all coming from within us.

285
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,710
I think our actual mines are actually
part of a dance between our brains and our

286
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:05,330
environments and our tools.
I mean,

287
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,630
I outsource part of our cognition
to the iPhone. There's a whole,

288
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,470
it's clear he called the extended
mind thesis or the you literally,

289
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,230
you create artful change in
the world using the magic wand.

290
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:17,570
No one has the iPhone.
It stores part of your memory.

291
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,990
It allows you to interface with reality
and actually cause change in reality.

292
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,990
Amber cases, a cyborg
anthropologist, she says,

293
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,590
our smartphones basically give us
technologically mediated telepathy.

294
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,960
SMS is basically sending your thoughts
through time and space at the speed of

295
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:36,290
light. By pressing a few
buttons, you become telepathic.

296
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,320
All you have to do is embrace the
idea that that's a part of you.

297
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,220
It's the extended phenotype that
Richard Dawkins or talks about, right?

298
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,350
It's you know,
termites build termite colonies.

299
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:47,360
Termite colonies are part
of this termite species.

300
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,350
You know what we produce is part of our
extended phenotype. It's a part of us.

301
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,080
It's not separate from us.
I think that idea is,

302
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,760
so this is connecting us to us,
this is really just connecting us to us,

303
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,830
this Hanson who you are,

304
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,880
because you are the connection between
you and all the other positive organisms

305
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,200
around you.
And the more you can,

306
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,400
the more you can keep that
going exponentially that
happy or in the better your

307
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,460
life will be. Yes, this really
is an enhancement. Yeah.

308
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,450
Emerged and evolved the same
way biological functions
and features emerge and

309
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:21,840
evolve. You know, Kevin
Kelly's treaties on this,

310
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,600
what technology wants is a fantastic,

311
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:27,390
and he talks about how technology has
a direction that has tendencies and

312
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,720
whatnot. And, and Ray Kurzweil of course,
who's the, who's a friend and hero,

313
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:34,230
I mean he says, he says, our
ability to create virtual models,

314
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:38,430
virtual reality in our heads combined
simply with our modest looking thumbs,

315
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:42,090
was sufficient to usher in literally
a secondary force of evolution called

316
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,110
technology.

317
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,470
And it will continue at an accelerating
pace until the entire universe is at our

318
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,090
fingertips. And the
thing is people say, wow,

319
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,870
how poetic coming to fork will accept
what he's saying is these exponential

320
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:55,380
growth curves of technology and then
impregnating computation into matter with

321
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:59,460
nanotechnology or impregnating manmade
evolution into synthetic biology or

322
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:00,294
artificial life.

323
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,630
These convergence of these exponentially
growing technologies are literally,

324
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,411
you know,

325
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:08,070
it's like a steward brand says we are as
gods and might as well get good at it.

326
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:10,350
Like having invented the gods,
we can turn into them.

327
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:14,310
It's not to say like instead
of praying for transcendence,

328
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:19,200
let's engineer transcendence,
let's engineer ourselves
into blissful, you know,

329
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:19,970
utopic

330
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,660
existence hopefully,
or nuclear war.

331
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,580
That's the other problem.

332
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,560
The problem is a man is also wicked
good at blowing shit up. You know,

333
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:33,890
like it seems like at our
highest levels of technology,

334
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:37,670
the best shit we have is
the most impressive shit
because the shit that can just

335
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:38,660
wipe things out.

336
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,250
Like has there ever been anything
more impressive than atomic power?

337
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,780
Is there ever been anything
more oppressive than the
idea of you just a reset

338
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:50,400
button for a whole city?
That's insane.

339
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,790
Yeah. The idea that that became
an option. Yeah. I mean one, one,

340
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,380
one has to acknowledge that you know,

341
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,350
technology extends who and
what we are and you know,

342
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:02,580
you can use the alphabet to compose
experienced scientists or you can use the

343
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,290
alphabet to compose hate speech.

344
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,950
So something that extends your thought
reach envisioned kind of like a scaffold

345
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:10,920
and can be used in any direction,
but it's up to the cultural.

346
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,960
So that's what the cultural
conversation is all about.

347
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:16,050
And that's where the story of who and
what we are and that's where culture plays

348
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,090
a key role.
How are we going to use these tools?

349
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,800
The scientists all have almost an
obligation to chase down every idea.

350
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,420
Well that's what humans do. So for them
it's like they have that justification.

351
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:30,180
I'm sure they had it when they built the
first atomic bomb that we must build it

352
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,610
before the Germans. Right? I
mean it wasn't that what they,

353
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,450
let's probably what they wanted to make
sure that the Germans could have easily

354
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:39,330
done it to us first and then we would
have been fucked. And that was the idea.

355
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,961
Sure.
I mean,

356
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:43,950
that's I guess where a
change in consciousness is
as important as the power of

357
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:47,790
our tools, you know? Yeah. Easily
more important. Right? That some more.

358
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,960
It's like w we have to grow up first
before we can use all this crazy shit we

359
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:55,410
have. Yeah. And we're not necessarily
completely grown up, but yeah, no,

360
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:58,560
it's possible though, right? Well,
we're on our way. There is a great, uh,

361
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,450
Steven pinker did a Ted talk called
the myth of violence and he says that

362
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:06,870
contrary to the media environment,
that, you know, if it bleeds, it leads.

363
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,950
The reality is that the world is getting
safer all the time and the chances of a

364
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:13,290
man dying at the hands of another
man are lower than they've ever been.

365
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,750
And he chronicles the decline in
violence over the last hundred years.

366
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:18,540
And it's like totally counterintuitive
because it's totally not what you think

367
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,540
and, but you know, this guy's like
well researched and it's unbelievable.

368
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,220
Or Hahn's robling who has a website called
gapminder that actually shows you the

369
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:29,400
progress across the world and all the
people coming out of poverty and all these

370
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,380
things that are happening that
actually point to, you know,

371
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,520
things getting infinitely better
across a variety of indicators.

372
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,190
And yet this is not what you hear on
the news because it doesn't make the

373
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:41,040
headlines. Because if it bleeds, it
leads. And that's unfortunate. Well,

374
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,690
I think it's just a numbers issue.

375
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,780
I don't think we're supposed to have
access to 300 million lies because if

376
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:52,260
there's 300 million people and that's
who we're including in our news and this

377
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:53,640
happened here and that happened there,

378
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,340
you're going to get a lot
of fucked up shit. Yeah,

379
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,420
but per capita really
not that much per capita.

380
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:03,240
America's pretty Goddamn
Save. Totally. It's, you know,

381
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,240
even the world has never been safer.
I mean,

382
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:10,520
the world's never been safe for them
to have this many people and to be this

383
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:12,330
safe,
like the pessimistic all day.

384
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:15,000
But you've got to point towards
there's some progress going on,

385
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,130
some sort of social progress going on.
Well, I think that the Ted Conference,

386
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,490
that's why it's such a sort of wondrous
force in nature because I think that

387
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:25,250
they've brought back,
uh,

388
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:30,410
the academics and made them sexy and the
intelligentsia is out there chronicling

389
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:33,660
all the progress that has been made in
technology and entertainment and design

390
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,930
and also pointing to what's wrong
but in a sort of smart, mature way.

391
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,650
And that's a phenomenon like that like
makes me happy. Like in an age of,

392
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,040
you know, reality television.
Like we also have, you know,

393
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,960
the Ted Conference and the Ted talks.
Yeah.

394
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,430
I think I was thinking about
this today in my car. I was like,

395
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,960
this is the only time ever
where people really, uh,

396
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,670
as a whole group,

397
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,590
we're exposed to all sorts of alternative
ideas without having to continue your

398
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,930
education without,
without being, you know,

399
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:06,931
like I think for a lot of our parents
when they got out of school and you know,

400
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:09,250
and then they started working like,
what do they do?

401
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,950
They picked up the paper now and again.
You know what I'm saying?

402
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,490
Like what you heard, what Walter
Cronkite told Ya on the evening news,

403
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,600
like your access to what
the fuck was really going on
was ridiculously small. No,

404
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,370
anything they do or lost there were
thinking captain America was out there

405
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,740
saving the world. They were
like little children. Totally.

406
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,610
The difference between that and what
your children are going to have,

407
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:34,210
the access they're going to
have from birth, it's insane.

408
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,110
It's not even the same species.
It's not the same reality informationally.

409
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:40,850
It's like it's not even the same reality.
Totally spot on.

410
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:41,684
I don't what you're saying.

411
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,340
I don't think we even realize how crazy
it is because we're caught up in this

412
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,680
cyclone and we just have accepted.

413
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,770
That's why they call it a singularity
and that's why such a great metaphor and

414
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:53,860
you know it's not the only one. We had
a singularity when we invented language.

415
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:57,820
I mean life after language is impossible
to imagine. I think to people on the,

416
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,660
on the other side of the
line like pre-language beings
cannot imagine what life

417
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:05,830
after all, it's only been a hundred
thousand years. You had a brilliant thing.

418
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:06,970
We were talking online,

419
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:10,200
one of your videos where you were
talking about Manhattan. Yeah.

420
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,960
And how you were described.
Please say that, uh,

421
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,820
there's a new book by David Deutsch.

422
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,480
He's a quantum physicist and genius
is called the beginning of infinity.

423
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,950
And I read this New York Times Review
of the book before I even found a book,

424
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:26,830
but it was like, it was, the guy was
saying it was his mesmerizing intellect.

425
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:29,620
I'm just to give you an example
of where his head is at. He says,

426
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:34,600
if you consider the typology of
Manhattan as it exists today,

427
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,810
so the physical topography of that entire
land mass is no longer shaped by the

428
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,890
forces of geology.

429
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,810
Literally geology has been trumped
by the forces of mind manifested as

430
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:50,320
economics, culture, uh,
you know, human behavior.

431
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,470
So we're literally artifacting landscapes
now like mind over matter literalized.

432
00:22:56,801 --> 00:23:00,640
And what he's saying is that that might
ultimately be the fate of the whole

433
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:01,450
universe.

434
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,840
And that gravitation and anti matter
only govern the universe at its least

435
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,860
interesting stages.

436
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:10,540
But where we're moving in terms of the
ability of mind to shape reality as in

437
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,750
the physical topography of Manhattan and
the world at large is that eventually

438
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:14,860
that will be the face
of the whole universe.

439
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,920
So sub straight independent
minds impregnating
intelligence into the COSMO's.

440
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,950
We're talking like death
star two we're talking,

441
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:25,600
we're talking death cause like shit.

442
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,370
I was going to say like a cosmic symphony
during the crescendo stretching on

443
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:32,740
forever like wow.

444
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,490
Or the death star or the debt's
never how bad ass the death star was.

445
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,640
Can pull up a whole fucking planet.
You better shut your mouth, bitch.

446
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,930
They built a fake planet
gone down. Shh. Come on man.

447
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:46,310
That's an amazing accomplishment as well.

448
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,370
If someone started building the death
star, they would have to keep going.

449
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,520
They would have to see if they
could do it. Yeah, they can.

450
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,670
You just can't fund that project. Folks
don't don't from the desk to our project,

451
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,020
noon is going to be that star. It's going
to be Dick Cheney's head out in space.

452
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,190
It's going to be a robotic.

453
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:05,000
Dick Cheney had actually space
is a very exciting frontier.

454
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,890
Now with the privatization of space,

455
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,810
we're going to see you like
radical innovation. I mean,

456
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:12,950
you have this new generation of techno
philanthropists. It has to be privatized,

457
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:17,240
right? You have to let people try to come
up with some crazy shit. Not only that,

458
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:20,210
but the people that are behind it are
people who have made billions in the

459
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:23,540
information age, who have the resources
of nation states and now individuals,

460
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,141
visionaries,

461
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:27,320
private individuals have the power
that only government used to have.

462
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,700
This is actually talked about.

463
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,030
You should have a peanuts would scares
people that anybody could just build some

464
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:34,640
rockets and just launch them on people.
You know?

465
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,490
It's like that's where it
starts from. I mean, the,

466
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:40,560
the money behind all these space ideas.
Yeah,

467
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,070
let's go up and stay all that shit.
It's military.

468
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,370
They want to make sure that they have
the ability to communicate, watch shit,

469
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:50,320
dropped bombs. Fuck you up, get
you quicker. I mean that's, that's,

470
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,320
that's what funds a lot of innovation
when it comes to, I mean, yeah,

471
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:57,050
at first a lot of innovation
has come from military research,

472
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:59,180
but it very quickly
translate down to consumers.

473
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,610
I mean the fact that because of the
money involved, right? Isn't it,

474
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:05,540
I mean the military contracts or junking
it's because of the resources required.

475
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:05,871
But I mean,

476
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:10,640
when you consider the fact that gps on
your smartphone today is largely free,

477
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,630
credible,

478
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,530
or that a person with a cell phone in
Africa today has better communications

479
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:18,620
technology than the US president
did 25 years ago. And you know,

480
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,140
a billion people buying
smartphones for the first time,

481
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:23,270
what they call the rising billion.
They're coming online,

482
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,620
joining the global
conversations, a billion new
minds coming on, coming online,

483
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:31,970
you know, joining the global brand. I
mean, it really is encouraging I think.

484
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,270
And uh, you know, you should have,
you should talk to Peter Diamandis.

485
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,750
He started the x Prize
Foundation and cofounder,

486
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,230
Singularity University with Kurzweil.

487
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,930
He's got a new book all about how we
can leverage emerging technologies to

488
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:45,410
transform the world for the better. Like
infinitely. So it's called the abundance.

489
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:49,070
So how come we make 80 and t
to keep a fucking phone going?

490
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,240
How can we can't get that? How come
we can't get a call to not drop? Yeah.

491
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,580
Is that possible? That's ridiculous.
Why is that still going on?

492
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,500
You know what phone calls
still drop from time to time.

493
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,160
Wonky system.
The incredible shift that we have now.

494
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Why at and t why we just can't keep up
with the at and t Verizon doesn't fuck

495
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:16,940
me. Like they all fuck up. They all use
the same towers, don't you? Silly boy.

496
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,610
They have two totally different signals.
Well,

497
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:22,310
I'm not Verizon and at t and d but like
if you look at what's going on with

498
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:26,260
sprint right now and, and uh,
Verizon I think it is, uh,

499
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,870
they all should piggyback off each
other's towers and then I would go with

500
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:34,710
sprint to cause Verizon's awesome. And
at t and t can suck it. Yeah. About that.

501
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,260
I'm not a fan of both horizon in aids.

502
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,160
He's definitely better if you want to be
able to get online while you were on a

503
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:44,170
call. Yeah. Because he can't do it.
[inaudible] that is three gene technology.

504
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,490
You realize how great the iPhone is. If
you go to Canada, then you go to Canada.

505
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,270
There cells on system is way better than
ours. They don't drop calls up there.

506
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:55,860
It's fucking awesome. Like Rogers visit,
nobody wants juice. Yeah, I think so.

507
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,850
It's great. I think that the iPhone
is the modern magic wand. I mean,

508
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,750
when you consider the amount of
magic, well, Arthur C. Clarke,

509
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,800
sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic. I mean,

510
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:11,610
there comes a point when something,
when an instrument of man is transcendent,

511
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:14,700
that it literally change how
he relates to the to reality.

512
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:18,390
I think the iPhone is on that scale
of, of innovation. I mean it really,

513
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:20,910
or to show the iPhone to
somebody 200 years ago,

514
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,210
they would've thought that you are a god.
Right?

515
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,180
I mean that is a magical machine who,

516
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,790
where are you when you're on a telephone
call to the other side of the planet?

517
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,181
I mean,

518
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,360
they're hearing your voice or they're
hearing a representation of your voice,

519
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:36,930
except it's in real time and it responds
to feedback instantly. Are you here?

520
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,823
Are you there?

521
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,360
He just embodied Eddie Griffin
had the best bit ever. Yeah.

522
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm the guy who invented telephones.
He goes,

523
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,810
how high you got to be to
be sitting around going,

524
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:53,190
I want to talk to someone
who isn't even here. Totally,

525
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,890
but see you just hit the nail in the head.

526
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,550
Just how psychedelic it's modern
information technology is,

527
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:03,390
you know John Markoff wrote a book
called what the dormouse said.

528
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:07,260
It's a true history of silicon valley
innovation in the 60s and it's all about

529
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:10,200
how a Douglas Engelbart and the Xerox
Parc and all these people that we're

530
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:12,570
trying to augment human
intelligence by any means necessary.

531
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:16,500
The birth of the computing revolution
and a and how they collided with the

532
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,670
counterculture and the
psychedelic movement of the
60s half of these engineers

533
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:23,850
were all like tripping out and computers
were all of a sudden reconfigured.

534
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:26,490
It wasn't these big like
government centralized machines,

535
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:28,650
but no computers could be
extensions of the human mind.

536
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,470
And Timothy leary came out in the 80s
and says, guess what? The computers,

537
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:33,060
the LSD of the nineties.
I mean,

538
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:36,130
that's literally what it was because
computers aren't what mind manifests.

539
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,060
Things like expanding your sphere
of possibility, expanding your mind.

540
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:42,870
I mean these are psychedelic
slogans being applied to technology.

541
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:46,850
And I think that that's spot
on. I think you're right. Um,

542
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,340
I think the interaction that
you have with social networks,

543
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:54,220
with Facebook and Twitter and message
boards and stuff like that, you're the,

544
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,350
it's, it accelerates your,
your sphere of ideas.

545
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:02,880
So incredibly, I think about,
not just because of people like,

546
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:05,550
uh,
people sending you fascinating things,

547
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,250
but other people's points of view
and comments on them. Well, you know,

548
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:10,560
you'll sometimes, this is one
of the more interesting things.

549
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,220
I'll watch a great video that I want
to read the comments because you know,

550
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,850
every now and then, you know, you go, wow,

551
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:18,990
that guy just put it in at
a unique perspective that
I hadn't considered before.

552
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,790
Totally. I mean, it allows, you know,

553
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:26,090
spaces for innovation where ideas can
have sex and it's like similar to genetic

554
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:30,330
recombination in nature. So ideas
having spaces and liquid networks.

555
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:33,690
As Steven Johnson talks about, uh, spaces
where they can complete each other,

556
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:36,330
where they can intermingle, where
they can and recombined. I mean,

557
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:40,140
we're having the primordial soup of human
culture creating a new replicator and

558
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:42,520
these replicators achieving more change

559
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,930
than biological evolution ever did. And
so that's where things get kind of crazy,

560
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,980
what they call the new Oh,

561
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:52,510
sphere is this new thing that rises
above the biosphere or psyche where mind

562
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,650
lives and, and guess what it mind is now
transcending time, space and distance.

563
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:59,980
We become posts,
geographical beings were shared,

564
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:03,730
passions can conjure self organization
and teamwork and collaboration and

565
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:07,960
cooperation and these open spaces
without like entropy getting in the way

566
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,970
without having to like get over there,

567
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,250
the Labor that it takes to get
over there to meet that person.

568
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,690
No.
What was the idea that Mckenna had?

569
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:19,670
That there's like some transcendent object
at the end of time that's pulling us

570
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:23,870
towards it. And as we get closer
to it, we become more like it.

571
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,920
Is that what it is? I think that
that was his, his, his, his metaphor.

572
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:29,450
Crazy way of looking at it.

573
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,300
Yeah. I mean, uh, the, the metaphor,
everybody uses a different word, you know,

574
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:35,220
Kurzweil coins at the singularity,

575
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:37,740
which is a metaphor borrowed from physics
to describe what happens when you go

576
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:40,140
through a black hole, which is to say
all the laws of physics collapsed.

577
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,430
So you borrow that to describe this kind
of event horizon that's just within our

578
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:48,810
reach where it almost becomes
impossible to define or describe.

579
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:52,140
Because at that point we're going to
be so deeply intertwined with these new

580
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,420
tools that are going to change
the way we think and perceive and,

581
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,860
and are basically, and mechanic might have
a different name for it, you know, uh,

582
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,830
this guy used to call it the Omega point,
you know,

583
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,670
Pierre de Chardin is Jesuit priests talked
about a move towards the Omega point.

584
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:09,510
I mean, all the metaphors are
there. And uh, I mean I definitely,

585
00:31:09,511 --> 00:31:10,950
I mean w w w already there,

586
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,160
we thought we fly through the air and
talk on the phone and surf the web and

587
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:16,470
machines with wings on them over oceans.

588
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,710
Yeah, no shit. Where are we? Where are we?

589
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,250
That the plane thing is amazing,
that it's still the same thing.

590
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,430
It's still getting the tube fly in
the air. Like we haven't figured that,

591
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,850
that hasn't really gotten any better.
Well that someone that does economics,

592
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:32,710
it's just the price of what it
is. I mean, we've still, I mean,

593
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:34,120
they've become much safer.
I think the,

594
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:38,260
the chances of having an accidents
like 125 million, so it's, yeah,

595
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:41,900
it's way safer. It's just still the
same thing. It's still just crazy.

596
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,830
It's the scope teleportation.
When's that going to pop up?

597
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:48,340
Because it seems like this plain things
been going on for a while. Like really?

598
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:51,430
That's it. That's as good as we can do
it. I feel like there's some other shit,

599
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,293
you know,

600
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,930
that'd be cool when we
could transfer brains, like,

601
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:58,350
like you have like a empty soul over
on the other side. So you'd be like,

602
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:58,651
all right,

603
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:03,651
I'm just going to transfer my brain into
an adult brain probably of human copy.

604
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,660
Yeah. And that was
Kurzweil's idea, right? The,

605
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:09,240
to be able to copy yourself into a
operating system. Well, I mean, yes.

606
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:10,340
And that creates that fear.

607
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,980
Just philosophical conundrum because it
says if you scan your brand and you put

608
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:18,540
it in a computer, then which is you,
that one or this one. When he says that,

609
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,830
that's not how actually
how it's going to happen.

610
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:22,710
What's going to happen is more and more
of our biology is going to be replaced

611
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:25,980
by non biological components,
but it'll be millions of baby steps.

612
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,180
So first you'll replace 5% then 10%
and eventually after a bunch of gradual

613
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,390
steps, you're all non biological,
but you never felt any change.

614
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,980
So that's how it's still you.

615
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,990
I know a dude who has an artificial knee
and he was just telling me about his

616
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:40,030
artificial knee and I was
just thinking about yet

617
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,920
a knee replacement and I was
thinking about it. I was like, wow,

618
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,880
this is how it begins. He's just
walking around. He's got a fake knee.

619
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,440
Dude is walking around. Totally
is bionic. I know we're already,

620
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,040
we're already cyborgs. I mean, think about
it. Our cars, our exoskeletons, so our,

621
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:55,671
our airplanes,

622
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:59,420
these are suits that we put on that
transformed the way we interface with,

623
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:03,440
I mean, we're already looks like
a Mustang. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

624
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,440
It really is it just you,
that's why people want them to look cool.

625
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:09,380
This is my cool suit total around
it. And some people, you know,

626
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:11,690
some people get a little freaked out and
they're like, oh, but this is unnatural.

627
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:15,140
But it's actually not because the same
a biosphere that sprouted human beings

628
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:18,890
and sprouted flowers sprouted the
microchip. I mean Buckminster Fuller said,

629
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:21,470
start with the universe. If you
look at Earth as a planetary system,

630
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,240
everything that comes out of it is
natural. That means that the micro chip,

631
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,360
the iPhone is as natural as a tree.

632
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,560
What's amazing because it's
following the same kind of momentum.

633
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:36,980
I think that began with the big bang and
his self organizing properties that are

634
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,430
just sprouting. All these innovation,
evolution evolving don't involve ability,

635
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:44,470
I think is the term that Kevin Kelly use
that it's insane. It's insane. Right.

636
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,670
And it is a good antidote to
existential malaise, right? I mean,

637
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,660
th th the continuum of the
continuing fact of death,

638
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,610
the death sentence that hovers
over human beings makes life very,

639
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,120
we're very silly in
that fact that we will,

640
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,910
people want to concentrate on that
end and know it's coming. It's coming,

641
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,220
it's coming and like way
before it ever gets there.

642
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:04,850
You fucking Shit your pants on it. You
know? It's like, yeah, it's going to come,

643
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:08,150
but you've got to enjoy this.
You got to learn how to enjoy this.

644
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,370
The best way to be happy.
The only way,

645
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:14,570
the only way to truly be happy is to
do what you want to do and enjoy this.

646
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,311
Oh yeah. You, you,

647
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:18,470
you can make plans for the future and
you can discipline yourself and you could

648
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:21,470
set goals. That's all well and good,
but you better be enjoying this. Oh,

649
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,710
you have to, otherwise you're being
silly person. Yeah. Yeah. Well you got,

650
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:27,390
you got to find what gets you off and,

651
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,610
and try to make sure that whatever gets
you off is also functionally productive.

652
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,410
Yeah. So yeah, it doesn't
put anything negative out
there. Right. And I, you know,

653
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,020
Carl Sagan coined the term wonder junkie.

654
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:41,700
And I think that's like an awesome
one to describe. Like, you know,

655
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:45,500
the love of knowledge,
a lust to for ideas and ideas,

656
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,550
recognizing the erotic power of ideas
and to think that ideas are not these

657
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:52,850
abstract things, but they're actually a
thing that can change the world. Right?

658
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,820
You guys have, we've talked about,
and it seems like every day, well,

659
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,990
my ideas are just, it's weeds, ideas. It's
not even mine. I'm just borrowing them.

660
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,310
Pulling them out of the
sky comes through you,

661
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:08,570
but not from you and belongs not to you.
I'm an antenna for the mighty Shiva.

662
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,520
Well, Timothy Leary said
the brain is a transceiver.

663
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,680
But you know what's brilliant about
what you just said is because you are

664
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:16,250
creating a podcast now where you are
putting out a variety of interesting ideas

665
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:19,370
that reach all sorts of different
people and inspires all of these people.

666
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:22,100
So you become a node because
you reach millions of minds.

667
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:26,240
You infect those minds with new ideas.
Your ideas have virality, spreading power.

668
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:26,841
Infectivity.

669
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:30,170
So think about yourself as participating
in the evolutionary process,

670
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,180
spreading your scene as it were like that.
I should have not been so mean to at.

671
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,710
And. T. I'm sorry. I don't know
how hard it is to run a network.

672
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,830
You guys were the first to have the
iPhone. I appreciate you for that.

673
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:43,350
I've been a loyal customer for years.
It's not that bad.

674
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,020
I was just just making
comedy. Oh, I'm sorry.

675
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,360
I do have a little ATNT guilt
when you think about it that way.

676
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,740
Put out some negative energy.

677
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,770
I do like the fact that there was a
reason I have the at and t phone so I can

678
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:54,870
use the email and the internet

679
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,640
at the same you said more than you
would think too. I do. I use that a lot.

680
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,190
That is a feature I didn't think I
would use, but I do. I'm sorry at t and.

681
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:05,420
T I was just fucking with you. He was
very interesting that you, that you,

682
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:08,910
that you mentioned, um, that
you mentioned marijuana, um,

683
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,890
and something that helps you get
ideas or are you a cop? Ha, no,

684
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:14,270
we're talking about

685
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,660
stuff that's been published.
Yo. I think, yeah,

686
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:20,710
well I think anybody smokes marijuana.
Ert eats marijuana, especially eats it.

687
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,920
Anyone's going to tell you there's
an enhancement there. You know,

688
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,310
there's the idea of whether or not
it's a performance enhancing drug.

689
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,080
I say it is. I say it is,
you know, I don't think you
should be able to fight high.

690
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,680
I think if a guy got into UFC high,
he might have an advantage for real.

691
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,870
I'm not kidding.
A cognitive advantage.

692
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,990
The real problem with it is that you
could've gotten high a week ago and you,

693
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,240
there's no way you are
completely stone cold sober,

694
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:48,070
but when you take a drug test,

695
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:51,310
that drug tests will show that you test
positive for marijuana so you're not

696
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:55,030
under its positive effects whatsoever.
It's just the fact that it stays in your,

697
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:55,990
in your fat cells,

698
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,060
but that it's contained.
It's continued illegality is,

699
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:02,060
is a testament to sort of an intellectual
stagnation in our society. I mean,

700
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:04,550
even back in the day, Abraham
Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln used to say,

701
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:06,770
provision goes beyond the bounds of
reason because it makes it a crime.

702
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:09,050
And things that are not crying
by legislating a man's appetite.

703
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,320
You can't tell somebody what they can
do in the privacy of their own home if

704
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:14,150
they're not hurting anybody else,

705
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:18,020
particularly when so many artists are
talking about how it has helped them in so

706
00:37:18,021 --> 00:37:21,590
many ways. Norman mailer used to say it
was divine for associations. Carl Sagan.

707
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,190
Okay.

708
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:27,190
My fricking hero used to rave about
marijuana freaking when Carl Sig and he,

709
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:29,150
he's so legit.
You gotta say file.

710
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:34,020
We can fucking hear Carl Sagan
used to enjoy cannabis. You know,

711
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:38,990
and there was actual article recently
in a, in a psychiatry journal that,

712
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:42,230
uh, they looked at marijuana and
creativity by studying semantic priming.

713
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,930
And semantic priming means
if you activate a word,

714
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,050
it's immediate associations that get
triggered in your head. So if I say bird,

715
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:51,170
you think of when you think of flight,
those are normal associations.

716
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:54,590
And it turns out that people that claimed
that marijuana made them more creative.

717
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,360
It turns out that it induced
semantic and I'm sorry,

718
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,420
and induced a hyper
priming effect in them.

719
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,050
So what that means is they cast a wider
associate of net. So when you said bird,

720
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,060
they didn't just think
of wings and flight,

721
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,770
they thought of transcending one's
limitations going beyond one's limit,

722
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,970
soaring above it all.

723
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:14,870
They just cast wider ways of connecting
the ideas to other ideas and isn't that

724
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:15,950
what creativity is all about?

725
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,310
So for the first time we were able to
physiologically quantify the claims made

726
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:23,870
by so many artists and first for society
to civil restrict that I think is just,

727
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,980
it goes beyond the bounds of
reason. It's not reasonable. I know

728
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,890
so many people that benefit from
it and yet it's still illegal.

729
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,450
It's completely logical.

730
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,100
It's clear evidence that
someone is suppressing behavior.

731
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,760
Someone is trying to move forward this,
this,

732
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:44,680
this same exact culture that
they're enjoying right now.
They don't, it's a cycle.

733
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,280
It's,
it's,

734
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,660
it's a psychoactive capability thing
as much as it is a thing about it as a

735
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,330
commodity, you know, that's one of the
things that people don't understand.

736
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:56,650
Marijuana is illegal because of its
status as a commodity as much as it is

737
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,480
because of its psychoactive effects.

738
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:02,740
Or there's a lot of pharmaceutical
companies that do not want it to be legal

739
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,641
because it's a,

740
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:07,900
it would be a natural commodity
that would cure a lot of ailments,

741
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,200
that there are prescription drugs that
are available for that people have

742
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:15,850
patents on and they stand to lose
millions and millions of dollars.

743
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:19,930
And that's where all their lobbying power,
their financial influence,

744
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,870
that's all that stuff comes into play.
And that's why it's illegal.

745
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,860
It's completely preposterous. And that's
very embarrassing. It is embarrassing.

746
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:32,140
It's very unfortunate. But I also think,
well all of our advocacy advocacy,

747
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,320
you know, people have never had more
power to create grassroots movement.

748
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:37,810
I mean the same fuel that is
fueling, you know, the Arab spring.

749
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:39,940
I think people can band
together and demand change.

750
00:39:39,941 --> 00:39:42,520
I mean the same way we
took down Sopa right?

751
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,690
I mean people can get together and create
this advocacy and have ultimately the

752
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:48,850
same lobbying power as these corporations.
I mean,

753
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:50,770
that's something that the
Internet is allowing for.

754
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:53,740
So I think it's certainly moving in
that direction, right? I hope so.

755
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,690
It feels like it.

756
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,700
It feels like people are actually paying
attention to what people like the soap

757
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:01,810
a thing.
People are actually paying attention to,

758
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:04,060
the reaction that people are having on
the Internet and they're going, okay,

759
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:06,860
let's, let's step back here
and let's reassess things.

760
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,040
And I think ultimately it has to be the
way that people decide on things. Yeah.

761
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,680
We can't go through all these. Well, the
hive mind is deciding. Yeah, well, yeah,

762
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:18,580
it is the hive mind. I mean people go,
people are going to hurt. How many really?

763
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,690
How much is really,

764
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,900
you don't think they're going to be
able to fix the hacks and come on, man,

765
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:24,040
there's always going
to be a game like that,

766
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,350
but it's still red or
it'll be self correcting.

767
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,140
But that doesn't mean that you'd leave
it in the hands of these crazy fucking

768
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:33,280
Diebold people or any of these, you know,
you, you've seen those documentaries on,

769
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,610
on, on how they were able
to fix voting machines.

770
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,060
We able to change the results of all,
there's been a lot of controversy.

771
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:42,030
I grew up in Venezuela
where, uh, you know,

772
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,870
we have a president that keeps
supposedly getting reelected as he,

773
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:50,160
as he imprisons his political
opponents and appropriates,

774
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:53,050
takes over private property.
And rumor has,

775
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:57,760
it has been rigging the voting
machines. So it's a problem. I uh, I uh,

776
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:02,740
I know that story, that rumor all too
well, you know, I don't know who used it.

777
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:04,120
I don't know if it was used,

778
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,980
but they do absolutely know for a fact
that it's possible to change the votes.

779
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,590
It's possible to change the
number and the, the scary,

780
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:15,460
those machines allowed a
third party input so crazy.

781
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,720
So it's just amazing.

782
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,840
So they said they probably sold these
to these crazy dudes that are running

783
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:21,650
these fucking donkey
countries. But then, you know,

784
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,490
this strange countries in Afghanistan,
you know, I mean look like,

785
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,200
like those like warlord type dudes or
live in those places. You know what,

786
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:32,560
someone told me the best way they get
information from those guys as they give

787
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:33,394
them.

788
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,480
Like in Afghanistan they
give the dude's Viagra. Wow.

789
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,820
And then they give up information
on the Taliban like that

790
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,610
were so silly. Why at the end, at
the end of all of our technology,

791
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,720
just a by Agra to quick fix viagara for
it's crazy reward warlord type dudes

792
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:58,640
living in the mountains. Wow.
It's crazy. It's ridiculous.

793
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,970
Where do you think we're going
to be in a hundred years, man?

794
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,060
How are we going to be
living in some sort of a f

795
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:09,270
saturated with intelligence? Oh, virtual
reality I think is definitely coming.

796
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:11,580
I think once we hack the nervous system,

797
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,960
we won't have to interface with cyberspace
through the square little devices.

798
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:16,380
You know,

799
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,010
it'll be like Neuromancer you know
William Gibson says that cyberspace tapped

800
00:42:20,011 --> 00:42:22,140
into our sort of instinct that this,

801
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,280
that disinformation world information
is spatial and we want to cruise these

802
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:30,390
digital realms and we want to be in, it's
like the matrix except not a dystopia.

803
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,560
Why does the matrix have to
be a cautionary tale? Right.

804
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,280
I like the idea of going into my own
private universe or like the lucid dream

805
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:42,330
and vanilla sky where the universe is
sculpted and based on my preferences and

806
00:42:42,331 --> 00:42:46,440
moods and I render things into existence
at a faster and faster rate. I mean,

807
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,720
we already are living in a
world that's shaped by the mind.

808
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:52,050
It's just that the buffer time is
shrinking. As the tools get more powerful.

809
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:56,730
Eventually the speed of thought will
render things into existence at that sort

810
00:42:56,731 --> 00:43:00,600
of lightspeed, that's where we're headed.
Jesus Christ. How far away is that?

811
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,130
How far away is the speed of thought
making material things? Well,

812
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,080
out of the ether, you're once
we can once Nano Delek trip. Oh,

813
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,690
it is like a psychedelic
psychedelic offers,

814
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:15,630
a glimpse of the world
that's created by mind.

815
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,660
We were already living in a
world made of language. I mean,

816
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:20,670
everything we inhabit is,
is an object,

817
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:24,600
objectification of the imagination that
Terence Mckenna is like Terence Mckenna.

818
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,000
You know, people say, oh, he was
just about advocating psychedelics.

819
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,090
He was about much more than that.
Terence Mckenna was a futurist, a poet,

820
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,440
and a technologist in many way. Who
understood that transformative power of,

821
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:37,920
you know, even if he wasn't, it was
cool to just listen to him talk. He's,

822
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,330
he did was such a head of such
a crazy way of phrasing. Right.

823
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:46,010
Thanks. And putting things together
is a really interesting dude. Insane.

824
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,960
You know, the first time I ever did DMT,
I actually heard him talk in my DMT trip.

825
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,680
It was the strangest fucking thing ever.
Wow.

826
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,400
It was so strange because I don't
know if you've ever done anything, uh,

827
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,140
you ever done anything like that?
DMT?

828
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,520
No. I can't say that I have,
although I've read a lot about it.

829
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,510
I'm very curious. Just haven't
found the set and setting in time.

830
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,100
Mckenna always just talk
about heavy psychedelic trips.

831
00:44:11,101 --> 00:44:14,160
One of the things he said is,
did not give into astonishment.

832
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,320
That there's a voice inside the Dmt
trip that tells you do not give into

833
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:22,620
astonishment.
And that's the first time I did it.

834
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,000
I blasted through and you could
literally hear it, but you don't hear it.

835
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:31,590
You don't hear it, but it's sand. Do not
give into astonishment. I was like, wow,

836
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:32,010
this is

837
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,000
the craziest shit ever. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Well that's uh, I just,

838
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,140
it's like, yeah, I love the word
astonishment because it's like, well,

839
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:45,120
I mean it's like what he's teasing at is,
is, is this idea of astonishment, wonder,

840
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:49,740
awe. Like rapturous ought to be pulled
from context to you. Tom Robbins,

841
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,100
Tom Robins, the writer, he, he's a
comedian as well maybe or something.

842
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:54,120
But he wrote about this guy,

843
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:55,740
Tom Robbins was writing about
psychedelics and he said,

844
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,920
the plant Jeanie's as this,
the saint marijuana or psychedelics,

845
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,760
the plant Jeanie's do not necessarily
manufacture imagination or wonder men.

846
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:05,460
It's not that they make
you more imaginative,

847
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:10,850
but what they do or what they can do is
pull us out of context so dramatically

848
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,920
that we ended up gawking and amazement
that the ubiquitous everyday wanders

849
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,470
we're culturally conditioned to ignore.

850
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,690
But you don't need drugs
to be pulled from context.

851
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,150
That's just one way that some people
do it. You can do it by traveling.

852
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,320
You can do and falling in love.

853
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,750
You can do it by having the rug
pulled from underneath your feet.

854
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,140
Just be inspired. Yes. So we, you know,

855
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,240
but then we have this other
thing called hedonic adaptation,

856
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,090
which is what trumps everything that's
always around becomes invisible.

857
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:36,420
And that's why we always need novelty
because we don't appreciate what we have

858
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:39,440
because we got used to it because the
brain gets used to it. And so in order to,

859
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,250
that's a terrible disease.
He died.

860
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:44,380
I got updation is the first cure with like
bioengineering that we need to fix it.

861
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:47,910
We need to fix that so that we can
be perpetually open and in awe.

862
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,680
You know what I'm saying? But, um,

863
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,290
but really it's about finding ways
to remove yourself from context,

864
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,620
different perspectives, new thoughts,
new spaces, new new ideas, right?

865
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,830
That is the hunger for it,
the constant hunger for it.

866
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:03,600
I have it because otherwise I go down
into the darkness. Like if I'm not in awe,

867
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,820
I start thinking about human beings.

868
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:09,570
We're the only species that's aware of
our mortality and this causes cognitive

869
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:12,960
stress. What do we do with the fact
that no matter how much we create,

870
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,350
how many people we fall in love with?
We're all just food for worms. In the end.

871
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:19,740
So you're essentially like an
awesome collector of ideas,

872
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,280
kind of a friend of mine called intention,
a lot of creative ideas of your own,

873
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,520
but you have an awesome
collection of these, these,

874
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,210
these ideas and it's um,
you know, do you have,

875
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,640
do you feel like that's your
calling to get that out there?

876
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:34,860
You obviously have a very unique,
and you know,

877
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:38,550
and well studied perspective on things
can be when you're talking about all

878
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:41,460
these things and you're obviously very
passionate about it. Like what do you,

879
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:44,430
what are you trying to do? You're trying
to like get other people hip to this.

880
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,780
Yeah, we'll agree to everybody to strap
in and, and, and prepare yourself.

881
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,830
Come along for the ride.
Yeah. Well, yeah. Wow Man.

882
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,650
You start saying shit like this.
You know,

883
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,090
a lot of the things you've said
and these videos, you know, you're,

884
00:46:57,091 --> 00:47:01,530
you're putting these little seeds in the
heads of people all over the world that

885
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:03,750
may not necessarily have ever
thought that idea before.

886
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,300
That's a powerful thing then. Yeah. Well,

887
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:09,840
one of my heroes is Timothy leary
and I also really love Bucky fuller.

888
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:13,080
And they used to call themselves
performing philosophers, you know,

889
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,860
inter galactic sized ideas and using the
power of media communications to spread

890
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:19,410
those ideas. People like Marshall
Mcluhan that it as well. Yeah.

891
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,810
And Canada as well. The candidate, it as
well performing philosophers. You know,

892
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,040
leary said in the information age, you
don't teach philosophy, you perform it.

893
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,600
If Aristotle were alive today,

894
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,480
he'd have a talk show or youtube channel
or a podcast like the Joe Rogan podcast.

895
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,920
I mean, you in a way are the modern
day Aristotle sping forth ideas,

896
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:37,930
inspiring people.
But I'm saying proof of concept,

897
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:42,550
people eat Animal Dixon on TV and I'm
sponsored by a fake vagina. Well, no,

898
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:46,660
but that's there, sir. Proof, proof of
concept. Basically saying that, you know,

899
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,820
we used to talk about ids in these forums,

900
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:52,180
these Greek philosophers and Roman
philosophers would talk about ideas and

901
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:54,700
people would just ruminate about
ideas. And that's, I mean, that's,

902
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,310
you're providing a space for
that. Yeah. That's kind of cool.

903
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:59,950
And I'm trying to do that too. In the
short videos that I launched, you know,

904
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:03,220
we call them shots of Philosophical
Espresso. Yeah, they're brilliant.

905
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,070
I loved them. Then you put, you put
a bunch of them on Vimeo and the,

906
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:08,060
it's just they're,

907
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,730
they're so stunning and there the
visuals are so in tune with what you're

908
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:15,970
saying. Thanks. Really good. How, what's
the best way for people to find these?

909
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:19,000
What is the, Oh, just chasing
Silva. Vimeo actually, yeah.

910
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:23,080
If they just Google Jason Silva, Vimeo,
my Vimeo page has all of the videos,

911
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:25,540
which is fantastic and they can
go so many. Do you have, oh,

912
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,280
I think I had like 28 videos in there
and have all different, have the, the,

913
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,500
the shots of Philosophical Express.

914
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:32,560
So then I have a series called the human
condition where I look at like, oh,

915
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:37,300
we're watching one. Okay Dude, just take
a bong hit and watch his shit. Right.

916
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,330
That's what I'm telling you, ladies and
gentlemen. That's what you needed to do.

917
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,600
This is a w. Oh, there
you are. There's the,

918
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,900
do you do it from the beginning so people
can hear this because this is such a

919
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:50,800
trip. This is, you can't, can't start
this while we're, here we go. Nice.

920
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,860
[inaudible].

921
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,510
I have pretty much an optimist.

922
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:04,710
I reminded of Brits and Doyle's line
from Darwin's pharmacy and he says,

923
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,930
dreams or not lack reality,
real patterns of information.

924
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,080
When the imaginary foundation says that
the role as you imaginations to conceive

925
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:17,510
the bullies, delight futures,
choose the most amazing,

926
00:49:17,511 --> 00:49:22,190
exciting and ecstatic possibility and
then pull the present forward to meet it.

927
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,820
That is when we do, we would bring
our imaginings into existence,

928
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:28,840
but I think that as technology,
as

929
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:34,800
ways to outsource our mental
capacities to our tools, so much more,

930
00:49:34,801 --> 00:49:35,460
our ability to,

931
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,370
I'll give you like the physical world
has increased in an exponential fashion,

932
00:49:38,371 --> 00:49:43,020
so we've been able to shrink and the lag
time between our imaginings and their

933
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:47,240
instantiation, the real world. David
Deutsch speaks in his new book,

934
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,200
the beginning of Infinity.
He says,

935
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,640
if you look at the topography of
the island of Manhattan today,

936
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,070
that typography,

937
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,000
typography in which the forces
of economics and culture,

938
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:04,260
human intent trumped the forces,
geology,

939
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,320
I mean the topography of Manhattan today
is no longer shaped by mere geology.

940
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,290
It's shaped by the human mind and my
economics and my culture and subway.

941
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:18,390
David Deutsch extrapolate is that
ultimately that will be the effect of the

942
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,200
whole unit.

943
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,030
He says creditation and anti matter
might only universe and its earliest at

944
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:29,031
least interesting stages but eventually
the whole thing will be subject to the

945
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:32,570
intent of some street independent,

946
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,840
infinitely more powerful minds and to
conceive of that just makes me feel

947
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,230
static to shh.

948
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,230
Are you fucking kidding me man?
Are you fucking kidding me?

949
00:50:46,231 --> 00:50:49,200
That might be one of the best
two minute videos on the web.

950
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:52,620
How many minutes is that? I think less
than two minutes is whatever that is.

951
00:50:52,621 --> 00:50:56,550
That might be one of the best videos
on the web. That is a bong hit. Wonder.

952
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,800
Well you know it's, I used to, awesome.

953
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,590
The word that I always
love to use is epiphany.

954
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,630
I want to epiphany's people to give
them a download to give them a micro

955
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:09,390
psychedelic trip,
but one that is scripted.

956
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:13,830
So you don't want to be tripping in a
scrambled with space with no context.

957
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:18,930
You want a scripted transcendent
experience and I think with these videos,

958
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:21,120
what I was trying to do is take
inspiration, take an epiphany,

959
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:25,050
which is usually a lonely experience that
happened, happen, happens in one's head,

960
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,350
and what is the goal of every artist
but to try to communicate is ecstatic

961
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:31,020
vision through paint, through
instrument, through voice.

962
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,900
What I'm trying to do is
reverse engineer inspiration.

963
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:38,930
Turn it into a visual form and transmute
that putting you in my head during

964
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:44,460
these glimpses of Nirvana
that I'm literally having
and I'm getting you off on

965
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:48,690
off because that's how I get off on my
own. On the odd that I have when I watch,

966
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,920
when I make the videos will end. You
enhanced it all with these amazing videos.

967
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:58,110
The videos and images behind it were
awesome, was a really perfectly edited.

968
00:51:58,111 --> 00:52:01,390
It was very compelling that, yeah,
I worked with a magnificent editor.

969
00:52:01,391 --> 00:52:02,280
Her name is Maria.

970
00:52:02,281 --> 00:52:05,790
She's from an entity called not this
body and it was wonderful collaboration.

971
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:09,480
Fucking cool thing about
the Internet, man. You could
just do something like that.

972
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,810
Boom, throw it up there. Pow.
People download it. Instant,

973
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,680
totally commercial people. No
commercials, no nothing. He is.

974
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,100
PSA is for inspiration.
It's, yeah, totally. Yeah.

975
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,830
And then think about all
the positive that that does.

976
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,730
That's a real ripple effect, man. That's
an amazing ripple effect. Absolutely.

977
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:30,180
I mean that's the big get off for it.
It's that people enjoy it.

978
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:33,360
That's when you really realize at some
point in time there's some bizarre

979
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:37,620
connection which we in all the human
beings on this planet, all of us together,

980
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:41,310
there's some weird sort of a
electrical, you know, some, some,

981
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:45,420
some connection that we all
share and if you disturb it,

982
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:50,130
if you put shitty stuff out there, you're
going to feel it back. You really are.

983
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,060
Yeah. But when, once we understand that
we control our environments totally.

984
00:52:55,061 --> 00:52:57,960
We all just be really
fucking cool to each other.

985
00:52:57,961 --> 00:53:01,860
We can like amass a whole hive
of people who get that concept.

986
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,980
Re Rich Doyle wrote a book
called Darwin's pharmacy.

987
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,410
It's about sex plants and the
evolution of the newest fear.

988
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:10,350
And he says that one of the things that
psychedelics do for some people is they

989
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:14,490
make us aware of the feedback
loops between our creative
and linguistic choices

990
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,740
and our consciousness.
In other words,

991
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,190
we become aware of the power of the
things that we do and the things that we

992
00:53:20,191 --> 00:53:22,980
surround ourselves with and the power
that those things have to literally shape

993
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,330
our experience of reality.

994
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:29,690
Like the is seen different when it's set
to music or when it's set to a certain

995
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:33,210
kind of lighting or when you surround
yourselves by certain kinds of people.

996
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:37,790
I mean people think that inspiration
or living an inspired life is this half

997
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,740
half hazard thing that you can't plan
for a transcendent moment. It's not true.

998
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,150
You can curate your spaces the same way
you curate your Facebook wall or your

999
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:45,451
toilet.

1000
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:49,200
People you follow on Twitter to set the
emergent conditions for serendipity to

1001
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:50,760
constantly be in a state where like,
wow,

1002
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:52,140
I'm just meeting so many
interesting people. Well,

1003
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:55,440
because I've made the choice to surround
myself in vortexes of interesting

1004
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,274
people.

1005
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:00,480
One of the ideas that Mckenna
had when it came to psychedelics,

1006
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:04,470
especially too with mushrooms,
was that what you are experiencing?

1007
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:08,130
And one of the reasons
why it's so consciousness
expanding is that what you're

1008
00:54:08,131 --> 00:54:12,240
experiencing when you take it in
the mushroom is the accumulation,

1009
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,130
not just a psychedelic experience,

1010
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,580
but the accumulation of the psychedelic
experiences of all the human beings

1011
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:18,750
before you that have taken it.

1012
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,130
And that's one of the ideas why there's
so much wisdom in the psychedelic

1013
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:24,690
experiments.
That's like one of the,

1014
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,740
the humility has so much humility and a
psychedelic experience and also so much

1015
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:34,230
of a, a perspective enhancer that
you're, you know, you're getting your,

1016
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:37,470
you're taking in this connection,
which is why, you know,

1017
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:41,430
I think you can pull information out of
it or hear people talk in. Sure. You know,

1018
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:44,070
it's one of the weird things about the
psychedelic experience when he gives you

1019
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:47,780
information, when it talked, when you
saw someone is actually communicated,

1020
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:51,300
holding you. Well, one of my favorites
is Joseph, that you've read the hotel.

1021
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:54,560
It totally, no, no. Joseph Campbell,
who's one of my heroes. Oh yeah.

1022
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,970
I love about the hero's journey,
which is the ultimate Arkansas.

1023
00:54:56,971 --> 00:54:57,990
And they spent illumination,

1024
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,010
he's done a lot of lectures about
the psychedelic experience as very,

1025
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:05,220
very literally an experience of the
hero's journey. I mean, consider,

1026
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,390
consider this steps,
you know,

1027
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,360
cause the hero's journey obviously
can be a geographical journey, right?

1028
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:12,450
Like go into the unknown, you
know, step away from the ordinary,

1029
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:13,680
transcend obstacles,

1030
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,350
have an apotheosis and a rebirth
and a realization about life,

1031
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:19,110
and then come back and make the return
with that illumination. But see,

1032
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:23,420
isn't that what happens anytime somebody
partakes in a psychological trip? Well,

1033
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,770
while I was going to say is I think
that's what happens when I'm watched your

1034
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:29,160
video, when I watched the video. I
believe that's a psychedelic experience.

1035
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:31,950
Definitely. It is. It's your
manifest the mind. Yeah.

1036
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:35,960
It's information coming through stunning
visuals and it's very, uh, it's, it's,

1037
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:39,450
it's imprinted totally. You know, you
get the impact of it. Totally. Totally.

1038
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,850
There was this really what it's, that's
really what the, the pull of it all is,

1039
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:45,750
isn't it? I mean, what, what your, what
you did and you accomplished in that,

1040
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:48,370
that sort of is what the pull
of all of this stuff is, right.

1041
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:52,440
To get something that's really, really
inspires performance inception. Yeah.

1042
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:56,610
To just poon. Yeah, just give them an
explosion of new idea. 100 when you,

1043
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:59,550
when you hit people with that, when that
goes out there and blows up on them,

1044
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,250
you're literally like
pushing them off one path.

1045
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,000
Even if it's just for a few minutes until
sure. Bullshit kicks in their fucking,

1046
00:56:06,001 --> 00:56:08,680
you know, her husband calls them and you
know, the kids are screaming, you know,

1047
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:11,070
but for at least a couple of
minutes, man, you're pushing them.

1048
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:14,340
You're pushing them in the right way.
Well, it's amazing to hear you say that.

1049
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:17,520
And there's,
one of my favorite films is inception,

1050
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,700
which was absolutely magnificent. I
didn't really like that movie. Well,

1051
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:23,980
you should read it. I love it. I
liked them a little. No, no, no, no.

1052
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,450
It was some parts where I was like,
wait a minute.

1053
00:56:25,451 --> 00:56:28,630
This is like a video game you need to
see out and around shooting people.

1054
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:31,990
This is silly. It's like he's on
slow mode. He's my child's mode.

1055
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,960
That's not even a real, you know what
I'm saying? It was like an old movie.

1056
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:38,110
Check out the book, the
inception in philosophy, but um,

1057
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,910
cause it talks about there's
some layers in that film.

1058
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:42,400
But one of the ideas is that the
entire film is actually a metaphor for

1059
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:45,610
filmmaking because think about what
filmmaking is. You create a sh a dream.

1060
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,970
You bring the audience into that dream
and hopefully they fill it with their

1061
00:56:48,971 --> 00:56:51,070
subconscious, which is what we
do every time we watch a film,

1062
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,010
we relate to the characters based on a
set of experiences that we have had in

1063
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:56,630
the moods that were already in when we
go into the theater and if the film is

1064
00:56:56,631 --> 00:57:00,610
successfully performed, a performance
of inception and it gives us catharsis,

1065
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:04,330
literally the film breaks through the
screen and becomes real in the watcher.

1066
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,520
And isn't that what happens when you
have a psychedelic experience and it

1067
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:08,450
transforms you?
Or when you have a geographical,

1068
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:11,080
you take a trip somewhere and
it transforms you. Or you know,

1069
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:14,360
when you actually take a, or
when you watch a movie and
it transforms you, the Po,

1070
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,210
or you have a dream and the dream and
gives you illumination in the transfer.

1071
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:17,680
The points,

1072
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,160
if you have catharsis in a dream or in a
film or in a psychedelic trip or in the

1073
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:23,740
Euclidean meetspace, it's all real.
It doesn't matter how you get it.

1074
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,980
That's why William Gibson says that the
so called distinction between the real

1075
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:29,770
and virtual world is what we're going to
laugh at in the future because there is

1076
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:33,070
no distinction when when you're watching
a movie and you're immersed in the film

1077
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:37,300
and you're crying from the film, it
happens to you. It becomes real. So too,

1078
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,260
when you, somebody might, you know,

1079
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,980
be on a psychedelic and have a
transcendent vision and people say, oh,

1080
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:45,100
that's just because he was on the drug.
No, the vision was real while he had it.

1081
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:48,820
Dreams are real while you're in them.
And if the vision can translate,

1082
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,340
you know when it wears off,
when you leave the movie theater,

1083
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:55,030
then you know that you've found
something valuable, genuine illumination.

1084
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,390
That's a fascinating idea,
right? It is a fascinating,

1085
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,690
the idea and the idea that it's somehow
or another going to be three D it's

1086
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:05,410
going to be all around us.
Eventually cinema films and stuff.

1087
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:09,280
We're going to watch movies take place
like all around us. You'll be in a world,

1088
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:14,020
a virtual world to being inside zookeeper.
Jesus Christ. That's incredible.

1089
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:20,770
That's kind of amazing. I mean, we, you
know, we're the naked ape, you know,

1090
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:22,750
Terence Mckenna says that we,

1091
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:26,270
we ate psychedelics when
we left this event as well.

1092
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,620
We left the jungles of African one
into the Savannah's. Our diets change.

1093
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:33,130
We picked the magic mushrooms from
the cow dung. We started tripping.

1094
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:35,530
He says it might've been a catalyst
for language. And you know why?

1095
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:38,740
I think it's very compelling idea because
we don't exactly know how language

1096
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:39,460
emerged,

1097
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,850
but he points to the fact that some
psychedelics have a synesthetic effect.

1098
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,370
It's an aesthetic means that
they blurs the different senses.

1099
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:49,510
So you see sounds are you hear
sites and if you think about it,

1100
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,010
language is synesthetic.

1101
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:55,750
I use vocal patterns to
transmit images to your brain.

1102
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,100
Wirelessly language was the first
information technology that allowed me to

1103
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:03,610
transmit information through time and
space outside of just DNA having sex with

1104
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:04,444
other DNA.

1105
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:08,500
And so the synesthetic power
of information technology
might have been triggered

1106
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:11,080
by the synesthetic effect
of the magic mushroom.

1107
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:16,210
That's the stoned ape hypothesis and I
think it's a brilliant theory for sure.

1108
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,810
Like that's a really interesting way
of putting it that I haven't heard said

1109
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:22,400
that way,
that it making

1110
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,360
noises with the images that synesthetic
yeah, that people don't realize this,

1111
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:30,560
you know languages
synesthetic that's amazing.

1112
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:34,610
And that's what chimps haven't figured
that shit out yet. And then the naked ape,

1113
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,000
what have you just start giving chimps
mushrooms. Maybe we should do that.

1114
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,260
Who should do that? Man, man,

1115
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:42,560
we should have some just and
everything in the road to be honest.

1116
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,960
Curing compound where we feed shrimp,

1117
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:48,680
but just to see what's
up feed troops to chimps.

1118
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,720
That would be the most bad ass scientific
experiment of all time and just a

1119
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:57,500
total planet of the apes type moving.
Do you think,

1120
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,080
could you imagine if you did it for
like three generations there until they

1121
01:00:00,081 --> 01:00:01,640
started becoming people and they're like,
stop,

1122
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,480
stop the experiment or there's some great,

1123
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,990
there's some great cartoons
that are seen on the Internet,

1124
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:08,750
like illustrations showing the stoned ape
hypothesis and you see like a bunch of

1125
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:10,580
monkeys like walking
around, you know, whatever.

1126
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:14,510
And then they like the mushroom and then
they're like in their heads they start

1127
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:18,920
seeing like rockets flying to the moon
satellites. It's cell phones and cities,

1128
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:20,480
buildings erected from the ground.

1129
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:24,290
I mean think of how psychedelic
that sounds to you know,

1130
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:27,620
to early man like a city,
New York,

1131
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,390
a jet engine next to like a caveman.
Right?

1132
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,930
How do you make the leap
from that to that? Well,

1133
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:37,840
you would think that that leap might be
more easy if the ape is tripping, right?

1134
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,310
Yeah,
we should totally see how that works.

1135
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,110
If they're willing to put monkeys and
cages and try Mascara out on their shit.

1136
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,280
Really have,
but you think they'd been given chips.

1137
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:50,500
There's definitely scientists in some
lab that are fucking giving machines to

1138
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:51,200
manage.
I don't know,

1139
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,470
but I don't know if you can advocate
that because if the chimp can't give you

1140
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:57,320
his permission, so what if he has a bed?
It's true. So you leave the mushrooms.

1141
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:59,660
If what happens happens,
hey, what the fuck?

1142
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,210
I just think it'd be a
fascinating thing to watch.

1143
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:03,650
Could you imagine if
they did it for like six,

1144
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:06,620
seven generations of chip started
losing hair, standing up straight,

1145
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,570
started slowly turned into people.

1146
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:11,270
Then it became all this political pressure
when they started looking like people

1147
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:14,570
closest one to a person yet and you'd see
this chimp will get me the fuck out of

1148
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:17,930
here. They probably started talking.
Well Hollywood prepares us. Yeah,

1149
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:21,080
they make a lot of cautionary tales about
that. I mean the cyborgs or you know,

1150
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:23,540
until it wouldn't be amazing though.
If it was just mushrooms,

1151
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,630
they probably would just go from like
throwing poop to wiping their poop all

1152
01:01:26,631 --> 01:01:31,190
over their own body castles.
You guys have probably seen,

1153
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,190
I've probably seen 2001 a space odyssey.

1154
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:38,360
She might think that maybe the monolith
when it first appears when the monkeys

1155
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,230
finally learn how to use tools, the
monolith is just kind of a place holder.

1156
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,030
It's this weird shaped figure.

1157
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,750
Maybe that it's a placeholder on purpose
because it's a metaphor for the mystery.

1158
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,170
What happened when we went from like
just being able to apes that use tools?

1159
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,480
Well maybe that's metaphor.
Maybe that's the mushroom.

1160
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:57,110
The monolith is the magic mushroom that
cuddle and catalyze the use of tool and

1161
01:01:57,111 --> 01:02:02,111
at the moment that the ape picked up
like a branch on the floor to use it to

1162
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:05,660
reach a fruit on a really high tree.
He became one with his tools.

1163
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:09,770
We used our tools to extend the boundaries
of who and what we are and then we

1164
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:13,950
went to the moon and then who knows
what's next. It's while was a genius.

1165
01:02:13,951 --> 01:02:18,951
She has a gene who meat like putting like
meaning into scenes and having scenes

1166
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,190
represent things that are actually
taking place in the real world.

1167
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,940
There's a some crazy guy named Jay Wiener.

1168
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:30,950
I think his name is who actually sat down
and documented all the connections to

1169
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:34,380
the moon landings and all that,

1170
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:37,680
all sorts of different things
in inside the work of Kubrick's,

1171
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:42,681
the shining like to the little boy wearing
an Apollo rocket sweater to the room

1172
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:47,280
number being like some number that has
something to do with the launch time.

1173
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:49,740
And it was a really amazing thing.
Kubrick had,

1174
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,730
he constructs a world
or did rather he's gone,

1175
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:57,600
but he constructed a world that
was not just like the surface,

1176
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:01,390
but there was hidden meaning to all
these different things that were going on

1177
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:06,270
and he was like, he was way,
way, way ahead of his time.

1178
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:10,920
He was just out there, man, that guy
had some fucking wild ass movies,

1179
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:14,040
a clockwork orange. Are
you kidding me? Yeah, yeah.

1180
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:18,330
I remember watching that movie going, God
damn, this guy's going deep. Yeah. Well,

1181
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:19,320
can you be,
that's why

1182
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,200
filmmaking,

1183
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:25,030
I think is the most transcendent art
form of our times because we're literally

1184
01:03:25,031 --> 01:03:30,031
able to create virtual world that
can transform our consciousness,

1185
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,240
like reprogram our brain. I
mean, I think, I think cinema,

1186
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:40,750
I think a gifted director is like the
closest thing we have to a deity in a

1187
01:03:40,751 --> 01:03:43,480
secular world. I mean what
they, what they create,

1188
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:48,550
what bursts forth in the cinema when
your brain is tweaked to the film in the

1189
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:53,260
right way is to me the modern
version of a religious experience,

1190
01:03:53,261 --> 01:03:53,650
right?

1191
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:57,640
Yeah. What's homeboy? The
dude who did alien, what's
that guy's name? Ridley Scott.

1192
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:01,230
Ridley Scott. Thank you. He's doing
the new one. Be New. Oh my God.

1193
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:05,200
Look what do you hear that Ridley Scott
is doing another alien movie? Yeah.

1194
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:09,850
Ego Cop Tams is going to be a wild
two hours of my life. Exact sit down.

1195
01:04:09,851 --> 01:04:13,990
I'm going to watch some crazy
shit. Hopefully it hasn't.
George Lucas said, no,

1196
01:04:13,991 --> 01:04:17,350
he won't. He won't. Ridley Scott is not
going to do, he's not going to do that.

1197
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,850
He's not going to do that.
He wouldn't do that.

1198
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:22,180
That's what we used to say that George
Lucas, they made charge are too,

1199
01:04:22,181 --> 01:04:25,600
but he's listening. No one but Ridley
Scott was capable of that first one.

1200
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,610
That first alien was a Mutha fucker.

1201
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,250
That was one of the greatest
harm movies of all time, man.

1202
01:04:30,251 --> 01:04:34,420
That thing was fucking terrifying.
A thing that jumps on your fucking face,

1203
01:04:34,421 --> 01:04:35,890
shoots a load down your throat.

1204
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,180
A monster emerges out of your chest
with an explosion and then just fox up

1205
01:04:40,181 --> 01:04:43,100
everything and no one can
stop it. Which, which aliens

1206
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,630
said the Milky Middle Guy where he gets
ripped in half and on the milk came out.

1207
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,640
Hmm.
You know what I'm talking about?

1208
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:52,100
Like here's like a robot and he
got split open and all this like,

1209
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:57,150
like robot juice flew over it. I think
maybe with aliens. Aliens. You don't know.

1210
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:01,120
Oh No, I don't remember that
man. I remember there was um,

1211
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,540
Sigourney weaver had like a crazy space
suit on that she put the fight off the

1212
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:08,170
aliens. Remember that? Yeah. I remember
there was some like crazy robotics.

1213
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:12,310
You pitch back off like she was going
to fight this fucking super, you know,

1214
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:16,330
super sized beasts. Integrative,
regular aliens were scary enough. Yeah.

1215
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,280
This was the crazy one.
And she's kicking

1216
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,990
a queen's ass. Not as good as alien one
was. They went a little crazy right there.

1217
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,980
Got a little Hollywood,
they try to outdo themselves more.

1218
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:25,180
Much like the new fear factor.

1219
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,680
It's like if you went back to the premise
of the first alien, the first alien,

1220
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:33,670
it was, she was way scarier. That
alien was fucking horrifying. You know,

1221
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:35,530
like you couldn't see it.
He didn't know where it was.

1222
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:38,440
Then it would just jump out at San
Jac people and the second aliens,

1223
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:40,670
they're killing them left and right.
Like running down a hallway.

1224
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,490
The aliens are coming out and
they're like, they're stupid now.

1225
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:44,750
You can just shoot him, you know,
before they would, you know,

1226
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:47,290
they would sneak up behind you and they
were intelligent and they were all you

1227
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,600
want. You want the film
to always be high concept.

1228
01:05:49,601 --> 01:05:51,970
I mean if you want to throw
out some action in there
to keep people entertained,

1229
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:54,840
but you only want it to be like high
concept of if you're into the ideas,

1230
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,150
you can also like be entertaining. Yeah,
way like metaphysical science fiction,

1231
01:05:58,151 --> 01:06:01,270
you know? The first one though
was on, on that level. The first,

1232
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:03,160
the first one was just
absolutely brilliant.

1233
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:06,100
It was a one of the greatest horror movies
of all time. There you go. You know?

1234
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:10,640
But the second one, he got crazy. It
was good. And the third action, no,

1235
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,710
I liked it. I, I'll, I'll
watch all of them do it. I
even watch aliens vs Predator.

1236
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:18,880
I'm a sucker. I'm stupid.
I'm like a 14 year old boy,

1237
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:23,080
my taste in movies. But that was a
terrifying movie. But you were right.

1238
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:26,640
That guy has created a world. He's
like a god in the world. Yeah.

1239
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,590
He's like a god of this mini world.
What comes to phase two?

1240
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:35,500
What's going to be the next immersive
transformative entertainment technology?

1241
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,600
You know,
someone was talking about James Cameron,

1242
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:39,580
they were talking about how
demanding James Cameron was.

1243
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,130
All James cameras like this fucking
paints the wrong paint. I want it.

1244
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:45,850
This call I went to and you know,
there was like, Oh God, he's so crazy.

1245
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:49,810
So demanding. I was like, that's the
only way you get to be a James Cameron.

1246
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:52,300
You know? How the fuck do you
make something like titanic?

1247
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,390
How do you make a movie that big?
You better be a bad mother fucker.

1248
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:58,930
You better be running shit, dude. You
can't. You can't half ass and Pussy foot,

1249
01:06:58,931 --> 01:06:59,800
that fucking movie.

1250
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:03,940
You're going to have a movie about a
giant metal ship that crashes into the

1251
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:07,400
ocean and it's gotta be a
compelling movie as well. Well,

1252
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,220
who wouldn't want to direct a film?
It could because essentially you're God.

1253
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:17,650
You control every variable as you want.
Dude, we'll look at the titanic note.

1254
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:21,520
Did it didn't just think of ship to
make that movie that was all digital.

1255
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,920
I mean that is, you're going to make
that in three d they're releasing.

1256
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:24,970
It's getting,
that's incredible.

1257
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,140
The idea of that kind of
technology to recreate reality.

1258
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:34,090
That's when your idea of recreating a
full reality. It doesn't seem so far off.

1259
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:34,953
Not at all.

1260
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,620
We're already doing.
We already do it, man.

1261
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:42,580
You know a plane reserve.
I with a wireless iPhone,

1262
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:45,040
make a reservation a few days later,
get them at crafted,

1263
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:47,860
flies you around the world to a place
where no one knows your name and you have

1264
01:07:47,861 --> 01:07:52,840
no memories. Holy Shit. Holy
Shit. And indeed, you know,

1265
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:55,380
it's probably going to be
like the next big jump is, uh,

1266
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:58,480
being able to go to a movie theater in
control it, I think we've talked about it.

1267
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,000
Oh yeah, I know what I mean. Yes. Yeah.

1268
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:05,590
But what's crazy is that I think
actors are on the way out. I mean,

1269
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:07,510
there's an only hope.

1270
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:11,910
There was a video that was posted on
Vimeo the other day on Kotaku and uh,

1271
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,100
it's just kind of shows you what
the next level of like x, Xbox,

1272
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:16,580
playstation with the CGI

1273
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:21,260
looks like for that. It's, it's very close
to being, look at this video real quick.

1274
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:25,790
It's really close to being just scary
sketching like God. I mean it's,

1275
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,220
it's like look how you can see the pores.

1276
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:32,510
You can see like it's got a little cut and
from my shaving, yeah, it's incredible.

1277
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:36,890
So this is an example of what the next
x box type playstation console would we,

1278
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:40,790
and this is just fucking video games for
your house. This isn't even look real.

1279
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,250
Yeah. It looks like Toby
McGuire or something like that.

1280
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,380
Like someone's bullshitting
us. Like someone, uh,

1281
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:50,810
made a fake video to pretend now I think,
I think what it is,

1282
01:08:50,811 --> 01:08:51,960
I think this is based on it.

1283
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:56,750
I did new texture technology that's going
to be used in like upcoming platforms

1284
01:08:56,751 --> 01:09:00,720
for games and the need to make the
supermodel version of that. Okay.

1285
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:04,620
That looks a little wonky. Just
a touch. Just a touch. Yep.

1286
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,350
His eyelashes or lack thereof.

1287
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,590
But what's cool is that this is just
one artist using the technology.

1288
01:09:09,591 --> 01:09:11,000
Imagine when we start having like,

1289
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,730
like you know that really
good artists play with it.

1290
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,640
There's painters that can paint a
face that looks like a photograph.

1291
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,970
This is incredible.
If you,

1292
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:23,000
what I was saying was that if you made
this like with a video camera with your

1293
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:26,790
friends and pretended as
the new technology, it would
look similar to this. Yeah.

1294
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:29,990
Just have a little shake cam
to it. I would totally look
around. Yeah. If you look,

1295
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:32,330
so you captured the,
the newest technology.

1296
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:36,200
This is what the government is doing now.
They're creating fake news. Yeah. Oh,

1297
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:36,990
then that I think,
yeah.

1298
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:41,720
The next paradigm will be like those
film experience that adjusts the choose

1299
01:09:41,721 --> 01:09:44,750
your own adventure film experience.
You know, based on your decisions.

1300
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:47,720
I immersive immersive
virtual reality games.

1301
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:50,770
You know like that movie exit stens
actually at a very interesting that it

1302
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:51,800
Cronenberg film.

1303
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,120
They could create a fake
Rhea one transmitted fake
reality and then a real one

1304
01:09:56,121 --> 01:09:57,490
that, but then like hide behind. Yeah.

1305
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,080
And then go into it and
have like a journey and have
something that you have to

1306
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:01,370
do and have something
you have to accomplish.

1307
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:05,080
You can be like the James Bond or the
Indiana Jones, the narrative. Jesus.

1308
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:09,800
What if you die in there though?
Maybe you wake up like crushed.

1309
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:11,020
Like you're just like,
yeah,

1310
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:14,330
what if there's like glitches every
now and then you'd die for real, right?

1311
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:18,320
Like dying in a train. You can't play
games bitch DV Indiana Jones. Huh?

1312
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,170
Do you think dying in the dream like
that we're not thinking of that can't be

1313
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:22,004
good for you,
right?

1314
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:24,660
There has to be like every time
you get your dye in your dream,

1315
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,300
it's like getting hit
in the head really hard.

1316
01:10:26,301 --> 01:10:30,230
Like a part of your brain thinks are
dead or something like they don't like

1317
01:10:30,231 --> 01:10:33,740
dying in my dreams. It's very weird and
I'm always so relieved when I wake up.

1318
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:38,000
Thank you. Isn't it funny that a
lot of people hate life? Like, God,

1319
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:41,630
I'm so miserable, but yet they happy
when they don't die in their dreams.

1320
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:48,470
You know, I didn't need to dreams
go God, you fucking pussy. You know,

1321
01:10:48,471 --> 01:10:51,590
it's interesting you talk about like
not appreciating life or hating life.

1322
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:54,530
There's a great documentary.
It's called flight from death,

1323
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,790
the quest for immortality.

1324
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:01,300
And it says that basically it cites
the work of Ernest Becker who was,

1325
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:02,960
uh,
if you saw Annie Hall,

1326
01:11:02,961 --> 01:11:05,900
it's the book that Woody Allen Gives Annie
Hall in the bookstore about the human

1327
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:06,391
creation.

1328
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:11,270
It's called the denial of death and a
to 1974 Pulitzer Prize winning book.

1329
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:14,130
And it says basically that we're

1330
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:17,670
essentially God's with
anuses with our minds.

1331
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:20,940
We can ponder the infinite were
seemingly capable of anything,

1332
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:25,410
yet we're housed in a heart pumping,
breath, gasping, decaying body.

1333
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:30,470
So we are godly yet creaturely we can
write poetry and build skyscrapers,

1334
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:37,281
but ultimately we're food for the worms
and that is the problem of the human

1335
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:40,170
condition. Ultimately the ser,
the source probably of our,

1336
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:44,340
the impetus to be so creative to tr to
transcend this condition symbolically and

1337
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:47,970
artistically. But he says even
even romantic love in a way,

1338
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:50,460
as a way of of dealing
with the human condition.

1339
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:53,700
You turn your lover into a deity,
she becomes your salvation.

1340
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:56,670
That's why all the pop song says she's
like the wind. She's like the sun.

1341
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:00,360
She provides the salvation that God no
longer provides in a secular society.

1342
01:12:00,361 --> 01:12:01,260
Right.
Cause we have,

1343
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,650
we have grown too sophisticated for
religion but we still need to work on our

1344
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:05,610
existential problems.

1345
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:09,150
So then we do it with our lovers or we
do it with through creative acts and

1346
01:12:09,151 --> 01:12:10,080
ultimately,
you know,

1347
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:14,370
using science and technology to transcend
the human condition might be the

1348
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:16,650
ultimate solution to the Becker dilemma.

1349
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:19,980
That's why I'm totally pro and
Manhattan project to transcend death.

1350
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,100
Like all about it. Yeah. Do.

1351
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:27,060
Do you find that when you do the
calculations as far as like, you know,

1352
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:31,310
human population growth of technology,
do you find a point where, I mean,

1353
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,630
are you seeing where this is
going to like wind up? Well,

1354
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:36,930
technology technology is a
resource liberating mechanism.

1355
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,840
And people talk about scarcity,
but scarcity is contextual.

1356
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:42,450
Something has only scarce until you figure
out the technology that makes it into

1357
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:45,210
something abundant. And this is what
Peter Diamandis, his new book talks about.

1358
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:47,820
So for example,
our dependence on fossil fuels,

1359
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,620
we think that this feel
way to fuel things. Well,

1360
01:12:49,621 --> 01:12:51,720
once we transcend that technology,
we saw,

1361
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:54,570
I mean we get 10 times more power
every day from the sun, you know,

1362
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,430
that we could ever use.
Right?

1363
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:59,160
And we just have to figure out a way to
capture that energy and people talking

1364
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:00,140
about overpopulation.

1365
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:02,460
But the reality is you can fit the
entire world's population in the state of

1366
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:06,240
Texas. They're still be plenty of space.
The probably, yeah, the whole world.

1367
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:09,470
Oh yeah. The problem is resources.
Billion People in Texas, Brian, I think,

1368
01:13:09,471 --> 01:13:12,240
imagine what the airport would
look like. Well, what happens,

1369
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,100
it's an issue of resources,
right?

1370
01:13:14,101 --> 01:13:16,740
But if you have like
nanotechnology or in vitro meat,

1371
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:20,700
tissue engineering grow all the meeting
could ever even pita supports in vitro

1372
01:13:20,701 --> 01:13:23,130
meat, you take that,
you can take stem cells,

1373
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,520
stem cells from an and give it a
brain cells from an animal meats.

1374
01:13:26,521 --> 01:13:29,910
Sounds like it could be good stem cells
from Macau and grow all the meat you

1375
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:33,210
could ever need with no nervous system.
So no animal is suffering.

1376
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:37,050
Never killed another cow. See formula
away from the fleshlight people.

1377
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,980
Cause like I met you. What? I'm interested
in that and some people talk about,

1378
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:45,060
you know, and or, or have you ever an
Arrow, hydroponics, I have to talk about,

1379
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:49,410
have you heard of aeroponics growing
fruits and vegetables in mist and these

1380
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:51,750
vertical farming towers with
this special missed and you have,

1381
01:13:51,751 --> 01:13:53,280
you don't have to worry about like,
you know,

1382
01:13:53,281 --> 01:13:57,090
the poison and the all the spraying
and damaging the eco, the farming,

1383
01:13:57,091 --> 01:14:01,200
the land of missed content's minerals
and water. It's like hydroponics.

1384
01:14:01,201 --> 01:14:03,660
But in ms grown in missed holy shit.
Right?

1385
01:14:03,661 --> 01:14:06,420
And people don't know about this stuff,
but it's like absolutely insane.

1386
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,710
That's incredible. That's a beautiful
idea. That's what I'm saying. Wow.

1387
01:14:10,711 --> 01:14:12,280
Growing vegetables in mist

1388
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,750
and vertical towers.
You know,

1389
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:16,510
we could just like grow all the vegetables
we could ever need in genetically

1390
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:18,570
engineered to have better like vitamins,
you know?

1391
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,840
But you can't live Monsanto do that
though. Let's not going to be Monsanto.

1392
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:22,301
Just like,

1393
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:25,870
just like computers used to be these big
centralized grids and now everybody has

1394
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:27,930
an iPhone or just like a,
you know,

1395
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,060
gps used to be this big government thing
and now everybody has ups on the phone.

1396
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,430
These things will trickle
down and empower individuals.

1397
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:35,230
Biotechnologies not going to be Monsanto.

1398
01:14:35,231 --> 01:14:38,020
Biotechnology is going to be to
the domestication of biotechnology.

1399
01:14:38,021 --> 01:14:39,790
It's going to be personalized medicine,

1400
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:42,640
personalized software
upgrade of your physiology.

1401
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:44,390
It's not going to be these
big government thing.

1402
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:48,450
Be like a place where you go and you can
become a new person. Sure. Know Autumn,

1403
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:51,530
I want to be a black chick
just for like a year. Yeah.

1404
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:55,750
So you're a doctor to become your lover,
the lover, and become the black chick.

1405
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:59,320
How about like having sex with your
partner and like merging your nervous

1406
01:14:59,321 --> 01:15:02,360
system's together. I mean, we've been
trying to merge into one another.

1407
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,680
If you fuck a tantric sex, oh,
there you go. Come on mushrooms.

1408
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:07,310
You can make some shit happen,
Molly.

1409
01:15:07,311 --> 01:15:12,190
There you got that two song
edible marijuana as well.

1410
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:16,940
There's something about that makes it
very sensuous. Interesting. Mm hmm.

1411
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:20,520
The connection to hive. Yeah. That's when,

1412
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:23,380
when we can all jump into
the human pool, right? Yeah.

1413
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:27,070
The human pool of thoughts and ideas.
The human brain pool when all of us are,

1414
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:31,900
there's no cubicles, cubicles drop and
we're all on the same thing together.

1415
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,660
That's going to be strange
to come will become gods.

1416
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:38,670
It seems like it's inevitable, right? Oh,
absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. There's a,

1417
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,950
one of my favorite quotes by
Alan Harrington, who wrote,

1418
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:44,320
he was part of the beat generation and
he's staying out with all those guys.

1419
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,210
He wrote a book called the immortalists.
He said,

1420
01:15:46,211 --> 01:15:49,960
we must never forget that we
are cosmic revolutionaries,

1421
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:54,370
not stooges conscripted to advance
a natural order that kills everyone.

1422
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,391
So we,

1423
01:15:55,391 --> 01:16:00,130
it's romantic and defiant to say we
will not go quietly into that good night

1424
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,030
rage, rage against the dying of
the light. That's what we do.

1425
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:07,330
What was the first sentence? We must never
forget. We are cosmic revolutionaries.

1426
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:10,960
Could you imagine if you just
walked around a tee shirts
at cosmic revolutionary?

1427
01:16:10,961 --> 01:16:15,100
Hell yeah. People would be like, really,
dude, what'd you do today? You jerked off.

1428
01:16:15,101 --> 01:16:19,900
He watched the Carl Sagan
video on youtube. Totally
to a comic book store. Well,

1429
01:16:19,901 --> 01:16:23,800
Carl Sagan, evolutionary hunter.
Awesome. What a great fucking title.

1430
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:25,240
I think I'm going to have to change my,

1431
01:16:25,241 --> 01:16:29,020
a message board handled
cosmic revolutionary cosmic
revolution. Yay. Hello.

1432
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:30,910
You just think that's
beautiful. Yeah, dude,

1433
01:16:30,911 --> 01:16:32,620
we are away for the cosmos to know itself.

1434
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,920
Sagan said it himself and also we're the
frontal lobes of the universe because

1435
01:16:35,921 --> 01:16:38,290
so far we haven't found anything
more complicated than the brain.

1436
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:41,800
There's very few things more douchey
than calling yourself a revolutionary.

1437
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:46,410
Fair enough.
It sounds like a myspace page.

1438
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:50,030
You know what? I'm [inaudible].
I gotta drop the hand away.

1439
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:52,360
You say we ain't call my,
so that'd be very hypocritical.

1440
01:16:52,361 --> 01:16:55,640
I've made fun of people for calling
themselves mobile revolution. I'm like,

1441
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,660
someone's going to call you that man. Even
if it's tongue in cheek, like with me,

1442
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:01,650
it's completely, you know,
cosmic revolutionaries either.

1443
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,450
Then you've got to let somebody else
call you unless you have lightening bolts

1444
01:17:04,451 --> 01:17:05,200
in the background.

1445
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,650
Maybe like everybody got a tattoo that
says cosmic revolutionary in lighting.

1446
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:10,400
We

1447
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,830
were,
but the thing is I think humanity is,

1448
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:16,400
we are cosmic revolutionaries and I
also think we're nature's secret weapon,

1449
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:20,000
right? Actually the other one of the other
videos I did is code or something it's

1450
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:23,000
called to understand is to
perceive patterns and one
of the things that it looks

1451
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:25,730
at is the recurring patterns that occur
at different scales of reality from

1452
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:28,370
manmade systems to natural
systems and back again,

1453
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:33,140
it's like these natural patterns that
persist in nature and are now popping up

1454
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,870
in these big data visualizations
of manmade systems.

1455
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:40,040
You know how cities are like capillaries,
you know, alleys are like arteries.

1456
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:43,010
You know Jeffrey West and the Santa Fe
institute talks about this stuff and what

1457
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:46,950
it shows you is that yes we are free
agents participating in this project.

1458
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:51,010
Just progression of technology but
it's also, it's inevitable itself.

1459
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:52,760
Organizing its evolution.

1460
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:57,200
Like we are just participating actively
instead of passively in evolution.

1461
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:00,260
You can we play that one? I would
love for sure. How does he get to it?

1462
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,880
You think he has it right? Yeah.
Yeah. You've got a cute this,

1463
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:09,370
it was the other one that we,
yeah, I think this one right here.

1464
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:11,940
Yeah.
This one looking at the different,

1465
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:15,630
the galaxies in the neuron
and the mushroom mycelium
in London from the sky and

1466
01:18:15,631 --> 01:18:18,420
the Internet. Visualize. I'll
share the Shang nuts. Yeah.

1467
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,770
They all share the same Philip mental
structure. How strangers though

1468
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:27,090
[inaudible]

1469
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:30,300
do all your things start with
this? Yeah. Cause my friend,

1470
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,710
I am my very good friends.
Patterns.

1471
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:36,460
And of course what this means is the true
comprehension comes when the dots are

1472
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:40,030
revealed and you get some Johnson long
view. When you see the big picture

1473
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,650
patterns, patterns, recurring patterns
across different scales of reality.

1474
01:18:44,651 --> 01:18:44,890
You know,

1475
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:48,580
Paul talks about the mycelial archetype
and how to get information sharing

1476
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:51,820
systems that comprise the Internet look
exactly like computer models of dark

1477
01:18:51,821 --> 01:18:55,060
matter in the universe.
Look exactly like the neuron brain.

1478
01:18:55,061 --> 01:18:57,700
They all hear the same for
twinkle Philip mental structure.

1479
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:02,880
It's the rise of network is big data
advocates talk about how the systems are

1480
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,640
looking exactly like natural
systems and what we can measure.

1481
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,740
The more we can visualize it,
that we can visualize,

1482
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:11,350
the more expands our consciousness.
My seniors were occurring.

1483
01:19:11,351 --> 01:19:13,870
Patterns are scales of
reality blows my mind.

1484
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:18,820
And I think that technology increasingly
is becoming an expander human

1485
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:22,090
consciousness. It extends our far reaching
vision and revealing so much more.

1486
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:23,770
It's like,
whereas once I was blind,

1487
01:19:23,771 --> 01:19:27,190
now I can see Geoffrey West from the
Santa Fe institute is telling us that

1488
01:19:27,191 --> 01:19:31,210
cities are really like organisms. You
know, alleys are like capillaries.

1489
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:36,670
How is it possible that a
manmade artificial logical
system is behaving like a

1490
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:38,560
natural system?
The more efficient it becomes,

1491
01:19:38,561 --> 01:19:41,950
the board started to look like nature.
Really interesting, weird stuff. Um,

1492
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:45,940
you know, but, but it makes me optimistic.
It's like what Steven Johnson says, look,

1493
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:50,140
if we can understand all this
stuff, I mean, any, anything
becomes possible. Right?

1494
01:19:50,141 --> 01:19:53,460
It's the adjacent possible standing
as a sort of shadow future.

1495
01:19:53,461 --> 01:19:56,330
A map of all the ways the
president can reinvent itself. It's

1496
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:58,923
beautiful stuff.

1497
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:06,860
Crazy. Another one. That's another one
that's [inaudible]. Awesome. That's great.

1498
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:08,250
It's weird.
We could thought

1499
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:13,070
that the human brain cell looks like
the universe. Oh yeah. Like the galaxy.

1500
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:17,640
You liked the, yeah, the
neurons. The Internet. The
Internet too. It's terrifying.

1501
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:21,330
Yeah. Well, but it shows you that there's
these patterns persist because they've,

1502
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:25,110
they've, they allow innovation to occur.
Yeah. I mean, the city is the coral reef.

1503
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:27,690
When I say terrifying, I mean just
winning in its magnitude. You know,

1504
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,390
it's all the idea that
makes me feel mystical,

1505
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:32,300
that the fact that
neurons and all of that,

1506
01:20:32,301 --> 01:20:37,200
it's just really hard to wrap your
head around exact call. Just one soup.

1507
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:41,610
But doesn't that all relieve you of any
boredom? Yeah. Whoa. It definitely does.

1508
01:20:41,611 --> 01:20:42,480
That's why I do it.

1509
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:45,900
I don't know how anybody could
be bored with any of this stuff.

1510
01:20:45,901 --> 01:20:46,920
It's mind boggling.

1511
01:20:46,921 --> 01:20:50,220
It's to some people it's a little
unsettling because they like to think that

1512
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:53,070
this is where I get my coffee in the
morning. Right. Marge, how are you March?

1513
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:53,821
Meanwhile,

1514
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:57,620
Marjane strapped to a fucking giant rock
going a thousand miles an hour and a

1515
01:20:57,621 --> 01:20:58,980
circle.
You,

1516
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,870
Marge is hanging on in space and that
the earth is not connected to anything.

1517
01:21:03,871 --> 01:21:06,210
It's just floating out
there floating and spinning,

1518
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:10,740
winning like a motherfucker spinning a
thousand miles an hour around a giant

1519
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,550
nuclear explosion.
That's right.

1520
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:17,280
A big constant nuclear explosion
that will eventually die. Thank you.

1521
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:21,520
S bizarres fuck right. It's
something, well, you know the, the,

1522
01:21:21,521 --> 01:21:24,270
the red sox are doing well this year.
Yeah.

1523
01:21:24,271 --> 01:21:27,740
Well they'll find a way to fuck that
up. Yes or no, and then they, they,

1524
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,870
they know how's the tomatoes and then,
you know,

1525
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,100
go back home and take a shit
and that's it. All right.

1526
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,560
Let me just wait for the
inevitable while we spent.

1527
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:39,780
Yeah. Why do we like
mundane things? What is the,

1528
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:44,820
the [inaudible] there's
something comfortable in the
prosaic because the world

1529
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:49,860
at large can be overwhelming to all of
us. I mean, those videos are overwhelming.

1530
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:53,430
A psychedelic trip is overwhelming.
I mean a big city can be overwhelming.

1531
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:58,610
And I think that some people thrive in
the spaces in which they are overwhelmed

1532
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:04,400
and some people prefer to cower away
from it due to circumstances in their

1533
01:22:04,411 --> 01:22:08,010
lives, culture, preconceptions,
choices that they make.

1534
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:10,020
And ultimately I think that,

1535
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,990
I don't think we'd do well to judge
anybody for how they choose to live.

1536
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:17,991
I think that what you do is you try to
do what you can to share many different

1537
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:22,590
ideas and many points of views and they'll
find Dell find the astonishment that

1538
01:22:22,591 --> 01:22:27,390
they like best and partake hopefully in
that one. You know, Makenna talked about,

1539
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:28,470
uh,
technology and once,

1540
01:22:28,471 --> 01:22:31,290
I'll never forget this thing they said
he was talking about different areas in

1541
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:34,920
life where, um, uh, what he said that um,

1542
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:40,440
a a failed symbiotic
is what a parasite is.

1543
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:44,850
And that every parasite seeks to be a
symbiotic organism and seeks because we're

1544
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:47,080
all symbiotic. They want to
keep eating. They don't want it.

1545
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,660
They don't want you to
die cause then they die.

1546
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,540
I mean people have all sorts of funky
living things living inside their body.

1547
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:54,090
We're all symbiotic.
Yeah. And you know when,

1548
01:22:54,091 --> 01:22:56,970
when he talked about technology,

1549
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:59,460
one of the things that I
thought always was that,

1550
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,360
doesn't it seem like technology
is some sort of a symbiotic,

1551
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,710
some sort of like a living organism?

1552
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,510
It seems like.
I have,

1553
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,230
like I always talk about how I have like
dead skeletons of the old shit laying

1554
01:23:11,231 --> 01:23:14,320
around. I found an old phone the other
day. It's an old fucking dead thing,

1555
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:18,130
you know, like move past this. This
is a fucking mastodon. I'm looking at,

1556
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:20,830
told me I'm looking at an old mac
that's a dinosaur bone, you know?

1557
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:22,090
That's really what I mean.
That's why I,

1558
01:23:22,091 --> 01:23:25,570
that's why we call it the human
technology co evolution. You know,

1559
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:29,140
I'm a fellow of an organization called
hybrid realities institute that says we

1560
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:32,150
are already cyborgs and when comes,
yeah.

1561
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:36,010
But do you believe in the Kurtzweil idea
that they'll be some sort of a sentient

1562
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,100
intelligent life form? It will become
centered and able to move around.

1563
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:41,380
It'd be able to think on its
own and that will be a new life.

1564
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:43,930
So it really is a new life.
We're already a hybrid.

1565
01:23:43,931 --> 01:23:46,870
Somebody puts on a pacemaker in their
heart or they put in a chip in their brain

1566
01:23:46,871 --> 01:23:48,970
to help them with their tremors from like,
you know,

1567
01:23:48,971 --> 01:23:52,570
one of the Dick Cheney neurologicals
neuro know that I saw yesterday,

1568
01:23:52,571 --> 01:23:54,640
there was this new pump
that they put in a guy,

1569
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:57,850
he doesn't have a pulse and pulse
that shits in the Bible son.

1570
01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:02,550
We live inside of the constructs of
our imagination. We live in the spaces,

1571
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,750
we use technology, we use
electricity, we create phone card.

1572
01:24:05,751 --> 01:24:08,170
So water that comes to our house
through the pipes, you know,

1573
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:13,120
I mean we were already, we already are
symbiotes in symbiosis. The differences,

1574
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,850
the symbiosis becoming more and more
smooth, you know, the best technologies.

1575
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:17,680
It's not technology that
gets out of the way, right?

1576
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:20,350
It just allows you to do the artful
change that you want to make in the world

1577
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:23,790
without having to fuck with it too much.
And that's what happens as these guys,

1578
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:28,000
she acknowledges get smoother in the way
that they get in meshed in our lives.

1579
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:32,590
The sort of hybridization just gets
richer and deeper, but we're already,

1580
01:24:32,591 --> 01:24:34,900
it's already happening. It's
perfectly natural, so that's not,

1581
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:37,600
that's not a problem.
It's not something to be scared of it all.

1582
01:24:37,601 --> 01:24:42,400
It's something just to be refined and
and the [inaudible] well we make choices

1583
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:44,390
right when we buy apple
products were saying we let,

1584
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,920
we want things to have a sense of
aesthetic. We want them to be beautiful.

1585
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:52,660
We want our symbiosis to be functionally
rich but also aesthetically beautiful

1586
01:24:52,661 --> 01:24:53,494
and that's important.

1587
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,840
There's a thought that's been going
around a lot lately on the Internet.

1588
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:59,170
The Internet is Karma Free Iphones,

1589
01:24:59,171 --> 01:25:02,680
you know I talked about it on this podcast
and people are talking about it now,

1590
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:05,270
like the idea of making
conflict mineral free,

1591
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,920
definitely possible and that's
absolutely going to be possible.

1592
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,910
And with nanotechnology we can engineer
your own materials from scratch because

1593
01:25:11,911 --> 01:25:13,870
we are manipulating things
at the level of the atom.

1594
01:25:13,871 --> 01:25:18,070
We can turn dog shit into Pearl to gap,
call it the diamond age.

1595
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:19,980
That's where Shit's going
to get a really weird cause.

1596
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:23,860
Everyone would have a 10 foot
dick made out of gold. Oh yeah.

1597
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:25,720
Order order an information file.

1598
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:28,210
Print the toaster in your house
and you're going to have no,

1599
01:25:28,211 --> 01:25:31,090
what are we going to have
to pay for electricity?
Everything's going to be solar.

1600
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:33,670
No, everything's going to
be abundant and infinite.

1601
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,750
How are we going to pay for things?
Cause the monetary system,

1602
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:40,060
we post scarcity age there. No, you
don't pay for it. No paying for things.

1603
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:43,410
Abundance and how they become a baller.
He can be a baller.

1604
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:46,030
You know you can't make it
rain if everything's free,

1605
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:49,420
you can ever cut the ball or out of
society because then you're going to cut a

1606
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:51,970
lot of the funny out. Why?
Because people love their status.

1607
01:25:51,971 --> 01:25:55,090
If you can't restrict with ridiculous
behavior, if you want to keep comedy,

1608
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:59,080
can we create virtual simulations that
are indistinguishable from the real where

1609
01:25:59,081 --> 01:26:02,140
you can be the baller, there'll be
racist world. They'll be racist.

1610
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:04,070
Do it in a racist way.

1611
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:06,860
You got to let you gotta let ball kids.
You can't to judge.

1612
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:08,030
How many people would become ballers.

1613
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,100
There's a lot of white dudes
go ball or style, right?

1614
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:14,510
Lot of white dudes get black guy tattoos.
You know what I'm saying?

1615
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,310
Talk like a black guy.
You can't,

1616
01:26:16,311 --> 01:26:19,340
you can't factor that in the computer
simulation. You got to let that happen.

1617
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,910
You know what I'm saying?
Like he was having the white
rapper do that. Uh, has uh,

1618
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,050
all the platinum teeth.

1619
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:29,090
Wait [inaudible] he's like one of the
most famous white rapper dudes is,

1620
01:26:29,091 --> 01:26:32,180
he's legit. He's like
download all of our cars. No.

1621
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:37,110
Oh dammit. I can't remember
the dude's name, Chris.

1622
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,880
My point's been shattered for, I can't
remember his name. I points my shattered.

1623
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:43,910
My point is you couldn't be able to
figure that guy out in the computer

1624
01:26:43,911 --> 01:26:47,040
simulation gotta let that Guy Happen
in the real world. Yeah, definitely.

1625
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:51,200
That would be the real problem you
got if we were strict. All, you know,

1626
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:53,810
people really do evolve. We're going
to, it's like shit's not going to be,

1627
01:26:53,811 --> 01:26:58,700
it's funny. She's really
funny. I'm when I am right now.

1628
01:26:58,701 --> 01:27:02,930
Like it's like a, when I'm
William Randolph Hearst
wanted to keep cannabis down.

1629
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,620
So because he as a commodity,
what's really why he made it illegal.

1630
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,260
So he was an evil fuck and
William Randolph first,

1631
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:12,770
it was just a bad motherfucker that
read newspapers and he also had his own

1632
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:13,460
mills.

1633
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:17,720
So he was going to have to convert his
mills over to Katie hemp because hemp

1634
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:22,560
paper was like, who do you get four times
as much? You know, you at a, in a, um, uh,

1635
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:26,510
an acre and it replenishes itself
every six months. You know,

1636
01:27:26,511 --> 01:27:28,730
it's not like you have to wait 20 years
to the fucking trees to grow back.

1637
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:30,620
It's just like boom, it's there
again and you can redo it again.

1638
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,530
And so as a commodity, this is going
to cost him millions of dollars.

1639
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:36,950
So what he decided to do was just write
stories about weed and put it in his

1640
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:39,980
newspaper. It's really an amazing
thing that the guy pulled this off,

1641
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,860
that we're reefer madness and all that
stuff. All that stuff came from him.

1642
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:46,730
You talking about Paul Wall? There are the
Rapper Paula. Thank you Veronica Ricci.

1643
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:50,720
Thank you Veronica. Thank you very
much. Thanks. She's on a ball, dude.

1644
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:53,660
What a good drill you've got.
Um, yeah, because that guy,

1645
01:27:53,661 --> 01:27:55,670
you can't predict that guy
in a computer simulation.

1646
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:58,340
He's a great white rapper and he's
totally like town with black people.

1647
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:00,500
He's got crazy platinum teeth.
You know,

1648
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,980
you got to let that guy take place
because otherwise you're not going to have

1649
01:28:03,981 --> 01:28:05,420
the art. Kelly's of the world, right?

1650
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,500
With evolution with our Kelly will
not be there. And then come on man.

1651
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:12,620
If you ever watched that art Kelly real
talk video, have you ever watched that?

1652
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:14,120
You've never seen that.

1653
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:18,710
You've never seen the most brilliant
piece of human pop culture when you think

1654
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:20,120
that the world is evolving still.

1655
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:22,820
We're going to show you something right
now and let's get this might throw a

1656
01:28:22,821 --> 01:28:26,630
monkey wrench and all your theory. Sarah
Thrupp, some r Kelly. Real talk. Brian,

1657
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:30,350
it's been so long. It'd be loud too.
Let's find out and it's fun. Now finally,

1658
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:34,640
what happens? I'm feeling risky. I haven't
slept. There's so many of them now.

1659
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,650
Like I,
I checked checked recently.

1660
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:40,160
There's like 50 of them are Kelly is
down with people listening to his shit

1661
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:41,090
online as a mine.

1662
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:45,710
People getting mad at me because of this
whole thing where I said I'm a website.

1663
01:28:45,711 --> 01:28:48,110
I ask people to not put
links to pirated shit. I go,

1664
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,420
you know just don't get me in trouble.
I'm not telling you what to do.

1665
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:52,730
Just don't put that shit on my website,
you know?

1666
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:56,450
But people actually fair for you to say
people act like you're telling me like

1667
01:28:56,451 --> 01:28:59,060
you're fucking shuttering me man.

1668
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:02,040
They get so crazy when it
comes to this and and their,

1669
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:07,040
their need to justify streaming things
talk to because I think it's a great

1670
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:11,400
song.
You know what I'm saying?

1671
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:16,401
He knows a lot of profanity in it but
profanity represents just how real shit

1672
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:20,040
gets when you arguing with the girl
and Shit. You know what I'm saying?

1673
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:23,820
So I did it on youtube but I'm going
to do this shit for y'all on Youtube.

1674
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:27,170
I don't want him,
he drives to evolve any more than that.

1675
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:30,000
I want this guy to always exist,
stole.

1676
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:33,090
He's jumping off here so
we're going to be real man.

1677
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:33,990
I'm just going to be rid of him.

1678
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,970
We just don't roll the
film and we going to do it.

1679
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:40,500
I'm doing this for the fans that I
know around the globe. They love.

1680
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:41,500
We'll talk to me.

1681
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:46,530
This is what, this is our Kelly. They'll
give me, who is he out there? You Sir?

1682
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,113
Watch this.

1683
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:53,260
Is that a club with,
let him see the full view

1684
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:56,971
girl.

1685
01:29:56,971 --> 01:30:01,700
I'm not about to sit up here and argue
with you about who's to blame a call. No.

1686
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:09,650
Only thing I'm traveling stablish
the Jews not establish steps.

1687
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:13,283
This

1688
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:19,260
in the club with some mother [inaudible].

1689
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:22,680
Did she say that?

1690
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:25,360
Hold on guys there.
Did she stay?

1691
01:30:25,361 --> 01:30:28,860
There were other guys were other guys.

1692
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:32,670
Dan will tell me this.
How the fuck

1693
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:36,250
she knew I was with the
mother when the whole plot

1694
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,350
right here is good writers.
Good.

1695
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,710
I don't know why you fuck with
them all jealous. No man having

1696
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:51,770
real tall. He's really
tall. Some all bullshit.

1697
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:57,050
I'm just trying to have the
town [inaudible] bullshit.

1698
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:00,943
We'll talk.

1699
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:06,380
Did Not just give you money to go get Joe.

1700
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:13,240
He's the greatest of all time.
Damn money.

1701
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:16,960
No one's more entertaining.
Limber. R Kelly. I don't,

1702
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:20,870
I don't want us to ever not have
an r Kelly. Well, you know what?

1703
01:31:20,871 --> 01:31:24,140
That's what's great about the Internet
is that if you have the urge to share,

1704
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:28,970
you can share. That guy's crazy. I
need him. I need him to stay crazy.

1705
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,140
I want that. I want that guy. We didn't
even see some of the best lines in it.

1706
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:36,830
That he's brilliant. Maybe he be sitting
here. It might be a parody. Yeah.

1707
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:40,280
Even if it's not, I don't care. Whatever.
He's fucking rocking in his way.

1708
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:43,160
Good for him. I love him. I'll be
at r Kelly fan of the day. He dies.

1709
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:46,420
I hope you didn't really p on anybody
though. Now he did. I have the video.

1710
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:52,400
She's really young, right?
Nevermind. I don't have that

1711
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:58,580
number bad. Call her back color.
Yeah. Maybe we need to delay.

1712
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:01,990
We needed put a delay in us. I don't have
it anymore. I hate it when it came out.

1713
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,930
And is she, she, she looked
like she was younger.

1714
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,650
Like I don't know how young she was, but
she look like old enough. Like she look,

1715
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,170
she was dressed up like a stripper
and shit. You know. Wait a minute.

1716
01:32:11,171 --> 01:32:13,100
What are you talking about? Nothing. I
don't know what you're talking about.

1717
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:17,050
Say we need a delay. I know because
of the art Kelly comment, right? No,

1718
01:32:17,051 --> 01:32:21,410
because the other day when a w Jimmy
fake phone number on the air, oh,

1719
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:25,150
people got phone calls, some part, some
poor chick on Twitter. We hooked her up.

1720
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:28,150
She's going to come to the show tickets.
That's hilarious. Took care of her.

1721
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:31,240
I told her take care of her, her
tab two and a fucking asshole. Yeah.

1722
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,100
So we removed it.
Let me ask you,

1723
01:32:33,101 --> 01:32:36,340
when did you become interested in
all of the ideas of the singularity?

1724
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:40,030
I'm just curious,
but ray Kurtzweil is absolutely,

1725
01:32:40,031 --> 01:32:44,080
we should have ray here to talk.
I would love to come with them.

1726
01:32:44,081 --> 01:32:47,860
And Mckenna Mckenna was a
huge, huge influence because
he was just so compelling.

1727
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:51,760
His, uh, lecturers were so
fascinating to me. And like I said,

1728
01:32:51,761 --> 01:32:55,510
the first time I did DMT, I literally
heard it, what was represented shirt,

1729
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:59,030
his shirt, his words. You know
that nut too. I think, you know,

1730
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:04,090
there's been very few people that
have put as much down as he did,

1731
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,800
you know, as far as like those
recordings that you can get online.

1732
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:11,320
Like there's so many of them, man and
they're so God damn interesting man.

1733
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:16,560
He just had this really
weird way of phrasing things
and putting things together

1734
01:33:16,811 --> 01:33:20,620
and brain was wired on just another
level and he understood the power of

1735
01:33:20,621 --> 01:33:24,130
language. He also had a
lot about language, like we
live in a world of language.

1736
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:28,480
He said, note how I use big words as one
of the things that he said. I was like,

1737
01:33:28,481 --> 01:33:29,860
Yo,
why has he gotten in trouble?

1738
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:33,610
He's really fascinated and he calls
language and ecstatic activity of

1739
01:33:33,611 --> 01:33:38,050
signification. Yeah. Self defining
reality was brought forth,

1740
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:40,600
intimated by language and brought
forth into being by language please.

1741
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:44,080
But it is for sure. Totally is. I
mean we live in a world of mind,

1742
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:48,870
right up world of psyche,
dance are so on flights.

1743
01:33:49,370 --> 01:33:51,710
So unfortunately Mckenna
died and before you know,

1744
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:54,630
he could really see how crazy things
are getting right now. Yeah. You know,

1745
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:58,360
it's such a shame. That's
what I say. We've got to fix
the death problem men. Yeah.

1746
01:33:58,361 --> 01:34:00,880
Cool.
It robs us of all these luminous beings.

1747
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:03,040
So how many people do you
think the earth can support?

1748
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:07,480
I mean if you were going to go into the
stars stars for sure. Of course we are.

1749
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:08,890
That's the,
that's the human.

1750
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:12,730
That's the next leap is didn't stand
Ingrid said that got him in trouble.

1751
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:16,690
Well I'm [inaudible] cause he was
taking it. Nasa I think I was doing no,

1752
01:34:16,691 --> 01:34:18,930
he was doing really well
in the campaign trail.

1753
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:22,750
They said who's going to go to the moon
and people like pitch fix Detroit I

1754
01:34:22,751 --> 01:34:27,670
think four. No, I do. I do think
we didn't stay in the caves.

1755
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:31,270
We didn't stay with the limitations of
biology. We won't stay on the planet.

1756
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:35,070
I mean I think I to be human is to
transcend our boundaries. Like, I think,

1757
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:38,110
think if it's possible with that natural,
oh yeah.

1758
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,720
It's all figure out a way
to Geo engineer's some
other planet and ship people

1759
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:43,240
over there and we'll, we'll figure it
out. I mean I, man, I ain't, I'm Brian,

1760
01:34:43,241 --> 01:34:46,270
but how could you say that? It's
impossible. When you look at we've, we've,

1761
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:51,330
we've been able to do here and just a
short couple of hundred years for $200 or

1762
01:34:51,821 --> 01:34:54,130
$300 you can buy an iPhone.

1763
01:34:54,131 --> 01:34:57,980
Something that the richest person on
the face of the planet 50 years ago

1764
01:34:57,981 --> 01:35:02,210
couldn't buy with all his
billions. I isn't that amazing.
What a crazy invention.

1765
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:06,590
If everyone on the other side of the
country like woopty other side of the

1766
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:09,440
country when we all lived on one side
of the country with the earth go out of

1767
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:12,130
it's spent. Yes, the earth would
sink. It would flip over it.

1768
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:16,040
Somebody's actually been out that somebody
actually asked when most of the world

1769
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:19,990
is water anyway. Like it's mostly
empty space. The planet, right.

1770
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:23,060
Mostly empty space and more,
more people are moving into cities anyway,

1771
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:25,520
so it's going to be just more
and more just empty space.

1772
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:28,490
There was someone who actually asked
that. There was like, I forget who it was.

1773
01:35:28,491 --> 01:35:30,980
It was like a recent thing. It
was a story really. Somebody acts.

1774
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:34,250
There was too many people on an island
and he was worried if they had all that

1775
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:37,250
people on one side, whether the, I
don't want to capsize. It was a real,

1776
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:42,100
a real person actually asked that
question like, dude, you know what?

1777
01:35:42,101 --> 01:35:42,691
We've got to get you.

1778
01:35:42,691 --> 01:35:45,510
We gotta get you some tee shirts
from the imaginary foundation. Okay.

1779
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,000
Do they exist

1780
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:52,070
in the line of the day because
I'm visible. Here's a, here's a,

1781
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:56,190
here's one of my favorite
teas. Loser. Yeah. No,

1782
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,830
the imaginary foundation,

1783
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:01,130
they make apparel that celebrates
the power of human imagination.

1784
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:03,170
If you can go to imaginary foundation,
they're going, that is one of them.

1785
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:04,130
The one you're wearing right now.

1786
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:07,150
It's like they think it's actually
with a bunch of cool colors on them and

1787
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:10,100
there's this like old guy underneath
like holding it up like, Oh wow,

1788
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,630
that's pretty cool.

1789
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:15,170
I mean there's stuff is like the most
gorgeous and inspired imagery that I've

1790
01:36:15,171 --> 01:36:18,410
ever come across because it's cosmic,
but it's also whimsical and psychedelic.

1791
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:23,270
So it's like singularity meets
psychedelic rapture in image.

1792
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:26,030
Yeah. Just I love them, man.
I want, I want, they'll say,

1793
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:29,120
I'll get them to send you a shirt. You
guys. That'd be great. Sounds awesome man.

1794
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:33,460
Yeah. Um, how did you meet a Ray
Kurzweil? I met him because um, you know,

1795
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:35,480
for five years I was hosting
a television show for current,

1796
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:38,090
which is Al Gore's cable in the channel.
Right. So that's what I was doing.

1797
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:42,550
Heard that him and Keith Olbermann at Ben.
That's the rumor I guess. Rawling yeah,

1798
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,800
squabbling squabble.
Then I left the network last year,

1799
01:36:45,801 --> 01:36:47,540
so I already knew about that.
Yeah.

1800
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:49,400
A lot of politics of bullshit
going down over there.

1801
01:36:49,401 --> 01:36:53,210
They don't appreciate the talent. Did they
not see these youtube clips? No, I just,

1802
01:36:53,211 --> 01:36:56,840
I wanted to make content on a,
on my own terms.

1803
01:36:56,841 --> 01:36:59,300
And after four and a half years
doing anything that he'd done,

1804
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:02,970
it got septation kicks in. So you just
crave something different. But, um,

1805
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:06,860
adaptation. Yeah, we'll, let's just
like, you'd need to be hedonistic.

1806
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:10,610
That's a strain he done got notation means
that something that gave you pleasure

1807
01:37:10,611 --> 01:37:12,710
stops being as stimulated as it once was.

1808
01:37:12,711 --> 01:37:17,210
You adapt to the hedonic nature of it
so that it's no longer hedonic. Oh,

1809
01:37:17,211 --> 01:37:18,080
so you're,

1810
01:37:18,081 --> 01:37:21,400
you're hedonism once you give into it
and you always constantly tolerance.

1811
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:25,580
Tolerance, like drugs. So you
are a hedonistic, Chunky, well,

1812
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:27,410
I've always thought that.
Don't you think like Alex,

1813
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:29,630
especially a gambling junkies,
they seem to be,

1814
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:34,000
it seems to be a hedonistic drug of
choice. You know that intelligence,

1815
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,301
we're hacking,

1816
01:37:35,301 --> 01:37:38,590
we're hacking our fight or flight mode
and we're hacking our own dopamine

1817
01:37:38,591 --> 01:37:41,480
secretion. Why do people go to scary
movies? You might ask to be scared. No,

1818
01:37:41,481 --> 01:37:44,570
they go to scary movies because it says
it's very Meta. You know, you're fine,

1819
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,210
but you also are tricking
yourself into being scared.

1820
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:48,560
But because you know you're fine,

1821
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,450
then it's okay to be scared
cause then it's exciting.

1822
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:54,350
Or like roller coasters or skydiving
paying to feel like you're going to die,

1823
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,160
but knowing you're not going to dodge,

1824
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:59,790
you can only do that because we're
very Meta and uh, but anyway,

1825
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:03,570
let me tell you how I met Ray Kurzweil.
One more point. The about the casinos.

1826
01:38:03,571 --> 01:38:07,950
Like I think that when you put a
casino in a one certain place too,

1827
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:10,830
I think you alter people's behavior when
you let them know that it's like this

1828
01:38:10,831 --> 01:38:13,380
one spot way over there and it's only,

1829
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:15,000
that's the only place
you're allowed to gamble.

1830
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:16,590
They just go there and start gambling.
You know,

1831
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:17,870
it's like they feel like
once they got there,

1832
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:21,090
but if you allowed people to
gamble everywhere they are,

1833
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,590
I doubt people would probably
wouldn't be as exciting. I'll just,

1834
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,310
Marvin fruit is always kind of a,
that is a really interesting,

1835
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:28,380
what'd you call it? The
hedonistic what? Well,

1836
01:38:28,381 --> 01:38:30,580
I was talking about he dynamic
Adam Thomas Adaptation.

1837
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:33,150
What happens if you are anything
that's always around becomes invisible.

1838
01:38:33,151 --> 01:38:36,080
I gotta remember that phrase because
that's a, that really is what it is. Yeah.

1839
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:38,300
It's a weird,
I've always wondered what that's for.

1840
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,940
I guess it's because we're
always trying to push forward.

1841
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:47,220
I think it's our brain's way of saying
that, you know, if tell late me, yeah,

1842
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:51,510
if you don't stimulate me,
I will just make you a Zombie in return.

1843
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,360
What do you think the genetic
reason for that is? You know, is it,

1844
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:58,670
is it to push Kenneth Energy
forward to keep frozen, to bleed?

1845
01:38:58,671 --> 01:39:03,180
There must be some reason to get you
to continue to expand your sphere of

1846
01:39:03,181 --> 01:39:06,750
possibilities. And what is more rewarding
than when you do create something like,

1847
01:39:06,751 --> 01:39:09,690
look, you might choose videos.
I'm watching you watching
these videos and you're,

1848
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:11,050
you know, you're, you're,

1849
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:15,510
you get a little charge out of yourself
knowing that early, get off, get off. No,

1850
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:17,250
you, you created something. I mean,

1851
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:20,910
that's one of the best
things that a person can feel
isn't they create something

1852
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:23,610
and somebody likes it. Yeah. You
know, it's really what really a,

1853
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:28,370
it's a cultural equivalent of like
sexual reproduction. This, you know,

1854
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:32,100
spreading the seed. And why, why it's
so hard for men to be monogamous.

1855
01:39:32,101 --> 01:39:35,490
Supposedly we'll, because we're wired to
spread the seed to spread information,

1856
01:39:35,491 --> 01:39:38,970
genetic information as as wide
across as possible. But guess what?

1857
01:39:38,971 --> 01:39:43,320
We've transcended at biological evolution
with culture. So now the seed is with,

1858
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:47,310
you know what they call them,
memes. Mimetic content and
names are like organisms.

1859
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:48,181
They're like sperms.

1860
01:39:48,181 --> 01:39:51,300
Their nuggets of information that are
spreading and leaping from brain to brain.

1861
01:39:51,301 --> 01:39:52,080
They're alive.

1862
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:56,740
So in a way we no longer need to spread
our seed physiologically really anymore.

1863
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,400
We do it culturally do.
I'm trying to,

1864
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:01,890
you know these nuggets I called them
inspired nuggets of techno rapture.

1865
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:05,160
There's just little nuggets.
They just, hopefully we'll do it.

1866
01:40:05,161 --> 01:40:08,010
Those are the perfect way to do it because
anybody could send anybody it's know

1867
01:40:08,011 --> 01:40:10,470
even if your Internet connection
socks right up really quick.

1868
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:12,980
It's only two minutes long,
right? It's, and it's,

1869
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:16,410
it's the right amount of commitment or
probably just go whoa, but that doesn't,

1870
01:40:16,411 --> 01:40:19,580
that require them to remember some
shit that you saw 20 minutes earlier,

1871
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:20,850
you know,

1872
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:23,550
two minutes shots of philosophical
expressive and then you put them on the

1873
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:27,300
Twitter. Right. I logged into,
I registered for Twitter I
think like two years ago.

1874
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:31,770
Oh yeah, yeah. At Jason underscore
silver by the way. But um,

1875
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:33,300
I remember when I first started Twitter,

1876
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:36,660
I didn't understand it because I
thought 140 characters are so limited,

1877
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:40,980
but it actually makes sense in an age
of information when you're saturated and

1878
01:40:40,981 --> 01:40:45,150
so much knowledge that it forces you to
be concise so that you can alleviate the

1879
01:40:45,151 --> 01:40:46,080
sort of bandwidth,

1880
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:48,570
bandwidth anxiety of being flooded
with just so much information.

1881
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,570
People short keep it quick,
Goddamn verbose. You know,

1882
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:55,960
people just ponder on as I do three
hour podcasts, let me tell you.

1883
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:59,890
But that's why we love them. Do that is
part of what we love, but not in writing.

1884
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:02,820
Writing. It's annoying. Why I'm making
me read so much. Well. Yeah. Well that's,

1885
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:05,880
I mean that it comes to
like social interaction.

1886
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:07,240
That's why I made the videos shorts,

1887
01:41:07,241 --> 01:41:12,241
because I don't feel entitled
to 30 minutes of People's
time necessarily because

1888
01:41:12,401 --> 01:41:16,960
I know that there's a lot of media that
is trying to suck their attention. No,

1889
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:20,940
I feel like he did this perfect. Yeah. Two
minutes is a quick like, you know, it's,

1890
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:22,660
it's a donation and Twitter maybe,
you know,

1891
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:26,020
maybe you could pop it up to
like 200 words or 200 letters.

1892
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:27,203
That would be about it.

1893
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,040
It doesn't work on podcasts. I, I used to,

1894
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:33,990
I do a podcast with Ari Shaffir caudle
a one minute podcast and it's just like

1895
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:36,210
pretty much you just say hi and
then you have to say goodbye.

1896
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:40,860
It doesn't work for a podcast. So he did
it on as a podcast. Yeah. Did you really?

1897
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:42,260
Yeah. That's ridiculous. Yeah.

1898
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:45,840
You can't, you couldn't even just
reading Twitter off a podcast,

1899
01:41:45,841 --> 01:41:48,660
you can't do that because then it just
say negative shit to get your attention.

1900
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:52,520
Right. You know? We're just trying to
be the loudest, I don't like negativity.

1901
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:57,570
It's very sad. So sad. It is, but is
it natural? Is it important? Is it,

1902
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:01,770
is it necessary for us to appreciate
the good? Do we have to experience this,

1903
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:02,140
this,

1904
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:06,240
the ruin and varies school of thought
that says things only make sense due to

1905
01:42:06,241 --> 01:42:08,550
their contrast. You can only
appreciate pleasure if you know pain,

1906
01:42:08,551 --> 01:42:11,730
but I don't know, I think we can evolve
past that. I think we can you pleasure.

1907
01:42:11,731 --> 01:42:15,690
Just because it's pleasurable and not
need it's opposite. I'm not sure if we'll,

1908
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:19,470
we'll get there. Why not? I hope
while we've gotten, you know,

1909
01:42:19,471 --> 01:42:22,620
it's all been positive up to here even
though our of horrific things have

1910
01:42:22,621 --> 01:42:26,430
happened along the way. You know,
it's not like the Ganga is con days.

1911
01:42:26,431 --> 01:42:30,030
We're doing a little bit better,
much lesser mind, a few choice spots.

1912
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:33,330
Totally on the planet, you know,
unless you're in right now in Syria,

1913
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:36,010
which is a really crazy, you've been
watching this stuff in the news. Yeah.

1914
01:42:36,011 --> 01:42:40,540
It's very, very upsetting. What's going
on over there? It's crazy. Um, but um,

1915
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:44,460
I'm hopeful that the world is going to,
well, we'll, we'll get home. We need to,

1916
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:46,130
you know,
the world needs to respond to them.

1917
01:42:46,131 --> 01:42:48,120
I'm hopeful we'll move in that direction.

1918
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:53,730
It's fascinating how we're watching these
countries that have been controlling

1919
01:42:54,811 --> 01:42:59,280
people through fear, through
dictatorships, military dictatorships,

1920
01:42:59,281 --> 01:43:03,030
and we're watching them fold, boom,
boom, boom, just left and right.

1921
01:43:03,031 --> 01:43:07,370
And everybody knows and they're all
terrified. Yeah. You know, it's all,

1922
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:11,760
how long can you hold down? How long can
you resist the movement and movement?

1923
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,130
You know, that's gonna make you, you're
not going to be a trillionaire anymore,

1924
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:18,450
Mr. Well, people, people,
people will persist and they'll,

1925
01:43:18,451 --> 01:43:22,500
there'll be successful. Actually Kurzweil
is also known for predicting the,

1926
01:43:22,501 --> 01:43:27,450
so when the Soviet Union would collapse,
did he really accurately, wow. Yeah. Yeah.

1927
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:29,190
You figure it out. Well, because he was,

1928
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:33,450
he saw the exponential growth curves of
information technology and he predicted

1929
01:43:33,451 --> 01:43:36,840
that basically the free
flow of information would
eventually be too much for

1930
01:43:36,841 --> 01:43:39,900
that insulated. Just put it in a
computer program or say, oh no,

1931
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:41,580
he had predicted it. He, he,

1932
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:44,520
he has an uncanny ability to
make predictions that come true.

1933
01:43:44,521 --> 01:43:47,400
It's the reason that he's called
the smartest man since Edison,

1934
01:43:47,401 --> 01:43:48,234
by all these people.

1935
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:51,620
And when I met him was because I
did a short on current TV called the

1936
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:52,580
immortalists. What's, what's,

1937
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:55,790
what's focused on just the maverick
techno optimists who were trying to find a

1938
01:43:55,791 --> 01:43:59,150
solution to the problem of death. And I
became friends with him and I felt like,

1939
01:43:59,151 --> 01:43:59,361
wow,

1940
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:03,320
this is the most brilliant guy and I
want to do everything I can to help push

1941
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:05,600
these ideas forward because these are
the biggest ideas in the history of the

1942
01:44:05,601 --> 01:44:08,320
world. And, uh, and then, uh,

1943
01:44:08,321 --> 01:44:11,660
I became even friendlier with him because
I also became very good friends with

1944
01:44:11,661 --> 01:44:15,230
Barry Ptolemy who directed transcendent
man, the film about Kurzweil. And, uh,

1945
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:18,330
and since then, fucking fell
amazing. Transcendent man is,

1946
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:20,880
I've seen it several times. We'll
do really inspirational. Yeah.

1947
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:25,700
It's a magnificent dock. And, uh, and if
you, you would love Barry, the director,

1948
01:44:25,701 --> 01:44:27,610
he's awesome and a shorter one.

1949
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:30,620
And there's a feeling of a labor of
love because what we're doing is we're

1950
01:44:30,621 --> 01:44:33,440
evangelizing some ideas that could
transform the human condition and

1951
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:35,660
unfathomably rich ways.
And you know,

1952
01:44:35,661 --> 01:44:39,830
you have Kurzweil who's just like what
he's lending us with these ideas and with

1953
01:44:39,831 --> 01:44:44,230
his mind is just, there's nothing short
of astonishing. As I was saying earlier,

1954
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:48,640
such a dramatic thing to watch
to his pursuit of this, you know,

1955
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:53,650
his pursuit of enlightening people as
to the consequences and the radical

1956
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:58,100
possibilities that it's, it's such
food for your brain. Yeah. You know,

1957
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:02,120
Kurt's while was one of the, you
know, there's so many on the Internet.

1958
01:45:02,121 --> 01:45:02,990
I mean it's, it's, it's a way,

1959
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:08,030
it's an amazing time to influence by
people and to be able to repossess a blog

1960
01:45:08,871 --> 01:45:12,560
entries like literally like a day
after something happens. You know,

1961
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:15,320
someone interesting, we'll blog
something and it just, it, I mean,

1962
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:18,590
what a strange time we have.
Totally. It's, this is the strange,

1963
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:21,290
strange time in human history.
We're swimming in it,

1964
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:25,700
we're swimming in it right now. During
this time. The rate of change gets faster.

1965
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:28,000
Evolution is telescoping basically.

1966
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:30,320
So it took a billion years
to get to a certain point.

1967
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,960
And then the last hundred years
we've created more change.

1968
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:36,590
So the rate of things change and gets
faster and faster and faster until it's no

1969
01:45:36,591 --> 01:45:41,020
longer even quantifiable until we kind
of like merge with our technology.

1970
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:44,570
Ever get recruited to speak at one of
those 2012 conferences. I'll do it.

1971
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:47,390
I just spoke at digital life
design in Munich, which is like,

1972
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:51,890
it's a super kind of technology futurism
invite only event. It was awesome.

1973
01:45:51,891 --> 01:45:54,410
Like Yoko Ono spoke and wow.
Sheryl Sandberg,

1974
01:45:54,411 --> 01:45:58,860
the president of Facebook's about Yoko
Ono spoke. Yeah, there's a lot of like,

1975
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,450
I dunno what she spoke about it Mr. Todd,
but I'll show you.

1976
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:04,790
She used to fuck a famous
guy. There you go. No,

1977
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:09,140
but that was actually my video was
shown at the Economist magazine Ideas

1978
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:09,890
Festival.
Oh Wow.

1979
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:12,500
So you can imagine when you have
like a crowd of like the economist,

1980
01:46:12,501 --> 01:46:13,730
then you're showing them these
videos and then you know,

1981
01:46:13,731 --> 01:46:15,230
the best part they got it,
dude.

1982
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:18,410
They didn't think that I was just like
some crazy hippies spewing forth these

1983
01:46:18,411 --> 01:46:20,870
ideas.
Rhapsodic they totally get it.

1984
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:23,510
And I spoke at the singularity
summit incidentally,

1985
01:46:23,511 --> 01:46:26,390
which is the conference that's all
about the technological singularity.

1986
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:30,620
And I spoke about the importance of art
design and aesthetics to come make stick

1987
01:46:30,670 --> 01:46:33,440
to sort of transmit with these ideas
because people only respond to what moves

1988
01:46:33,441 --> 01:46:36,470
them. You know, can only show them so
many graphs before they fall asleep.

1989
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:38,740
But if you inspire them,
if you epiphany's him,

1990
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:39,800
if you give somebody the goosebumps,

1991
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,290
they'll remember it and I showed
the videos and sure enough,

1992
01:46:42,291 --> 01:46:45,500
like people really seem to respond
to them. So they're definitely,

1993
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:48,410
it's creating a kind of,
I'm hopeful.

1994
01:46:48,411 --> 01:46:50,970
I think I'm going to be speaking at
Google in March actually as well.

1995
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:54,660
A friend and friend to setting that up.
Let's Yoko Ono. Like I didn't meet her,

1996
01:46:54,661 --> 01:46:57,210
she was speaking in the other
atrium at the same time as me.

1997
01:46:57,210 --> 01:47:01,290
She was my competition.
Does she speak and Larry inside of a bed?

1998
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:04,710
Like did they just like roll a bed up onto
stage and she says [inaudible] Graham,

1999
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:05,670
John Lennon in there,

2000
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:10,590
whether it's just like young John
Lennon and now today you'll call.

2001
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:15,240
No, it's just a fucking tricky. It's
really, really darkly lit and they sing.

2002
01:47:15,241 --> 01:47:17,160
Imagine, would you fuck Yoko Ono? No.

2003
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:20,100
She had an art exhibit that I
went to when I lived in Boston.

2004
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:23,190
It was really bizarre. It was one
of the strangest art exhibits ever.

2005
01:47:23,191 --> 01:47:27,060
And one of the things she had was a block
of wood with a bunch of nails in it.

2006
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:27,900
And uh,

2007
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:32,900
there was a hammer and a box of nails
there and she encouraged people to pick up

2008
01:47:33,271 --> 01:47:35,820
the nails and contribute to the art.
Wow.

2009
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:40,320
And she said that that's how she wanted
people to be enthusiastic about our art

2010
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:45,330
by letting them contribute. And my joke
was, take the nail, putting your forehead.

2011
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:51,940
I'd be a line around
the block. I'm, no, no,

2012
01:47:51,941 --> 01:47:55,890
nobody's probably going to hit the nail.
But it'd be interesting to watch,

2013
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,030
you know,

2014
01:47:57,030 --> 01:48:00,720
if there was just her standing there with
the nail in her forehead and she left

2015
01:48:00,721 --> 01:48:04,770
a hammer there. Most, most people are not
going to kill you, but you never know,

2016
01:48:04,771 --> 01:48:08,520
man. You never know, John. That would
be an interesting art piece, you know,

2017
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:12,150
that'd be a pretty fucking crazy thing
to do. Anybody please steal this idea.

2018
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:13,440
Yeah,
and everybody else,

2019
01:48:13,441 --> 01:48:15,540
please don't hit him in the head
with a hammer that's fucked up.

2020
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,520
You know what's interesting about art?

2021
01:48:17,550 --> 01:48:22,140
I always think the kind of
art I'm interested in is
that the art that is there

2022
01:48:22,141 --> 01:48:26,670
to kind of move me in some way. You
know, there was a great notion of,

2023
01:48:26,671 --> 01:48:30,600
do you ever notice why beauty? Sometimes
it makes you sad like true beauty,

2024
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:33,240
like something really
rapturously beautiful.

2025
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:36,600
Well I'm a man so that doesn't happen.
I'll get sad.

2026
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:41,230
I'll cure like strip strip
clubs like [inaudible]. No,

2027
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:44,490
I'm talking about sunset
something sublime.

2028
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:48,690
That doesn't make me sad.
I look at true beauty like a,

2029
01:48:48,770 --> 01:48:52,170
like a magnificent gift to the universe.
So that's, that's what I give it to.

2030
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:55,110
But you know why it sometimes makes
me sad is because they say that Alan

2031
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:57,810
[inaudible] says that the reason
it makes sense because the beauty,

2032
01:48:57,870 --> 01:49:00,270
what beauty hints at is
at times the exception.

2033
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,410
So it reminds us of a lot of the
mediocrity that surrounds us.

2034
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:07,350
And then we're like sad because we see
a glimpse of the ideal and mankind has

2035
01:49:07,351 --> 01:49:08,830
been obsessed with the ideal ever since.
You know,

2036
01:49:08,870 --> 01:49:12,630
we started making the Greek statues of
David back in the day and that's all well

2037
01:49:12,631 --> 01:49:16,050
and good until you start getting gray
hair on your balls and then you know,

2038
01:49:16,051 --> 01:49:19,620
you start appreciating things
cause you will as the end is near.

2039
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:24,450
Oh so sad. Right? It's just life.
No, I know. [inaudible] I appreciate,

2040
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,690
I do not get sad when I see
beautiful things ever. Just entropy.

2041
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,630
I love [inaudible]. I love it.
I love beautiful things too.

2042
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:34,050
But he gets out a little bit.
Well I, they, beauty moves me.

2043
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:36,600
Do you ever have sore
nipples when you see,

2044
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:40,680
if you see like once a month it gets
sore and I'm just being completely

2045
01:49:40,681 --> 01:49:45,070
ridiculous. I'm sorry, I'm just trying to
be funny. Maybe. Maybe it's a Latin thing.

2046
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:50,410
Comedians sometimes. Do you dye
your pubes show? No. Why? Why not?

2047
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:52,960
Ship them off? Yeah. They're
only on the, on the sac.

2048
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:57,100
The SAC is the only the gravy ones in the
bushes. All black. A jungle. Dark, sad.

2049
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:00,120
Okay. So it's scary. See, it's telling
me in the box, I need to see your,

2050
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:04,510
the documentary fear spirit. You say
that right there, man. You need to pause.

2051
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,420
I'm talking about my boss.
Like I need to see your

2052
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:13,230
40 and shit right there.
Sign. I didn't have to phrase
that like that. That's like,

2053
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,780
that's like, that's almost in the same
category as making somebody flinch.

2054
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:21,180
You're obviously not used to doing the
stupid show like this. No, I'm kidding.

2055
01:50:21,190 --> 01:50:24,940
This is amazing, man. Amazing having you
on, man. You're blowing people's minds.

2056
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:29,170
Hey, you didn't pause enough. First thing
that either Joe, what happened blowing,

2057
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:33,940
blowing or you're right. Very
good point. Very good point.

2058
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:39,190
Um, anyway, you were saying
something about your documentary,

2059
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:42,970
the spirit molecule. The dog
wasn't mine. All I did was I was,

2060
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:45,270
I was like the rod sterling
of it and you know,

2061
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:46,990
it's just all the stuff that they wanted.
I was,

2062
01:50:46,991 --> 01:50:48,870
it was an honor just to do it for him.
It's a,

2063
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:52,150
my friend Mitch Schultz who did it
was really, uh, a very illuminating

2064
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:55,480
documentary called Dmt, the
spirit molecule. A lot of
like really interesting,

2065
01:50:55,481 --> 01:50:59,340
intelligent and brilliant people who
have had DMT experiences and the time

2066
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:02,440
that's available. I'm pretty sure
it's on iTunes. I know it's online.

2067
01:51:02,441 --> 01:51:06,770
You can find it. Google it by. It's really
good. You'll love it. Very cool. Yeah,

2068
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:11,080
it's a fascinating, um, thing that there's
some sort of a chemical that you, human,

2069
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:14,080
the human mind makes. It's the most
intense psychedelic known demand.

2070
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:15,670
It's really weird.
You know,

2071
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:19,990
it makes you ask all these questions and
why it evolved because there's a reason

2072
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:20,580
that

2073
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:24,270
when you were talking earlier about
the idea of engineering states of

2074
01:51:24,271 --> 01:51:27,840
consciousness that we're going to be able
to engineer a state of complete total

2075
01:51:27,841 --> 01:51:29,250
bliss. Totally. You know,

2076
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:31,940
the idea that you're going to have a
DMT button on the end of your fucking

2077
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:36,850
key chain is pressing
Du du, Du, Du, Du, Du,

2078
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:37,410
Du Phil.

2079
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:42,180
He is going into some fucking crazy
spiral of going to be like with no

2080
01:51:42,181 --> 01:51:45,840
boundaries. You imagine if we were,
but that's all anyone's going to do.

2081
01:51:45,841 --> 01:51:47,550
I'm just going to DMT
trip all that. Yeah. Well,

2082
01:51:47,551 --> 01:51:52,110
there was an article in wired recently
about an Djs using nanoparticles in the

2083
01:51:52,111 --> 01:51:56,250
future to get the audience like
literally. Hi. Wow, that's incredible.

2084
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,260
Instead of using chemical
technology, electronic technology.
Oh, D people, man. Well,

2085
01:52:01,261 --> 01:52:04,050
I don't think [inaudible] o d people.

2086
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:07,140
The song was so good. It made someone
to have a fucking heart attack.

2087
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:08,333
Jim [inaudible].

2088
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,740
Well, yeah, but then what? That nobody
would want to go. If that happens,

2089
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:13,420
people will go for the ecstatic.

2090
01:52:13,570 --> 01:52:17,650
Yeah. There's a few policies. You
can't make it. She can't run up hill.

2091
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:23,140
That sounds, yeah, that sounds ridiculous,
but the, the idea of nanoparticles.

2092
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:24,970
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2093
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:28,600
We'll like in your change the way you
think and chicken as a whole row of people

2094
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:30,700
change the reality.
Yeah.

2095
01:52:30,770 --> 01:52:33,500
Did you must get crazy managing.
We're going down the rabbit hole for sure.

2096
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:35,860
Which is this,
what if this is the future?

2097
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:40,270
We all go into a gigantic airplane
warehouse, right? Like an airplane hangar.

2098
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:42,640
They closed the doors,
they hit the button,

2099
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:45,950
the nanoparticles come out and
all of a sudden we're in Avatar.

2100
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:50,330
Yeah. We're flying through space ships
and shit. All of this is taking place.

2101
01:52:50,331 --> 01:52:52,730
We're just standing there. We
were in real life, real life.

2102
01:52:52,731 --> 01:52:56,480
We're just standing there. Why wouldn't
you? That's exactly what we engineers,

2103
01:52:56,481 --> 01:53:01,160
your entire imagination creates an
image that it is uploaded to your

2104
01:53:01,161 --> 01:53:05,840
consciousness and everybody experiences
it totally and that move around in it

2105
01:53:05,841 --> 01:53:10,430
and like reality. You can change it.
Yeah, you can change it and alter it.

2106
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,950
Exactly. Dude. We're
all be world builders.

2107
01:53:12,951 --> 01:53:17,750
You can use imagination inside that
world because if you think about it,

2108
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:20,030
that's already the world that we live in.

2109
01:53:20,031 --> 01:53:23,480
It just has taken longer to execute it
because somebody thought of an airplane

2110
01:53:23,481 --> 01:53:26,270
and then they imagined themselves flying
on the airplane and then they built the

2111
01:53:26,271 --> 01:53:29,630
airplane and then it worked and
then they flew in. Today we all fly.

2112
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:32,390
It's just that because it
took 40 50 60 70 years,

2113
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:35,180
it doesn't feel like we just
created the world that we live in,

2114
01:53:35,181 --> 01:53:38,780
but we didn't just create, we
literally just created it. I mean,

2115
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:42,320
that's the craziest part of all that.
That's not a metaphor.

2116
01:53:42,321 --> 01:53:43,430
That's not an exaggeration.

2117
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:48,610
We live inside of worlds that we have
created and yet we're still a part of this

2118
01:53:49,731 --> 01:53:52,310
gigantic thing, this planet, you know,

2119
01:53:52,311 --> 01:53:55,910
we're still a part of this hive of
organisms. How did we come about?

2120
01:53:56,060 --> 01:54:00,230
How did we emerge so prominently? I
mean, I know there's a lot of theories,

2121
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:03,470
but what do you subscribe to? The stoned
ape theory? Do you have your own theory?

2122
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:07,490
No, I think, I mean, you
know, it's difficult to prove
right, but I definitely,

2123
01:54:07,491 --> 01:54:11,060
I find it the most captivating account
and makes sense to me based on every very

2124
01:54:11,061 --> 01:54:14,540
captivating people don't know. Explain
to people what the theory is. Yeah. Well,

2125
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:18,500
the stoned ape hypothesis basically
tries to explain at one point sort of

2126
01:54:18,501 --> 01:54:20,330
language emerged,
you know,

2127
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:24,980
from a species that couldn't speak to a
species that could change the operating

2128
01:54:24,981 --> 01:54:25,700
system of the brain.

2129
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:30,700
It's referred to as the first singularity
and Terence Mckenna says that this

2130
01:54:30,921 --> 01:54:35,921
occurred when early hominids left the
jungle for the Savannah's and in the

2131
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:39,560
savannahs their diets change and they
were ruffling around for whatever they

2132
01:54:39,561 --> 01:54:42,600
could find to eat and the magic mushrooms
that were growing in the cow dung or

2133
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:46,160
yeah, those were psychedelic. And
so when they started taking them,

2134
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:49,760
they wouldn't have been able to make
sense of the synesthetic experience that

2135
01:54:49,761 --> 01:54:54,220
ensued because the magic mushrooms,
because synesthesia among their,

2136
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:56,930
their hallucinatory qualities,
which means a blurring of the census.

2137
01:54:57,350 --> 01:55:01,310
And wasn't there something
about it increasing the
size of the human brain over

2138
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:04,620
a period of like he talks about and then
food in the gut and brain size. Is that,

2139
01:55:04,621 --> 01:55:06,440
how real is that?
I believe so.

2140
01:55:06,441 --> 01:55:09,560
I mean there's an account of it and food
of the gods of how it literally changed

2141
01:55:09,561 --> 01:55:10,880
the structure of the brain.

2142
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:16,150
But I think the most compelling kind of
like visual is when he says psychedelics

2143
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:21,080
can be synesthetic and that
means seeing sounds hearing site.

2144
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:25,670
We talked about this, right? And that's
what language is. Language is psychedelic.

2145
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:26,390
Yeah,
it is.

2146
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:31,390
I send images wirelessly into
your head by making vocal sounds.

2147
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:35,870
I mean, I mean that's like, that's
like I'm, I'm already a cell phone.

2148
01:55:36,410 --> 01:55:40,460
I send thoughts to you telepathically
into your head. I mean,

2149
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:44,100
so it's like where did that arise from?
And so it's an theory. It's definitely

2150
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,480
like,
whoa dude.

2151
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:49,200
Like it's not really well accepted
in the scientific community.

2152
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:52,710
No rock.
And really it's a little too silly.

2153
01:55:52,711 --> 01:55:55,710
I mean I brought it up to people and
they've gotten that upset at me for it.

2154
01:55:55,711 --> 01:55:59,400
Preposterous. It was the idea that
it's a wonderful mythology though.

2155
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:01,740
It's beautiful. It's, if it
was true, it'd be awesome.

2156
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,230
And the thing that really
hits people about it as,

2157
01:56:04,231 --> 01:56:07,680
even though you know it's probably at
this point in time unprovable but hits

2158
01:56:07,681 --> 01:56:11,430
people about it is the profundity, is
that a word of the psychedelic experience?

2159
01:56:11,431 --> 01:56:13,710
The first time you ever have a mushroom
experience and you realize like,

2160
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:17,640
well you're dealing with is so profound
and so powerful and so impactful.

2161
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:20,640
Who's to say that if you didn't eat this
everyday wouldn't make your brain grow

2162
01:56:20,641 --> 01:56:25,020
bigger? It really seems like it might not
to mention that man has had a symbiotic

2163
01:56:25,021 --> 01:56:29,190
relationship with these plants for its
entire, for the, for our entire history.

2164
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:29,640
I mean,

2165
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:33,960
you know Francis Crick who discovered
the DML is said to have experimented with

2166
01:56:33,961 --> 01:56:34,830
LSD.
Like I said,

2167
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:38,190
well also said to have come up with the
idea of the double helix while he was on

2168
01:56:38,191 --> 01:56:38,820
Lsd.
Okay.

2169
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:42,150
But that could have be horseshit because
it was like after he was already dead

2170
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:44,160
and it was like one of
those deathbed confessions,

2171
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:46,620
it could have been that his friends
just really into acid does like,

2172
01:56:46,621 --> 01:56:49,240
I'm just going to fuck up everybody
by telling everybody to Francis Crick.

2173
01:56:49,241 --> 01:56:52,410
He told me he was on acid when he died.
Maybe it's not the drugs,

2174
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:55,650
it's what drugs could
do to their thinking,

2175
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:58,440
which could have been triggered
by other things as well.

2176
01:56:58,441 --> 01:57:02,070
It's a counterintuitive nonlinear
out of the box thinking, you know,

2177
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:05,820
seeing the world in new ways requires
tweaking how you perceive the world will

2178
01:57:05,830 --> 01:57:09,510
bomb. Big Part of what the brain
is is it's a chemical reaction.

2179
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:11,100
We know that when you were adding alcohol,

2180
01:57:11,101 --> 01:57:13,040
adding anything to that chemical reaction,
right?

2181
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:16,500
It changes the result and the data
that comes in is perceived differently.

2182
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:19,200
Absolutely, and we know that
we can tap into something.

2183
01:57:19,201 --> 01:57:20,690
When you give somebody
mushrooms or you get some,

2184
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:25,860
you tap into this incredible blissful
experience and it's akin to a religious

2185
01:57:25,861 --> 01:57:29,010
experience.
When we understand the brain perfectly,

2186
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:31,470
we will be able to insert
ourselves into superman.

2187
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:35,430
Like that movie limitless was actually
very prescient because it actually didn't

2188
01:57:35,431 --> 01:57:38,190
end with a dystopia warning,
cautionary tale. It was like, no,

2189
01:57:38,191 --> 01:57:41,880
he figured it out and he
wins. Yeah, no kidding.

2190
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:46,470
Do you, do you think that any
of this would have taken place,

2191
01:57:46,471 --> 01:57:48,300
any of this experimentation,

2192
01:57:48,301 --> 01:57:51,360
any of this would've without psychedelics
if there were no psychedelics,

2193
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:56,220
is it possible that that an ape has
become a human and the human has become

2194
01:57:56,250 --> 01:58:00,930
almost immortal as well? Listen, here's
what I think. I think that we need

2195
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:06,540
to live inside of minds that can go from
living in caves to flying through the

2196
01:58:08,681 --> 01:58:13,600
air and jetliners. We need to be able
to make leaps of thinking of that scale.

2197
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:16,270
But we have to do it in
a compressed timeframe.

2198
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:20,210
It took 150,000 years to go from
caveman to flying and jetliners.

2199
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:23,260
I'm the less it happened. So if you,
if you do, if you look at deep time,

2200
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:25,630
it's only a blink and
the evolutionary scale.

2201
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:29,440
It's less than a blink in less
than a blink of a blink of a blink.

2202
01:58:29,530 --> 01:58:34,530
We went from naked monkeys to jetliners
and 1.5 billion minds during their mind

2203
01:58:35,231 --> 01:58:37,420
work in a space that is in
space called the Internet.

2204
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:41,980
A blink of a blink of a blink.
So what's to say that the blink

2205
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:46,750
is not going to be equal parts
astonishing and equal parts sort of

2206
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:51,610
transformational dude. Fucking is.
Yeah. You just nailed it. Yeah.

2207
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:54,880
God Damn.
A blink of a blank.

2208
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:59,650
It's so hard to wrap your head on
150,000 years ago we were in caves.

2209
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,840
That's insane,
dude.

2210
01:59:01,841 --> 01:59:06,040
It's really almost impossible to wrap
your head around how recent that is.

2211
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:10,360
Blink of a blink of a blink of a blink.
So what the fuck happened?

2212
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:15,160
How did we just take off one
like that? Triumph. It's amazing.

2213
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:18,640
Something happened because nothing else
from back then is any different. Right.

2214
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:22,180
Everything else from 150,000 years ago
is the same. Right. And where is it?

2215
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:27,580
Where is this leading fucking
nuts might've such a blank
canvas for us to paint.

2216
01:59:27,581 --> 01:59:29,350
That's the hardest thing for
us to wrap our heads around.

2217
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:34,030
Everything else from 150,000 years
ago is the same. Everything is sad.

2218
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:35,910
Orangutans have the same habits.

2219
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:38,920
We just shot away from the
pack and started building shit.

2220
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:40,780
Slingshot can mown down.

2221
01:59:40,790 --> 01:59:44,470
Elephants was shot away.

2222
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,360
We slingshot clear bombs.

2223
01:59:46,361 --> 01:59:50,770
Slingshotting and bootstrapping complexity
builds upon itself and it gets faster

2224
01:59:50,771 --> 01:59:51,760
and faster and faster.

2225
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:55,780
Sexting Kim Kardashians show boom.

2226
01:59:56,650 --> 02:00:00,310
2012 it's amazing, dude. That's amazing.

2227
02:00:00,311 --> 02:00:03,870
It's so freaking fucking exciting.
Yeah,

2228
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:07,540
it is in you're allowed to curse or
you should do is do like a lot of like

2229
02:00:07,541 --> 02:00:11,550
citing dude, like it's so
like, it's so, wow. Yeah.

2230
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:16,270
Like it's so, wow. It's so happening
right now. You know, it's, it's,

2231
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:20,630
I think in the future when we look back
on this day and age, you know, with is,

2232
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:22,460
you know,
objectively as we can,

2233
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:26,470
we were caught in a technological
tornado. Oh, you know,

2234
02:00:26,471 --> 02:00:30,370
and it's tsunamis happening in a
way that we adapt to it. You know,

2235
02:00:30,371 --> 02:00:34,450
people are very adaptive. Totally,
totally. We're awesome at, at, you know,

2236
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:38,140
recognizing our environment has changed
and adjusting. We're really good at that,

2237
02:00:38,290 --> 02:00:40,780
but the fact that we're able to do it
with something as mind blowing as the

2238
02:00:40,781 --> 02:00:44,470
Internet is really incredible in the fact
that, you know, at this point in time,

2239
02:00:44,530 --> 02:00:48,850
you see societies all over
the world trying to be more
and more restrictive when

2240
02:00:48,851 --> 02:00:51,790
it comes to the answer to that because
they recognize this is their usurper but

2241
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:55,870
you surfer is not. Yeah,
totally. Rick Santorum. No,

2242
02:00:55,871 --> 02:00:59,370
it's the fucking Internet
man. The Internet is going
to take over to the stated.

2243
02:00:59,450 --> 02:01:01,480
The nature is what gay people
to get married. I mean,

2244
02:01:01,481 --> 02:01:06,070
an organism wants to maintain the
status quo if it has been a successful

2245
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:06,690
organism,

2246
02:01:06,690 --> 02:01:11,080
and that is cultural context or certain
businesses or corporations or business

2247
02:01:11,081 --> 02:01:13,780
models that have worked for certain
groups of people for a long time.

2248
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:15,670
It's in their interest to want to persist,

2249
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:18,880
but the reality is that we all need to
become cheerleaders for evolution and

2250
02:01:18,881 --> 02:01:20,980
that means embracing disruption.
Yeah.

2251
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:23,620
That means also letting
gay people get married.

2252
02:01:23,621 --> 02:01:26,500
You fuckheads owe hundred cows in percent,

2253
02:01:26,501 --> 02:01:30,220
like 100% like gay marriage should
be 100% legalized everywhere.

2254
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:33,940
Marijuana should be 100% legalized
everywhere this Rick Santorum do.

2255
02:01:33,941 --> 02:01:35,230
That's one of the things he stands for.

2256
02:01:35,231 --> 02:01:37,510
He doesn't want gay people to be
able to get married. It's like,

2257
02:01:37,511 --> 02:01:40,280
what do you fucking care? Well,
that's, that's the caveman mentality.

2258
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:44,260
No, he's scared people. What I wrote
on my Twitter was that the only reason

2259
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:46,560
why anybody would want gay
people who are not married,

2260
02:01:46,561 --> 02:01:50,220
either they're dumb or they're secretly
worried that Dick's are delicious.

2261
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,280
I think that must be what it is.
I think that's a lot.

2262
02:01:53,281 --> 02:01:55,760
They're just worried that if there's
a lot of gay guys around, I'm writing,

2263
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:58,020
you know, there'll be stuck in the
deck. They just don't trust themselves.

2264
02:01:58,250 --> 02:01:58,960
They're not that

2265
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:01,460
sure that they're not yet
hit upon and look at that.

2266
02:02:01,461 --> 02:02:03,310
Look at a bunch of the behavior.
Yes,

2267
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:05,840
his bone structure of the
way he carries himself.

2268
02:02:05,841 --> 02:02:10,120
He can be tricked you get that guy's not
an alpha running around telling people

2269
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:10,720
up.

2270
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,870
Okay. I think the biggest,
the biggest rule should be,

2271
02:02:12,871 --> 02:02:16,130
you should not be able to impose
your own moral rules on other people.

2272
02:02:16,131 --> 02:02:19,310
It's like censoring books or
censoring thought to each his own.

2273
02:02:19,311 --> 02:02:22,220
As long as you're not physically
hurting anybody else. If it offends you,

2274
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:24,680
I don't care.
You're free to say whatever you want.

2275
02:02:24,681 --> 02:02:28,000
I'm free to say whatever I
want. We respect and tolerate
each other. But you know,

2276
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:32,460
actually Bill Maher said to be tolerant
of intolerance. That's the problem.

2277
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:36,080
That's why moral relativism doesn't
work. That's why you can't just say, oh,

2278
02:02:36,081 --> 02:02:38,540
and cultures in the Middle East where
they're stoning women to death. Oh,

2279
02:02:38,541 --> 02:02:40,540
that's just a different culture.
We've got to respect it. No,

2280
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:43,820
you don't respect that cause that's
being tolerant of intolerance,

2281
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:48,940
right? Yeah. He's, it has a brilliant, Tim
Harris has a brilliant talk about that.

2282
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:52,180
Yeah, it's, it's, it's,
it's a strange thing, man.

2283
02:02:52,181 --> 02:02:57,120
It's a strange thing where people will
embrace this, this notion of fear and of,

2284
02:02:57,121 --> 02:02:59,480
of, of someone different
than them enough, you know,

2285
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:03,190
that somehow or another this is going to
erode moral fiber and that your way of

2286
02:03:03,191 --> 02:03:05,650
thinking is correct and what these
people want to do that hurts you,

2287
02:03:05,651 --> 02:03:07,230
not one iota.
Right.

2288
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:10,810
You're going to somehow another prevent
and do it righteously under the guise of

2289
02:03:10,811 --> 02:03:12,790
some fucking book. Right. Like, you know,

2290
02:03:12,791 --> 02:03:14,720
I wrote that in like a bunch of
people were saying, you know,

2291
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:18,880
tweeted me back and like, you know, I'm
a Christian and that's, come on man.

2292
02:03:18,881 --> 02:03:21,980
Really stop. What do you give a
fuck of some gay dude you, oh,

2293
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:23,680
because I'm a Christian,
because you're Christian,

2294
02:03:23,681 --> 02:03:25,090
you care about gay people getting married,

2295
02:03:25,091 --> 02:03:27,760
let him do whatever the fuck they want.
It doesn't make your thing any different.

2296
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:31,120
You know, what does this divorce, not
they should, you know, just divorce.

2297
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:34,510
I'll make your shit any weaker. It was
when 60% of the people get divorced,

2298
02:03:34,511 --> 02:03:37,030
doesn't it make marriage weaker?
Does it make it look more ridiculous?

2299
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,760
You should be upset about that.
It would be,

2300
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:41,620
should be upset about people who get
married that don't really want to get

2301
02:03:41,621 --> 02:03:45,070
married and fuck it up for the statistics
of the people that are happily married.

2302
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:46,960
Because when you're happily married,
people always tell you,

2303
02:03:46,961 --> 02:03:50,980
you fucking search and then
divorced book loop, Dude.

2304
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:54,940
You know what we should do is
prevent people from getting married,

2305
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:57,280
not stop them from getting married.
Okay,

2306
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:03,280
stop everybody from getting married.
Gay people, straight people, everybody.

2307
02:04:03,281 --> 02:04:08,160
Marriage should be illegal, period.
It's not the gay folks. You know?

2308
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:10,750
If we're getting fucked,
they should be able to get fucked too.

2309
02:04:10,810 --> 02:04:13,930
That's my attitude.
If we're caught in this ridiculous Mays,

2310
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:16,840
the gay folks should just jump right in
as well and if you want to keep them out

2311
02:04:16,841 --> 02:04:19,150
of the gate, it's just cause you're
worried about they're marrying you.

2312
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:20,013
That's what it is.

2313
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:23,500
Specially because at the roots,
like, you know, even Christianity,

2314
02:04:23,501 --> 02:04:26,880
it was all about like loving thy
neighbor as you love thyself.

2315
02:04:26,910 --> 02:04:30,000
I mean that should be like the only rule.

2316
02:04:30,150 --> 02:04:33,210
And you know what that means
is whatever your winks,

2317
02:04:33,211 --> 02:04:38,160
your neighbor happy should make you happy.
As long as he's not hurting anyone

2318
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:41,790
else. Right? So, or I fucking
you when you go to get your mail,

2319
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:43,950
that aint cool either.
You know,

2320
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:47,240
it's like you're next to him
in the mailbox and you're
trying to get your mails

2321
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:51,660
and yes, God damn boy,

2322
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:55,020
you know that's not cool. Right?
That's a little uncomfortable.

2323
02:04:55,310 --> 02:04:57,960
And he's not really hurting anybody,
but he is making you feel weird. Right?

2324
02:04:58,190 --> 02:05:00,930
It shouldn't make you feel weird. But
other than that, what do you give a fuck?

2325
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,080
It's just weird. And when I see that and
break that breaks aren't tentorium guy.

2326
02:05:04,081 --> 02:05:08,370
One state caucuses in three states, man,
three of them. Colorado was one of them.

2327
02:05:08,371 --> 02:05:12,240
Colorado, Missouri, I think Minnesota.
Well, I think that, you know, a friend,

2328
02:05:12,241 --> 02:05:16,410
my friend of mine says that evolution
also thrives when there's resistance,

2329
02:05:16,450 --> 02:05:19,800
because resistance forces evolution
to figure out a way to transcend that

2330
02:05:19,801 --> 02:05:24,210
limitation. So in a way that resistance,
the people wanting to teach creationism,

2331
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:27,350
for example, now resistance, maybe it's
just part of the system because it makes,

2332
02:05:27,351 --> 02:05:29,010
it maintains the system to be more robust,

2333
02:05:29,011 --> 02:05:32,580
to find ways to transcend that problem so
that we don't get too comfortable ever.

2334
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:36,150
Because there's always those sort of
backwards way of thinking that could very

2335
02:05:36,151 --> 02:05:38,940
quickly become cancers and stop the
innovation that we can't let that happen.

2336
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:42,960
Yeah, it's, it's, it's very, it's a
very tricky situation when, you know,

2337
02:05:42,961 --> 02:05:43,900
and when you,
I,

2338
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:47,640
the idea of being a Christian
is a beautiful idea if
you look at it in terms of

2339
02:05:47,641 --> 02:05:51,870
what the, the, the real teachings of Jesus
where, you know, he was a hippie. Yeah,

2340
02:05:51,871 --> 02:05:53,400
absolutely.
It was a kind,

2341
02:05:53,401 --> 02:05:56,430
loving hippie who hung out with all
types of awesome people. I mean,

2342
02:05:56,431 --> 02:05:58,050
what a great moral example.
Yeah.

2343
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:01,950
But we have to recognize when in 2012 we,

2344
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:05,700
we don't go on what people wrote
down thousands of years ago.

2345
02:06:05,790 --> 02:06:10,170
We'd go on what we know today and what
we know today is that there are people

2346
02:06:10,171 --> 02:06:13,500
that are just born gay. They just
are. I've met him. You've met him.

2347
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,480
There's no fucking denying.
When I,

2348
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:18,050
there was a kid that lived
up the street from me, um,

2349
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:22,080
about 10 years ago and he was
five years old, five years old.

2350
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:24,510
I know this fucking kid was gay.
He was five.

2351
02:06:24,660 --> 02:06:28,020
He'd be playing in my yard and he was
like super sweet to me and who would like

2352
02:06:28,021 --> 02:06:31,530
to give me hugs and he would like
to talk about like little dogs.

2353
02:06:31,531 --> 02:06:34,320
And his mother wanted him
to play football, but he
didn't want to play football,

2354
02:06:34,530 --> 02:06:37,440
you know, isn't in it. And His dad would
come over, you know, real, real nice guy.

2355
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:38,940
He's gay now.
Of course he's gay.

2356
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:42,360
He was gay then nobody tricked him into
being gay. He didn't get recruited.

2357
02:06:42,361 --> 02:06:45,870
He was born gay. Some people are born
with red hair, some people are born with,

2358
02:06:45,871 --> 02:06:47,160
you know,
awesome eyelashes,

2359
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:51,930
[inaudible] human beings.
We should all,

2360
02:06:51,931 --> 02:06:53,820
like in Bryce who and what we are.

2361
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:58,140
I mean our differences are what make us
interesting. They should is wonderful.

2362
02:06:58,141 --> 02:07:01,080
Like the real issue is some
people are not gay and so they go,

2363
02:07:01,081 --> 02:07:03,510
nobody could possibly
like what I don't like,

2364
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:06,600
nobody could possibly really like that.
That's DV and that's disgusting.

2365
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:09,420
And that's not freedom.
That's like authoritarianism.

2366
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:13,470
Well it's a lack of education.
It's a, it's a lack of evolution.

2367
02:07:13,471 --> 02:07:15,200
It's a lack of information.
It's,

2368
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:18,500
there's a lot of places in
this world and you know, and,

2369
02:07:18,501 --> 02:07:21,980
and thought pockets that are still
backwards. There's still, there's still,

2370
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:25,950
but you think that's sort of a,
an enlightened human values,

2371
02:07:25,951 --> 02:07:30,180
like eventually Trump kind of
this negative way of thinking.

2372
02:07:30,181 --> 02:07:33,480
I mean if you think about like the,
the, the modern kind of pop culture,

2373
02:07:33,481 --> 02:07:38,260
like the mainstream films, the mainstream
media would never, for example,

2374
02:07:38,261 --> 02:07:40,540
like embrace creationism. I
mean, you know what I'm saying?

2375
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:42,130
Like I feel like for the most part,

2376
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:46,480
well like I'm saying like you
don't see like movies for example,

2377
02:07:46,481 --> 02:07:48,790
coming out like defending creationism.

2378
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,800
Well I think someone
could do it really well.

2379
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:53,290
I think if you had some master director,

2380
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:56,500
like some Kubrick type dude
and a a great storyteller,

2381
02:07:56,501 --> 02:07:59,890
they could figure out a way to craft
something that would make you think that

2382
02:07:59,891 --> 02:08:03,150
intelligent design might be very well
the how the universe ones well it,

2383
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:05,290
but if you do it in as minutes do it.

2384
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:08,570
But if you do it as a poem like
turns Malik's tree of life than,

2385
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:09,910
I mean that's a beautiful poem.

2386
02:08:09,911 --> 02:08:12,880
But they're not like making a documentary
looking at the evidence that creation.

2387
02:08:13,170 --> 02:08:16,110
No, I meant like a 2001
type movie. Like a movie,

2388
02:08:16,111 --> 02:08:19,210
like a piece of fiction thing is we're
all craving transcendence in rapture.

2389
02:08:19,211 --> 02:08:19,721
And the thing,

2390
02:08:19,721 --> 02:08:24,280
what's most beautiful about this fleeting
ephemeral sensation is that it's a

2391
02:08:24,281 --> 02:08:25,010
mystery,
right?

2392
02:08:25,010 --> 02:08:29,950
So it's better expressed as a mystery
then to sort of anthropomorphize it and

2393
02:08:29,951 --> 02:08:34,450
put in a man's face on it.
And a beard, like fall in
love with the mystery. That's,

2394
02:08:34,451 --> 02:08:35,500
you know,
a Carl Sagan.

2395
02:08:35,501 --> 02:08:39,550
Why do you have this weird long though
to believe that there's some secrets

2396
02:08:39,551 --> 02:08:43,020
written somewhere and this is what the
ancient, I think our yearning for the,

2397
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:46,060
our yearning for the sublime,
we can't avoid it the same way.

2398
02:08:46,061 --> 02:08:50,170
The Yearning of Arrows, right? Like it's
just as embedded in us as the sex drive.

2399
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:53,560
Is it, or is it because we know
like in our genes somewhere,

2400
02:08:53,561 --> 02:08:58,420
another that we have gone through peaks
and valleys of human behavior and human

2401
02:08:58,421 --> 02:09:03,421
culture and that we have had periods of
times where we lost information and did,

2402
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:06,790
you know, lose touch with
our, our, the, the real, uh,

2403
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:11,080
tenants of society and of
loving thy neighbor and all
that stuff. You know, this,

2404
02:09:11,230 --> 02:09:14,310
this idea of these secret stories
that we've forgotten. They,

2405
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:15,820
what they represent is,
you know,

2406
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:19,690
cultures that had crashed in universal
archetypes that Joseph Campbell talks

2407
02:09:19,691 --> 02:09:20,021
about.

2408
02:09:20,021 --> 02:09:24,190
And it's interesting because religion has
become corrupted and institutionalized

2409
02:09:24,191 --> 02:09:25,480
in many insects politics.

2410
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:29,620
But there's also a great theory that says
that the origins of religion actually

2411
02:09:29,621 --> 02:09:32,150
lie in the use of psychedelics.
Sure.

2412
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:36,430
Even the concept of God seems like a
vision straight out of the psychedelic

2413
02:09:36,431 --> 02:09:38,980
experience. If you embrace it
as the metaphor that it is,

2414
02:09:38,981 --> 02:09:41,950
which is to say that
something that transcends me,

2415
02:09:41,951 --> 02:09:45,640
something is that something that feels
that I'm part of something bigger than I

2416
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:50,641
am and what I would becomes indefinable
you put a symbol on it and okay.

2417
02:09:50,861 --> 02:09:54,580
You can call that God.
Like that purple was probably born.

2418
02:09:54,581 --> 02:09:56,290
The religious rituals were always,
they,

2419
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:59,570
you know those in native American
Cultures and native cultures that what use

2420
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:03,130
psychedelics and their
religious ceremonies. I mean,
that was a part of it. Yeah.

2421
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:04,840
People would like to dismiss it,

2422
02:10:04,841 --> 02:10:09,360
but I don't know anything more powerful
than I've ever experienced in life other

2423
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:11,440
than like tornadoes and shit.
You can't dismiss it.

2424
02:10:11,441 --> 02:10:14,290
It's a fact that those things were used
in religious ceremonies is the beginning

2425
02:10:14,291 --> 02:10:17,320
of time. I would say an
unbelievable powerful force,

2426
02:10:17,321 --> 02:10:21,280
and just because it doesn't rip trees out
of the roots and make fucking cows fly

2427
02:10:21,281 --> 02:10:25,570
through the air [inaudible]
yeah, that's my point. You know,

2428
02:10:25,571 --> 02:10:29,290
I remember that movie altered states
with William hurt member it. Yeah. Yeah.

2429
02:10:29,310 --> 02:10:32,470
That was terrible. We'll try watching
it now. That's unfortunately terrible.

2430
02:10:32,620 --> 02:10:33,980
You think it's when you watch it and not,

2431
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,650
it doesn't hold up at all.
It was awful. I was shut him.

2432
02:10:36,730 --> 02:10:40,340
I like the dialogue a lot though. Really?
Yeah. Well he talks about the self,

2433
02:10:40,341 --> 02:10:42,280
the individual mind that contained
some mortality and I'll tell you,

2434
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:45,950
that was cool, but it was just
so, it was, it was just so dated.

2435
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:48,480
It was really weird. It just
didn't seem that good. Huh?

2436
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:52,070
I remember it being a monkey.
It's not that good. Yeah,
that's what I mean. I mean,

2437
02:10:52,071 --> 02:10:54,500
this is like, who the fuck
let you do this? Stop. Right.

2438
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:56,870
Why is he running around
everything before that is awesome.

2439
02:10:57,050 --> 02:10:58,820
His whole search for the
transcendent than how he,

2440
02:10:58,970 --> 02:11:00,420
he has a relationship with
the girl and she says,

2441
02:11:00,421 --> 02:11:02,490
even sex as a mystical experience for you.
Yeah.

2442
02:11:02,570 --> 02:11:05,510
She says that she feels like she's being
harpooned by some raging monk and the

2443
02:11:05,511 --> 02:11:07,120
act of receiving God's so death,

2444
02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:11,030
sex and death as the connection to
the divine in me. It's all connected.

2445
02:11:11,031 --> 02:11:14,250
The drugs, the sex, the transcendence. Me.
I loved it when it first came out. Yeah,

2446
02:11:14,260 --> 02:11:17,480
yeah. Watch it now. It's just,
Whoa, this is fucking terrible.

2447
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:21,200
There's just something
about, they've gotten so much
better at making movies now.

2448
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:23,100
It's really amazing when you
stop and think I'm up to,

2449
02:11:23,101 --> 02:11:25,190
there's a piece of evolutionary
evidence right there.

2450
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:28,810
We'll get culture culture from
1950 and culture from today. Watch.

2451
02:11:28,830 --> 02:11:31,520
No father knows best or
watching, no. You know,

2452
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:35,060
calling car seven or what was that
fucking show they had? What was that show?

2453
02:11:35,061 --> 02:11:38,150
Do you remember? It was like a car 69
where are you? Or something like that.

2454
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:42,440
Car 54 where,
I mean that's,

2455
02:11:42,441 --> 02:11:46,940
they had a show about a
fucking guy driving around in
a car who was a cop. Right?

2456
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:50,690
Yeah. It's ridiculous. You know? I
remember they had Bj and the bear.

2457
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:54,980
They had a show about a truck driver with
a chimp, right? Yeah. They had to show,

2458
02:11:54,981 --> 02:11:57,230
we've talked about before, if there
with a president that was a champion,

2459
02:11:57,231 --> 02:12:01,310
Ecog Mr. Smith or some where it was, yeah,
we've talked about this before. He was,

2460
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:03,610
I must've been so great
at the time traveling.

2461
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:06,140
It's crazy cause no one
remembers this show at all.

2462
02:12:06,141 --> 02:12:08,510
And I've tried to find out
youtube and I can't find it.

2463
02:12:08,511 --> 02:12:11,750
It's called mistress Samantha and
he just chimpanzee as a president.

2464
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:14,290
He talked and he talked
like Humphrey Bogart thing,

2465
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:17,570
hate bogey and everybody else was a
person. The chimp was just running.

2466
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:20,600
Everyone just acted like that was normal.
Well okay.

2467
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,590
Yeah. What is that about? I don't know.

2468
02:12:24,830 --> 02:12:27,470
What do you think about people that
say that the human being was actually

2469
02:12:27,471 --> 02:12:31,490
created by a genetic intervention from
extra terrestrials we'll at least.

2470
02:12:31,490 --> 02:12:32,910
That's interesting.
Yeah.

2471
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:38,120
So 17 sexiest idea of all you can
imagine the planet being seated with the

2472
02:12:38,481 --> 02:12:41,300
primordial elements that would
then like immersed, you know,

2473
02:12:41,301 --> 02:12:44,810
you just set the emerging conditions
for complex life to emerge for that is

2474
02:12:44,930 --> 02:12:48,710
compelling because we are now doing that
with artificial life and with synthetic

2475
02:12:48,711 --> 02:12:52,400
life. I mean Craig Venter, when he
created the first synthetic life form,

2476
02:12:52,401 --> 02:12:57,380
you know the signature was written in
the DNA like right of his name. So okay,

2477
02:12:57,381 --> 02:13:01,250
so now you're creating life.
You know it.

2478
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:03,320
We are doing intelligent design.

2479
02:13:03,770 --> 02:13:07,760
Intelligent design is actually
occurring now with synthetic biology.

2480
02:13:07,761 --> 02:13:12,761
And so to think that some far
more powerful civilization
might have created the

2481
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:16,700
and seated and terraform the planet is,
I mean,

2482
02:13:16,701 --> 02:13:20,090
it's not outside of the
realm of impossibilities.
Certainly a compelling idea.

2483
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:24,500
It's certainly like what we're about to
do. It's more interesting than, you know,

2484
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:27,200
God created the heavens
and seven days it seems.

2485
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:31,140
So unfortunately there's fucking asteroids
and comets out there because if it

2486
02:13:31,141 --> 02:13:33,570
wasn't for them, I'd like, we're
definitely going to win this race.

2487
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:35,430
We're going to run this
race with technology.

2488
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:37,440
We're going to pull through eventually
we'll get our shit together.

2489
02:13:37,710 --> 02:13:39,030
But that might not be the case.

2490
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:43,380
We might be like on the verge of getting
it all together. No, no. But you know,

2491
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:46,440
Freeman Dyson doesn't have to quote
him again, but he said that, uh,

2492
02:13:46,530 --> 02:13:48,840
with synthetic biology
and artificial life,

2493
02:13:48,870 --> 02:13:52,560
we're eventually going to
decode the genome of every
living thing on the planet.

2494
02:13:52,561 --> 02:13:54,980
And then we'll be able to
actually have with nanotechnology,

2495
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:58,590
the entire biosphere and something
that's, Eh, a few micro grams in weight.

2496
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:00,360
So the whole biosphere
in the palm of our hands,

2497
02:14:00,510 --> 02:14:03,930
and then we'll send those biospheres
in the palm of our hands into space.

2498
02:14:03,931 --> 02:14:07,320
As you talking about Adam and eve type
shit, sending it into space. The seat.

2499
02:14:07,321 --> 02:14:12,000
Well this is what it is. It's an
amazing, amazing, it all comes back.

2500
02:14:12,001 --> 02:14:15,750
And then the metaphor sentence, if that's
really what Adam and eve was all about,

2501
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:19,470
that's really what of that's the,
that's the real creation. Holy Shit.

2502
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:22,200
That eventually the intelligent
animal once you know,

2503
02:14:22,201 --> 02:14:25,980
becoming sentient and aware of itself
started on a fucking rape and killing

2504
02:14:25,981 --> 02:14:30,981
rampage until for the created bombs and
rap music than death metal and then,

2505
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:36,810
and then what? Yeah, and then what, how
do we, how do we get out of this alive?

2506
02:14:37,290 --> 02:14:39,210
What's your suggestion?
Well,

2507
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:44,280
I think that that's where the cultural
conversation that is happening, you know,

2508
02:14:44,281 --> 02:14:48,480
I think what's really exciting is
that the Internet allows minds to come

2509
02:14:48,481 --> 02:14:52,800
together based on shared interests.
And this will mean lol cats fans.

2510
02:14:52,860 --> 02:14:57,540
And it will also mean, you know, the
smartest signed, laughed many times.

2511
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:01,670
Me Too. Lol Cat. That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying, I have you, Evan, and hi.

2512
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:04,850
I love a good,
and I know cat and I'm not criticizing it,

2513
02:15:04,851 --> 02:15:07,170
but I'm saying the same thing that allows
millions of people to come together

2514
02:15:07,171 --> 02:15:12,171
over a shared delight allows also the
smartest scientists and astronomers and

2515
02:15:12,571 --> 02:15:15,550
physicists and philosophers and
thinkers around the world collaborate,

2516
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:19,980
cross pollinate, you know all these
minds working together. You know,

2517
02:15:19,981 --> 02:15:23,010
it creates something that's greater than
the sum of its individual parts, right?

2518
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:25,770
That's when something transcendent
emerge as you put things together in a

2519
02:15:25,771 --> 02:15:27,840
certain way and it leads to
something that's greater,

2520
02:15:27,841 --> 02:15:32,400
two plus two equaling five somehow.
Until I'm confident that because of that,

2521
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:36,600
we will find innovative solutions that
help us address all of humanity's grand

2522
02:15:36,601 --> 02:15:37,710
challenges and that's,

2523
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:41,250
that's happening secularity you have to
recognize each other as a super organism

2524
02:15:41,251 --> 02:15:41,760
first,
right?

2525
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:45,780
We have to recognize each other as we're
all one organ systems thinking. Yeah,

2526
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:46,650
that's the only way to do it.

2527
02:15:46,651 --> 02:15:48,790
Separate yourself from the
environment in which your body didn't.

2528
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:49,681
At some point in time,

2529
02:15:49,681 --> 02:15:52,720
we're going to have to fix Somalia and
we're going to have to fix, you know,

2530
02:15:52,721 --> 02:15:54,720
100% fewer copia.
You look at the percent,

2531
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:57,930
he's fucked up places where people are
starving to death and they're uneducated.

2532
02:15:57,950 --> 02:16:02,250
They're totally unacceptable as a human
entity, right? As a single organism.

2533
02:16:02,251 --> 02:16:03,960
We have to accept that this is,

2534
02:16:03,961 --> 02:16:06,360
we have to reengineer the
situation somehow or another.

2535
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:08,790
And it sounds like eugenics. It sounds
terrible, but that's not what I mean.

2536
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:11,700
I mean with education, love
and food and you know, I mean,

2537
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:14,490
if we can put as much
money into going to war,

2538
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:17,760
why can't these fucking piece companies
come up with some lobbying money?

2539
02:16:18,030 --> 02:16:21,330
But imagine if it was because think
about a better is profitable for peace.

2540
02:16:21,331 --> 02:16:25,200
If PR piece was more profitable than war.
Good ideas. I've never had it better.

2541
02:16:25,290 --> 02:16:29,560
Good ideas have never had it better than
they do to. Absolutely agree on note.

2542
02:16:29,561 --> 02:16:30,340
You know,

2543
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:33,850
an idea for an airplane that was a good
idea and an idea on how to build it was

2544
02:16:33,851 --> 02:16:35,590
a good idea now. And so
I think that, you know,

2545
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:38,440
maybe we can't articulate
what those ideas are yet,

2546
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:41,890
but we certainly are creating the spaces
in which those ideas are more likely to

2547
02:16:41,891 --> 02:16:45,460
emerge than any other time
in human history. And that
is kind of a fact, I think.

2548
02:16:45,490 --> 02:16:48,880
Yeah, I don't think anybody's as well
as far as we know about human history,

2549
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:52,150
the only thing that fucks me up when I,
I'm not willing to commit to that is the,

2550
02:16:52,151 --> 02:16:53,350
the Egyptian period.

2551
02:16:53,650 --> 02:16:56,910
There are some crazy shit going on
in each of those motherfuckers wrong.

2552
02:16:56,930 --> 02:17:01,090
They might, they might have been
on this level, on a parallel level,

2553
02:17:01,091 --> 02:17:03,910
there was completely different interesting
construction of the hieroglyphs,

2554
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:07,990
the architects and architecture and
engineering of fuck. Well, you know,

2555
02:17:07,991 --> 02:17:11,560
eventually they died. You know, the
people that realize the highest heights,

2556
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:16,330
it's very difficult to maintain that
tone for very long. I think there's a,

2557
02:17:16,360 --> 02:17:16,900
you know,

2558
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:19,960
there's a certain revolutions per
minute that you have to be hitting as a

2559
02:17:19,961 --> 02:17:23,680
society. You have to be really completely
in tuned to hit such high heights.

2560
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:26,560
And you know, you have to be
in tune ethically, morally,

2561
02:17:26,561 --> 02:17:28,320
but you're still a human being.
So in,

2562
02:17:28,321 --> 02:17:32,320
if that philosophy is not somehow or
another genetically imprinted into the

2563
02:17:32,321 --> 02:17:36,700
monkey in time with lack of discipline
and people that aren't going to raising

2564
02:17:36,701 --> 02:17:39,360
children, the ideas will be
lost. Well, but now all the,

2565
02:17:39,361 --> 02:17:42,460
all the world's ideas and all the
world's information is now digital.

2566
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:46,450
The library of Alexandria. Yeah,
we'll ever lose that library again.

2567
02:17:46,451 --> 02:17:50,320
And the Internet is also distributed,
right? It's not a centralized network.

2568
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:53,740
I don't think you can knock down the
ideas ever again that way unless an

2569
02:17:53,741 --> 02:17:56,500
asteroid hits theory. Yeah, that's
what I was just about to say. Yeah,

2570
02:17:56,501 --> 02:17:57,970
I think we can,
we can lose it all.

2571
02:17:57,971 --> 02:18:00,670
We could totally start from
scratch and we may have, you know,

2572
02:18:00,690 --> 02:18:03,000
that's the big crush there.
And you look at Egypt, they,

2573
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:06,550
how did they get that far
ahead of everybody else?
That's how nutty thing, man.

2574
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:09,580
I mean, it's almost like a joke, you
know, it's almost like, you know,

2575
02:18:09,581 --> 02:18:12,790
you think you understand
history, Tut, ah, look at that.

2576
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:16,690
2,300,000 stones cut
into a perfect pyramid.

2577
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:21,370
Used to be smooth limestone with a golden
cap all made back when there was no

2578
02:18:21,371 --> 02:18:25,580
fucking wheel. Good luck. Good luck.
Figured out. Well you know what the,

2579
02:18:25,581 --> 02:18:28,270
I guess back then they weren't global.

2580
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:32,710
And so if that limited area was knocked
out, then it affected the whole,

2581
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:33,670
now we're global.

2582
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:37,060
So the only way that the whole thing
could be knocked out is with an asteroid,

2583
02:18:37,061 --> 02:18:38,770
not if you kill one pocket or another.

2584
02:18:38,910 --> 02:18:42,280
But I think eventually using the someone
real, we've got to go into space.

2585
02:18:42,310 --> 02:18:44,680
That's why we gotta go into
space. Yes, for sure. For sure.

2586
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:47,890
Isn't it amazing that someone at one
point in time, what does it ever, it was,

2587
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:52,380
it was Egypt and culture.
2,500 BC. Someone got that
far. Yeah. Isn't it amazing?

2588
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:54,760
It's totally amazing.
Those struck people that don't,

2589
02:18:54,761 --> 02:18:57,700
I mean I've never been to Egypt.
I've watched a lot of documentaries.

2590
02:18:57,910 --> 02:19:00,370
I did go to the, um, uh,
to Cheech and Eatsa once,

2591
02:19:00,371 --> 02:19:04,360
which was maybe not as impressive as
Egypt because of the sheer size of some of

2592
02:19:04,361 --> 02:19:07,320
the things. But still pretty
fascinating that this was a,

2593
02:19:07,570 --> 02:19:10,780
an ancient culture that existed over a
thousand years ago and they made these

2594
02:19:10,781 --> 02:19:14,140
amazing buildings and you're
walking on the ground where they're,

2595
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:17,560
their civilization took place and you
realize that these were like thinking

2596
02:19:17,561 --> 02:19:21,760
philosophically, people that thought
about deep things thousands of years ago,

2597
02:19:21,761 --> 02:19:23,530
profound thoughts about space.

2598
02:19:23,530 --> 02:19:28,310
And I am a nurse and that completely
fascinated by the completely fascinated by

2599
02:19:28,311 --> 02:19:32,300
the Mayan culture and the idea that
there's over a thousand Mayan temples just

2600
02:19:32,330 --> 02:19:35,600
out there in the jungle that they haven't
even discovered yet. You know, they,

2601
02:19:35,601 --> 02:19:38,670
they find these fucking things and they
just start digging into them and they're

2602
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:40,790
like, Holy Shit. But
there'll be in Mexico City,

2603
02:19:40,791 --> 02:19:43,820
there'll be like build an apartment,
buildings and someone would go, stop.

2604
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:47,060
We just found the biggest temple in the
history of the Mayan culture, you know,

2605
02:19:47,061 --> 02:19:51,620
and they'll find some gigantic fucking
things that are just underground or no,

2606
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:54,260
it's like you've got to wonder
what the hell happened there?

2607
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:59,270
They had achieved this incredible height
as far as their ability to construct

2608
02:19:59,271 --> 02:20:02,120
these things at a stone.
And then even before them,

2609
02:20:02,121 --> 02:20:05,630
there's somebody called the old Mex. They
don't even know who the fuck they were.

2610
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:08,450
They don't even know what the
language was. They have no idea.

2611
02:20:08,451 --> 02:20:11,080
But they have these giant
fat African heads of your,

2612
02:20:11,081 --> 02:20:12,080
you know what it shows though,

2613
02:20:12,081 --> 02:20:15,680
it shows the tendency towards complexity
and the tendency towards development

2614
02:20:15,681 --> 02:20:20,681
and progress that might have been thwarted
by an existential threat or a war or

2615
02:20:20,751 --> 02:20:22,940
whatever it is that happened.
But the tendency is there.

2616
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:26,240
So it's this idea that like
life moves towards complexity.

2617
02:20:26,241 --> 02:20:30,680
Life is actually anti and tropic and
wants to get more complex, more sublime,

2618
02:20:30,681 --> 02:20:32,670
you know, knowledge,
information wants to spread.

2619
02:20:32,671 --> 02:20:37,010
Sentients wants to perpetuate itself.
And so I think we're on the best.

2620
02:20:37,370 --> 02:20:40,850
We're in the best ride of our, of,
of, of history. I think we're, I mean,

2621
02:20:40,851 --> 02:20:43,190
I think they, they got pretty
far, but then they were thwarted.

2622
02:20:43,191 --> 02:20:46,070
You're totally right. I
just, I'm a retard. I have to
figure out how it happened.

2623
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:48,630
You know, I'm like, this is what it was.
What, what happened was, you know, I,

2624
02:20:48,631 --> 02:20:51,530
I can't even live in the moment
when it comes to this. Yeah, I know.

2625
02:20:51,550 --> 02:20:54,830
I'm still trying to pick apart the
formula. How are we, we got to this point,

2626
02:20:54,890 --> 02:20:58,760
but this point is the most fascinating
point. If this point existed in the past,

2627
02:20:58,970 --> 02:21:02,940
if we were running around like, you
know, I don't think we got arms were, no,

2628
02:21:02,941 --> 02:21:03,890
I definitely don't think so.

2629
02:21:03,891 --> 02:21:06,350
But if we somehow or another we're
running around like the Romans,

2630
02:21:06,351 --> 02:21:09,410
I'm fucking horses and shit and yet nobody
ever figured out how to make a phone

2631
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:14,620
and somebody found some projection thing
and threw up a movie of how we live

2632
02:21:15,861 --> 02:21:18,860
right now with cars and shit.
Oh my God.

2633
02:21:18,861 --> 02:21:23,060
People are standing in front of a fire
going and do, what the fuck is this way,

2634
02:21:23,061 --> 02:21:26,340
way crazier than anything
they could ever imagine.

2635
02:21:26,350 --> 02:21:30,380
A time lapse videos of cities at
night. Oh yeah. Because what you see,

2636
02:21:30,381 --> 02:21:34,460
it's like one of your videos, there's
that scene in the movie Tron, right?

2637
02:21:34,461 --> 02:21:37,940
It says they tried to picture clusters
of information as they flowed through the

2638
02:21:37,941 --> 02:21:42,020
computer. What did they look like,
or the circuits like freeways, chips,

2639
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:44,810
motorcycles. And when you look at
a time lapse of a city at night,

2640
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:49,640
you do see it's just particles of light.
It's just information being exchanged,

2641
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:51,350
you know,
especially when it's time lapse.

2642
02:21:51,351 --> 02:21:53,510
Then you're going to see the individual
cars, but you just see the light,

2643
02:21:53,780 --> 02:21:56,360
the buildings and the light.
It's just information. You know?

2644
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:59,360
It was Dawkins who says,
if you want to understand life,

2645
02:21:59,510 --> 02:22:02,540
don't think of oozing gels and
throbbing and throbbing liquids.

2646
02:22:02,570 --> 02:22:04,100
Think about information technology.

2647
02:22:04,101 --> 02:22:07,280
It's just information being exchanged
all the time. That's all it is.

2648
02:22:07,370 --> 02:22:11,090
If you're nursing information,
if you're someone who's flying into La,

2649
02:22:11,390 --> 02:22:15,630
I urge you to fly into La at
night, right? Lions, a motherboard,

2650
02:22:15,650 --> 02:22:19,940
dude's a motherboard. He can't
believe how right. Wild it looks.

2651
02:22:19,941 --> 02:22:24,590
How organized, how planned, how he
never laid a runner, blade runner,

2652
02:22:24,591 --> 02:22:26,010
right? You don't, we don't realize

2653
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,750
how advanced we are as a society.

2654
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:31,200
I really don't feel you give the full
perspective because of you flying to Los

2655
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:33,000
Angeles and he died and adaptation.
Man,

2656
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:36,220
my friend Larry had a house
up at the top of um, uh,

2657
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:39,660
the Hollywood hills and you would go
into his backyard and it was like the

2658
02:22:39,661 --> 02:22:41,370
craziest science fiction movie ever.

2659
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:46,440
Totally believe it was a real view ban
all like Christmas lights all throughout

2660
02:22:46,441 --> 02:22:49,140
the, you know, like the whole city
in front of him. And it was amazing.

2661
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:51,840
It was a view that if I would
wonder if I lived there,

2662
02:22:51,841 --> 02:22:53,040
if I ever got anything done,

2663
02:22:53,330 --> 02:22:56,160
cause I might just get out there every
night and just stare like a fucking month.

2664
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:59,160
You would hope so. But probably after
two weeks he wouldn't even notice it.

2665
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:03,250
I just don't way I would notice it if I
smoke weed there. Well that's out there,

2666
02:23:03,290 --> 02:23:06,480
the joint. I'm going to look at
that and go, God damn. There you go.

2667
02:23:06,481 --> 02:23:08,220
You just hit the nail on the head.
Yeah.

2668
02:23:09,490 --> 02:23:12,600
That would be your way of getting rid
of the hedonic adaptation and returning

2669
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:14,940
luster and wonder through your experience.
Do people always say,

2670
02:23:14,941 --> 02:23:17,390
why don't you talk about weeds so much?
Man. It's kind of annoying, you know,

2671
02:23:17,570 --> 02:23:22,170
got annoyed when you harp on weeds so
much cause cause it's worth talking about

2672
02:23:22,171 --> 02:23:24,780
now when people talk about yoga or people
talk about how much they love their

2673
02:23:24,781 --> 02:23:28,930
wine. Oh I love this. 1975
delicious red wine. People wait,

2674
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:33,520
let's move porridge. He can't in
the wrong shit kid. I'll do it.

2675
02:23:33,521 --> 02:23:38,430
You can use food to nourish your body.
You can use food to become morbidly obese.

2676
02:23:38,431 --> 02:23:41,130
So it's really,
it's not the food's fault how you use it.

2677
02:23:42,350 --> 02:23:46,830
Tired of this bullshit society
not catching up. Jason,
how do we get through this?

2678
02:23:47,490 --> 02:23:48,930
How do we get through this?
Well,

2679
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:53,670
I mean I guess I'm just trying to make
a contribution when you definitely do on

2680
02:23:53,671 --> 02:23:56,100
that. I'm putting forth mimetic
content to inspire people.

2681
02:23:56,101 --> 02:23:57,570
I think we do that content.

2682
02:23:57,910 --> 02:24:02,310
Never use that word because I love the
word meaningful. I need to, yeah. And uh,

2683
02:24:02,340 --> 02:24:06,330
I think that, um, I don't know. I mean,

2684
02:24:06,331 --> 02:24:08,580
Timothy Leary,
Timothy Leary,

2685
02:24:08,581 --> 02:24:12,180
when he used to call himself
like a standup philosopher
performing philosopher,

2686
02:24:12,181 --> 02:24:15,900
it was this idea of embracing pop culture
and competing in the marketplace of

2687
02:24:15,901 --> 02:24:16,381
ideas.

2688
02:24:16,381 --> 02:24:20,980
So if you think that the marketplace
of ideas could lead us astray,

2689
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,060
then contribute better ideas. I
mean, I mean you're, you're doing it.

2690
02:24:24,090 --> 02:24:28,770
You have 600,000 mines connected to your
Twitter account. Yeah. That's, I mean,

2691
02:24:28,771 --> 02:24:33,750
that's a wonderful opportunity. It's
fun for you to have fun, but also, man,

2692
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:38,140
like you're, you can create waves
of positive, positive change.

2693
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:42,100
One of the things that's amazing is how
nice people are on Twitter. To me, dude,

2694
02:24:42,110 --> 02:24:46,320
it's so nice. I very rarely get
Duisburg cable without a cable.

2695
02:24:46,321 --> 02:24:50,940
You are tuned into 600,000
mines. Yeah. It's pretty amazing.

2696
02:24:50,970 --> 02:24:54,000
Just thinks of amazing.
Yeah, it's an amazing time.

2697
02:24:54,001 --> 02:24:57,030
And how many of them were watching this?
It was only like a couple thousand shit.

2698
02:24:58,760 --> 02:25:01,020
The ultimately this
would be on the iTunes.

2699
02:25:01,021 --> 02:25:04,620
It'll probably be like somewhere around a
half a million. Oh, that'll be fun. Yeah.

2700
02:25:04,850 --> 02:25:07,740
Be Fun. Is All of our different
points of distribution.

2701
02:25:07,741 --> 02:25:11,330
We have it in unused treme. We put it
on Vimeo. Vimeo is the poem. I mean,

2702
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:14,640
it was great. I loved it for video
quality. Yeah. And, uh, and you know,

2703
02:25:14,641 --> 02:25:17,370
we can put long ones on there.
Awesome. No problems then we,

2704
02:25:17,380 --> 02:25:20,730
cause Ustream hooks us up.
We have available on Ustream.

2705
02:25:21,090 --> 02:25:24,090
And so we have also in straight farm,

2706
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:27,970
it's just make it as easy as possible. I,
I, this is my favorite thing to do. Oh,

2707
02:25:27,971 --> 02:25:32,110
you're a podcast pioneer. I mean,
you put it out there. People love,

2708
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:35,320
they love your style. And
it's amazing because, um,

2709
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:38,350
you guys talk about so many
different things, but um, you know,

2710
02:25:38,351 --> 02:25:42,070
just as many people that have seen my
videos and it'd be like, oh my God, dude,

2711
02:25:42,071 --> 02:25:45,400
you got to do something at Ted. Like
people watch the videos and they're like,

2712
02:25:45,401 --> 02:25:48,760
oh my God, dude. Joe Rogan needs to
see this. Like you, that's funny.

2713
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:53,530
This is a symptom of the Kim
Kardashians era. I'm, I'm right there.

2714
02:25:53,531 --> 02:25:57,010
I'm part of the problem. Uh,
I don't, I think, yeah, I
think you're doing great. No,

2715
02:25:57,011 --> 02:26:00,940
I'm just kidding, man. I'm
a big fan. John. Devork. Uh,
do you know who that guy is?

2716
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:05,380
John seed divorce? No. He's a technology
guy. You know he is Brian, right? Oh yeah.

2717
02:26:05,381 --> 02:26:07,030
I know who he is.
He was,

2718
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:10,270
he told me that I have to get Adam Curry
on the podcast because Adam Curry is

2719
02:26:10,271 --> 02:26:13,090
the real pod father.
He's the guy who really created,

2720
02:26:13,110 --> 02:26:16,210
he's been doing it for awhile. He's the
creator. The creator, right, isn't he?

2721
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:19,870
Didn't he help figuring out how
to make podcasts? I don't know.

2722
02:26:19,871 --> 02:26:23,290
I think they're ready to do hers.
Yeah. I don't know why I'm saying this.

2723
02:26:23,291 --> 02:26:26,320
I feel like I read that he had something
to do with the actual coding of the

2724
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:29,380
first podcast. Might not. It
might not be true either way.

2725
02:26:29,380 --> 02:26:33,070
He's like one of the originators, so
I thought guys from techtv, right.

2726
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:36,700
John Dvorak is the [inaudible]
technology called right now.

2727
02:26:36,701 --> 02:26:40,000
He still works with twit and seen
a bunch of his stuff. The podcast,

2728
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:44,830
the podcast allows the technology to
actually get out of the way and what it

2729
02:26:44,831 --> 02:26:48,310
does is it frees your mind. Yeah.
That's why technology is psychedelic.

2730
02:26:48,370 --> 02:26:53,370
Your mind is free to roam from
600,000 miles to their mind,

2731
02:26:53,381 --> 02:26:54,100
to the friends,

2732
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:56,410
their friends' minds and their
friends and minds and they're from it.

2733
02:26:56,590 --> 02:27:00,430
You are freed by the podcast, by
the tools. I mean, think about that.

2734
02:27:00,431 --> 02:27:05,380
Think about it like how it expands the
reach of each and every one of us and

2735
02:27:05,381 --> 02:27:08,650
then it's up to what we say that will
determine the size of the following and

2736
02:27:08,651 --> 02:27:11,530
the influence what you say. Sure.
Yeah, and whether you're not, you know,

2737
02:27:11,531 --> 02:27:15,860
people want to hear the real
communication, real talk. We have tau.

2738
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:18,480
Don't you think I ain't
got enough bullshit.

2739
02:27:20,470 --> 02:27:23,290
People want to hear people really
communicating and it's not enough of that

2740
02:27:23,291 --> 02:27:26,980
going respond to authenticity. Yeah.
They respond to authenticity and it's a,

2741
02:27:26,981 --> 02:27:31,210
it's a beautiful venue for any comedian
or anybody who's looking to express

2742
02:27:31,211 --> 02:27:34,040
himself or someone like you or
anybody that has an idea. It's,

2743
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:36,760
it's the most important thing is
I just got to get this out there.

2744
02:27:36,761 --> 02:27:39,220
I don't want to go through all these
different channels to get this out there.

2745
02:27:39,370 --> 02:27:41,680
I don't want to get it approved.
What did he say tonight? Well,

2746
02:27:41,681 --> 02:27:43,630
I'm going to say this, right.
You know, I think totally,

2747
02:27:43,631 --> 02:27:45,040
but you have to thread send it.

2748
02:27:45,041 --> 02:27:47,830
All of those rules and limitations
no longer apply and you know,

2749
02:27:47,831 --> 02:27:51,160
eventually you'll have more impact in
those like institutionalized forms of

2750
02:27:51,161 --> 02:27:53,550
putting things out there or
they won't exist anymore.

2751
02:27:53,550 --> 02:27:56,400
Then of course they're not going to exist
anymore. That's, that's inevitable. Yeah.

2752
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:58,630
The form of government that
we enjoy in the future,

2753
02:27:58,631 --> 02:28:00,000
we'll have to be Internet based.
There's,

2754
02:28:00,370 --> 02:28:03,040
unless there's something else becomes
cooler than the Internet. Nah, dude.

2755
02:28:03,041 --> 02:28:06,080
It's going to be like the Libertarian
Utopia is the seasteading institute that's

2756
02:28:06,081 --> 02:28:09,490
building those man made islands where
we can have like libertarian utopia is

2757
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:12,970
free of government control.
This has been a mind blowing podcast.

2758
02:28:13,030 --> 02:28:15,750
This has been such a treat guys.
I can't tell you how.

2759
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,610
Thanks for hooking it up dude.
Brian Hoff's Dui and hooked
it up. Pick it up. Ryan.

2760
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:22,190
Man,
the power

2761
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:25,040
of the Internet. Brian's the
man dude. He's been very,

2762
02:28:25,041 --> 02:28:29,330
very fascinating guy of fascinating ideas,
man.

2763
02:28:29,530 --> 02:28:32,570
I think you man fucked a lot of
people's head sideways today.

2764
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:37,790
A lot of people are on the
train right now, headed home
from work going, God damn,

2765
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,510
she getting out of their car not
knowing what the fuck to think. Yeah,

2766
02:28:41,511 --> 02:28:45,320
this is a double listen. Slow it down by
50 yeah, this is one of those podcasts.

2767
02:28:45,321 --> 02:28:48,080
We tried to interject some,
some humor in there along the way too,

2768
02:28:48,090 --> 02:28:50,710
just to break it up a little
because you are, you are you.

2769
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:53,750
There were so many ideas. You presented
them so well and so quickly, you know,

2770
02:28:53,751 --> 02:28:55,160
that was really enjoyable,
man.

2771
02:28:55,400 --> 02:29:00,400
You have a really good understanding of
people's attention spans and of being,

2772
02:29:00,681 --> 02:29:03,710
you know, enigmatic. And you know
when you're doing these video clips,

2773
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:06,320
it's not just that you have great ideas,

2774
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:10,040
it's that you have great ideas that
you figured out how to say with so much

2775
02:29:10,041 --> 02:29:13,250
passionate enthusiasm. Then it becomes
really contagious. And then on top of it,

2776
02:29:13,430 --> 02:29:17,080
this is the perfect visuals and it's like
really powerful stuff, man. I'm, I'm,

2777
02:29:17,081 --> 02:29:20,410
I'm honored that you came down and dude,

multiple and it's fun for all of us. Yeah.

2781
02:29:31,461 --> 02:29:32,540
This is a fun conversation.

2782
02:29:32,541 --> 02:29:35,390
I love the fact that I didn't
treat someone like you and
have these crazy talks.

2783
02:29:35,391 --> 02:29:38,630
It's just the coolest shit ever.
It's one of the real talk.

2784
02:29:38,660 --> 02:29:41,960

02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:44,420
Somebody actually said this in
one of the message board threads.

2804
02:30:44,421 --> 02:30:45,710
I thought it was really funny.
He goes,

2805
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:48,650
if Brian and Joe have been on
Alpha brain for the last year,

2806
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:52,310
how come they don't see him any
smarter? I don't take it anymore. Yeah.

2807
02:30:52,311 --> 02:30:54,910
And you know what? I might get
too high before I do this podcast.

2808
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:58,450
I'm gonna tell Ya, there's
is a fine line between, uh,

2809
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:03,380
how I look and how I look. Now. I look at
myself and I'm like, ah, do your highest.

2810
02:31:03,430 --> 02:31:07,310
Fuck. That's ridiculous. You should not
be that high. And talking to strangers.

2811
02:31:07,311 --> 02:31:10,780
So I apologize for that. Came off
too high, but it wasn't faculty.

2812
02:31:10,860 --> 02:31:14,540
It was fantastic. Um, but I take
Alpha brain. I do, I love it.

2813
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:18,410
It's the shit I wouldn't if I, if I didn't
believe in it, I wouldn't support it.

2814
02:31:18,440 --> 02:31:19,710
I don't make much money from it.

2815
02:31:19,711 --> 02:31:23,320
I do it because I believe
in it and I think it's an
awesome company. I think, uh,

2816
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:25,080
the guy behind it,
my friend Aubrey,

2817
02:31:25,081 --> 02:31:29,430
is one of the coolest human being human
beings on the planet and he has only the

2818
02:31:29,431 --> 02:31:30,960
best intentions in mind.
And so do we.

2819
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:34,590
So that's why I stand behind these
products and that's why I stand behind the

2820
02:31:34,591 --> 02:31:36,840
company. And if I didn't believe in
it, I wouldn't be attached to it.

He's ridiculous onstage.

2833
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:17,940
So much different than his warmongering
side that you see on the podcasts.
