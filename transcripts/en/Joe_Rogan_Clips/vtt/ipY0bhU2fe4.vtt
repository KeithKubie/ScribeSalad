WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.090
Pulsars. And by the way, uh, the Trump space force,

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.620
you know the many pick the whole lot of Trump haters out there. And,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.320
but if you want to hate Trump rationally,

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.630
you want to not hate him no matter what he said.

5
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:15.780
You want to evaluate statement by statement what he says, right?

6
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.630
That's what you need to do. He says, I want to space force. Well,

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.170
let's think about that. Okay? In the second world war,

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.500
there was the air force, except they were not their own branch.

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.800
They were part of the army. It was called the army air force.

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.330
And then we realized that command and control in the air needs different kinds

11
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:35.580
of soldiers though because they have to be pilots.

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.350
It's a different kind of decision making, different kinds of tactical, um,

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.830
actually actions you would have in the, in the theater of operations.

14
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.020
And so it was sensible to spawn off a new branch of the military called the air

15
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:49.854
force.

16
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.330
No one today would question whether that was a good idea today.

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.650
Well,

18
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.650
you should know that operations in space in the vacuum of the universe is a

19
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.430
different regime that you're operating in from moving through the air.

20
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.320
Your hardware looks different, your, your strategies are different.

21
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.900
Your decision, your command and control is different.

22
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.520
So it's not a crate just cause it came out of Trump's mouth doesn't make it a

23
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:21.000
crazy idea that you might want a space force. In fact,

24
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:26.001
I had proposed a space force in 2001 when I was on a commission appointed by

25
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:31.560
George W. Bush to explore the future of the United States space.

26
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.190
Aerospace industry, a commission of 12 so I put it on the table.

27
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.940
We have air force generals, they're former members of Congress,

28
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.110
people from Lockheed Martin. And people said, well,

29
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.470
the air force is currently overseeing space,

30
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.250
United States space command. So everybody was happy with it. And so I find,

31
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.950
I said, okay, let's not worry about it if everybody's happy,

32
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:56.760
but as if as long as this needs of our presence in space grows,

33
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.300
but more importantly the size of our assets,

34
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.580
as long as that continues to grow.

35
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.360
What else would the military do beyond protecting your borders?

36
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:10.380
They would protect your assets and our space. Assets by day,

37
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.170
day by day or growing by leaps and bounds.

38
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.930
So [inaudible] not assets meaning like satellite,

39
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.910
satellite station and the value of those.

40
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.210
It's not just the cost of the satellite is the value that's at the satellite to

41
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:23.480
you, right? The uh,

42
00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:26.400
the military is now creating a whole other GPS system that is,

43
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.840
will be exclusive to them and then they're going to see the current GPS to an

44
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.850
and what have we done with GPS?

45
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.710
This hard earned engineering and physics and orbital mechanics.

46
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.030
What have we done with the GPS?

47
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.310
We now use it to find out who you want to meet with. Oh,

48
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:47.670
someone's in your area. Yeah, that's it. This is Tinder. This is grinder.

49
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
This is show me mateable people within 20 square blocks of where I am.

50
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.710
That's a GPS on grinder.

51
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.520
You, you're right. I did look up the definition mate.

52
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:02.800
Mate implies you're making a baby, right? Okay.

53
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.910
Who are you going to have sex with? Fun. Yeah. Yeah, so,

54
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.530
so that has a certain economic value to society. It's sodas, Uber,

55
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.190
so do all the things that sodas, ups, tracking their trucks.

56
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.200
So it's not the cost of the satellites,

57
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.800
the value of the satellite to our economy. You'd want that protected.

58
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.310
Make sense? Is there a space force currently? Like is it real?

59
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:26.140
Are they recruiting? Does the United States space command?

60
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:28.900
So is there anybody who's a general, if we make a space,

61
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.090
there's generals in the air force overseeing space command.

62
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.620
So if you're going to make a space force, you would offload,

63
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.600
you would offload the space activities of the air force space command to this U

64
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.630
S space command primarily to the space force.

65
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.130
And then add or subtract from that in whatever way is sensible given the needs.

66
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.450
If we have a space for it. You know what?

67
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:52.330
I want to see what I want them to protect us from asteroids.

68
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.790
How about that for a defense program? That makes sense.

69
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.320
Do you want the government involved in that?

70
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:59.470
Shouldn't it be somewhat a little bit more thorough? That's not how it works.

71
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.000
It's not scientists. Yeah.

72
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.770
You just made you made a blanket anti-government decision cause you're just

73
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.620
anti-government guys. People say, okay so

74
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.090
um,

75
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.090
private enterprise is not good at doing expensive things that have never been

76
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:21.700
done before. Right. Need government money. Government government does it first.

77
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.290
Okay. Right. Then you learn where the hostels are, where the friendlies are.

78
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:29.290
Where are the, what patent did you need to make this happen?

79
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.250
Then the venture capitalist meeting about whether I'm going to make a buck on it

80
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.900
has some, has some, some teeth in it. They say how much will this cost?

81
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.990
Well we know because the government did it and we think we can do it for half

82
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:43.180
that price. Is it dangerous? Yes.

83
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:45.250
The government did this and they lost two people,

84
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.920
but we will put protections in so we won't have that risk.

85
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.630
What is the return on the investment?

86
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.560
The government got no return because they didn't, that wasn't the objective,

87
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:56.800
but here's how we can bring them. So I'll do it second. I won't do it first.

88
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.440
This is how you get the Dutch East India trading company.

89
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.120
They were not the first Europeans to the new world because where's the edge of

90
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.490
the earth? Will you find India way? Will you?

91
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.420
It's what you don't know any of this. I'm screaming at you. Sorry.

92
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.410
You don't know any of this.

93
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.770
Columbus does it first and he can tell you where there's food and where there's

94
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.320
isn't, where there isn't and where they want to kill you and where they don't.

95
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.720
Then you hand that information to the market,

96
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:24.721
to the mercantilists and they make a buck after the fact.

97
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.050
So they come in, they come in. Yeah, that's how you do it.

98
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.440
That's how modern airplanes came about.

99
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.050
People were making planes in their garage.

100
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.000
The government said this could be a cool thing.

101
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.040
Let's pay them and have them compete to carry air mail,

102
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.900
new kind of mail mail delivered by air. Oh that's cool.

103
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.380
So now I make an airplane because I want their contract. You say no,

104
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:53.650
you want the contract, you make an airplane. That cat has more cargo,

105
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.070
a bet better engine. You're cleverer now. You just the contract from me.

106
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.180
Now I make a bigger airplane cause I said Oh I see what he did there but now I

107
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:06.500
can improve on that. Now wait a minute, I don't need to carry mail.

108
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.340
I can carry people and thus is born commercial airport air,

109
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.090
airplane government basically bankrolled it as did uh,

110
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.160
as did a prize money for accomplishing certain um,

111
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.950
achievements like Lindbergh.

112
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.940
No one talks about the fact that there was cash money available to him for

113
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:33.560
having done a flown across the Atlantic solo. First cash money.

114
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.120
No kid. I did it for the money. Yeah. As most of them did fly the longest,

115
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.450
the highest, the fastest. Each of these had money associated with it.

116
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.240
So this drove the marketplace.

117
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.680
It was not whether you could make a product out of it initially.

118
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.570
Cause you got to get over the early humps,

119
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.340
you got to get through to get to know what it is that works and what doesn't.

120
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.190
So is there a plan with the space force?

121
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.120
Like are they gonna make space weapons and space ships?

122
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.140
There's a treaty in 1960s to which we are signatory. Okay.

123
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:09.320
And I talk about it in accessory to war. It's again, I hate,

124
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.340
I feel so bad for doing this. Plug it baby. No, I feel so let me hold it then.

125
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.580
Can you hold it? Yeah. Yeah. I just feel, but, but it's, it's

126
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.440
the unspoken Alliance between astrophysics in the military.

127
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.430
You look beautiful with that book primarily because there's a bow and arrow

128
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:30.980
here. Oh, they're being shot by Sagittarius.

129
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.500
That became a weapon and a missile that a 10 you're,

130
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.250
you're a bow and arrow guy. Oh yeah. Last I checked.

131
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.150
Yeah. You've got a fricking bow and arrow in the back room here. Yes.

132
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.860
What are you afraid? I'll practice when the zombies come.

133
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.230
You run out of bullets. Tommy som.

134
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.380
I'm pulling this sorta check from walking dead. Oh, excuse me.

135
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:56.000
The best weapon that he runs out of bullets.

136
00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.160
Zombies are slow and her weapon is in fact this totally, yeah. Uh,

137
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.120
so what was I saying before I interrupted myself? Uh,

138
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.470
space force. Who's that? Who's paying attention out there? Weapons.

139
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:14.000
Asteroids, uh, steroid weaponizing space. So there's this outer space treaty,

140
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.750
the treaty for the peaceful uses of outer space and it was in 1967.

141
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:19.490
There's some modifications since then,

142
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:22.430
but that's the basic one and we are signature to it.

143
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:23.990
And so are the other major countries of the world.

144
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.130
We just break out of the Paris accord break out of that goddamn space pussy

145
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:31.280
shit. It's a beautiful document.

146
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.260
[inaudible] tries to be very forward looking.

147
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.040
If there's an astronaut from another country who is at risk,

148
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:41.420
then you will go to help them without question. It's very kumbaya.

149
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.820
Okay. So one of my sort of,

150
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:47.540
now that I'm old and tired and I just am a realist,

151
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.930
it's why should we promise to not kill each other in space when we are not

152
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.420
successful at doing that here on earth.

153
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.200
And we don't even promise tonight [inaudible] promise to do it here on earth.

154
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.520
Who are we to say, Oh, well we'll kill each other. Anybody in space,

155
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.980
we'll all hold hands. I don't have,

156
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.600
I don't have that much confidence in human conduct.

157
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.890
I become cynical over my years and I'm angry.

158
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.270
Demonstrate to me that on earth you'd know how to not kill one another,

159
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.440
then I'll believe your space treaty. So what I'm saying here now,

160
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.010
given that there is a treaty, it says you can't put heavy weapons in space.

161
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.010
As I detail in one of the, Oh, by the way, I have a coauthor on this.

162
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.970
I started doing this 12 years ago and it was like,

163
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.970
I will never finish this for a thousand years. I brought in a coauthor,

164
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:39.930
obvious Lang,

165
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.550
who is a longtime co editor of my essays that I'd written for natural history

166
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:48.150
magazine. Just give a shout out to my coauthor. How does that work in this case?

167
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.200
Sort of takes your stuff and stitches it together. Uh, in this particular case,

168
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.130
uh, there are lot of ways we collaborated. Um,

169
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.020
some of them I just dictated entire chapters to her and,

170
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:02.730
but leaving out certain details that were,

171
00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.680
would require a nitty gritty of sort of research just to get the right numbers

172
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.470
in the right year and the right commander and the right this,

173
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:13.890
but I know broadly how it happened in what sequence.

174
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.800
And so then she would take that in, shape that into a chapter.

175
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.710
Other places I would say, you know, this happened,

176
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:21.900
this happened and that happened. She would say, well,

177
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:24.570
that wouldn't fit the narrative as it's coming together.

178
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.420
Let's drop the middle one and take the other two. And I say, great.

179
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:29.940
So I'd write that up and she would stitch it,

180
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.290
she would graft it is a better word into the rest of what was going on.

181
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.550
So this is, even though there are places here where I speak in first person,

182
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.300
it's actually, it's a co-written project. It's not ghost written. It's not,

183
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.570
I'm just putting my name, but somebody else wrote, I mean, I write,

184
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:49.050
I know how to write. So we're, we're coauthors on this, but thanks for asking.

185
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.960
That was good. Um, so, uh,

186
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.980
so here's a problem that we detail here. People say,

187
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:58.980
I don't want weapons in space. Okay.

188
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.750
There's nothing more useless than a space weapon relative to earth surface.

189
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.870
Okay? If you're in space, you're an orbit. The think it through.

190
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.280
If I use your skull here, that's kind. Okay, cool. Okay. If this is earth, okay.

191
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.830
Everything more spherical here, I guess not. I'm using your skull. Okay.

192
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.360
All right. So this is earth and I've got a satellite in orbit around the earth.

193
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.590
Right. Okay. And I say, okay, I want to weaponize the satellite,

194
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:28.200
put a bomb in it, and I want to drop over some city. Some,

195
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.110
some bad person wants to make that decision. Right. Well,

196
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:33.180
what's the city you want to hit? Well, it's up here somewhere,

197
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.970
so you gotta drop it halfway there. So you gotta well, no,

198
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:40.860
it's not just that these are not very high above the planet and so you have to

199
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:44.490
like change the orbit to align it so that it goes over your target.

200
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.700
Satellites don't go over every spot on earth.

201
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.600
They only go over the orbit that had Perin preset for it. Okay,

202
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.100
we can already destroy a city with an Intercontinental ballistic missile and we

203
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:57.934
can aim that.

204
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.400
We can aim a missile to any place on earth and it will get there in less than 45

205
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:08.050
minutes and destroy the whole city with nuclear weapons.

206
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.550
We can already do that.

207
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.870
There is no advantage to putting nukes in space if that's your objective.

208
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.880
Not only that, suppose there's a rogue satellite and it's messing with you.

209
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:22.120
It's beaming energy particles at you and you want to take it out.

210
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.360
How are you going to take it out? You're going to destroy it. Oh,

211
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.630
now you break it into a million pieces, a thousand pieces.

212
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.950
Now each piece is moving 18,000 miles an hour and put your own satellites at

213
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:37.300
risk. That's the modern equivalent to in the first world war when they said, Oh,

214
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.600
we have a good idea because we can't shoot them in the, in the trenches,

215
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.590
let's gas them out so they have the mustard gas, oops,

216
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.400
the wind changed directions and all of a sudden you become a victim of your own

217
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:51.670
weapon such as what happened in space.

218
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.030
If you go in and start exploding satellites out of orbit.

219
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.130
So war in space is a different thing.

220
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.760
It's not what you think it would be. So what would they do?

221
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.850
So the outer peaceful use of outer space treaty allows you to have defensive PR

222
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.510
things in space, not offensive for defensive purposes. It allows that.

223
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.950
So treat it aside though. What could you do? Could you, I mean,

224
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.310
could you have space? Rogue state could take out our GPS satellites. Okay.

225
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:21.611
But what?

226
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:24.550
Render the military blind and then you won't be able to pick up your Uber.

227
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.290
He won't have anyone have sex with tonight.

228
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.740
That's the range of stuff that GPS applies to, right?

229
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.920
And so it'll affect our economy. It'll affect our security.

230
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.790
And then our Navy can't talk to the air force. The air force can't talk to it.

231
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.820
And that would be bad. [inaudible]

232
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.260
armies Wars are no longer fought just by how many soldiers have you lined up at

233
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:45.310
the, at the border.

234
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:50.670
It's what have you done strategically to render your opponent,

235
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.300
uh, uh, th just to render,

236
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.380
to weaken your opponent or render them incapable of fighting you.

237
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.500
This is why the attacks on September 11th worked because we had a policy that if

238
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:08.980
someone wants to hijack a plane, you follow their instructions.

239
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.760
You do not deny them their requests because the assumption was that if you deny

240
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:20.110
their requests, they will start harming people. And if you follow the requests,

241
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.110
it will delay when they harm them, if they harmed them at all.

242
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.000
And maybe everyone will end up safe.

243
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.530
It was not in the game plan that they would crash the plane on purpose.

244
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.100
Okay, so September 12th,

245
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.060
you will never again be able to do that to the American plain.

246
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.480
Forget the extra x-rays that we're doing.

247
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.570
A pilot will never relinquish the cockpit ever again,

248
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.590
no matter who they're torturing in the back of the back of the plane,

249
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.270
no matter what they're doing,

250
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.490
even if they're shooting people one by one because the plane going down takes

251
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:53.324
everybody out.

252
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.560
So that was a pretty easy door to close,

253
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.690
literally and figuratively. But no one sought coming.

254
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.310
Do you know what drives me crazy when they put that drink cart [inaudible] not a

255
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:11.000
hallway. Yeah, to protect the pilot. When they opened, I asked them about that.

256
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:15.050
So it's just to delay you a fraction of a second to give them a chance to go in

257
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.260
and lock the door. Ah, right. It's,

258
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.080
you have to get through them and the flight attendant,

259
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.500
that takes an extra second. You can't just run in.

260
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:27.680
Plus they don't even allow you to stand in the aisle while that's happening.

261
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.460
They'll tell you to sit down and sit down. Correct.

262
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.290
So you have to get out of your thing, charge the cart,

263
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.730
and get through the cart and the flight attendant who will be fighting for their

264
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:42.500
life at this point. Okay. And because the plane is everything,

265
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.490
right? Yeah. I've seen that opening now you can get through there.

266
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.090
Those ladies ain't going to stop, man.

267
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.030
Nobody who really is physically Joe Rogan has already thought this through.

268
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.800
It's an [inaudible] thing that my mind does. The point is you can, Oh,

269
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.250
I would never do it. Of course. You know what I, I thought about not that,

270
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:06.680
but I thought to myself, the plane that went, cause I was like,

271
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.730
I witnessed the September low. It's four blocks at six blocks away from, uh,

272
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.660
six walking blocks forward. Plain hit. No, cause that was,

273
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:18.500
my view is blocked from the South. So, but I have a camcorder,

274
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:23.330
footage of the explosion, big explosion I've ever seen. Um, and by the way,

275
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.600
one thing I noticed is that there was no shockwave.

276
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.790
I might've been the closest scientist to the event, so I was,

277
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.490
all I could do was apply every bit of physics that I know.

278
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.320
There was no shockwave. Wow. I said, well,

279
00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:38.390
how can we have an explosion in no shockwave?

280
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.350
And I later learned if you can make a deflagration wave,

281
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.380
if you atomize fuel and then you spark it,

282
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.180
then the flame moves across the fuel. It's not a, it's not a shockwave.

283
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:52.850
It's just a deflagration wave and therefore there's no shockwave.

284
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:57.851
And so windows are not blown out a quarter mile away as they were in Oklahoma

285
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:02.330
city with the giant bombed with him, make today Timothy McVeigh.

286
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.750
Uh, why am I bringing this up? Um,

287
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.140
what was I talking about? September 11 the plane. Oh, uh,

288
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.270
Oh yeah. So here's something I calculated.

289
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:19.070
I said if I was in a seven 67 and we're about to crash into a building,

290
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.000
if I was in the last row of the plane,

291
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:28.930
how much time would elapse before the front row crumbled?

292
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.650
And it met me in the back row

293
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.890
given the speed of the plane going into the building. 500 miles an hour. Yeah,

294
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.490
that's probably slower than that by then. I would say closer to 400.

295
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.200
I mean it's a known speed and I don't know it,

296
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:48.920
but I don't think it was this because you can't turn at that highest speed and

297
00:17:48.921 --> 00:17:50.700
it to like turn around and, and aim.

298
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.250
So it's about a second less half a fraction of a second. It's a fraction.

299
00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.390
So the question is tiny for how long does it take a plane to go its own length?

300
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.470
Right? When it's going at 400 miles an hour, that's seconds.

301
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.750
It's a fraction of a second. So it was like, that's it.

302
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:11.220
You can't even process that. So I figured the deaths were pretty quick.

303
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.310
Wow. Instantaneous. Yes. Basically instantaneous. You are,

304
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:19.110
you are pulverized a pile of goo.

305
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.620
Are they planning on making space ships that can shoot down other space ships?

306
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.380
So here, so any space Wars would not be war between space and earth.

307
00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:33.100
It would be between stuff in space that that's all stuff in space, like space,

308
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:37.200
space, space, space to space. Yeah. Here's another question.
