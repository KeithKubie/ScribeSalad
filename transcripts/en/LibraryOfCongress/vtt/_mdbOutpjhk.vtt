00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.540
&gt;&gt; Jacob Nadal: Thank
you for joining us today

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.840
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.140
My name is Jake Nadal.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.440
I'm the director

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.370
for preservation
here at the Library.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.830
Every spring, libraries

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.300
across the US celebrate
Preservation Week,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.780
and event that was started
in 2010 as a joint effort

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.860
between the Library,
the Institute of Museum

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.390
and Library Services, and
working in partnership

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.690
with professional societies

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.650
like the American
Library Association,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.230
the American Institute
for Conservation

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.220
and then the Society
of American Archivists.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.700
Preservation Week is
always a welcome opportunity

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.290
to share both our
technical knowledge

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.520
and our sense of purpose.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.200
Every day, across all of
the Library's facilities,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.090
preservation staff
reshelf materials

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.970
that were consulted
the day before.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.800
They ensure that everything
is in its place and ready

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.430
for the next researcher.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.690
They perform the treatments that
keep our collections usable.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.730
And when materials are
too fragile for use

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.670
or their formats
become obsolete,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.140
they create new versions
to ensure

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.480
that information
stays available.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.150
Preservation staff also do the
scientific research required

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.770
to ensure that we understand the
risks that face our collections

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.400
and that we have strategies
to bring them into the future.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.260
We do that work to make sure
that everything collected here

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.070
in the Library has a
pathway into the future.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.640
From time to time, however,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030
Congress gives the Library
special direction to attend

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.130
to the preservation issues of
concern to the American people.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770
Because of that,
I'm especially glad

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.590
that we can showcase the
Veterans History Project today.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.520
We have 167 million items in
the collection at last count,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.260
and we add thousands
more each day.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.600
So when I say that my staff
of 180 is one in a million,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.850
I mean it both from the heart
and from the calculator.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.710
Working on the Veterans History
Project is a good reminder

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160
that preservation and Library
collection-building are not just

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.480
numbers games.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.780
It's not just one of us

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.670
and a million more
things to take care of.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880
Those treatment hours,
the inventory records,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.450
all of the work to building a
collection adds up to something

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.320
that matters to people, both
the individuals and communities.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.740
During events like Preservation
Week, and as I speak

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.470
with colleagues across the
country, I'm always inspired

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.230
to see how libraries,
archives, historical societies

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.760
and other collecting
institutions engage with people

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.280
in their communities to bring
the past into the present.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.060
I think the Veterans History
Project is a great example

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.360
of this.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.660
So now I will hand the stage

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.350
over to Karen Lloyd,
director of the VHP.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.150
Karen.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.290
[ Applause ]

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.680
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Good afternoon.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.690
He's taller than me.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.830
Thank you for choosing
to be here today.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.130
I'm Karen Lloyd.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.950
I'm a retired Army aviation
colonel and the director

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.480
of the Veterans History Project.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.420
First, I'd like to give a shout
out to Jake and his whole team

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.790
for asking the Veterans
History Project to be part

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.690
of this amazing event.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.460
One of our major challenges
is convincing veterans

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.170
and their loved ones to part
with some of those unique

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.530
and original items that
illuminate their narrative.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.020
I know from firsthand experience
how hard it is to part

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.950
with these treasures,
but I have come

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.330
to understand the importance

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.700
of ensuring these artifacts are
available for future generations

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.040
and how the Library's
preservation directorate

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.450
under Jake's leadership
makes that possible.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.670
As a veteran, as the widow of a
veteran, the child and sibling

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.390
of veterans, the
Veterans History Project,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.270
to me, is more than a job.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.040
It's rewarding, and
it's purposeful.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.160
I ask you, how many of you
can say, I'm living the dream

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.330
when you talk to other folks.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.120
Today, if we're successful,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.990
we'll pass on that
same enthusiasm

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.970
about the Veterans
History Project to you.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.850
My hope is that you leave
today with a sense of urgency

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.990
to gather the narratives
of veterans.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.450
VHP is your opportunity to
make a meaningful difference

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.970
for the veteran in your
life for your community.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.430
The Veterans History
Project is one

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.940
of the Library's most
popular programs.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.520
It is one of the largest oral
history projects in the country.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.510
Its congressional mandate
is to collect, preserve

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.180
and make accessible the personal
accounts of American veterans

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.450
so that future generations
may hear directly

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.540
from those veterans and
better understand their

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.400
selfless service.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.400
Oral history is a principal
conduit for folklore.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.490
It is through oral
history that we learn

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.340
about the life experiences and
perspectives of individuals

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.110
who might not otherwise
appear in historical record.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.310
It also provides
a rich opportunity

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.140
for human interaction.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.150
I am grateful that Congress
understood the oral history

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.600
aspect of folklore when
it developed the Veterans

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.320
History Project.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.570
Over the past 1 years,
we have collected

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.420
over 105,000 different
firsthand narratives,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.100
ranging from oral histories
to diaries to letters

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.280
to photographs, even 2D artwork.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.670
Our collection spans
from World War I

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.330
through the current conflicts.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.320
We include every branch,
ethnicity, gender and conflict.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.950
Our diverse and rich
collection is a start,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.820
but with over 17 million
veterans in America today,

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.470
there's a lot of work left to
be done, and we need your help.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.740
It would have been
impossible for our staff

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.920
to archive this much history
without the direct involvement

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.510
of volunteers from
across the country

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.910
who interview veterans
in their lives.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.790
By using the Veterans
History Project as a tool,

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.300
you help the nation preserve
our veterans' story so that we,

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.530
together, can create a living,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.090
lasting memorial to
military service.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.220
Decades, even hundreds of years
from now, people won't have

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.310
to wonder what happened
during the wars

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.160
and conflicts represented by the
veterans who were interviewed.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.930
They will be able to hear
it directly from those

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.370
who were there, from the
pointy end of the spear

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.210
to those rear echelons.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.040
Our veterans will tell
you, e need the whole story

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.170
to fully understand the
complete experience.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.410
The Veterans History Project
history project was created

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.920
with the purpose to
collect, preserve

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.290
and make accessible the memories
of our nation's veterans

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.880
so that we can hear
directly from them

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.030
and capture what they
saw, felt and heard,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.170
the human experience
of military service.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.980
Collect, reach out to the
veterans in your lives

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.740
and communities and listen,
really listen, to their stories

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.420
and donate them to the
Library of Congress.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.450
Why you ask?

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.990
To ensure we don't lose those
voices and those stories.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.520
Today, you'll hear from Rachel
Telford, the VHP archivist

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.750
and the preservation directorate
team that supports VHP

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.760
about the techniques and
procedures available to them

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.940
to preserve these
original artifacts

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.510
so they remain accessible
for future generations.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.510
Rachel.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.500
[ Applause ]

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.490
&gt;&gt; Rachel Telford: All right.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.930
So, before the conservators
get into the details

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.420
of how they preserve individual
items in our collections,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.120
I just wanted to
give some background

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.500
on a few collections
they'll be talking about just

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.610
to provide some context
and give you a sense

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.900
of exactly what it is we're
preserving and the stories

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.040
that are captured
in these items.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.430
I'm just going to
highlight three.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.030
The first is the collection
of Albert John Carpenter.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.330
This is the only
photo we have of him.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.750
He is in the back row,
second from the right.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.050
And he served in the Army

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.890
with the 142nd infantry
regiment during World War I.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.460
He was in France in the
trenches during the final days

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.950
of the war, so he experienced
bombings and gas attacks

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.850
and all the worst that
World War I had to offer.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.060
And he, fortunately
for us, kept a diary.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.340
So we know a little bit
about his experience.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.720
His entries were fairly
brief to the point,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.530
but they contain quite vivid
descriptions of his experiences.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.660
On October 11, 1918, he wrote,

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.070
142nd casualties still
enlarging and very weak.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.570
Only two good meals
since on front.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.440
Twelve a.m. a gas
shell came over.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.170
Did not get my gas
mask on quick enough.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.210
Sent to field hospital,
taken about 20 pills

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.480
and sent back to the lines.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.460
So, he conveys quite a lot
just in a few short lines.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.960
These are a couple
pages from his diary.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.930
The diary itself
came to us unbound.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.070
It's just loose pages,
and as you can see,

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.370
there's a little bit of water
damage there that happened

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.610
at some point before
we received it.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.210
And in a few minutes, our
conservators will talk

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.980
about some of the work that
they have done to help ensure

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.260
that the content of the
diary remains accessible.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.070
But the preservation of this
item starts a little bit earlier

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.370
than that.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.880
The veteran's family donated
the diary to us in 2002,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.370
and they knew that
they were going

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.490
to make it accessible
to researchers.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.940
They knew that it would
be securely housed.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.360
But several years
after the donation,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.830
the veteran's daughter-in-law,
Shirley Carpenter, got in touch

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.030
to let us know how
important that decision

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.270
to donate this diary really was.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.710
She used to keep the diary
in a box in her hall closet,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.560
along with the family Bible
and all the important documents

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.420
of that family history.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.500
And she lives down
on the Gulf Coast,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.160
and in 2005 Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita swept through her town,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.960
left five feet of
standing water in her house

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.620
and destroyed everything
that was in that box.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.920
So all those pieces

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.650
of her family history were
destroyed except for this diary,

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.510
because she had made that
decision to send it to us,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.250
and it was safely
housed 1,000 miles away.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.220
So Albert Carpenter's story
is available here today

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.920
because she took that first
step in preserving the diary

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.070
and donating it to the
Veterans History Project.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.320
And the second collection
is Samuel Culotta.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.190
He's a World War II veteran.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.910
He was from Baltimore,
and when he was 17,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.040
immediately after the attack
on Pearl Harbor, he had tried

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.530
to enlist in the Marine Corps.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.380
He had flat feet, so
they wouldn't take him.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.220
But shortly after that, he was
able to enlist in the Navy,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.590
and he served with a
naval assault beach party.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.300
He has quite a large collection

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.000
that includes an oral
history interview.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.770
It also includes diaries,
memoirs, correspondence, maps,

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.190
news clippings, all
kinds of materials

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.160
that document his service.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.460
He was a medic.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.520
He participated in nine island
invasions in the Pacific,

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.230
so he saw close combat.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.870
He saw terrible casualties,
and there are a number

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.390
of incredible stories that are
captured in his collection.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.740
One of my favorites is the
story of this little boy.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.280
His name was [inaudible] Joseph.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.310
He lived in Enewetak in
the Marshall Islands,

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.220
and his family, his
community, was caught literally

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.440
in the middle of the war.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.430
And he was injured by shrapnel

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.560
and brought aboard the
USS Cambria for treatment

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.510
and Sam Culotta was given
the job of taking care of him

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.910
and making sure that he got back
to his family in good health.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:21.460
And he mentions this sort of
briefly in his oral history,

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.390
but through the original
material in his collection,

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.320
we can really get a
sense of the impact

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.530
that this experience had on him.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.910
There are a number of photos.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.530
As you can see here, the ship's
tailor made a little uniform

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.830
for him.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.280
And you can also
see in this phot

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.060
that he's got bandages
on both of his hands.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.140
And based on some of
these images we have,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.230
he's there in the center,
it seems like the guys

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.760
on the ship really liked him.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.760
Samuel Culotta certainly did.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.660
He wrote in his diary that
he became quite fond of him,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.790
and they were both very upset
when it was time for him

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.090
to go back to his family.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.720
He describes, you know, quickly
leaving him with the sailors

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.850
who were taking him back
because he didn't want

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.230
to see the boy crying
as he was leaving.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.790
And this is an experience that
definitely stuck with him,

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.210
because 60 years later he
tried to track this boy down,

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.550
and he wrote to the Embassy
of the Marshall Islands,

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.410
and despite only having
a summary of events

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.110
and a phonetic spelling
of the boy's name,

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.460
he was actually able
to find him.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.780
It turned out this little
boy grew up to be a member

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.980
of the island council,
and apparently,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.520
has been telling the story
of the time he got to hang

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.000
out on a US Navy ship with
all his sailor friends

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.850
for his entire life.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.430
So that letter got into the
hands of a local politician

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.600
who immediately knew
who it was about.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.780
So after 60 years, they
were reunited here in D.C.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:46.240
So our oral history collections
are an incredible resource,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.400
but in this case, if we just
had that veteran's oral history,

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.840
we would know a little
bit about this.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.680
He talked about it for maybe a
minute and a half, two minutes,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.860
but there's not a lot of detail.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.460
And but because he donated
all this additional material,

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.670
we know a lot more about that
experience and how he felt

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.250
about it, both at the time
as well as in later years.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.780
And so it is a much
richer story for having

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.110
that additional detail.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.470
The final collection is that
of George Washington Pearcy.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.080
He served in the Army and Army
Air Forces during World War II.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.560
He shipped out to the
Philippines in early 1941,

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.230
so he was there before the
outbreak of war in the Pacific.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.530
And during this period,

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.480
he was an incredibly
prolific letter writer.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.460
He would write five, ten,
sometimes 15-page letters

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.440
to his parents describing his
daily life, his impressions

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.510
of the Philippines, his
plans for the future,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.120
and he would regularly remind
them to keep all of his letters.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.420
Keep everything he
was sending back.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.750
He would tell them exactly
where they were supposed

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.240
to be keeping all this material.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.370
Like every other letter, don't
forget to keep my letters.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.090
So it was clear that he thought
his experience was important

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.390
and interesting.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.640
He wanted to document
it, and he also,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.120
he mentioned possibly
wanting to write a book

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.910
about his experience, so
it was clear he wanted

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.520
to share his experience
later on.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.080
After the war began,
he was no longer able

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.960
to write these lengthy
letters, and in 1942,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.720
he was taken prisoner by
Japanese forces and held

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.680
in several prison camps
in the Philippines.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.390
And after he was
captured, he was only able

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.620
to send a few brief postcards
home, but he did keep a diary.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.370
And diaries, we know,
often weren't allowed

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.970
in Japanese prison camps,
so this probably was kept

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.290
in secret, potentially
at great risk.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.460
We do know that he was
clearly using whatever paper he

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.760
could find.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.650
Here we see some used
labels from cans of food,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.210
and behind that there's
part of a map.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.390
But this wasn't entirely
used as a traditional diary.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.310
We can see evidence
that he's trying

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.480
to keep his mind active
while he's in prison.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.030
Here he's making a
list of things he wants

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.650
to do when he gets home.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.320
In another section,
he's compiling a list

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.970
of personal property that
he lost when the war began,

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.340
because he plans to petition
the government for reimbursement

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.070
for all of those items.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.440
And this is another
one of his diaries.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.470
Here, he's repurposing
medical records that he found

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.550
at the Philippine colony
where he's being held.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.280
And you'll hear shortly about
the physical preservation

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.990
of diaries, but the first step

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.480
in preserving these diaries
happened long before they

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.780
got here.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.490
In 1944, Pearcy was to
be transported to Japan

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.830
on a prison ship, and so
he gave all of his papers

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.740
to a fellow prisoner who would
stay behind named Robert Auger

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.570
for safekeeping and asked him
to return the material to him

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:50.170
if he was able to keep it
with him when he got home.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.580
And George Pearcy
didn't make it to Japan.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.800
His unmarked prisoner
transport was sunk

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.220
by a US submarine in late 1944.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.760
But Robert Auger remained

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.380
in the Philippines was
eventually liberated

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.680
by US forces.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.070
And shortly after returning
to the US, he made good

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.590
on his promise, and he mailed
the diaries to Pearcy's parents.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.320
And it would be several more
months before his parents found

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.540
out what had happened to him.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.970
So naturally, after
that terrible news,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.360
they saved everything.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.510
And this all got passed
down through his family

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.650
to his nephews, who
eventually made the decision

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.180
to donate this material
to us here

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.740
at the Veterans History Project.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.370
And at that time, it was the
only Pacific Theater POW diary

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.820
that we had in our
collection, so the importance

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.860
of preserving these
particular items really can't

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.220
be overstated.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.210
We actually now have to
Pacific Theater POW diaries.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.550
The second one belonged to
his buddy, Robert Auger.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.570
And so our conservators
are going to tell you more

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.540
about exactly how they
preserve these items for us,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.660
and we'll have some of
them on display afterwards.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.550
We also have a number of items
on display in the exhibit,

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.970
Echoes of the Great War here
in the Jefferson Building.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:05.550
And on May 26th, we'll be
presenting a one-man show called

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.230
An American Soldier's
Journey Home, which is based

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.800
on the World War I diary
of Irving Greenwald,

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.690
which you can see here.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.410
But for now, I will turn
things over to our conservators

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.780
who will tell you more about
the incredible work they do

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.510
with our material.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:25.500
[ Applause ]

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.790
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Evers: Hello.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.930
Like Rachel said,
my name is Jennifer,

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.400
and I'm from the
Conservation Division.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.900
We have a couple of us
here today to talk to you.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.890
The Conservation
Division is responsible

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.340
for the physical preservation

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.480
of the Library's
special collection.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.560
And this includes everything
from examining collection items

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.000
to assess their conditions,
created written

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.110
and photographic
documentation, treating items

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.290
that require intervention
or stabilization,

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.910
monitoring their environment
throughout the Library stacks

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.330
to make sure that we're
keeping everything

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.710
in the best possible conditions.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.430
We prepare collection materials

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.550
for loan exhibition
and digitation.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.280
And we prepare for and
respond to potential disasters.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.460
In addition, we support
and promote the field

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.960
of conservation by giving
lectures, conducting

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.030
and publishing original
research,

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.060
treating conservation interns
and fellows and serving

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.060
in leadership roles in the
professional community.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.500
The Conservation Division staff
includes book conservators,

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.520
and our lab is pictured in the
image on the left, and paper

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.890
and photograph conservators.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.760
And their lab is in the
picture on the right.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.410
We also have a number of
preservation specialists

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.920
and conservation technicians.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.490
I think as conservators that
we are not only fortunate

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.420
to work here at the Library of
Congress, but that we have some

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.220
of the best jobs in the Library.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.900
We get to interact
with a wide variety

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.630
of items in the collection.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.800
Our work requires us to learn
more about the collections

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.790
from the curators
and archivists.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.080
And basically, we get experience
a really unique physical,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.400
tangible connection with
our shared material, culture

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.190
and history on a daily basis.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.100
And although today we're
mostly going to talk to you

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.070
about conservation treatments,
I also would like to mention

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.020
that quite a bit of work
takes place up front

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.970
when an item first
comes into the lab.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.270
Objects are first examined

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.110
to evaluate their
physical structure,

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.470
composition and condition.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.510
And in the picture on the
left, you can see Gwenanne,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.310
my colleague, examining a book
containing Japanese coloring

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.200
examples under a microscope.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.550
And she is looking to assess
lead red deterioration.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.850
In the photo on the right,

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:44.200
you can see someone doing
photographic, sorry,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.870
preparing to take photographic
images to document the condition

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.370
of an item before it is treated.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.070
We also write extensive
documentation detailing

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.970
as much information as
possible about the item,

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.680
and this includes information
such as its creator,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.950
how it was manufactured
or created,

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.560
its present physical condition,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.530
and all of this information
helps us

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.510
to make informed
decisions about the best way

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.230
to treat or care for an item.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.970
And finally, we meet with
curators and archivists

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.710
to discuss treatment options
and get approval prior

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:20.450
to undertaking any physical
treatment of an item.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.710
Conservators receive
highly specialized training,

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.180
either through graduate programs
or intensive apprenticeships.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.190
We learn about the structure
of physical materials

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.840
and take extensive
coursework in chemistry.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.880
But conservation is a mix of
art and science, so we also have

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.940
to become skilled
in craftsmanship.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.340
We learn about the historical
construction of physical items,

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.370
because in order to fix
something, you also have

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.990
to have an inherent
understanding

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.690
of how that thing is made.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.090
In graduate training programs
for book conservation,

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.340
we were taught to recreate
historical binding models

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.580
so we can better
understand their structures,

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.070
see weak points where the
physical materials are likely

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.750
to fail and learn how to
best fix these issues.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.590
Conservators are both
scientists and craftsmen,

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.170
and like all craftsmen,
we love our tools.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.470
These are just some of the tools

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.590
that conservators
frequently use.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.790
You probably recognize
a lot of them, scissors

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.810
and brushes, exact-o knives.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.560
But some that you might
not be as familiar with are

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.410
in the top left there's a
jar of wheat starch paste,

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.280
which is an adhesive that we
often use in conservation.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.960
The top right is a paring knife,
which book conservators use

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.660
when working with leather.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.240
At the bottom, there's
two sheets

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.920
of long-fiber Japanese
tissue which is often used

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.570
to repair material
because it's very strong,

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.430
transparent and flexible.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.500
And then the kind of more
tan-colored paper is a rag pulp

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.660
paper that we actually make
inhouse in the Library.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.270
And this can also be
used as a repair paper.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:50.820
I'm one of ten special
collection conservators

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.230
in the book lab at the
Library of Congress.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.150
We're responsible for
treating bound items

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.930
in the Library's vast
repository of collections.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.660
Unlike a museum, we don't
only collect priceless art

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.950
like medieval manuscripts and
important works of art on paper.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.540
Although we do have an
incredible collection

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.840
of those things.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.310
We also have very
important collections

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.960
that encompass the entire
range of human experience.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.420
Many of the items in Veterans
History Project collections do

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.510
not, at casual glance,
have the characteristics

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.340
of something you might
consider to be part

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.950
of a special collection.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.480
There are no jeweled bindings
or gilded illuminations,

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.350
or if there are, I
haven't seen them.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.260
And a lot of the items
have been created

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.960
by people whose names you
might not be familiar with.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.900
But they connect us to our
past on an individual level,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.670
and they allow us to experience
the world through a time

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.170
and a perspective
other than our own.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.610
And these are some
examples of books

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.410
from the Veterans History
Project collections

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.690
that have recently been
treated in book conservation.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.510
On the top left is a
scrapbook that belongs

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.700
to Robert Frank Auger,
and he's the veteran

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.810
that Rachel mentioned as saving
Culotta's diaries and letters.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:57.710
He was an Army captain wounded
in action, and he belonged to,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.490
or he was a Japanese
prisoner of war

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.210
for 33 months during
World War II.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.480
And after the war, he did a
lot of work promoting the sale

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.760
of war bonds, and
this scrapbook,

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.910
which I believe was probably
made by his wife, contains a lot

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.980
of newspaper clippings about
his work selling war bonds.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.410
The top right is a very
brittle diary written

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.320
by Joseph Sweitzer, who served

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.270
on an ammunition train
during World War I.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.910
His diary was written on very
fragile and acidic paper,

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.140
and it was disbound and rehoused

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.860
in a newly constructed
post binding

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.030
to allow for safe handling.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.220
And at the bottom right is
a publisher's blank book

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.820
that was used as a diary
by Willing Hearn, Jr,

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.990
another soldier during
the Great War.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.960
There's a huge variety
of bound materials

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.280
in the Veterans History
Project's collection.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.610
These items form an important
part of our cultural heritage,

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.720
and when they become part of
our collections, we treat them

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.330
with the same deliberate care,
precision and consideration

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.400
as we would any other
books or manuscripts

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.700
in our special collections.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.670
So now, I'm going to talk
in a little more detail

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.690
about the conservation
of diaries written

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.550
by two different veterans.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.680
The first, Samuel
Anthony Culotta,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.300
served as a medical corpsman

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.030
in the US Navy during
World War II, as you heard.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.760
He was only 18 when he
enlisted, and during his time

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.210
at the Pacific Theater, he
wrote a series of diaries

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.040
in five small notebooks.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.740
They came into the conservation
lab in pretty poor condition

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.680
with loose pages,
broken sewing thread

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.690
and torn and crumbled edges.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.780
And I chose this image on the
left from one of his diaries

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.220
because I think this
is a huge part

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.160
of what makes the
Veterans History collection

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.460
so compelling.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.630
At the beginning of the
entry, Culotta notes,

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.580
"And so ends my uneventful
birthday.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.240
I nicked my nose shaving."

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.200
Which is sort of an
everyday, mundane observation.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.360
However, at the end of the
same page, he also writes,

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.620
"I've reached a hardened state
of mind where it concerns war.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.920
But if I ever got to thinking
too much of what I've seen

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.180
and participated in, I
believe I'd go nuts."

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.390
This is a really sad and
profound reflection from someone

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.530
who is still too young to vote
and a reminder that Culotta,

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.980
along with many of the veterans
whose diaries are now part

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.540
of the VHP collections, was just
an ordinary young man living

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.150
through very extraordinary
circumstances.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.270
War is brutal and personal, but
his diaries, along with those

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.740
of other veterans, help

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.530
to personify these
historical events

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.530
and provide us a
valuable link to our past.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.980
This is another of
Culotta's diaries.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.120
You can see in the photo on the
left it's been mended with tape.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.830
Normally, if something
were covered in tape,

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.780
we'd probably decide
to remove it.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.770
My colleague Gwenanne will
talk more about that in one

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.970
of her treatments, but
essentially, the adhesives

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.900
and tape can damage
the paper substrate,

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.090
making it discolored
and brittle.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.120
However, Culotta
used medical tape,

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.470
which was likely the only
tape available to him

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.420
on the binding of this diary.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.810
This is another part of what
makes the VHP collection

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.190
particularly unique.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.650
Signs of use and
repair are often part

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.970
of the intrinsic
history of the item

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.270
and are carefully considered

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.800
when undertaking a
conservation treatment.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.110
That grime on the cover
might be from a battlefield

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.380
or a foxhole rather than
just general use over time.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.200
And tape is what Culotta had
on hand as a medical officer

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.760
to fix his diary when
it was falling apart.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.020
Here you can see it mended.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:17.570
This is the diary
after treatment.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.860
The broken sewing was
causing the pages to fall

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.730
out of the binding,
and as a result,

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.560
some of the loose pages had
become torn and damaged.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.210
A repair tissue was
used to mend the tears

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.200
and strengthen fragile
paper around the edges.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.780
Creases in the pages that were
covering text were carefully

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.170
humidified and gently unfolded.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.710
Loose pages were mended

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.820
to recreate their
original bifolios,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.340
and the diary was resewn
as it was originally.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:46.690
And you can see that this
diary isn't even a properly

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.990
bound book.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.060
It's just a compilation of loose
pages, and it's probably all

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.420
that Culotta had
at his disposal.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.720
You can see that
the ink has bled,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.880
probably from changes
in humidity.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.180
Perhaps he got caught

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.650
in a rainstorm while the diary
was tucked in his pocket.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.020
In this case, the edges
of the pages were crumpled

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.220
with numerous tears and
creases that obscured the text.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.170
The tears were mended, the
creases were flattened,

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.010
and it's now possible to
easily read the diary.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:14.920
In addition to performing
conservation treatments,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.180
we often create custom
housings for collection items.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.500
After they were treated, each

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.830
of Culott'a diaries was
individually rehoused

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.440
in a custom [inaudible]
and closure to ensure

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.860
that the unbound manuscript
pages stayed together

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.540
and that the diaries are
protected during storage.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.660
The second diary that I'll
talk about was written

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.560
by Ewing Harry Miller.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.190
Miller served in France as a
first lieutenant in World War I.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.370
He wrote his diary in
a blank account book

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.190
with beautifully marbled
edges and a leather spine.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.980
At some point, the
spine leather fell off,

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.620
and the sewing thread broke,
which left the diary vulnerable

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.520
to damage during even
the most careful use.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.120
You can see here that the front
cover has fallen completely off

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.420
of the binding.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.830
And here's another
slide showing damage.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.820
As you can see in the top photo,
the pages are starting to fall

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.620
out of the diary, and the sewing
is partially gone along the

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.590
spine, along with most
of the spine leather.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.480
So the diary was disbound and
resewn, which means that all

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.420
of the pages are now
mechanically attached

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.240
to each other to form a
single, solitary text block.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.820
This image shows the sewing
frame in our book lab.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.480
You can see that the thread goes
into and out of the sections

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.810
and wraps around the cord sewing
supports before the next section

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.160
is sewn on.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.460
In a lot of modern books,

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.790
the pages are just glued
together at the spine.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.570
But in most older books, the
pages are actually sewn together

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.720
like this in a variety of ways.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.470
I don't often get to resew an
entire text block like this,

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.280
but when I get to, it's one of
my favorite parts of treatment.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.310
Partially because it's
just fun to sew a book,

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.370
but also because it provides
a sense of connection

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.000
to the craftsman of the past,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.720
since bookbinders have
used these same methods

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.870
for centuries.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.530
Here, you can see that the text
block is now completely sewn.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.960
The spine has been lined
with cloth, and the front

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.270
and back cover boards
have been reattached.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.850
This was done by
inserting the cloth

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.460
that lines the spine
beneath the lifted leather

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.030
on the spine edges.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.530
The book is now essentially
back together

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:17.510
and functions like
a bound volume.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.140
However, it's still
missing a leather spine.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:25.190
When we bind new skins
of leather for repair,

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.360
they're usually too thick
and stiff to use as is,

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.790
which means we have to thin them
down to a more usable thickness.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.250
This green machine pictured

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.550
in the image is called
a sharfix [phonetic],

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.330
and it has a very sharp
blade that runs parallel

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.230
to a small horizontal
metal cylinder.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:42.260
As the leather is
pulled between the blade

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.310
and the rotating cylinder, a
thin strip of suede is removed

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.430
from the skin which decreases
its overall thickness.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.890
This can also be done by hand
using a knife, like you saw

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.960
in the image of the
tools or a spoke shave.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.000
Paring usually takes quite
a while to get an even,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.040
thin leather that is
suitable for repair.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.710
These are some of the finishing
tools that we have in the lab.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.030
They are brass tools with wooden
handles that can be heated

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.440
over a stove and used
to impress gold lines

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.190
and designs in leather.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.060
Although these tools
are probably only

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.530
about 20 years old, tools
just like this have been used

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:15.830
for hundreds of years.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.730
There has not been a lot of
change to the technology.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.030
The jar in the back

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.220
of the picture holds
scraps of gold foil.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.720
Unfortunately, there
were just enough

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.040
of the original spine lines
left on Miller's diary to tell

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.350
where the lines had
been originally tooled.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:33.190
And here you can see
the completed treatment.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.850
The diary has been resewn
and repaired in leather.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.560
Gold lines have been
tooled on the spine,

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.150
just as in the original.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.370
And the book once again
functions as a proper binding.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.840
So, these were just two
examples of bound diaries

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.270
from the Veterans
History Project

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.950
that has been treated
by book conservators.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.850
Now, my colleague,
Gwenanne, is going to talk

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.590
about several items
that have been treated

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:56.510
by paper conservators at
the Library of Congress.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:02.410
[ Applause ]

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:03.710
&gt;&gt; Gwenanne Edwards: Hello.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.010
I'm Gwenanne Edwards.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.140
I'm a paper conservator
here at the Library.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.780
And, like Jennifer, I'm
going to be focusing mainly

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.240
on conservation treatments.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.930
So on the screen is a
small sampling of materials

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.370
from Veterans History Project
collections that Library

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.290
of Congress paper conservators
have treated in recent years.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.850
So they include inscribed
maps, watercolor drawings

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:32.630
and letters with ephemeral.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.660
The first paper conservation
treatment project that I'm going

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.260
to discuss in a little bit
more detail is a map drawn

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.560
by Gale Mattison,
first lieutenant

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.380
in the army during
the Vietnam War.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.150
The map depicts hamlets
within Binh Thuan Province

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.050
where Mattison was stationed.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.290
And it contains a detailed
legend identifying areas

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.410
such as schools,
locations of barbed wire

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.430
and communist-friendly enclaves.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.450
The map is drawn on transparent
paper, which is similar

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.420
to a modern tracing paper.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.710
So the materials in VHP's
collections pose diverse

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.770
problems to conservators.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.440
They're mostly on poor
quality papers common

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.750
of the 20th century, made
with what limited access

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.230
to material would allow and
often to be intended to be used

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.830
and exist only temporary
during the time of conflict.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:28.520
The paper on which Mattison map
was drawn had become brittle,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.940
breaking where the object
was most often handled

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.890
around the edges.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:36.820
This caused numerous
losses and tears.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.370
There is also adhesive
residue around the edges

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.030
which can be seen at the
top in that center detail.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:48.750
And in this detail from the
bottom edge, previous removal

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.680
of a tape had pulled
away the top layer

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.030
of the paper taking the
blue-colored pencil along

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.810
with it.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:58.480
So after examination and
before conservation treatment,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.090
conservators test the paper
and media, so that's any ink,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.030
paint or other material
applied to the surface,

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.770
to ensure the methods of
repair will not cause damage

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.620
to the object.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.010
The extremely sensitive
transparent paper

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.600
and the modern-colored
media used

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.270
in the Mattison map required
more extensive testing

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.030
than normal.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.840
And this treatment also provided
an excellent opportunity

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.140
for a conservation intern under
the supervision of a conservator

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.060
to gain experience with the
maps-challenging materials.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.360
So prior to treatment,

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.570
the intern tested several
possible repair papers,

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:36.110
adhesives and mending
techniques.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:41.510
And then based on her testing,
she chose appropriate repairs

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.930
that would prevent the
media from bleeding,

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:47.020
wouldn't distort the
paper and were invisible

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.670
from the front of the object.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.760
And on the right you can
see an example of one

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.350
of the tears that's
been repaired.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.130
An adhesive from a previous tape

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.690
on the top edge has
also been reduced.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:03.200
And tape and adhesive is the
most common condition issue

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.830
conservators find when
working on VHP's collections,

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.040
and they can be removed
with a variety

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.970
of techniques including heat,
and that's what was done

00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:14.490
with the Mattison map,
an example of that kind

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:17.630
of treatment is in the top left.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.560
Or with substances
applied to the surface

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.860
that soften the adhesive,

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.330
and that technique is
shown on the right.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.550
Although time consuming,
when going well,

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.570
tape and adhesive
removal is, I think,

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:32.830
one of the most satisfying
conservation treatments.

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:39.210
So finally, the Mattison map
required filling in both paper

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.890
and cran [phonetic] losses.

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:44.220
The intern filled the paper
losses, such as the one shown

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.680
in the bottom left of the slide,
with a repair paper she created

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.730
to match the original.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.100
So both that insert, as well
as the one shown on the right,

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.400
were then further toned to
visually integrate the losses.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.270
And some of the materials
conservators use

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.630
for toning fills are
shown in the top left.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.490
The toning materials are all
either reversible or applied

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:10.990
in a reversible way, as
reversibility is a main tenant

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.590
of ethical conservation
practice.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.330
The reversibility is
important because if we decide

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.370
to remove any fills
in the future,

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:22.400
we can do so without
causing damage to the object.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.240
So again, here was the map
before conservation treatment

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.610
and then after it had
been physically stabilized

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.280
and the damage made less
visually distracting.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.560
And it can now be safely
handled by researchers

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.030
without causing further damage.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:45.090
So most items from the Veterans
History Project require less

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.310
extensive conservation
treatment.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.040
The goal of the next
two treatments was

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.850
to physically stabilize
these two diaries

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:57.430
of George Washington Pearcy to
prepare them for digitization.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:00.610
So the diaries were an
unfound papers while Pearcy was

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.220
imprisoned in Japanese
camps in the Philippines,

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.850
as Rachel described earlier.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:09.080
And I'll talk first about
the diary on the left.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.460
So this diary was written
on the backs of forms

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.140
from Davao Prison, including
forms recording the daily

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.300
weather at the prison and
prison hospital records.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.880
And you can see an
example of a hospital form

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.590
on the left indicating a case
of appendicitis at the camp.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:32.440
And Pearcy, like most prisoners
of war in Japanese camps,

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.000
suffered from numerous health
ailments while imprisoned,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.740
and included in this diary is a
list of his own health problems,

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.110
and you can see that on the
left, as well as a 12-page list

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:49.850
of property he lost as a
result of enemy bombing

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:53.130
in the Philippines,
which Rachel mentioned.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:57.830
And one page of this 12
pages is on the right.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:01.750
The list include each item's
cost, the date it was bought

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.860
and the condition when lost.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.700
So these diary pages were
generally in fair condition

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.700
with minor tears and
breaks along the edges.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.250
So conservation treatment
of the pages was limited

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:17.920
to stabilization, reinforcing
weak areas in mending tears.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:23.290
However, tucked into this
diary were five documents

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.640
that had been folded too
tightly to safely open

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.680
without further conservation
treatment.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.890
These letters needed to
be humidified to open.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.520
Humidification is a
technique conservators use

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.500
to reduces creases and folds,

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.160
as well as to safely unroll
tightly-rolled supports.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.320
So using a humidification
chamber,

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.980
an example of a chamber
is on the screen,

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.210
moisture is introduced
in a controlled manner

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.490
to relax the paper fibers.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.760
And then the paper is
flattened underweight.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.840
So humidification and flattening
revealed five letters,

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.750
one from Pearcy's sister and
the rest from his mother,

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.080
sent to Pearcy while imprisoned.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.320
The letters span the first half
of 1943, and over the months,

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.180
show growing anxiety as his
family had hardly heard from him

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.910
since the beginning of the war.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:19.120
On the backs of the letters,
Pearcy drew detailed images

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.810
such as this map of Davao
Prison as well as drawings

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.590
of other POW camps
and the Japanese ship

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.820
which transported the POWs.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.750
And although the drawings
are incredible precise,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:35.630
they are pretty difficult
to interpret,

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:40.000
given the translucency of the
paper and of the typewriting ink

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.700
on the front interferes
with the readability.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.760
So with more than a little
digital manipulation following

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.660
after-treatment photography,

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.400
the drawings are
now clearly legible.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.430
In this drawing, in particular,
shows a detailed layout

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.770
of Davao, including the main
compound, a hospital, cemetery,

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:04.510
and then the surrounding
landscape including the jungle

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.930
and several farming plots.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.780
So these images digitally
enhanced

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.660
by a conservator
will become part

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.080
of the diary's permanent record.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:18.550
So finally, after
humidification and flattening

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:21.660
of the inserted letters
and drawings and mending

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.330
of the diary pages, the metal
clasp holding the pages together

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.920
was removed prior
to digitization

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.480
as it concealed areas
of the pages.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.090
While the clasp was separated
from the diary, it was coated

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.810
with a resin to prevent
further corrosion of the metal

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:40.070
and to prevent the paper
from damaging interactions.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:46.290
And after digitalization, the
metal clasp was reattached,

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.620
preserving the diary
as it had been made.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.140
A custom enclosure was then made
to safely store both the diary

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.480
and the letters inside.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.010
So following the progression
from the top left of the slide,

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.570
the diary was placed
in a four-flap box,

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.650
and then the box closed
as in the top right,

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.940
which was then placed
in a larger four-flap

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.790
that could accommodate both
the diary and the letters,

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.160
which were larger than
the diary after treatment.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.560
So the housing adequately
protects both the diary

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.580
and the drawings while
maintaining their proximity.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:24.470
So another diary was written on
the backs of food can labels,

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:29.390
as Rachel showed, and
remnants of US military papers.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.800
The contents of this
diary are harrowing.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.430
As seen on the left, it includes
detailed accounts of prison life

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.980
and the sometimes brutal
treatment the Filipinos

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.880
and Americans endured
and memories of some

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.180
of the military campaigns

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:49.110
in which Pearcy participated
before being taken prisoner.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:53.600
And, as Rachel mentioned, the
diary also looks to the future.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.550
It includes a four-page
list, and the first page

00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:00.000
of this list is on the right,
of things Pearcy wanted to do

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.540
after returning home,

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.200
all of which he never
got the chance to pursue.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:09.590
So conservation treatment
of this diary was minimal.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:12.560
Folds along the edges were
relaxed and flattened.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.850
Weak creases in danger of
breaking were reinforced.

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.600
Tears were mended, and losses
bridged with repair paper.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.600
Like the other diary, the goal

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.710
of this treatment
was not aesthetic.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.140
Instead, stabilizing
the object for handling

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.440
and digitalization
was the focus,

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.680
and preserving the
evidence of its creation

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.140
and use was paramount.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:38.060
As a conservator, not really
expecting to encounter materials

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.690
like food can labels, but again,

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:43.800
working with VHP's collections
gives us an opportunity to work

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.550
on some really unique materials.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.590
Finally, I want to briefly
highlight another aspect

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:55.140
of conservation other than
treatment and housing.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.140
As Jennifer and I have
noted, examination

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:01.210
and photo documentation play
important roles in conservation.

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.830
Albert John Carpenter's
World War I diary was brought

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.820
to the conservation lab
for stabilization prior

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.260
to being displayed
in the first rotation

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.290
of the Library's exhibition,
Echoes of the Great War.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.020
As Rachel mentioned,
the diary was saved

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.120
from Hurricane Katrina, but
another point, at another point

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.720
in its history had
suffered from water damage,

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.340
which has caused some
of the inks to bleed.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.550
And the first page
of the diary shown

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:30.040
on the left is still legible,
despite the water damage,

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.650
as only the ruled lines
on the page have bled.

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.380
However, there were numerous
other pages that were illegible

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.180
or only partially legible

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.360
where the water had
caused more ink loss.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.410
As part of the conservation
process, the paper conservator

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:47.680
who treated the diary first
did a thorough examination

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.980
of the object.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.460
And one tool conservators
commonly use

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.680
for examination is
ultraviolet radiation.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.130
And here you can see a
conservator examining objects

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.130
with ultraviolet light,
which causes some materials

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.130
to become apparent that
can't normally be seen

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.700
in a visible light.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:10.720
So when the conservator used
this examination technique

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.190
on Carpenter's diary, the text
made illegible by water damage

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:18.540
in visible light on the left
became legible when examined

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.000
under ultraviolet
light on the right.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.070
So she then captured
this so that the images

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:27.240
with their now readable text
can provide more information

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.710
to researchers.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:33.720
And Jennifer and I have
detailed just a few aspects

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.960
of conservation that helped
preserve our veterans'

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.310
history today.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.860
I hope that you can see by
the examples that we've shown

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.210
and the knowledge and investment

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.820
that the Library's conservation
division lens preserving

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.840
VHP's collections.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.170
And when we preserve
our veterans' history,

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:51.820
we are increasing
our understanding

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.890
of our entire collective
shared history.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.870
So thank you, and
thank you especially

00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:00.510
to our VHP colleagues.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:08.500
[ Applause ]

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.340
&gt;&gt; Jacob Nadal: Thank
you everyone.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.090
We have a few minutes
now to take questions,

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.890
and then I believe after the
conservators will be here

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:25.920
and can talk you through a
display of some of the materials

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.800
from the Veterans History
Project that we have here

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.100
and have done some
treatment work on.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:39.030
&gt;&gt; So who decides the priority?

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:47.320
Is it based on the risk or
the condition or the value?

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.910
How do you decide that you
can't treat everything?

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.020
&gt;&gt; Jacob Nadal: I'm going
to call in a ringer.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.500
So a number of factors.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.940
This is all done in
consultation with a curator.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.290
&gt;&gt; Rachel Telford: Yeah, there
is not a simple answer to that.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.870
We have a long list of
items that need treatment

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.330
that is much longer

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:09.240
than a reservation directorate
can handle in any given year.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:14.090
So we kind of find out what they
have time for, and then look

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:19.960
at our priorities in terms
of a variety of factors.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.750
Sometimes the things that
come in recently are fresh

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:26.330
in our minds, and so, you know,
we have to go back and look

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:28.890
at the full list and,
you know, try to get some

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.740
of the older items
that we haven't looked

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.040
at in a little while.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.850
But yeah, we try to
work on the older items,

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:38.060
but also prioritize things that
would be more easily treated

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.820
if we get to them immediately.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.410
Things like recently
adhered tape

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:47.320
that will come off much more
easily if we do it now rather

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.220
than putting it on a
shelf for a few years.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.440
But year, there are
a variety of factors

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.550
that go into prioritizing.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:55.850
&gt;&gt; Jacob Nadal: Thank you.

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:57.150
One of the things
that we're conscious

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.470
of in the preservation
directorate is needing

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.900
to strike a balance of
what's critical either

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:07.080
because of a condition issue,
it's something that needs

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.180
to be taken care of
immediately, what's crucial

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:13.660
because of the Library's
current exhibition, digitation

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.690
and public service priorities,
so World War I materials

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:19.420
to accompany that
exhibition, get some focus.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.720
But then also having sort

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.180
of broad based collections
care strategies to slow

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:27.110
down for the aggregate
collections as much as possible,

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:28.410
the rate of damage or decay.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:31.110
So you saw a lot of boxes today

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:34.550
in the conservators'
presentations that ensures

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.280
that just during day-to-day
handling and storage

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.540
of the items, we're
minimizing risk.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.250
We work very closely with
the architect at the Capital

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.220
to make sure that we're
optimizing the storage

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.790
environments for collections.

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:47.400
So recognizing that any day

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.650
or year we can't work
with every piece.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.500
We try to have strategies that
embrace the whole collection.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.050
Yes.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.510
&gt;&gt; Are the photographs
we've been looking

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.360
at this afternoon part of
the conservation process,

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.730
or is it part of a larger
program to digitize the contents

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:08.560
of the Veterans History Project?

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.440
What's the difference with
the original and [inaudible]?

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.100
&gt;&gt; Jacob Nadal: Sure,
both good questions.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:16.540
So one question is about the
photographs you've seen in some

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.300
of these presentations and
whether they're done simply

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.590
for conservation
purposes or to document

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:24.180
and make the collections
more accessible.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.810
And then also where we draw
the line or how we balance

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.070
between preservation
and conservation.

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:32.260
I'll speak to the less
philosophical one first.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.320
And that is that conservation
as a matter of good practice

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.480
and professional ethics
involves prior documentation

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.340
of the condition of materials
so that we understand the state

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.360
in which they came
to the collections,

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.290
discussion with the curatorial
staff so that we make sure

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:51.690
to retain any important
artifactual

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:53.180
or physical evidence.

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.220
The discussion, for example,
of why you keep the tape

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:57.770
on one thing and not another,

00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.070
well that tape may
tell you something

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:00.780
about the material
history of that object.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.860
And we work that out closely
with the curatorial staff

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.630
to make sure that we
agree on a treatment plan.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:09.750
Some documentation is often
done during treatment,

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:12.840
if we need to do further
analysis or assessment.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.920
As a treatment progresses,
occasionally, I think,

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.860
I'm looking at my conservators,
there's a surprise.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.140
And further research
is conducted.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.640
And then of course, we
document the after state.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:29.610
That corpus of materials is
important to us as we use

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:31.810
that item in the future
or as we have questions

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:33.310
about it during research.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:36.520
It can also supplement
the record of that item

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.230
and become part of a plan
to make it more accessible.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:44.160
There is an overlap between
the digitization we have to do

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.590
for the technical
purpose of conservation

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.700
and broader Library
goals to make sure

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.720
that the collection
remains digitally available.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.910
At 167 million items, we're
very careful not to say anything

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:59.030
about comprehensively
digitizing the collections.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:02.380
But the Library is engaged
in a number of activities to,

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:04.990
within certain bans
of the collection,

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:07.720
provide as much access as
possible, and with certain types

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.740
of materials to provide
digital access.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.650
In some cases, that
depends on user preference,

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:16.310
exhibition priorities,
particular interpretative areas

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:17.830
that the Library is working in.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.270
But and our records may engage
with or supplement that,

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.410
especially where, as you've
seen in some of those images,

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:26.260
we are able through our
optical techniques to bring

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:29.490
to the fore aspects
of the object

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:33.000
that may not be clearly
visible to the human eye.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.260
As for preservation
and conservation,

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.230
we sometimes make them at
the kind of medical metaphor

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.780
that we have a public
health responsibility,

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.730
as well as a medical or surgical
responsibility, and we think

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:49.140
about preservation as sort
of the stewardship goal

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.440
of the Library that we
ant to provide good,

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.640
overarching care
to the collections.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.330
That can involve
corrective treatments

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.870
or stabilization treatments
that conservators execute.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.130
It can involve reformatting
items,

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.870
so one preservation
strategy is to take something

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:07.070
from obsolescent media and
move it to a new format.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:10.280
We've done this with Veterans
History Project, I think,

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.080
increasing amount as we
get 21st century materials.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.690
The letters and diaries
and photos

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:17.600
of soldiers now are
created on iPhones.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.020
They're sent as text
communications.

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.320
And that material needs

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.550
to be migrated off its
original digital carriers

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.290
and into new platforms.

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:30.960
We also do a great deal
in the preservation realm

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.130
for the environmental
control, emergency response.

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.060
We have a 24/7 team
that's available to respond

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.710
in case there's any emergency

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.150
that affects the
collections in the Library.

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:43.480
So, we think about preservation
as an all-encompassing strategy

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:46.950
and conservation as an important
element of the interventions

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:49.640
that we take with
those items over time.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.340
Great. Thank you.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.730
I think I'll hand it
over to our conservators.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:06.090
Or Karen if you'd
like to say at last.

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:07.840
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: In
conclusion, I just really want

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.480
to thank the preservation
director and Jake for all

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.300
that they do to help
us make sure

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:18.030
that these important veterans'
narratives remain accessible

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:19.330
into the future.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:22.100
And also, I want to thank
you all for coming today.

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:23.900
Take care.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:31.410
[ Applause ]

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:35.080
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
