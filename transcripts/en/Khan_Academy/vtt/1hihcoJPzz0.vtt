00:00:00.775 --> 00:00:05.036
- [Voiceover] If lowercase
x is a member of capital X,

00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:09.931
lowercase y is a member of set capital Y,

00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.626
and lowercase z is a
member of set capital Z,

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:15.898
which of the following
could have a value of 23?

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:17.717
So let's look at each of these.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.749
So x times y times z.

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.262
So you take something from this set,

00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:23.160
something from this set,
and something from that set,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.108
and multiply them together.

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:26.698
Well, if you did that, you're going

00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:29.077
to get a non-prime number.

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:32.003
Maybe you pick one from set X,

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:33.516
but then you're gonna have to pick a two

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:37.192
from set Y, or three or four,
and then a three, four, five.

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:41.821
So you're going to get things
like one times two times three

00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:44.696
or one times three times three.

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:46.100
No matter what, especially when you look

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.424
at these last two sets, you're
going to get the product

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:53.491
of at least two primes or you
might even take the product

00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:56.652
of a composite and a
prime or two composites.

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:59.335
So there's no way multiplying those three.

00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:01.432
Especially a member from these last sets,

00:01:01.432 --> 00:01:02.662
they don't have one in them.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.397
But you're going to get
a prime number like 23.

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:08.583
23's factors are clearly
only 23 and itself.

00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:10.762
It doesn't have a two or
three or four as a factor.

00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:12.542
It doesn't have a five as a factor.

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:14.980
And so, we could rule that out.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.392
Let's think about it, x plus y plus z.

00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:20.323
Can we make that equal to 23?

00:01:20.323 --> 00:01:22.467
So let's see, 23 is a lot
larger than these numbers.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:24.275
Let's see if we'd pick the largest number

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:27.270
in each of these sets and
see if we can get to 23.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.898
So three plus four plus five.

00:01:31.898 --> 00:01:34.293
These are the largest
members in each of those sets

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.217
and this still only gets us to 12.

00:01:36.217 --> 00:01:39.842
So there's no way we're going
to be able to get to 23.

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:43.772
Now at C, x plus y times z.

00:01:43.772 --> 00:01:46.030
x plus y times z.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.899
Well, I see a way of doing that.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.130
I see a way of doing that.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.143
x plus y times, let me do
this in a different color,

00:01:52.143 --> 00:01:53.919
x plus y times z.

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:54.931
What if...

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:56.954
Let's see, we can get to 20 by multiplying

00:01:56.954 --> 00:02:00.356
four times five and then you add a three.

00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:02.750
So this could be three plus

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.812
four times five.

00:02:05.812 --> 00:02:07.507
And so we'll go with that one.

00:02:07.507 --> 00:02:09.200
Which of the following
could have a value of 23?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.477
That one, and we can only pick one choice

00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:12.649
so we know we're already done.

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.036
But we could verify that we can't

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:15.822
get there with these other ones.

00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:19.255
So let's see, x squared plus
y squared plus z squared.

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:22.215
This one is tempting.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:23.202
It's tempting.

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:25.628
This is because you could
get numbers large enough.

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:28.345
But if you play around
enough, you would have trouble

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:33.051
finding a combination that has a 23.

00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.988
x times y plus z.

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:39.096
So, if you wanted to get
as large as possible,

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:40.748
you do three times four.

00:02:40.748 --> 00:02:44.927
So you could try three times
four and then plus some z.

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:48.609
But then in this case, this
is going to be 12 plus z.

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:49.502
12 plus z.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.093
z would have to be nine.

00:02:51.093 --> 00:02:52.452
You don't find a nine in this third set.

00:02:52.452 --> 00:02:53.737
There's clearly no nine so you could

00:02:53.737 --> 00:02:55.859
rule that one out as well.

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.744
So we go at C.
