remember this was 2007 so it was a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
remember this was 2007 so it was a
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.359
remember this was 2007 so it was a
pretty different world and in particular

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
pretty different world and in particular
 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.980
pretty different world and in particular
there was no Android and there was no

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
there was no Android and there was no
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.260

iPhone and the devices that were

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
iPhone and the devices that were
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.370
iPhone and the devices that were
available at the time were quite

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
available at the time were quite
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.109
available at the time were quite
primitive so you had a whole

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119
primitive so you had a whole
 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.609
primitive so you had a whole
fragmentation of technologies across

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
fragmentation of technologies across
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.740
fragmentation of technologies across
different device manufacturers so you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
different device manufacturers so you
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.020
different device manufacturers so you
would see j2me and one device maker you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
would see j2me and one device maker you
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.999
would see j2me and one device maker you
would see Symbian and then even within

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
would see Symbian and then even within
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.890
would see Symbian and then even within
Symbian there were two variants uiq and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
Symbian there were two variants uiq and
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410
Symbian there were two variants uiq and
s60 you'd have Palm OS you'd have

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
s60 you'd have Palm OS you'd have
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.530
s60 you'd have Palm OS you'd have
Windows Mobile and it was brutal as an

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.480
application developer tap to target all
of these different SDKs because each one

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
of these different SDKs because each one
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.340
of these different SDKs because each one
would have different capabilities and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
would have different capabilities and
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.050
would have different capabilities and
limitations and what you would

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
limitations and what you would
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.210
limitations and what you would
invariably find is that because they're

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
invariably find is that because they're
 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.469
invariably find is that because they're
so different you would have to hire

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
so different you would have to hire
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.030
so different you would have to hire

the application developer in mind so we
 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.240
the application developer in mind so we
spend a lot of time worrying and

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170
consistent style so if you're writing an
 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.199
consistent style so if you're writing an
application and you're interacting we'll

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209
application and you're interacting we'll
 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.940
application and you're interacting we'll
say with our camera to API s and then

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950
say with our camera to API s and then
 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.699
say with our camera to API s and then
you're talking to sensor manager to read

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709
you're talking to sensor manager to read
 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.229

API is for you even more important is

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410
API is for you even more important is
 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.620
API is for you even more important is
making sure that we have consistency of

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630

and so the way we do that is we have

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519
and so the way we do that is we have
 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.890
and so the way we do that is we have
something we call a compatibility

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900
something we call a compatibility
 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.440

incredibly stable and that's because as

00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:42.209
incredibly stable and that's because as
 

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:44.509
incredibly stable and that's because as
a developer you spend hours in the IDE

00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519
a developer you spend hours in the IDE
 

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:48.949
a developer you spend hours in the IDE
every day and so in 1.4 and 1.5 we felt

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959
every day and so in 1.4 and 1.5 we felt
 

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:50.689
every day and so in 1.4 and 1.5 we felt
like with those significant investments

00:10:50.689 --> 00:10:50.699
like with those significant investments
 

00:10:50.699 --> 00:10:52.699
like with those significant investments
well we'll continue to make investments

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:52.709
well we'll continue to make investments
 

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:53.929
well we'll continue to make investments
in stability and quality and every

00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:53.939
in stability and quality and every
 

00:10:53.939 --> 00:10:55.999
in stability and quality and every
release we had the foundation that we

00:10:55.999 --> 00:10:56.009
release we had the foundation that we
 

00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:58.009
release we had the foundation that we
wanted to start setting our sights on

00:10:58.009 --> 00:10:58.019
wanted to start setting our sights on
 

00:10:58.019 --> 00:10:59.809
wanted to start setting our sights on
the next set of improvements which are

00:10:59.809 --> 00:10:59.819
the next set of improvements which are
 

00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:04.309
the next set of improvements which are
really gonna focus on speed now when we

00:11:04.309 --> 00:11:04.319
really gonna focus on speed now when we
 

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:05.509
really gonna focus on speed now when we
took a look at the features that we had

00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519
took a look at the features that we had
 

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:07.819
took a look at the features that we had
planned for the next release we decided

00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:07.829
planned for the next release we decided
 

00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:09.530
planned for the next release we decided
it was so gigantic that we wanted to

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.540
it was so gigantic that we wanted to
 

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.030
it was so gigantic that we wanted to
renumber the release so you'll see the

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040
renumber the release so you'll see the
 

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.100
renumber the release so you'll see the
next version of Android studio will be

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.110
next version of Android studio will be
 

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:21.960
next version of Android studio will be
Android studio 2.0

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:21.970
 
 

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.940
 
now this is a gigantic release I'm gonna

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:24.950
now this is a gigantic release I'm gonna
 

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.260
now this is a gigantic release I'm gonna
walk you through some of the feature set

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:26.270
walk you through some of the feature set
 

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.930
walk you through some of the feature set
today when we talk to mobile developers

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:28.940
today when we talk to mobile developers
 

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.100
today when we talk to mobile developers
there was a few things we found

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.110
there was a few things we found
 

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.350
there was a few things we found
particularly that there were a number of

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360
particularly that there were a number of
 

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.420
particularly that there were a number of
opportunities to make the development

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:34.430
opportunities to make the development
 

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.630
opportunities to make the development
process faster smoother and better in

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:37.640
process faster smoother and better in
 

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.160
process faster smoother and better in
particular when we talked to mobile

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:39.170
particular when we talked to mobile
 

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.079
particular when we talked to mobile
developers like all developers we found

00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:41.089
developers like all developers we found
 

00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:42.730
developers like all developers we found
that you spend a ton of time we spend a

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:42.740
that you spend a ton of time we spend a
 

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.620
that you spend a ton of time we spend a
ton of time in the code build run cycle

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:44.630
ton of time in the code build run cycle
 

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.860
ton of time in the code build run cycle
writes where you spend all your time and

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:46.870
writes where you spend all your time and
 

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.030
writes where you spend all your time and
now if you think about what's like to

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040
now if you think about what's like to
 

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.010
now if you think about what's like to
code on HTML you make some code edits

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.020
code on HTML you make some code edits
 

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.449
code on HTML you make some code edits
and then you can refresh the page live

00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:52.459
and then you can refresh the page live
 

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:54.550
and then you can refresh the page live
right so it's super fast now how many of

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560
right so it's super fast now how many of
 

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.900
right so it's super fast now how many of
you guys would say it feels that way on

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:55.910
you guys would say it feels that way on
 

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:00.160
you guys would say it feels that way on
mobile we felt like it was just too slow

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.170
mobile we felt like it was just too slow
 

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.570
mobile we felt like it was just too slow
it's too heavy weight and you had to be

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:01.580
it's too heavy weight and you had to be
 

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.220
it's too heavy weight and you had to be
able to iterate better so I'm gonna talk

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.230
able to iterate better so I'm gonna talk
 

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.750
able to iterate better so I'm gonna talk
about a bunch of changes the first thing

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760
about a bunch of changes the first thing
 

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.090
about a bunch of changes the first thing
you'll see coming is we've massively

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.100
you'll see coming is we've massively
 

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.660
you'll see coming is we've massively
accelerated build speeds so in 2.0 full

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:10.670

it was so before your build was taking

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.100
it was so before your build was taking
 

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.400
it was so before your build was taking
you a minute now it's gonna be about 20

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:18.410
you a minute now it's gonna be about 20
 

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.220
you a minute now it's gonna be about 20
25 seconds

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.510
 
now I know a lot of you guys know too

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:28.520
now I know a lot of you guys know too
 

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.550
now I know a lot of you guys know too
after you do a full build then of course

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560
after you do a full build then of course
 

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.900
after you do a full build then of course
you do an incremental build that's when

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:31.910
you do an incremental build that's when
 

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.120
you do an incremental build that's when
you do the second set of changes build a

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.130
you do the second set of changes build a
 

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.550
you do the second set of changes build a
second time incremental build speeds are

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560
second time incremental build speeds are
 

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.680
second time incremental build speeds are
gonna be even faster than that they're

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:38.690
gonna be even faster than that they're
 

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.510
gonna be even faster than that they're
gonna be in the single-digit seconds and

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:40.520
gonna be in the single-digit seconds and
 

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.740
gonna be in the single-digit seconds and
I'm gonna come back to that and talk

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:41.750
I'm gonna come back to that and talk
 

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:49.570
I'm gonna come back to that and talk
about it more so the next thing I want

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:49.580
about it more so the next thing I want
 

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.850
about it more so the next thing I want
to talk about is the emulator in the

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:51.860
to talk about is the emulator in the
 

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.980
to talk about is the emulator in the
code build run cycle in order to iterate

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:53.990
code build run cycle in order to iterate
 

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.690
code build run cycle in order to iterate
you need to be able to quickly see how

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:55.700
you need to be able to quickly see how
 

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.100
you need to be able to quickly see how
the app looks as well

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:57.110
the app looks as well
 

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.200
the app looks as well
now a lot of you guys in the community

00:12:59.200 --> 00:12:59.210
now a lot of you guys in the community
 

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.610
now a lot of you guys in the community
talk to us about our emulators and

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:00.620
talk to us about our emulators and
 

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.770
talk to us about our emulators and
here's what you said they are not fast

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:02.780
here's what you said they are not fast
 

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.750
here's what you said they are not fast
enough they are not stable enough we

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760
enough they are not stable enough we
 

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.070
enough they are not stable enough we
listen to you guys and the truth was

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:06.080
listen to you guys and the truth was
 

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.860
listen to you guys and the truth was
you're right so we've made massive

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:08.870
you're right so we've made massive
 

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.250
you're right so we've made massive
improvements here in 2.0 we have made

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:12.260
improvements here in 2.0 we have made
 

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.350
improvements here in 2.0 we have made
major changes let me just start by

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360
major changes let me just start by
 

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.850
major changes let me just start by
talking about speed because i fairly

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:15.860
talking about speed because i fairly
 

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.190
talking about speed because i fairly
feel like it's the most important in

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:18.200
feel like it's the most important in
 

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.270
feel like it's the most important in
Toronto one of the first things you'll

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:22.280
Toronto one of the first things you'll
 

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.400
Toronto one of the first things you'll
find is that they are significantly

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:24.410
find is that they are significantly
 

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.520
find is that they are significantly
faster we have a DB push speeds that are

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:27.530
faster we have a DB push speeds that are
 

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.800
faster we have a DB push speeds that are
five times faster for the emulator than

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:29.810
five times faster for the emulator than
 

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.390
five times faster for the emulator than
they are on a physical device we've

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:31.400
they are on a physical device we've
 

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.460
they are on a physical device we've
massively accelerated i/o we've

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:33.470
massively accelerated i/o we've
 

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.570
massively accelerated i/o we've
massively accelerated CPU so we're also

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:37.580
massively accelerated CPU so we're also
 

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.760
massively accelerated CPU so we're also
adding SMP support to take advantage of

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:39.770
adding SMP support to take advantage of
 

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.280
adding SMP support to take advantage of
hosts multi-core architecture you will

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:42.290
hosts multi-core architecture you will
 

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.260
hosts multi-core architecture you will
find overall that the emulators are

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:44.270
find overall that the emulators are
 

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.190
find overall that the emulators are
massively faster than they were before

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:47.200
massively faster than they were before
 

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.590
massively faster than they were before
we would also say the emulators continue

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600
we would also say the emulators continue
 

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.540
we would also say the emulators continue

in addition to significant speed

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:04.760
in addition to significant speed
 

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.240
in addition to significant speed
improvements we also completely rewrote

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.250
improvements we also completely rewrote

you guys in the audience asked us for
the ability to grab the edge of the

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.010
the ability to grab the edge of the
 

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.010
the ability to grab the edge of the
emulator and pull it down and back to

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:33.020
emulator and pull it down and back to
 

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.650
emulator and pull it down and back to
resize it and you will also find that

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:38.660
 
 

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.080

so that's not all you're gonna find
 

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.740
so that's not all you're gonna find
you'll have the ability to emulate GPS

like you know me walking over to the
 

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.470
like you know me walking over to the
keynote today you can emulate calls you

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480
keynote today you can emulate calls you
 

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.780
keynote today you can emulate calls you
can emulate texts you can emulate camera

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:56.790
can emulate texts you can emulate camera
 

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.820
can emulate texts you can emulate camera
you can mr8 emulate battery state so you

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:58.830
you can mr8 emulate battery state so you
 

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.079
you can mr8 emulate battery state so you
want to see how your apps gonna perform

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:00.089
want to see how your apps gonna perform
 

00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:02.480

when the battery's full or really drain

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:02.490
when the battery's full or really drain
 

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.390
when the battery's full or really drain
so overall a very very significant set

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:05.400
so overall a very very significant set
 

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.519
so overall a very very significant set
of changes in the emulator again the

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:07.529
of changes in the emulator again the
 

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:09.530
of changes in the emulator again the
reason why we felt this was so critical

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540
reason why we felt this was so critical
 

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.750
reason why we felt this was so critical
is you have to be able to iterate in

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760
is you have to be able to iterate in
 

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.610
is you have to be able to iterate in
your app and fast and every minute that

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620
your app and fast and every minute that
 

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.630
your app and fast and every minute that
you're sitting around you're waiting for

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:14.640
you're sitting around you're waiting for
 

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.280
you're sitting around you're waiting for
builds you're waiting for run speed

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:16.290
builds you're waiting for run speed
 

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.250
builds you're waiting for run speed
that's a minute wasted so with 2.0 the

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:19.260
that's a minute wasted so with 2.0 the
 

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.079
that's a minute wasted so with 2.0 the

constantly in the flow while you're
 

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.890
constantly in the flow while you're
coding so you can iterate and try things

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:24.900
coding so you can iterate and try things
 

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.650

out on a single device now one of the

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660
out on a single device now one of the
 

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.019
out on a single device now one of the
things Dave talked about is we have 1.4

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:30.029
things Dave talked about is we have 1.4
 

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:32.720
things Dave talked about is we have 1.4
billion active users on Android and so

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:32.730
billion active users on Android and so
 

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.730
billion active users on Android and so
that means there's also a ton of devices

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740
that means there's also a ton of devices
 

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.260
that means there's also a ton of devices
out there and that was another reason

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:36.270
out there and that was another reason
 

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.610
out there and that was another reason
why we felt the emulator was so

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620
why we felt the emulator was so
 

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.290
why we felt the emulator was so
important so you could test not just on

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300
important so you could test not just on
 

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.090
important so you could test not just on
the device that you have next to you but

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100
the device that you have next to you but
 

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.610
the device that you have next to you but
across a multitude of devices one of the

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620
across a multitude of devices one of the
 

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.440
across a multitude of devices one of the
things that we hear from developers

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:45.450
things that we hear from developers
 

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.450
things that we hear from developers
everywhere is that the emulator is very

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:47.460
everywhere is that the emulator is very
 

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.280
everywhere is that the emulator is very
important but physical devices are

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:49.290
important but physical devices are
 

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.840
important but physical devices are
important as well and that's why we have

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:50.850
important as well and that's why we have
 

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.120
important as well and that's why we have
decided to have world-class support for

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.130
decided to have world-class support for
 

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.000
decided to have world-class support for
both so let me talk about some more

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.010
both so let me talk about some more
 

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.760
both so let me talk about some more
changes Android also has a very

00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:58.770
changes Android also has a very
 

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.370
changes Android also has a very
important set of developers doing what I

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380
important set of developers doing what I

would call graphics intensive apps so

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660
would call graphics intensive apps so
 

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.140
would call graphics intensive apps so
this would be things like maps games

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:06.150
this would be things like maps games
 

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.420
this would be things like maps games
video things of this nature we do a lot

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.430
video things of this nature we do a lot
 

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.180
video things of this nature we do a lot
of it at Google as well and so that's

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.190
of it at Google as well and so that's
 

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.280
of it at Google as well and so that's

key asks from the community one of the

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:54.330
key asks from the community one of the
 

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.760
key asks from the community one of the
things you guys asked us for is to be

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:55.770
things you guys asked us for is to be
 

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.320
things you guys asked us for is to be
able to run all test types together now

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:57.330
able to run all test types together now
 

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.760
able to run all test types together now
as you guys know in Android studio you

00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:58.770
as you guys know in Android studio you
 

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.890
as you guys know in Android studio you
can have two test types unit tests and

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900
can have two test types unit tests and
 

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.320
can have two test types unit tests and
Android tests and now you can have both

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:03.330
Android tests and now you can have both
 

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.600
Android tests and now you can have both
of those active at the same time one of

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:05.610
of those active at the same time one of
 

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:11.590
of those active at the same time one of
the things that means

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600
 
 

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.940
 
so one of the things that means to is

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:13.950
so one of the things that means to is
 

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.500
so one of the things that means to is
you can now refactor seamlessly across

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:15.510
you can now refactor seamlessly across
 

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.880
you can now refactor seamlessly across
your code so you can make a change in

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:16.890
your code so you can make a change in
 

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.440
your code so you can make a change in
app code refactor it it will go across

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:18.450
app code refactor it it will go across
 

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:25.040
app code refactor it it will go across
all test types all right so I've talked

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.050
all test types all right so I've talked
 

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.230
all test types all right so I've talked
so far about coding talked about

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240
so far about coding talked about
 

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.120
so far about coding talked about
building I've talked about IntelliJ and

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.130
building I've talked about IntelliJ and
 

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.410
building I've talked about IntelliJ and
everything that we got from them we've

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:30.420
everything that we got from them we've
 

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.020
everything that we got from them we've
talked about debugging testing I want to

deployment and making your app
 

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.630
deployment and making your app
discoverable one of the things that we

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640
discoverable one of the things that we
 

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.520
discoverable one of the things that we
did in Toronto was work very closely

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:40.530
did in Toronto was work very closely
 

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.590
did in Toronto was work very closely
with the Google search team they have a

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600
with the Google search team they have a
 

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.600
with the Google search team they have a
wonderful feature called deep linking

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:44.610
wonderful feature called deep linking
 

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.030
wonderful feature called deep linking
which allows you to expose your app so

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.040
which allows you to expose your app so
 

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.990
which allows you to expose your app so
that it can be found in the Google

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000
that it can be found in the Google
 

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.150
that it can be found in the Google
search but one of the key questions is

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160
search but one of the key questions is
 

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.130
search but one of the key questions is
ok how do I get this set up in my app so

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.140
ok how do I get this set up in my app so
 

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.110
ok how do I get this set up in my app so
we've added support for this in Android

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120
we've added support for this in Android
 

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.210
we've added support for this in Android
studio 2.0 the first thing you'll find

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220
studio 2.0 the first thing you'll find
 

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.370
studio 2.0 the first thing you'll find
is something called intention actions so

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380
is something called intention actions so
 

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.020
is something called intention actions so
what this means is you can go into

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:00.030
what this means is you can go into
 

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.150
what this means is you can go into
Android studio and as you're in your

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160
Android studio and as you're in your
 

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.310
Android studio and as you're in your
code it will suggest to you in line

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320
code it will suggest to you in line
 

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.020
code it will suggest to you in line
where you need to put code and actually

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:06.030
where you need to put code and actually
 

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.550
where you need to put code and actually
expand and show you how to configure it

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:07.560
expand and show you how to configure it
 

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.340
expand and show you how to configure it
now the second thing we have is static

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:10.350
now the second thing we have is static
 

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.500
now the second thing we have is static
analysis so I'm sure you know none of

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:12.510
analysis so I'm sure you know none of
 

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.030
analysis so I'm sure you know none of
you guys in the audience much like Dave

Burke have ever made coding mistakes but

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:15.690
Burke have ever made coding mistakes but
 

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.630
Burke have ever made coding mistakes but
I will be honest and say I make them

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640
I will be honest and say I make them
 

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.780
I will be honest and say I make them
frequently so the static analysis we

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:20.790
frequently so the static analysis we
 

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.640
frequently so the static analysis we
have in 2.0 will check and make sure

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:22.650
have in 2.0 will check and make sure
 

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.250
have in 2.0 will check and make sure
that your deep links are configured

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260
that your deep links are configured

that your deep links are configured
correctly the third thing we've added is

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240
correctly the third thing we've added is
 

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.030
correctly the third thing we've added is
real-time testing so you can actually

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.040
real-time testing so you can actually
 

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.700
real-time testing so you can actually
see whether Google can index and render

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:34.710
see whether Google can index and render
 

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:42.900
see whether Google can index and render
the app pages correctly

better time than now to switch to
 

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.880
better time than now to switch to
Android studio it is a massive speed

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:01.890
Android studio it is a massive speed
 

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.290
Android studio it is a massive speed
improvement and we believe it will

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:03.300
improvement and we believe it will
 

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.270
improvement and we believe it will
significantly accelerate your

significantly accelerate your
development a couple other things we'd

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620
development a couple other things we'd
 

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.580
development a couple other things we'd
say Android studio remains open source

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:10.590

thing we had wanted to talk about while
 

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.860
thing we had wanted to talk about while
we were here with development I feel

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:18.870
we were here with development I feel
 

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.540
we were here with development I feel
like one of the most amazing feelings is

your coding is this timelessness where
 

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.020
your coding is this timelessness where
you're incredibly productive and so it

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:27.030
you're incredibly productive and so it
 

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.330
you're incredibly productive and so it
was in the interest of enabling

was in the interest of enabling
 

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.040
was in the interest of enabling
developers to code like that that we

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.050
developers to code like that that we
 

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.170

then we'll restart the activity but
 

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.460
then we'll restart the activity but
before I do that let me just get the app

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:44.470
before I do that let me just get the app
 

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.980
before I do that let me just get the app
running so I'm gonna go control R so the

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:46.990
running so I'm gonna go control R so the

you know takes takes a bit of time

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580
you know takes takes a bit of time
 

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.590
you know takes takes a bit of time
previously in an old world you - every

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600
previously in an old world you - every
 

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.790
previously in an old world you - every
time you made a code change you have to

00:23:59.790 --> 00:23:59.800
time you made a code change you have to
 

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.500
time you made a code change you have to
go through that process so here's how it

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:01.510
go through that process so here's how it
 

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.810
go through that process so here's how it
looks with Android studio 2.0 so let's

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:03.820
looks with Android studio 2.0 so let's
 

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.820
looks with Android studio 2.0 so let's
say I want to change the background of

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:05.830
say I want to change the background of
 

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.530
say I want to change the background of
the setting screen so I go to my XML

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:07.540
the setting screen so I go to my XML
 

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.290
the setting screen so I go to my XML
layout and I want to add a background so

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:10.300
layout and I want to add a background so
 

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.730
layout and I want to add a background so
I've got a background bitmaps I want to

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:11.740
I've got a background bitmaps I want to
 

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.680
I've got a background bitmaps I want to
add here so I can just go Android

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:13.690
add here so I can just go Android
 

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:18.630
add here so I can just go Android
background like so if I can type like

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640
background like so if I can type like
 

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.400
background like so if I can type like
that and then I have a drawable setup

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.410
that and then I have a drawable setup
 

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.960
that and then I have a drawable setup
this is a preview of

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:21.970
this is a preview of
 

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.340
this is a preview of
of Android see they oh okay all right

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:26.350
of Android see they oh okay all right
 

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.960
of Android see they oh okay all right
all right so we're all good

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:27.970
all right so we're all good
 

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.300
all right so we're all good
okay so what's cool here is that to run

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:30.310
okay so what's cool here is that to run
 

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.190
okay so what's cool here is that to run
it I just go control our it'll send up

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200
it I just go control our it'll send up
 

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.870
it I just go control our it'll send up
the new okay it's gonna restart because

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880
the new okay it's gonna restart because
 

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.820
the new okay it's gonna restart because
I I'd busted it so we'll change this in

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:35.830
I I'd busted it so we'll change this in
 

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.440
I I'd busted it so we'll change this in
a second so let me let me let the start

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.450
a second so let me let me let the start
 

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.470
a second so let me let me let the start
again here okay so you can see normally

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480
again here okay so you can see normally
 

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.490
again here okay so you can see normally
what would happen there is that we just

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:41.500
what would happen there is that we just
 

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.140
what would happen there is that we just
we start the activity which would not

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.150
we start the activity which would not
 

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.240
we start the activity which would not
have a cause a reinstall so it's the

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:45.250
have a cause a reinstall so it's the
 

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.380
have a cause a reinstall so it's the
same thing that happens when you rotate

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:46.390
same thing that happens when you rotate
 

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.040
same thing that happens when you rotate
the screen

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.050
the screen
 

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.630
the screen
I'll change another resource this time I

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640
I'll change another resource this time I
 

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.860
I'll change another resource this time I
won't mess it up so you can actually see

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:49.870
won't mess it up so you can actually see
 

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.200
won't mess it up so you can actually see
it work so there's a you can see it says

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.210
it work so there's a you can see it says
 

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.760
it work so there's a you can see it says
new button there I can change the string

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:53.770
new button there I can change the string
 

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.340
new button there I can change the string
and I can say new game like this dog

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:56.350
and I can say new game like this dog
 

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.650
and I can say new game like this dog
control are okay you know what I'm gonna

00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:58.660
control are okay you know what I'm gonna
 

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.850
control are okay you know what I'm gonna
I'm gonna reset this on one of the one

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:02.860
I'm gonna reset this on one of the one
 

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.650
I'm gonna reset this on one of the one
of the advantages of a live stream by

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:04.660
of the advantages of a live stream by
 

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.000
of the advantages of a live stream by
the way is you can edit it after the

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.010
the way is you can edit it after the
 

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.850
the way is you can edit it after the
fact and so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:08.860
fact and so what I'm gonna do is I'm
 

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.880
fact and so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna uninstall this app did it okay

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:11.890
gonna uninstall this app did it okay
 

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.150
gonna uninstall this app did it okay
okay so I'm showing you what real

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:15.160
okay so I'm showing you what real
 

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.420
okay so I'm showing you what real
development looks like this is good so

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:18.430
development looks like this is good so
 

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:19.920
development looks like this is good so
I'll leave you I'll leave you game there

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:19.930
I'll leave you I'll leave you game there
 

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.410
I'll leave you I'll leave you game there
right and I'll go back here and I will

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:22.420
right and I'll go back here and I will
 

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.820
right and I'll go back here and I will
remove this line here like that so and

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:26.830
remove this line here like that so and
 

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:30.210
remove this line here like that so and
now I will do a normal building compile

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:30.220
now I will do a normal building compile
 

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.560
now I will do a normal building compile
so it's gonna build a good pile and it's

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:31.570
so it's gonna build a good pile and it's
 

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.030
so it's gonna build a good pile and it's
gonna install it let's take a couple of

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:33.040
gonna install it let's take a couple of
 

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.040
gonna install it let's take a couple of
seconds okay now it's running so if I

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.050
seconds okay now it's running so if I
 

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.340
seconds okay now it's running so if I
add this line back in here like so and

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:41.350
add this line back in here like so and
 

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.760
add this line back in here like so and
then I just do my control are what it'll

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:44.770
then I just do my control are what it'll
 

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.770
then I just do my control are what it'll
do is we'll just restart the activity so

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:46.780
do is we'll just restart the activity so
 

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.270
do is we'll just restart the activity so
you'll see a little flicker and I just

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:48.280
you'll see a little flicker and I just
 

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:54.280
you'll see a little flicker and I just
restarts like that okay

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:54.290
 
 

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.980
 
now looks more interesting so we call

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:56.990
now looks more interesting so we call
 

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.540
now looks more interesting so we call
that a warm swap right so it's the same

00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:58.550
that a warm swap right so it's the same
 

00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.740
that a warm swap right so it's the same
things rotating the screen much more

00:25:59.740 --> 00:25:59.750
things rotating the screen much more
 

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.230
things rotating the screen much more
interesting is when you want to do what

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240
interesting is when you want to do what
 

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.510
interesting is when you want to do what
we call a hot swap and the way this

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520
we call a hot swap and the way this
 

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.070
we call a hot swap and the way this
works is that we're instrumenting the

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080
works is that we're instrumenting the
 

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.960
works is that we're instrumenting the
code and every time you compile we run

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:07.970
code and every time you compile we run
 

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.760
code and every time you compile we run
an analyzer and see if we can hot swap

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:09.770
an analyzer and see if we can hot swap
 

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.340
an analyzer and see if we can hot swap
out the code at runtime and so we can

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:12.350
out the code at runtime and so we can
 

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.200
out the code at runtime and so we can
change method implementations of a class

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.210
change method implementations of a class
 

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.360
change method implementations of a class
on the fly so if I go into the chess

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:16.370
on the fly so if I go into the chess
 

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.930
on the fly so if I go into the chess
activity up here and so we have this on

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:19.940
activity up here and so we have this on
 

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.400
activity up here and so we have this on
draw frame call so this is getting call

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:21.410
draw frame call so this is getting call
 

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.620
draw frame call so this is getting call
sixty times a second to update this

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:23.630
sixty times a second to update this
 

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:26.260
sixty times a second to update this
screen now if I change something like

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:26.270
screen now if I change something like
 

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.390
screen now if I change something like
let's change these values here and I

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400
let's change these values here and I
 

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.370
let's change these values here and I
change this value here so what this will

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:30.380
change this value here so what this will
 

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.470
change this value here so what this will
do is it will turn the chess board into

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480
do is it will turn the chess board into
 

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.910
do is it will turn the chess board into
a 3d animated scene so I just go ctrl R

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:36.920
a 3d animated scene so I just go ctrl R
 

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.770
a 3d animated scene so I just go ctrl R
the code dynamically changes and then

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:38.780
the code dynamically changes and then
 

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.390
the code dynamically changes and then
boom instantly it just updates

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400
boom instantly it just updates
 

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:46.600
boom instantly it just updates
[Applause]

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:46.610
[Applause]
 

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.509
[Applause]
so it turns out that I work in a company

00:26:49.509 --> 00:26:49.519
so it turns out that I work in a company
 

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:51.190
so it turns out that I work in a company
full of overachievers who were very good

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200
full of overachievers who were very good
 

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.710
full of overachievers who were very good
at chess and I need an advantage so what

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720
at chess and I need an advantage so what
 

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.110
at chess and I need an advantage so what
I'm gonna do is try to find an advantage

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120
I'm gonna do is try to find an advantage
 

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.909
I'm gonna do is try to find an advantage
now the first thing anybody who watches

00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919
now the first thing anybody who watches
 

00:26:57.919 --> 00:26:59.320
now the first thing anybody who watches
rugby and everything the All Blacks play

00:26:59.320 --> 00:26:59.330
rugby and everything the All Blacks play
 

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.210
rugby and everything the All Blacks play
from New Zealand will know the trick to

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:01.220
from New Zealand will know the trick to
 

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.830
from New Zealand will know the trick to
winning is to intimidate your opponent

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840
winning is to intimidate your opponent
 

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.259
winning is to intimidate your opponent
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and

00:27:05.259 --> 00:27:05.269
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and
 

00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:07.149
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and
try and make my chess pieces larger so I

00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159
try and make my chess pieces larger so I
 

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:10.210
try and make my chess pieces larger so I
get the vertex mesh for my piece my

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:10.220
get the vertex mesh for my piece my
 

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.519
get the vertex mesh for my piece my
pieces so I gotta be let's see

00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:12.529
pieces so I gotta be let's see
 

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:15.610
pieces so I gotta be let's see
player 1 I suppose to do that boom and

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:15.620
player 1 I suppose to do that boom and
 

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.710
player 1 I suppose to do that boom and
then what I'll do is I'll it'll write

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720
then what I'll do is I'll it'll write
 

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.320
then what I'll do is I'll it'll write
over each of my pieces like this some

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:20.330
over each of my pieces like this some
 

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.060
over each of my pieces like this some
people on size get all the chess pieces

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:22.070
people on size get all the chess pieces
 

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.190
people on size get all the chess pieces
like that and then what we'll do is

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200
like that and then what we'll do is
 

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.860
like that and then what we'll do is
we'll get each of my pieces one by one

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:26.870
we'll get each of my pieces one by one
 

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.629
we'll get each of my pieces one by one
the index I and then I have a

00:27:28.629 --> 00:27:28.639
the index I and then I have a
 

00:27:28.639 --> 00:27:30.580
the index I and then I have a
convenience method to set the scale and

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:30.590
convenience method to set the scale and
 

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.129
convenience method to set the scale and
then I'll set that to 0.75 seems like a

00:27:33.129 --> 00:27:33.139
then I'll set that to 0.75 seems like a
 

00:27:33.139 --> 00:27:35.620
then I'll set that to 0.75 seems like a
good intimidation factor like that and

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:35.630
good intimidation factor like that and
 

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.049
good intimidation factor like that and
then control or boom and the gold pieces

00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:38.059
then control or boom and the gold pieces
 

00:27:38.059 --> 00:27:41.770
then control or boom and the gold pieces
jump up like that

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:41.780
 
 

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.060
 
[Applause]

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.070
[Applause]
 

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.589
[Applause]
so also it's got an extra advantage I

00:27:47.589 --> 00:27:47.599
so also it's got an extra advantage I
 

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:48.639
so also it's got an extra advantage I
think I'll make my opponents a little

00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:48.649
think I'll make my opponents a little
 

00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:51.070
think I'll make my opponents a little
smaller so I can just go come on D like

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080
smaller so I can just go come on D like
 

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.330
smaller so I can just go come on D like
this by the way if you have not started

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:52.340
this by the way if you have not started
 

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.009
this by the way if you have not started
using studio the autocomplete and this

00:27:54.009 --> 00:27:54.019
using studio the autocomplete and this
 

00:27:54.019 --> 00:27:56.379
using studio the autocomplete and this
idea is kind of amazing like watch this

00:27:56.379 --> 00:27:56.389
idea is kind of amazing like watch this
 

00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:59.080
idea is kind of amazing like watch this
boom boom is super fast so let's make my

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.090
boom boom is super fast so let's make my
 

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:02.019
boom boom is super fast so let's make my
opponents 0.75 and of course that's

00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:02.029
opponents 0.75 and of course that's
 

00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:04.930
opponents 0.75 and of course that's
player to control our boom a little

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:04.940
player to control our boom a little
 

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.859
player to control our boom a little
black guys get small alright now it

00:28:08.859 --> 00:28:08.869
black guys get small alright now it
 

00:28:08.869 --> 00:28:10.509
black guys get small alright now it
turns eyes is the squirrelly little

00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519
turns eyes is the squirrelly little
 

00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:12.879
turns eyes is the squirrelly little
opponents won't be easily intimidated I

00:28:12.879 --> 00:28:12.889
opponents won't be easily intimidated I
 

00:28:12.889 --> 00:28:14.859
opponents won't be easily intimidated I
need to have a more meaningful material

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:14.869
need to have a more meaningful material
 

00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:17.349
need to have a more meaningful material
advantage so what I'm gonna do is get my

00:28:17.349 --> 00:28:17.359
advantage so what I'm gonna do is get my
 

00:28:17.359 --> 00:28:19.869
advantage so what I'm gonna do is get my
pieces again so I'm player 1 and then

00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:19.879
pieces again so I'm player 1 and then
 

00:28:19.879 --> 00:28:22.930
pieces again so I'm player 1 and then
I'm gonna gonna set whoops a little typo

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:22.940
I'm gonna gonna set whoops a little typo
 

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.499
I'm gonna gonna set whoops a little typo
so get get the pieces so I and then what

00:28:26.499 --> 00:28:26.509
so get get the pieces so I and then what
 

00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:28.719
so get get the pieces so I and then what
I'm gonna do is set the mesh and then

00:28:28.719 --> 00:28:28.729
I'm gonna do is set the mesh and then
 

00:28:28.729 --> 00:28:29.619
I'm gonna do is set the mesh and then
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get the

00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:29.629
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get the
 

00:28:29.629 --> 00:28:32.619
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get the
vertex mesh for ask more powerful pieces

00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:32.629
vertex mesh for ask more powerful pieces
 

00:28:32.629 --> 00:28:35.259
vertex mesh for ask more powerful pieces
so I guess get mesh and then queen would

00:28:35.259 --> 00:28:35.269
so I guess get mesh and then queen would
 

00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:38.049
