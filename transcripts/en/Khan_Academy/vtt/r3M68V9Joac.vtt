00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
- [Voiceover] So we have
the expression 17 4/9

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.450
minus 12 and 2/3.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.830
And I encourage to pause the video

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.905
and see if you can
figure out what this is.

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:11.660
So now let's work through it.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.655
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to rewrite

00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:15.095
these mixed numbers.

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:19.675
So I'm going to write this as 17 and 4/9

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.695
minus 12 and 2/3.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.960
I'm going to write the
12 right under the 17,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.810
and I'm going to write the
2/3 right under the 4/9.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.555
Let me make it very clear,
we are subtracting 12 and 2/3

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:32.685
from 17 and 4/9.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:33.985
So the first thing that
we might want to do

00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:35.385
is we could look at the fraction parts

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:37.950
and we might want to start
subtracting until we see,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.555
look, we have different denominators here.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:41.850
We have ninths and we have thirds.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.150
So the first thing we'd want to do

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.950
is let's get to a common denominator,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.690
and a good common denominator
would be the least

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.885
common multiple of nine and three.

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:50.980
Well, what's that going to be?

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.690
Well to think about that,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.315
I like to start with
a larger number, nine.

00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:57.595
And say, well, is that divisible by three?

00:00:57.595 --> 00:00:59.215
Well, yes, it is divisible by three.

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:00.715
It is divisible by the other denominator,

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:02.755
so this actually is the
least common multiple.

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:04.975
If it wasn't, I would keep
taking higher and higher

00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:05.990
multiples of 9.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.730
I would go to 18 and
then I would go to 27,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.155
and I would keep going until I found one

00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:12.125
that's divisible by three.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:13.135
But I didn't have to do that

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:15.090
because nine is divisible by three.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.415
So I can rewrite both
of these fraction parts

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:19.830
in terms of ninths.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.110
Now the one on top already is
written in terms of ninths,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.640
so I can just rewrite that.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.040
17 and 4/9.

00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:30.555
And the one on the
bottom, I can write as 12

00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:33.510
and some number of ninths.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.585
So 2/3 is how many ninths?

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:39.875
Well, to go from thirds to ninths

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:44.150
I had to multiply by three,
had to multiply by three,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.955
so the numerator, I need to
multiply by three as well.

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:49.775
Two times three is six.

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:52.790
2/3 is the same thing as 6/9.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.090
And now I can try to subtract.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.695
But even here, when I try to subtract,

00:01:57.695 --> 00:01:59.630
I have a larger fraction down here

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.325
that I'm trying to subtract
from a smaller one.

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:04.325
I have 4/9 minus 6/9.

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:05.495
So what can I do?

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:08.330
Well, be answer is I can regroup.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.095
I can take a whole from the 17.

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:13.790
Let me do that.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.325
So if I take a whole from the 17,

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:19.520
that's going to become 16,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.710
and then that whole that I just took from,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.660
I guess you could say
the whole number place,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.325
I can add it to the fraction.

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:28.785
Well, a whole is just going to be 9/9.

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:30.750
So all I did was I regrouped here.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.150
I took 9/9 from 17.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.895
9/9 is one, so I took 9/9
from 17, I'm left with 16,

00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:38.690
and then I regrouped them and I added them

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.450
to the fractions place, as
one way to think about it.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.760
Well, what's 4/9 plus 9/9?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.220
Well, that's going to be 13/9.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.590
So this right over here is 13/9.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.285
13/9.

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:53.980
It's a very strange way to
write it, but 17 and 4/9

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.690
is the same thing as 16
and 13/9, because notice,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.295
this is greater than one.

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:02.855
This is the same thing as one and 4/9.

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:06.310
One and 4/9 plus 16 is
going to be 17 and 4/9.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.930
Now why did I do all of this?

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.425
Well 13/9 is larger than
6/9, so I can subtract.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:16.850
What's 13/9 minus 6/9 going to be?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.415
Well, 13 of something,
in this case, ninths,

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:23.780
minus six of that same
something is going to be 7/9.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.015
Seven, let me write
that in a neutral color.

00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:30.695
So that's going to be 7/9.

00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:34.325
13/9 minus 6/9 is 7/9.

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:35.955
And then I can look over
in the whole number place.

00:03:35.955 --> 00:03:37.785
All I have left a 16 here.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:41.295
16 minus 12 is four, and I'm done.

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:44.395
17 and 4/9 minus 12 and 2/3

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:49.395
is equal to four and 7/9.
