00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.660
What we're going to
explore in this video

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:09.800
are polyhedra, which is just
the plural of a polyhedron.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.200
And a polyhedron is a
three-dimensional shape

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.710
that has flat surfaces
and straight edges.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.133
So, for example, a
cube is a polyhedron.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:31.050
All the surfaces are flat, and
all of the edges are straight.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.110
So this right over
here is a polyhedron.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.590
Once again, polyhedra is plural.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.820
Polyhedron is when
you have one of them.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.320
This is a polyhedron.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.790
A rectangular pyramid
is a polyhedron.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.970
So let me draw that.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.070
I'll make this one a little
bit more transparent.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.740
Let me do this in a
different color just for fun.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.600
I'll make it a magenta
rectangular pyramid.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.490
So once again, here I
have one flat surface.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.250
And then I'm going to have
four triangular flat surfaces.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.634
So this right over here, this
is a rectangular pyramid.

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:06.480
Now, it clearly
looks like a pyramid.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.170
Why is it called a
rectangular pyramid?

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.380
Because the base right
over here is a rectangle.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.150
So these are just a few
examples of polyhedra.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.734
Now, what I want to think
about are nets of polyhedra.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:22.900
And actually, let me draw
and make this transparent,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.630
too, so we get full appreciation
of the entire polyhedron,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.340
this entire cube.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.350
So now let's think about
nets of polyhedron.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.920
So what is a net
of a polyhedron?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.050
Well, one way to think about it
is if you kind of viewed this

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.390
as made up of cardboard, and you
were to unfold it in some way

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.040
so it would become
flat, or another way

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.498
of thinking about
it is if you were

00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:47.220
to cut out some
cardboard or some paper,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.610
and you wanted to fold it up
into one of these figures,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.720
how would you go about doing it?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.310
And each of these polyhedra
has multiple different nets

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.410
that you could create so
that it can be folded up

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.680
into this
three-dimensional figure.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.550
So let's take an example.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.409
And maybe the simplest example
would be a cube like this.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.700
And I'm going to color code it.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.810
So let's say that the bottom of
this cube was this green color.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.790
And so I can represent
it like this.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.505
That's the bottom of the cube.

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:19.810
It's that green color.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.760
Now, let's say that this back
surface of the cube is orange.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.260
Well, I could
represent it like this.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.470
And notice, I've kind
of folded it out.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.670
I'm folding it out.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.460
And so if I were to flatten it
out, it would look like this.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.860
It would look like that.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.060
Now, this other backside,
I'll shade it in yellow.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.310
This other backside right over
here, I could fold it backwards

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.400
and keep it connected along
this edge, fold it backwards.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.440
It would look like this.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.967
It would look like that.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.550
I think you get the
general idea here.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.870
And just to be clear,
this edge right over here

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.220
is this edge right over there.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.490
Now I have to worry
about this top part.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.140
Maybe it is in-- let me
do it in a pink color.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.680
This top part of the cube
is in this pink color,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.340
and it needs to be attached
to one of these sides.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.700
I could attach it to
this side or this side.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.200
Let's attach it over here.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.630
So let's say it's attached to
that yellow side back here.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.660
So then when we
fold it out, when

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.140
we really unpack the thing,
so we folded that yellow part

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.290
back, then we're
folding this part back,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.950
then it would be
right over here.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.030
And then we could fold this
front face right over here.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.900
We could fold that
out along this edge,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.732
and it would go
right over there.

00:03:49.732 --> 00:03:50.940
It would go right over there.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.340
And then we have one
face of the cube left.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.070
We have this side
right over here.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.170
Well, we could do,
actually, several things.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.410
We could fold it
out along this edge.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.310
And then we would draw the
surface right over there.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.200
Or if we want to do
something interesting,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.010
we could fold it
out along the edge

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.120
that it shares with the
yellow, that backside.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.096
So we could fold
it out like this.

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:19.470
So if we folded
it out like this,

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.330
it would be connected to the
yellow square right over here.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.070
So you see that
there's many, many ways

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.300
to construct a net
or a net that when

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.320
you fold it all back up will
turn into this polyhedron,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.827
in this case, a cube.

00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:35.910
Let's do one more example.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.160
Let's do the rectangular
pyramid, because all of these

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.295
had rectangles.

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:43.210
Or in particular, these had
squares as our surfaces.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.250
Now, the most
obvious one might be

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.520
to start with your
base right over here.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.930
Start with your base and
then take the different sides

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.980
and then just fold
them straight out.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.450
So, for example, we could take
this side right over here,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.270
fold it out, and it
would look like that.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.050
We could take this
side back here,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.260
and once again,
just fold it out.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.122
And it would look like that.

00:05:13.122 --> 00:05:15.080
It should be the same
size as that orange side,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.960
but I'm hand drawing it, so
it's not going to be perfect.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.340
So that's that right over there.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.720
And then you could take this
front side right over here,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.450
and once again, fold
it out along this edge.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.650
So it would look like this.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.610
And then finally, you could
take this side right over

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.130
here, and once again, fold
it out along this edge

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.030
and it would go right there.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.160
But this isn't the only net
for this rectangular pyramid.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.300
There's other options.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.320
For example, and just
to explore one of them,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.130
instead of folding that
green side out that way,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.840
instead we might have
wanted to fold it out

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.092
along this edge with the
yellow side that you can't see.

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:05.050
Actually, let's make it
a little bit different.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.880
Let's fold it out along this
side since we can see the edge.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.950
And let me color the edge.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.210
So this is the edge right over
here on the blue triangle.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.650
So this is the edge.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.740
And when you fold the
green triangle out,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.380
it would look like this.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.780
If you fold it the
green triangle out,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.670
it would look like this.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.170
So hopefully this gives
you an appreciation.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.880
There's multiple ways to
unfold these three-dimensional

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.830
figures, these polyhedra,
or multiple ways

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.530
if you wanted to do
a cardboard cutout

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.480
and then fold things back
together to construct them.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.430
And these flattened
versions of them,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:47.264
these things, these unpacking of
these polyhedra, we call nets.
