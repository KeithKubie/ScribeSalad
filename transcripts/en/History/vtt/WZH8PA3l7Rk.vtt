00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:10.660
[music playing]

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.240
Oh, must be more
than a million dollars.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.414
Aw, shucks.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.482
There's more than
$1,000, I betcha.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.051
But how can we
take it with us?

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.723
[machinery whirring]

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.792
Get outta here!

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.728
[squeaking]

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.731
Make way!

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:07.733
[squeaking]

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.734
[squawking]

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.337
And me wants peace and quiet.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.272
I've been a bad boy.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.342
I should have
listened to my mother.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.645
[music playing]

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.553
But gosh, how can we get home?

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:29.489
Worry, worry, worry, worry.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.157
Worry, worry, worry, worry.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.558
Worry, worry, worry, worry.

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:34.894
I got it.

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:38.331
SINGERS: [inaudible].

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:42.735
Yo ho, my land a-ho.

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:46.639
See [inaudible] lands and
raise your hands upon the sea.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:50.776
And every day when I'm
away, she'll long for me.

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:55.381
And whisper low when tempests
blow [inaudible] and sea.

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:58.885
Yo ho, land ho, land ho.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:02.522
The harbor's past, the
wind is wild and free.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:06.926
Yo ho, we go across the sea.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.663
As long as we can
say [inaudible],,

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:14.300
so here's a [inaudible].
