00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.650
In the last work session,

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.136
we were able to replace the words noun
and verb in a single hard coded string.

00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:08.370
But the Mad Libs Generator
we want to build,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.270
we want to feed in any string we want
into it and the way we want to do this

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.170
is by using the new concept you've
just learned about, functions.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.090
Now we don't know enough
about functions just yet

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.500
to build a full blown
Mad Libs Generator but

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.050
in this work session, we'll go over
the distinction between two statements.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.880
Print and return, which can cause a lot
of frustration to new programmers but

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.900
are also inherent to functions.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.410
Let's dive in.
