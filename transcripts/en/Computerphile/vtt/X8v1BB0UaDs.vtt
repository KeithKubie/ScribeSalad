00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030
[four] things start making a

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.429
51% of the time they make the right choice and 49% of the wrong

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.739
It's going to be a very inefficient system to do all the error correction to correct for that

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.590
And so this is why we often the moore's law the end of its being predicted simply because we are getting down to these

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.199
tiny Tiny scales first time I came across

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.910
Integrated circuits was when I was lucky enough to be working years ago at [Acorn] at the time at which

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.529
Steve furber and Roger Wilson, we're designing the arm processor and at that point

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.078
We were all very excited [about] three Micron technology. That was the feature size of the transistors three Microns

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.499
Which today is huge and today were doing it you know 28 and 22 nanometers

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.619
[modules] interesting we'll be hearing about it for years first coined back in the

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.820
70s

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.389
By gordon Moore of intel at the time it was an empirical observation. I was an observation of

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.329
The number of components that could be built on an integrated circuit

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.089
and their cost

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.080
It's often simply quoted as you know every generation

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.549
We were doubling in complexity, but slightly more nuanced than that we look at

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.229
the cost

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.159
I'm going to use a log scale here. So we're going to go 110

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.080
100

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.340
buton

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.840
Thousand

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.840
to the four and along here

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.210
We'll look at number of components

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.470
Moore's Observation was over a series of time we started off

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.650
The cost was quite high and we could integrate

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.200
you know some small number of

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.579
Components and as you added more and more components the cost per component went back up

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.360
So the point is there was a sweet spot that was. Oh there was a size of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.890
semiconductor of

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.600
integrated semiconductor

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.729
That was most cost effective. He first time the group. This was 1962 what he observed was [that] at each generation

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.020
It was a sweet spot

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.589
and that's what's often referred to as moore's [law] is the doubling every generation and the generation is each time we

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.779
reduce what we refer to as the feature size of the components reduce the size of the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.950
transistor and the wire and of course if we have the dimension of it then because it's a flat surface we

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.540
Quadruple multiply [by] for the number of components we get on the chip first time I came across

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.249
Integrated circuits was when I was lucky enough to be working here years ago at Acorn at the time at which

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.540
Steve furber Roger Wilson, we're designing the arm processor and at that point. We were all very excited about three Micron technology

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.359
That was the feature size of the transistors three Microns which today is huge and today. We're doing it. You know

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.120
28 and 22 nanometers are

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.820
much smaller feature size, so

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.430
What what does [that] actually mean [maybe] which worthwhile thinking about you know how we actually manufacture?

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.690
Semiconductors just to get an understanding of and when we're referring to these you know what does this mean and then?

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.300
some of the issues that we'll get eventually as we

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.100
Shrink these devices small and smaller we'll get to the issues that are causing us

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.740
Concerns about Moore's law and the fact that it's you know it's slowing down, [and] it can't continue forever

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.880
the original

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.549
Transistors were actually made by just lobbing together our various bits of semiconductor material and

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.309
In fact as a brilliant picture you'll be able to find the first

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.170
Transistor by Shakti when he was at bell labs just showing you how this stuff was glued together, but essentially to build a transistor

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.839
we need some semiconductor materials that

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.719
That are doped with ions

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.130
that give them either a slightly you know and a

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.809
lack of electrons in their crystal structure or an excess of electrons

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.710
And they're either referred to as p or n materials which refer to as p doping or n doping of the semiconductor material

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.999
so when we build silicon chips taking a cross-section of

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.799
Some silicon material then we dope an area of it

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.170
with what we refer to as this p material and then

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.700
maybe another

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.069
[area] with these n material in it and as we apply electric charge to this we switch on and off the current

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.570
flow through this area of the semiconductor and that gives us the basic switching function

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.389
We need and from that we can build up all the more complex logic gates in order [to] build this the way

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.929
We do it is very similar to photography a process called lithography

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.410
where we start with our semiconductor material and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.600
We put a mask over the top of it then we diffuse in from a gas

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.399
Lots of our little molecules here flying around this P-type material it

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.729
diffuses into the silicon and that gives us our doped region

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.259
And then the next step would be similar thing we start off with our existing region

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.959
And then we put on a different resistance layer

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.329
And then we do fit with our n-type material and we build up the small zone [obviously] [do] it for less time

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:10.250
So it doesn't go all the way through and this process of laying on resist material and then itching it off the material is

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.810
photosensitive, we've put a

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.440
Essentially a negative on top of the the chip

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.399
show you shiny ultraviolet light through it and

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.829
the photoresist reacts under that and then we can etch it away with some chemical leaving some of the resist and then we can

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.200
Dope and it's very similar to how we've built printed circuit boards for years. It's just a much smaller scale, so

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.750
[as] we want to build smaller and smaller

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.410
Transistors, we've had to understand how to build

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.740
essentially the Masks

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.889
For the chips and these these masks are multiple layers

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.199
Including not just the p and the n layers, but [also] metal layers as well for the wiring on the chip

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.449
It's each generation is required better understanding more complex

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.789
Optical systems and and all sorts of things like that, so that's what we're going on for years

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.949
And that's this this same mechanism. These are the basis of all integrated circuits whether they're

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.800
processors, whether they're

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.720
With their memory devices there are subtle distinctions in the details of the layerings and the type of dopings

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.779
We use that make them more efficient for one use or another?

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.799
Silicon is not the only material [we] [use] [for] semiconductors for example photonic devices for lasers we often use

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.359
Things like gallium Arsenide with which so called three five semiconductors so long

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.589
But it's the basis of all our silicon chips and in essence

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.249
Know as these feature sizes get smaller and smaller

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.570
We start getting to the point where if we look at these areas of the transistor at some point as we shrink this?

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.909
The question is how many atoms are there in here or ions of the dopant material?

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.820
And as it gets smaller and smaller the [number] gets less and less

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.970
And that therein lies one problem, which is as we get to very small numbers of atoms

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.979
the behavior we rely on the quantum mechanics behavior of the

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:15.409
Transistor the probability that it switches in the right way starts to start you know the chances that does the right thing start to reduce

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.429
Night there's always been a problem with any of these systems

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.800
There's usually two places in which it's stable, and you're trying to switch from one place to the other

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.120
and

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.670
It's just the probability that these will do the wrong thing and as we get down to tiny tiny transistors

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.710
There's serious problem that there aren't many

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.140
Atoms that are actually at the heart of making that decision, and if they don't all jump decide to jump the same way

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:47.450
Then it may not do what we expect so the prediction of moore's law that [it] will run. I is a statement of the transistors

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.190
You know starting to do the unlikely thing too often?

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:59.960
And the point at which you know we've used error correction and other techniques to try to correct the problems that we're getting

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.929
you know that will take us so far, but at some point with you know if the things start making a

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.099
51 percent of the time they make the right choice and 49 percent of the wrong

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.470
It's going to be a very inefficient system to do all the error correction to correct for that

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:21.260
And so this is why we often the moore's law the end of its being predicted simply because we are getting down to these

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.279
Tiny tiny scales, there's plenty of other things we still have available to us

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.440
I mean many modern [chips] have vast arrays of the chip that are just laid [down] to Memory arrays

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.890
And we can ask questions [about] you know are they the best?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.129
Architectures given we have so many billions of transistors are we doing the best thing with them

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.279
And then finally something that actually it dates back a long way as well

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:46.560
[I] often find myself going back to what seems like prehistory of computing for many but

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.489
Back in the days when I did my phd one of my colleagues did

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:56.070
Work on 3D chip design where we stack up the chips on [top] of each other and hence?

00:08:56.529 --> 00:09:02.729
Continue to get you know doublings in Density within a certain area doesn't quite get us the same cost savings

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.870
but it does give us [and]

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:12.089
The ability to have very dense computing systems by stacking and we've already seen that a number of commercial products that come available

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:23.279
Things that can affect this radiation there's one public only that will fall [over] like that won't move here. We go ready

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.450
The system works [look] at them

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.640
And it's for one of those reasons and for example when we build chips to go into satellites or into deep space missions

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.490
We take extreme [measures] to protect the material
