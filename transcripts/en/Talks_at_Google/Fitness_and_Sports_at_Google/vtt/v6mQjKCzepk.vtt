00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.360
Thank you for having me today

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.160
My name is Akiko Yamamoto as introduced today

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I’ll be presenting to a crowd from a completely different field

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.070
I will be talking about my lifestyle

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.260
I find it a hard topic to talk about

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.060
I find it easier to talk about my profession

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.780
But, I’ve given the honor to speak to you today

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.280
I’d like to talk about the lifestyle of my husband and I

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.320
As mentioned earlier today

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.000
My husband is the personal trainer at XX-san’s gym

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.800
As a result I had been asked to visit today

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.840
I’m also thankful to my husband

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.000
So, let’s begin

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.080
I think we have a fitness boom now

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.660
Among the fitness trends,
I’d like to mention how I was invited to talk here

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.270
In November last year

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.220
There was a program in Nihon TV called
“1 Minute of Fukaii Hanashi”

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.020
Where my family and my husband and I were featured

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.900
When I asked how they learned about me

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.700
Someone said  there was an ophthalmologist that was also a fitness bikini model

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.720
They had  checked what's trending on social media

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.340
It is how they discovered me

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.100
I’ve brought a snippet of that program

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.200
The sound is a bit low

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.060
But please take look

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.060
I have gained 7 kilos since then

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.460
A bit embarrassing

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.940
It would have been better if I wore my swimsuit

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.920
And show my abs

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.680
But my trainer forbid me to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.420
Because of this program

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.740
As a program on a popular time slot

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.080
I was very thankful, as an ophthalmologist

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.170
As well as a fitness bikini athlete

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.020
I’ve had many opportunities to talk like today

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.190
It has been a grateful experience

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.170
It will be quick today, but before I get to our main story today

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.130
I’d like for you to learn about us a bit more

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.060
I’ve prepared a couple of slides

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.160
Thank you in advance for having us again

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.150
I was born in Ageo City in Saitama Prefecture

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.240
I was born between my parents,
and my father ran an ENT clinic

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.700
I am the third and youngest born,
and a stereotypical youngest child

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.120
I did whatever I wanted

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.100
And was a free spirit, a daydreamer

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.500
I had happened to go to an elementary school
that was strong in in gymnastics

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.360
So, by the 4th grade it was normal to be able to do a backflip

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.280
I was at that level of gymnastics

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.380
I thought that was normal at the time

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.760
Then I joined the gymnastics club when I entered High School

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.060
Since there was a gymnastics club

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.860
I said that I was going to be a gymnast

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.300
Then I joined a band

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.620
I really got into it

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.720
So, I said that I was going to be a singer

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.560
I would talk about my typical teenage girl dream with my family

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.920
After a while my sister and my brother had started medical school

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.100
I saw them, and I started to lean towards being a doctor

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.240
During my summer break in High School,
I told my father about this

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.340
He was surprised

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.000
And said that he thought I wanted to be
a singer and a gymnast

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.040
I thought that I had to put my hobbies aside
And got serious about studying

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.180
But my parents said that maybe I could sing, dance,
and be a doctor at the same time

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.460
My parents weren’t as strict about studying all the time

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.160
So I was able to continue my hobbies and pursue medicine

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.460
This was in 1989

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.220
I enrolled in Kanazawa Medical School

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.460
I didn’t do very well in school

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.400
But I was fortunate to have friends that looked after me

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.660
And I was able to graduate in 6 years

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.980
I then entered the ophthalmologic class of the same university

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.540
I stayed there for 9 years

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.290
I did cataract surgeries and retinal detachment surgeries

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.820
In the university hospital

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:58.400
I studied under a professor who specialized in dry eyes,
The surface of our eye has contact with our eyelids all the time

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.360
I started to get very interested in eyelids

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.320
There are cases where the eyelids are formed downward,
or there are eyelashes that are upside down turned inside

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.300
There are many troubles that come with eyelids

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.260
In Kanazawa University, there was no specialization in this

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.860
So I thought of making one

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.740
I decided to go back to Tokyo or Kanto

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.600
I was able to meet great people

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:35.620
And I was able to receive great mentorship
to gain skills in eye surgery

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.360
After about a year, I went back to Kanazawa University

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.760
And started an eye surgery clinic

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.360
I still go there once a month
I visit for surgeries and the like

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.500
On the other hand in Tokyo

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.060
I had started an eye clinic in Jiyugaoka

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.520
This year will be our 12th year

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.780
I have also been very blessed with staff

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.090
I am grateful to be working in this great environment

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.120
This is my main profession

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.960
About how my husband and I met

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.860
When I went back to Tokyo

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.460
I was actually looking for a handsome
surfer instructor at the time

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.680
We got introduced

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.360
He is actually 9 years younger

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.140
But he’s actually a man of the world,
and with strong character

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.540
We have a 9 year age gap but

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.660
As the youngest child I can be less reliable
so we compliment each other well

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.380
After we were in a relationship

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:54.140
I learned that his mother had given birth to him at 19

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.140
So, we are 9 years apart,
but I’m only 10 years apart from his mother

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:04.140
I get along with him, but sometimes
relate more to his mother’s stories

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.880
When we talk about nostalgic topics,
his mother and I get along better

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.270
That was the funny story of my step mother and I

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.420
Around the time we started dating

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.180
I started to also get into beauty treatment clinics

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.060
After work I would go to these clinics everyday

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:31.440
The clinic I went to was not the luxurious type

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.780
When you go in, you have to change into paper underwear

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.600
There were a lot of women and it was like a hot sauna

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.200
With women doing different beauty treatments

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.360
It looked like a training hall

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.400
There was also a contest that went on

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.000
And everyone worked hard towards that

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.240
During this time, dieting was also part of this

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.560
I feel embarrassed as a doctor

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.920
But there sometimes I wouldn’t
get my period for 3 months

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.220
I did this, and got to this point I couldn’t
get a good grasp of the situation

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.140
And didn’t know when to stop

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.100
I thought that if I went back to normal food I would get fat

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.500
I felt that my way of thinking
had derailed from normal as well

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.240
During this time I became pregnant with my daughter

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.600
I immediately stopped caring about my diet

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.000
During this time,
Nicole Richie who I really liked was also pregnant

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.820
Maternity fashion was also trendy during this time

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.150
And I really got into this

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.920
I immersed myself into it

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.140
I was very happy and fulfilled

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.780
But when I was pregnant,
I gained weight in my upper body quickly

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.080
A lot of weight was on my hip joint

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.540
I started to feel the pain and I couldn’t walk for long

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.520
When I went to an orthopedist

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.580
I was diagnosed with acetabular dysplasia on both sides

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:10.480
This bone in my buttocks,
and this round bone in my thighs

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.700
This bone head

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.360
The cover here, if it is normal it is supposed to cover properly

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.320
The coverage on mine was shallow

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.520
Since I had gained weight on my upper body
there is contact here

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.840
The cartilage had also become scoffed, and I was feeling pain

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.860
This was on both sides

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.110
The right side’s bones were definitely touching

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:41.660
There was cavity in the bones

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.980
I had to get surgery as soon as possible

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.220
And the cause was

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.200
The wrong diet I was doing for a long time

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.500
had pushed this to happen

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.880
Because of this, my bones had been hollow

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.880
When it comes to diets

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.560
Following the wrong diet is very bad

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.400
I really regretted this at the time

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.360
There are two types of surgery to chose from

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.540
One is the prosthesis,
the surgery often done with the elderly

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.520
This is where they would create an artificial hip

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.640
The other method is by keeping your own bones

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:25.320
This is very hard and recovery time is very slow

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.180
But after the recovery from the surgery,
there are no limitations in lifestyle

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.420
It is still best to have your own bones

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.800
There is that method

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.620
However, there is the bed ridden recovery time
after the surgery for at least two months

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.420
My daughter was still 2 years old at the time
so this felt like a life sentence to me

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:49.720
I did not think I can be staying in a hospital bed
for two months for recovery

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.140
I kept searching online and found a doctor
in Gifu Prefecture that allowed a quicker recovery

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.820
It would cut your own bones but also take care of it

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.520
and found a way to allow a much faster recovery

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.500
I decided to have a consultation

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.120
And decided immediately to take the surgery with the doctor

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.820
The picture on the right is after surgery

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:22.300
And as you can see on the right it is overlapped nicely

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.880
In the surgery they hollow out your bones and move its position

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.260
Then push it into place

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:38.340
My husband used to work in a commercial production company

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.460
And he finished work very late

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.620
He treated my hip joint problem

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.260
Not as my problem,
but something that we had to face as a family

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.540
He resigned from his job

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.620
And helped out with housework and bringing up our child

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.400
Sorry, I get teary-eyed when talking about this

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.920
He quit his job for our family

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.360
Even when I had my surgery

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.500
He had come to Gifu with me

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:16.160
He took care of our daughter,
and came to visit the hospital everyday

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.400
Our daughter also had to suddenly stop breast milk

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.240
I think it was hard for him

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.480
But he put her to bed every night

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.600
I am very thankful for that

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.260
Let’s stop talking about this then

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.400
Please wait

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.240
It usually takes two weeks of hospitalization to recover

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.440
But because I wanted to be with my family

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.280
I was able to be discharged after 9 days

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.060
The right picture is not my scar right after the surgery

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.340
It’s actually after a little while

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.760
I had this massive scar

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.360
I was quite shocked when I saw this scar

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.600
The doctor also said that

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:13.030
That this condition isn't necessarily OK by only one surgery

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.960
I had surgery done on my right side

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.260
But I might need to do surgery on my left side someday

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.760
To delay the risks of getting re-surgery
on my right and another surgery on my left

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.160
I was advised to start strength training
as part of my rehabilitation

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:37.760
Because of this,
my husband had gotten a license in physical therapy

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.380
He also worked to get a license to be a trainer

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.300
That is what he did

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.500
Every night he would work on parts that hurt on my body

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.000
He also became my trainer

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.880
Ever since he did study abroad
He liked doing strength training

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.920
Working in a production company is very hard physically

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.920
Everything in your life including eating becomes chaotic

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.800
This is what his body became like then

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.580
Since after he resigned

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.780
He became like this

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.020
How long did this take?

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.060
About 2 years

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.120
My weight was the same in both pictures

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.900
That’s really good isn’t it

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.520
In 2 years time this is what change can do

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.000
He isn’t unhealthy

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.820
I think he is very healthy

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:39.240
In 2015, my husband joined the
Best Body Japan bodybuilding contest

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.520
There were many in my husbands class

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.060
It was a fierce competition

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.220
But he was able to be a finalist

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.360
This right back pose, I think it looks very good

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.840
During this time

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.520
I was busy with the two kids

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.760
and taking video and pictures at the same time

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.140
During this back pose The whole crowd went wild

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.560
Most of the people were male

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.380
Everyone cheered and I had goosebumps all over

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.880
That husband of mine has a gym in Roppongi

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.040
If any of you are interested,
please come and have a chat

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.300
As I mentioned earlier

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.120
My husband would be my physical therapist at night

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.300
And in the gym he is also my trainer

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.120
I have been to physical therapy regularly before

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.300
But your body goes back if you only go to the therapist

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.820
By having some muscles around

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.120
The parts the therapist fixes also become harder to go back

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.060
I was also able to realize this

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.900
I stopped feeling the pain in my hip joint

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.100
I was very thankful for that

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.060
My physical appearance too

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.440
I was conscious about my bow leg before

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.440
But it started to form better after

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.700
My buttocks had also been saggy

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.200
And, I felt that it started to go up

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.800
After 1 year and a half of training

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.080
My abs started to show

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.940
We started to see this

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.020
And, since I was already training for rehabilitation

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.360
We thought that it would be good
if there was another goal for it

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:30.800
We talked about me joining a tournament

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.880
As advised by my husband

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.100
I didn’t think I would have a chance

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.920
When I went to cheer my husband when he joins

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.780
I have seen the great bodies of many of them

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.540
I didn’t think someone like me could compete

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.740
I was very anxious and worried

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.120
But I trusted my husband that everything was going to be fine

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.940
I did everything my husband told me to do

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.600
And worked studiously on training

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.920
Every aspect of it is very detailed

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.240
Of course the diet and training menu

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.440
But I had to lose body fat and weight by a certain day

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:18.860
And it was also featured on the TV program
how he managed everything in my day-to-day life

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.260
Sort of like my manager

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.240
It is great isn’t it

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.020
For someone like myself that has a sloppy personality,
I was very thankful

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:21.240
In 2016, I took part in a total of 4 competitions

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.520
The very right was my first competition

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.640
The diving board of the swimming pool side worked as the stage

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.980
In a really small space, while there was rain, the wind was also really hard

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.100
And I was in 18 cm heels

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.960
We were shaking while doing poses

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.340
I was very nervous

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.060
During the preliminary

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.720
My husband said I was looking at the judges like a murderer

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.680
Since I had worked this hard

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.820
I should relax and smile more

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.520
This is the advise I got from my husband

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.060
I took part in the finals very relaxed

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.440
I received 3rd place

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.660
I am in the middle, but this is the 3rd place

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.620
From right it is 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.880
I won 3rd place in my first competition

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.900
I think that wasn’t such a bad result

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.320
2 years ago was the best result I got

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.180
It was at the Model Japan contest

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.600
But even how hard I work

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.680
With my physical build

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.660
There are contests that will not evaluate it very well

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.480
This is what I thought

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.940
And my husband also said to change the competitions we join

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.460
I chose to take part in competitions that

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.420
Evaluate athletes based on weights and proper training

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.280
There is the Japan Body Building &amp; Fitness Moderation
competition

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.520
It’s a big tournament called All Japan

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.300
During this time, it is September 3rd

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.420
I received the 4th place last year

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.540
Since this competition

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.080
I had been featured on Fukaii Hanashi

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.140
And I have gotten to speak with a lot of different people

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.420
But the 4th place isn’s so bad

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.080
But during this time

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.700
I was quite greedy, and wanted to get a medal

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.600
I wanted to be able to give the medal to my husband

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.320
I wanted to bring that to this years competition

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.840
And work hard to win

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.180
Sorry for the long explanation

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.140
But for my training

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.820
He is quite popular these days

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.020
My personal trainer

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.420
He said  since I got 4th place in All Japan
I should be able to train on my own

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.900
He would still make my training program menu

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.100
If my shoulders looked weak,
he would add training for my shoulders

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.720
And makes my menu,
so in a way I am at my husband’s gym

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.600
And I train like this

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.400
In the past, I only had Wednesdays off

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.500
That was the only time given to me

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.420
I would do my entire body for about 2 to 3 hours straight

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.240
I had great focus then

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.640
But I cannot do it this way now

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.120
Because I need to do more weights for the competitions

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.860
I need to focus on individual parts of my body

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.520
like shoulders and buttocks separately

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:31.480
On the weekends I would do training with my kids

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:37.840
We have fun doing it

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.840
Before the competition

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.140
When there aren’t patients around

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.400
And during lunch breaks are also an important time

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.520
They also featured this during the TV program

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.940
Please take a look

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.040
This is for real

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.340
I do wear swimsuits normally

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.740
But we had to tone it down for TV

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.420
When I hear the voice of patients

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.620
I don’t train then

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.580
But, yes it is like this

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.300
Yes

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:18.240
I have introduced to you my husband earlier

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.780
I would also like to talk to you about my children

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.920
On the left is Riri who is 9 years old

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.020
The moment she was born she was very cute

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.400
She is very thoughtful towards her mother

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.340
She says that she wants to just like me when she grows up

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.740
I thought I have a successor for my clinic

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.380
But she meant a bodybuilder

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.060
She is actually better at posing than myself

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.440
On the right is Kotaro who is 6 years old

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.100
His face, and his all out youngest child
personality is just like me

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.660
And he says that he wants to be like
his sister Riri when he grows up

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.360
He really looks up to his sister

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.620
Lately he has been getting into Kamen Rider

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.320
So I am relieved his gender is leaning towards male

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.340
These two kids

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:05.700
Many have told me that I was doing such a good job
being ophthalmologist and body builder and a mother

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.140
But this is what my week looks like

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:13.100
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
and bi weekly on Saturdays

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.380
I work from 10:30 AM to 7PM

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.300
Riri is in 4th grade in elementary

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.620
She has cram school and ballet classes

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.800
In actual, my daughter is more busy than I am

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.960
This part is my training

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.340
This is my training menu

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.380
This part, my trainer my husband sets up everything

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.260
The program changes

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.340
When competitions are near

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.980
When he sees that I am not losing weight as I should

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.220
He would add cardio in the morning

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:53.360
When you look at this, you might think that I am doing well

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.380
But actually, my family that supports me are the ones doing very well

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:02.920
Without their support I would not be able to do this

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.760
My husband would really want to join competition himself

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.220
But he has focused on me after taking 4th place

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.060
I also have a ticket to join the All Japan next year

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.800
He really thinks of me first

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.700
Our kids now are both in Elementary school

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.120
But when they were in preschool

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:32.220
He would send them off  and wash the dishes in the morning

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.620
And throw the trash away

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.100
I saw this on the news before but
the most common household chore

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.660
Japanese women want their husbands
to do is throw away the trash

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.280
That is a daily thing for us

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.240
And I thought if that was enough

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.200
My husband, as you saw the schedule earlier

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.600
There were only items that the children or I do are written down

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.240
But my husband takes care of his things on his own

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.440
I am very thankful for that

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.920
Before tournaments

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.580
I don’t do a very good job as a mother

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.420
And I am able to do things because of this family

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.840
I am very grateful

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.440
Every time that I cannot get the 1st place

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.300
I feel bad because I let my children down

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.480
After a competition

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.820
We have an awarding ceremony done by our kids

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.400
It is adorable please let me share this

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.920
I may need to pixelate this

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.120
But yes, this reminds me

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.780
When you get first place the sash and the gold medal

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:50.820
All of them are gold

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.820
So my son has a thing for gold now

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.780
He always says that he wants gold

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.880
So my motivation

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.720
Comes a lot from my son’s words that he only wants gold

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.280
This leads my motivation before a competition

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.200
I am a selfish mother that does whatever

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:18.580
But the moment the competition finishes,
the priority immediately changes to my family

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:24.040
With that I have gained about 7 kilos right now

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.280
But for our children

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:34.180
Even when they see their parents work hard
even when they are still small

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:39.540
We are hoping that it becomes a positive influence on them

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.820
Not just with studies

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.920
I want them to be able to give even play their 100%

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.500
This is how we are

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.360
My husband looks like he was bullied to do it

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.360
But this is how we raise our children

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:58.860
Yes

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:05.700
I’ve shared my husband’s and my instagram account

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.220
Please check it out if you’re interested

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.400
Thank you very much

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.340
Sorry if I was rambling
