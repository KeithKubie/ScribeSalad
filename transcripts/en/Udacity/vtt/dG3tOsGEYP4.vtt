I'm in a terminal. I'm going to go ahead and fire up Python.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to show you how to use Python to do hashing for you

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
because we're going to be doing a lot of this in this class.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So one thing we can use is hashlib, and hashlib has a couple hashes available to you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You've got md5, sha1, 256. Those are the ones we just talked about.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So let's go ahead and get the md5 of something.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The way we do that is we say, x = hashlib.md5, and we say "foo".

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay, so now x is this hash object, and the way we get something useful out of this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is we call the hex digest function on it.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If we call hex digest on the result of md5, we get this string.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is the md5 hash of this string "foo."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If I were to change--let's do this all in one line--let's say, hashlib.md5 "hello hello"--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
oops! "hello hello" and call hex digest on it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We can see our hash.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now if I were to just change one of these characters.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let's change to a capital O.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We can see our hash completely changes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
See, we add f5 to it, blah, blah, blah. 263 here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So that's a neat property of this particular hashing function,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and if we were to change this back to "hello hello", we get our original hash.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What's nice about a hash like hashlibmd5 is it's available on every system.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
If I type--if I hash "hello hello" on any system with md5, we're going to get the same result.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That's pretty cool.
