00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440
to say in a real life in a real task so
 

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.829
to say in a real life in a real task so
just like all of us have our classes of

00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839
just like all of us have our classes of
 

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:46.229
just like all of us have our classes of
students we have to get them analyze it

00:37:46.229 --> 00:37:46.239
students we have to get them analyze it
 

00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:48.809
students we have to get them analyze it
and deal with it are we able to do those

00:37:48.809 --> 00:37:48.819
and deal with it are we able to do those
 

00:37:48.819 --> 00:37:52.559
and deal with it are we able to do those
things and also I was curious to see

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:52.569
things and also I was curious to see
 

00:37:52.569 --> 00:37:55.049
things and also I was curious to see
what they chose what where they were

00:37:55.049 --> 00:37:55.059
what they chose what where they were
 

00:37:55.059 --> 00:37:58.229
what they chose what where they were
comfortable focusing on and that's part

00:37:58.229 --> 00:37:58.239
comfortable focusing on and that's part
 

00:37:58.239 --> 00:38:00.960
comfortable focusing on and that's part
of what I hope to find out so going

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:00.970
of what I hope to find out so going
 

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:02.870
of what I hope to find out so going
through the data of it through an IRB

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880
through the data of it through an IRB

process my co-author be performing and I

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880
process my co-author be performing and I

process my co-author be performing and I
determine categories of mental analysis

00:38:11.759 --> 00:38:11.769
determine categories of mental analysis
 

00:38:11.769 --> 00:38:14.220
determine categories of mental analysis
for these errors we were the two Raiders

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:14.230
for these errors we were the two Raiders
 

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.319
for these errors we were the two Raiders
we normed with each other and we

00:38:16.319 --> 00:38:16.329
we normed with each other and we
 

00:38:16.329 --> 00:38:19.319
we normed with each other and we
evaluated student responses separately

00:38:19.319 --> 00:38:19.329
evaluated student responses separately
 

00:38:19.329 --> 00:38:22.200
evaluated student responses separately
then we brought that back together and

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.210
then we brought that back together and
 

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.450
then we brought that back together and
any places where we disagreed we

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:24.460
any places where we disagreed we
 

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.749
any places where we disagreed we
negotiated we came up with in a sense we

00:38:27.749 --> 00:38:27.759
negotiated we came up with in a sense we
 

00:38:27.759 --> 00:38:31.920
negotiated we came up with in a sense we
came up with a neutral solution okay we

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:31.930
came up with a neutral solution okay we
 

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.109
came up with a neutral solution okay we
developed a list of what we identified

00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119
developed a list of what we identified
 

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:36.569
developed a list of what we identified
were successes and problem areas and

00:38:36.569 --> 00:38:36.579
were successes and problem areas and
 

00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:39.059
were successes and problem areas and
what are what our teachers were able to

00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:39.069
what are what our teachers were able to
 

00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:40.789
what are what our teachers were able to
do and we made a list of recommendations

00:38:40.789 --> 00:38:40.799
do and we made a list of recommendations
 

00:38:40.799 --> 00:38:43.109
do and we made a list of recommendations
just so you know we were working with

00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119
just so you know we were working with
 

00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:45.299
just so you know we were working with
about 80 teachers and because they were

00:38:45.299 --> 00:38:45.309
about 80 teachers and because they were
 

00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:46.830
about 80 teachers and because they were
doing three lexical

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:46.840
doing three lexical
 

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.290
doing three lexical
medical that's six islands each we

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:49.300
medical that's six islands each we
 

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.090
medical that's six islands each we
eliminated a couple of items that were

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:51.100
eliminated a couple of items that were
 

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.680
eliminated a couple of items that were
problematic either misunderstood or they

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:54.690
problematic either misunderstood or they
 

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.660
problematic either misunderstood or they
occasionally one or two omitted one so

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:57.670
occasionally one or two omitted one so
 

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:01.580
occasionally one or two omitted one so
we ended up at the tumble 467 actual

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:01.590
we ended up at the tumble 467 actual
 

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:07.320
we ended up at the tumble 467 actual
errors that were corrected and so in our

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:07.330
errors that were corrected and so in our
 

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.480
errors that were corrected and so in our
analysis we looked at does the teacher

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:09.490
analysis we looked at does the teacher
 

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:12.150
analysis we looked at does the teacher
correctly identify error as grammatical

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160
correctly identify error as grammatical
 

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.670
correctly identify error as grammatical
lexical or ambiguous because there's are

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680
lexical or ambiguous because there's are
 

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.030
lexical or ambiguous because there's are
they able to do this and just so you

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040
they able to do this and just so you
 

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.480
they able to do this and just so you
know they were taught this in that MA

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:24.490
know they were taught this in that MA
 

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.630
know they were taught this in that MA
program and they were basically this was

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640
program and they were basically this was
 

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.180
program and they were basically this was
part of their training and so part of

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:30.190
part of their training and so part of
 

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:34.530
part of their training and so part of
the look at this was could they do it

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:34.540
the look at this was could they do it
 

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.470
the look at this was could they do it
then we looked at the specific nature of

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480
then we looked at the specific nature of
 

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.970
then we looked at the specific nature of
the error because part part of what we

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:38.980
the error because part part of what we
 

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.140
the error because part part of what we
were interested in is one of the focus

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:40.150
were interested in is one of the focus
 

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.360
were interested in is one of the focus
on what are they comfortable is the

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:42.370
on what are they comfortable is the
 

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:45.090
on what are they comfortable is the
teachers analysis accurate is the

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:45.100
teachers analysis accurate is the
 

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.610
teachers analysis accurate is the
treatment appropriate and how might we

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:49.620
treatment appropriate and how might we
 

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.800
treatment appropriate and how might we
explain if they had an incorrect

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:52.810
explain if they had an incorrect
 

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.000
explain if they had an incorrect

sixty-seven we get their ability to

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:06.070
sixty-seven we get their ability to
 

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.460
sixty-seven we get their ability to
identify errors now these are just raw

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:08.470
identify errors now these are just raw
 

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.680

numbers here I didn't put percentages

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:10.690
numbers here I didn't put percentages
 

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:14.010
numbers here I didn't put percentages
here but you can see approximately seven

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:14.020
here but you can see approximately seven

about seventy nine percent were able to

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:16.570
about seventy nine percent were able to
 

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:18.990
about seventy nine percent were able to
identify or wheat to Raiders

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000

independently agreed was correct small

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:25.570
independently agreed was correct small
 

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.890
independently agreed was correct small
number here about 25 people were

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:28.900
number here about 25 people were
 

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.840
number here about 25 people were
partially correct in other words that

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:30.850
partially correct in other words that
 

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.760
partially correct in other words that
identified there's an error but they

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:32.770
identified there's an error but they
 

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.510
identified there's an error but they
didn't know what kind they're worse

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520
didn't know what kind they're worse
 

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.580
didn't know what kind they're worse
however there were 50 spots possibly six

students teachers in that two errors in
that group that were incorrectly

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.170
that group that were incorrectly
 

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.650
that group that were incorrectly
identified just either not errors at all

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:46.660
identified just either not errors at all
 

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.589
identified just either not errors at all
and we were surprised

00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599
and we were surprised
 

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:51.880
and we were surprised
they identified something that just was

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:51.890
they identified something that just was
 

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:55.809
they identified something that just was
not wrong and this was my of course two

00:40:55.809 --> 00:40:55.819
not wrong and this was my of course two
 

00:40:55.819 --> 00:40:59.019
not wrong and this was my of course two
of our independent judgments when we

00:40:59.019 --> 00:40:59.029
of our independent judgments when we
 

00:40:59.029 --> 00:41:01.390
of our independent judgments when we
asked them to analyze it and then say

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400
asked them to analyze it and then say
 

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.749
asked them to analyze it and then say
what's the error what's wrong you notice

00:41:04.749 --> 00:41:04.759
what's the error what's wrong you notice
 

00:41:04.759 --> 00:41:08.589
what's the error what's wrong you notice
our numbers go down and the incorrect so

00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599
our numbers go down and the incorrect so
 

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:11.200
our numbers go down and the incorrect so
what was for us seventy-nine percent

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:11.210
what was for us seventy-nine percent
 

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:14.130
what was for us seventy-nine percent
accuracy went to sixty-six percent

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:14.140
accuracy went to sixty-six percent
 

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.970
accuracy went to sixty-six percent
accuracy so about a third correct either

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:18.980
accuracy so about a third correct either
 

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.670

incorrect partially or completely when
 

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.740
incorrect partially or completely when
we then ask them to address that error

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:23.750
we then ask them to address that error
 

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:27.150
we then ask them to address that error
provide some kind of instruction for it

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160
provide some kind of instruction for it
 

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.640
provide some kind of instruction for it
okay and we judge appropriate pneus of

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:30.650
okay and we judge appropriate pneus of
 

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:32.650
okay and we judge appropriate pneus of
instruction in terms of does it fit the

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:32.660
instruction in terms of does it fit the
 

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.160
instruction in terms of does it fit the
error number one does it fit the level

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:36.170
error number one does it fit the level
 

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:39.220
error number one does it fit the level
of the writing in the essay because

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:39.230
of the writing in the essay because
 

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:43.299
of the writing in the essay because
obviously they need to make it fit we

00:41:43.299 --> 00:41:43.309
obviously they need to make it fit we
 

00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:46.509
obviously they need to make it fit we
didn't know all the students involved in

00:41:46.509 --> 00:41:46.519
didn't know all the students involved in
 

00:41:46.519 --> 00:41:48.849
didn't know all the students involved in
these essays but where do we did have

00:41:48.849 --> 00:41:48.859
these essays but where do we did have
 

00:41:48.859 --> 00:41:51.519
these essays but where do we did have
information on their writing we had all

00:41:51.519 --> 00:41:51.529
information on their writing we had all
 

00:41:51.529 --> 00:41:55.329
information on their writing we had all
the original writing samples and we want

00:41:55.329 --> 00:41:55.339
the original writing samples and we want
 

00:41:55.339 --> 00:41:57.849
the original writing samples and we want
to basically we judge that in terms of

00:41:57.849 --> 00:41:57.859
to basically we judge that in terms of
 

00:41:57.859 --> 00:42:01.319
to basically we judge that in terms of
we did it okay and what we found was

00:42:01.319 --> 00:42:01.329
we did it okay and what we found was
 

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:06.370
we did it okay and what we found was
decreasing okay in other words even if

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:06.380
decreasing okay in other words even if
 

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.749
decreasing okay in other words even if
they could identify that there is an

00:42:07.749 --> 00:42:07.759
they could identify that there is an
 

00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:10.900
they could identify that there is an
error they didn't they knew less often

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:10.910
error they didn't they knew less often
 

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.749
error they didn't they knew less often
what it was and they were able to even

instruction that fit the error okay so

00:42:22.269 --> 00:42:22.279
instruction that fit the error okay so
 

00:42:22.279 --> 00:42:25.809
instruction that fit the error okay so
what we learned was identified lexical

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:25.819
what we learned was identified lexical
 

00:42:25.819 --> 00:42:27.430
what we learned was identified lexical
grammatical errors was complex it was

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440
grammatical errors was complex it was
 

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.329
grammatical errors was complex it was
complex for us how much more rooted

00:42:31.329 --> 00:42:31.339
complex for us how much more rooted
 

00:42:31.339 --> 00:42:34.230
complex for us how much more rooted
would be for our teachers

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240
would be for our teachers
 

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:43.400
would be for our teachers
and because we both have top courses in

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:43.410
 

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:45.480
most of our teachers seventy-nine

nine percent so we basically found four

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:53.470
nine percent so we basically found four

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.359
out of five we're out of the stop we're
out of five teachers was four out of

out of five teachers was four out of
five errors was that different correctly

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:01.450
five errors was that different correctly
 

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:05.000
five errors was that different correctly
okay but that means one out of five

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:05.010
okay but that means one out of five
 

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.030
okay but that means one out of five
twenty percent approximately wasn't one

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040
twenty percent approximately wasn't one
 

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.010
twenty percent approximately wasn't one
out of five errors we felt was not

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:11.020
out of five errors we felt was not
 

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.130
out of five errors we felt was not
identified this is not even identified

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:14.140
identified this is not even identified
 

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.270
identified this is not even identified
correctly as an error okay two-thirds

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280

about sixty six percent were able to

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:20.020
about sixty six percent were able to
 

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.900
about sixty six percent were able to
explain it correctly in other words they

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:21.910
explain it correctly in other words they
 

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:23.850
explain it correctly in other words they
were able to say what it was what's

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:23.860
were able to say what it was what's
 

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.940
