00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:09.090
PROFESSOR: Welcome to this
recitation on pure resonance.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.090
So here we're given an operator
p(D) equals D square plus 4I,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.695
where D is the
differential operator

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:16.970
and I is the identity operator.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.620
And you're asked to consider
the equation p(D) applied to x

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.850
equals F_0*cos(omega*t),
where F_0 is a constant.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.390
So the first question is
what is the natural frequency

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.770
of the system.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.170
The second one is to use the
exponential response formula

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.070
to solve for p(D)*x
equals F_0*cos(omega*t).

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.970
And here you need to
be careful and do it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.970
for both cases omega equal
to 2 and omega equals not

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.560
equal to 2.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.640
And the last question is
just to sketch the graph

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.110
for the response of this
system: p(D)*x equals cos 2t,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.950
with the initial conditions x
of 0 and x dot of 0 equals to 0,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.700
basically, rest
initial conditions.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.020
So why don't you pause the
video, take a few minutes,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.270
and work through this problem.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.270
Welcome back.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.880
So first what is the natural
frequency of this system?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.210
So let's just rewrite
our system here.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.870
This is the left-hand side.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.002
So basically, this just
gives us an x dot dot

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:32.810
plus 4x on the left-hand side.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.390
So the system that we're solving
is simply x dot dot plus 4x

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.520
equals F_0*cos(omega*t).

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.750
So the first question asks
us for the natural frequency

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.830
of this system.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.740
The natural frequency
of this system

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.920
can be found regardless of what
you have the right-hand side,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.250
just by looking at the
characteristic polynomial

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.580
of your equation.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.750
The characteristic polynomial
here would be s squared plus 4.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.300
When this characteristic
polynomial is equal to 0,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.270
we can solve for s and find
what are the natural frequencies

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.272
of the system, if basically we
get complex solutions, which

00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:17.980
is the case here.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.770
Gives us s square equal minus 4.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.380
So s equals plus or
minus i*2, or 2i.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.681
So the natural frequency of our
system would be omega equals 2,

00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:38.180
because we only
consider frequencies

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.540
that are positive here.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.950
Second part.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.010
Now, we're asked to
look at the full system

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.100
with the forcing on
the right-hand side.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.020
And using the exponential
response formula,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.780
find one solution
to this system.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.970
So here we're talking
about a particular solution

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.410
with the exponential
response formula.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.170
So what does the ERF tell us?

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.170
The ERF, if you recall here,
the base of it for this system

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.590
for example, is the fact
that cosine is the real part

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.080
of the exponential i*omega*t.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.300
So we can rewrite this whole
equation as x dot dot plus 4x

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.000
equals F_0
exponential i*omega*t.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.750
And we would get then
a particular solution,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.920
if I ignore any particular
value of omega at this point,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.400
which would have the form of
the amplitude that we have

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.770
on the right-hand side at
0, exponential i*omega*t,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.460
which is basically our forcing.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.955
Over the characteristic
polynomial of the equation,

00:03:52.955 --> 00:04:00.370
so s squared plus 4, evaluated
at the frequency here that

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.744
would appear at the forcing
in the exponential form,

00:04:02.744 --> 00:04:03.660
so with the i*omega*t.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.210
So here you can see right away
that we would have a problem,

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.380
using this formula, if i*omega*t
was a pole or basically a zero,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.180
to this characteristic
polynomial.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.430
And so that's why
you were asked to be

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.140
careful with the value of omega
equal to 2 or not equal to 2.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.770
So here let's consider
omega not equal to 2,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.280
so that I can actually write
down 1 over p(i*omega),

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.440
because we know that
p(i*2) is equal to 0.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.240
So if omega is not equal to 2,
were out of the danger zone.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:45.255
And from this point, we can just
basically plug in our values,

00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:51.520
i*omega*t, and p(i*omega) would
just give us 4 minus omega

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.020
squared.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.830
So here again, the omega equals
2 danger zone approaches,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.200
where we would be
dividing by 0 if we

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.761
didn't take the constraint
omega not equal to 0.

00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:08.120
So this is the complex form
of this particular solution.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.630
But we're dealing with
a real-valued problem,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.420
so we want to take
the real part of this

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.080
to have the solution to
the problem we were given.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.980
And so that would just give
us F_0, 4 minus omega squared,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.000
cosine omega*t.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.810
So now let's take the
case omega equals to 2.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.910
OK So what happens?

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.870
If omega equals to 2, this
formula that you're given

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.660
fails, and you need to
seek for the derivative

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.730
of the characteristic
polynomial.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:56.520
And we basically have
to-- 2i equals to 2.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.780
So what about p prime of 2i?

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.220
So p prime of s is simply 2s.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.390
So if we evaluate p
prime at 2i, we simply

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:19.210
have 4i, which is
not equal to 0.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.750
So at this point we can use the
resonant exponential response

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.790
formula that you saw.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.540
Just change my chalk.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.280
We're here.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.120
We would again, same
trick, the cosine

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.630
is just the real part
of the exponential.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.430
So we can use this formula.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:49.760
And we have now to introduce a
t, F_0 exponential i*omega*t,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.580
because we're solving here for
the complex value equation.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.730
And now we can
divide by the p prime

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.150
evaluated at 2i, which is 4i.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.350
And so basically, I can
end up with a minus i

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.410
at the numerator.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.470
So to take now the
real value solution,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:12.530
we need again to take
the real part of z_p.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.830
So here now we have an i,
so we need to be careful.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.180
We're going to have
solution in sine.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.600
So let me just write
down what know.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.650
t*F_0 over 4.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.980
This with the Euler formula
would be cosine plus i sine.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.940
The i sine would be
multiplying this i,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.590
the two minus would cancel out.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:35.590
And so we would end up with
sine omega*t, t*F_0 over 4.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.330
And this would then
give us the solution.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.120
And here, note that
I actually chose

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.600
the value omega equals to 2, so
we can even be more explicit.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.856
For this case, we actually
have omega equals to 2t.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.510
So the last part
of the problem was

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:11.737
to sketch the solution for the
initial conditions x of 0 or x

00:08:11.737 --> 00:08:16.350
dot of 0 equal to 0, so the
rest initial conditions.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.090
So here are two ways to proceed.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.147
The long way would be
to seek the solution

00:08:22.147 --> 00:08:24.480
to the homogeneous equation
without the right-hand side,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.960
the forcing cosine, introduced
two constants of integration,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.170
and then seek these
constants of integration

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.170
on the general solution.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.586
And you would find that these
two constants of integration

00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:36.570
would be 0 with these
initial conditions.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.870
The other fast way to test
your particular solution

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:46.280
and verify that it actually does
satisfy the initial conditions

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.890
that you were given,
and so you can

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:58.310
then right away the solution
as being simply sine 2t.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:03.959
Here you can see that at 0,
we would have basically a 0.

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:05.500
And then if you do
a differentiation,

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.700
you just need to
be careful here,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.199
because you have a
product function,

00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:10.480
and you end up also with a 0.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.920
So this actually is
our general solution

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.560
for this particular initial
condition, And to sketch this,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.430
we can grow-- so here if I
just pick F_0 equal to 1,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:33.620
I'm just going to do
t/4 for the envelopes.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.410
At t equals 0, we start with 0.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:48.300
And we know that we're going to
have the first extrema at pi/4

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.070
and the first zero at pi/2.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:58.950
And so basically, we end up
with something like that.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:04.100
So basically, it's sine
of circular frequency 2,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.410
and with an envelope
prescribed by t/4.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.410
Or if we had another value
of F_0, it would be F_0 t/4.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.370
So the oscillation
is ongoing as t

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.210
goes to infinity
with an envelope that

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.580
diverges to infinity.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.080
So this is basically
a solution that

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.010
would not be convergent to 0.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.790
So this ends this recitation.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.750
And before I finish, I
just want to point out

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.270
that the fact that it
diverges is due to the fact

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.840
that we are forcing
this system very

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.940
close to its natural frequency.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.930
And so this is a
typical phenomenon

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.364
that you can associate
with a resonance,

00:10:39.364 --> 00:10:41.030
because we're basically
forcing a system

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.400
close to its natural frequency.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.280
So it's having this huge
amplification in the response.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.200
And that's what these
increasing envelopes mean.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.920
So this ends this recitation.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.000
And the key here
was to realize how

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.170
to use your exponential
response formula, how to move on

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.730
to use the resonance exponential
response formula by testing

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.170
for the first order derivative.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.560
And if that test
failed, you would

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.290
be going to higher orders.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.190
And then, given an
initial condition,

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.010
how to basically
sketch the function

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.080
and have a physical
understanding of what

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.500
the resonance means.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.650
That ends this recitation.
