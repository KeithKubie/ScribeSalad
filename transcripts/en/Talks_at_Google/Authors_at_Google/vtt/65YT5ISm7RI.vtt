[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.050
DAVE: Thank you,
everyone, for joining.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.980
I'm pleased to introduce our
guest today, Ryan Williams.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.600
He's the author,
keynote speaker,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.700
and former stand up comedian.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.160
So ask him some questions.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.830
He's a funny guy and
apparently a good writer.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.380
He authored his book, "The
Influencer Economy," which

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.200
is a top seller on Amazon,
and he teaches readers

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.020
how to launch their stories,
collaborate with influencers,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.729
and thrive in the digital age.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:36.270
Ryan's work has been featured
in "Inc." magazine, "Huffington

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.800
Post," "The Observer," "Business
Insider," and "USA Today."

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.980
He also has a podcast called
"The Influencer Economy," which

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.640
he can talk about, as well.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.030
And then he was also on
the early social media

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.820
team at DigiSynd, which
was acquired by Disney,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.100
and Machinima, acquired
for Warner Bros.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.780
So thank you, Ryan,
for being here.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.780
And he's also pretty
good at basketball,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.850
and you can see him
shooting hoops over

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.610
at Venice High School
gym on Wednesday nights.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.681
So with that, thank
you, Ryan, for joining.

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.086
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.907
RYAN WILLIAMS: Thank you, Dave.

00:01:09.907 --> 00:01:10.490
Hey, everyone.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.980
How's it going today?

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.660
Just to give you
some background here,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.790
Dave has a really
good reverse lay up

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.580
under the hoop at
the Venice High Gym

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.660
every Wednesday, which you can
feel free to come watch us.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.530
We never have anyone
in the audience,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.800
so it would be a complete shock.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.790
And as Dave mentioned, I'm
a former stand up comedian.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.970
So I wanted to ask you to give
yourselves a round of applause

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.310
for being out today.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.550
You could be anywhere.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.502
You watching at home,
thank you for tuning in.

00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:41.710
And it's a little known fact.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.210
When you do stand
up comedy, you may

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.400
notice that, when a
performer goes on stage

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.950
and you're in the crowd, the
comedian always says give it up

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.400
for the last performer.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.147
And side note, you always want
to start off with applause,

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:53.980
because then if you
bomb, at the very least,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.240
you felt good for five seconds
when you started your talk.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.500
So I wrote the book "The
Influencer Economy--

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.630
How to Launch Your Idea,
Share it With the World,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.070
and Thrive in the Digital Age."

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.000
So as I have been
researching influence

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.360
over the last few years, I've
understood that true influence

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.190
comes through collaboration.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.775
And on the two ends
of the spectrum,

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:15.400
when you want to
think about influence,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.090
there's being alone, building
in a garage, in a silo,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.730
in your office,
and collaboration,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.000
working with others.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.250
And the more you collaborate--

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.830
or as they say in the
YouTube world, collab--

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.530
then that's where the
influence happens.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.781
So today we'll be talking
about this on many levels,

00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:34.780
and I'd love to get started
if you're all ready.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.110
Grumpy Cat-- who here is not
familiar with Grumpy Cat?

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.780
So everyone here is aware
of Grumpy Cat, right?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.130
Grumpy Cat is a meme.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.860
Grumpy Cat looks
like a grumpy person,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.890
and it was started on Reddit
thread many years ago.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.960
This is the original
photo of Grumpy Cat,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.420
and then it became
a large scale meme.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.130
I went to South by Southwest
a couple of years ago.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.850
There was a line of 75 people
to take selfies with Grumpy Cat.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.740
Grumpy Cat-- little known
fact-- gets over $10,000

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.466
for appearance fees.

00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:11.590
Another little known fact--

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.250
Grumpy Cat has a manager.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.520
There is a meme
manager out there

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.520
that has Grumpy Cat
under its umbrella,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.260
and Grumpy Cat looks
authentic, right?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.526
And authenticity pays
in the digital economy.

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:25.900
So today, I'd love
to talk to you

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.180
about how to tell
your stories, how

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.550
to tell your bad ass stories.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.440
At the end of the
talk, the last few

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.700
slides I'll be giving you
a framework for how do

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.061
you tell your bad ass stories.

00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:37.810
So feel free-- if
you're watching at home,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.120
get a pen and paper,
as well as in the crowd

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.660
here at Google, because I'm
giving you an actual framework

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.650
for telling bad ass stories
to help you get a promotion,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.886
to help you generate
sales leads,

00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:51.760
and to help you to launch
your business idea.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.160
When talking about storytelling,
I realized through my podcast

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.505
I've collected
over 100 interviews

00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:01.880
with some of the
top best selling

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.910
authors, globally
renowned YouTubers,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.400
and amazing podcasters.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.900
And I found that everyone needs
three stories in their pocket

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.380
at all times.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.970
And most of us, the majority
of us, nearly all of us

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.890
undervalue our stories.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.070
We let the boss tell our
story to their superior

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.290
and then wonder why we
didn't get that raise.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.140
We think that our sales
rep understands the story

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.300
to close the deal,
but little do you

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.330
know that you've got no revenues
because the sales rep couldn't

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.770
pitch the business.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.299
Or even worse, you think your
significant other gets you,

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:38.840
and you're surprised
when they're not

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.464
in your brain to
understand what you're

00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:41.840
thinking when you're mad.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.930
So the three stories that I'll
talk about today that everyone

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.240
needs in their pocket
are what I call

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.190
your underdog story,
your bad ass authority

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.370
story, and your fixer story.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.560
The first story is the underdog.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.000
Think about Rudy.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.490
Think about walking
on to Notre Dame.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.890
Think about having no
background in football,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.660
and suddenly you're
on the field.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.420
The underdog story is
when you're an outsider

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.860
and you become an insider.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.750
It's when you have an
outsider perspective.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.690
You're an underdog,
and you succeed.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.865
David and Goliath is a
great example of this.

00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:17.240
And all of us-- when I worked
for startups like Machinima

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.000
and DigiSynd that were acquired
by Warner Brothers and Disney,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.430
all of our founders
had such great stories

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.920
about being the disruptor.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.490
Google itself-- you all
acquire many companies,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.820
and those startups often
have that outsider story.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.940
They're raging against
the machine, if you will.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.270
And Brene Brown is my example
for the bad ass authority

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.510
story.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.420
Google Talks, TED Talks--

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.960
we all know people come
in to teach you something.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.630
And a true word of
mouth marketing pro

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.350
will leave you with
three things to remember,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.610
because things in our brain
process through three.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.930
For example, I have
three bad ass stories.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.120
That's for a reason--

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.340
because we process that way.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.370
And a bad ass story, whether
it's a TED Talk or a Google

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.900
Talk, happens in a way where
we are showing our authority

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.990
by teaching, and instructing,
and giving people

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.370
something to remember.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.350
They can tell their
spouse, their client

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.940
to refer you for business--

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.290
their co-founder.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.480
And that's where true
authority comes from--

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.080
through instructing others.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.440
And then finally, we have
Winston Wolfe from "Pulp

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.320
Fiction," and he's the fixer.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.210
He helps do all the dirty work.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.120
And your fixer story is when
you talk about solving problems

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.950
for other people, and that's
how, when you become a bad ass,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.430
you don't mention six figures
and how much money you make.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.520
A side note-- I went to
a dinner the other week,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.902
and one of the guys next to
me-- it's always a guy, right?

00:06:48.902 --> 00:06:49.860
I said, what do you do?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.420
And he says, I make six figures.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.380
And I wanted to just walk away
immediately, and drop my fork,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.535
and spill my beer
on him, but then I

00:06:58.535 --> 00:07:00.160
made the mistake of
asking a follow up.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.050
And I said, how do you do that?

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.460
He said-- no joke--

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.950
I make six figures helping
business people who make

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.350
six figures make seven figures.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.850
And I was just like,
oh my god, this

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.410
is the worst type
of person I want

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.480
to be around at a
networking event.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.660
So that's not what a fixer is.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.990
A fixer is someone
who solves problems.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.850
A fixer is someone who actually
tells you who the customer is.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.500
It's often like "Mad Libs."

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.660
I help people do blank.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.790
I help people tell stories.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.910
I help people learn how
to use Google AdSense.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.580
I help people watching at home
to share videos on Facebook,

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.490
which I hope you
do with this video.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.730
So everyone needs three bad
ass stories in their pocket

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.090
anytime anywhere.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.010
I'm going to show you
how to do this later,

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.660
but in the meantime, let's
have an interactive part

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.100
of the talk.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.810
This is my family
growing up circa 1992

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.470
in the blistering cold
winter of Des Moines, Iowa.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.280
Now, just to have a
second here to pause,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.980
is my family photo that went
out to all of our friends

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.680
that my mom posed
in our driveway--

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.980
see her wreath in the back?

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.000
She's very proud of that.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.750
Is this authentic?

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.050
Do you think it's authentic?

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.050
You don't think it's-- a
hater in the front row.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.967
I love these people.

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:18.300
I love when you get someone
who just says no right away,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.754
and then you're like, all right.

00:08:19.754 --> 00:08:20.670
So it's not authentic.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.856
Why?

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:22.925
AUDIENCE: It's set up.

00:08:22.925 --> 00:08:24.050
RYAN WILLIAMS: It's set up.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.920
Right.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.929
What do you think?

00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:27.845
AUDIENCE: I think the
expressions on the faces

00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:28.974
are authentic.

00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:31.390
RYAN WILLIAMS: The expressions
on the faces are authentic.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.564
So you're not saying no,
but you're not saying yes.

00:08:35.564 --> 00:08:37.486
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
even if it's staged

00:08:37.486 --> 00:08:39.902
you can't get kids to do exactly
what you want them to do.

00:08:39.902 --> 00:08:42.674
So there's some element
of authenticity in it.

00:08:42.674 --> 00:08:45.090
RYAN WILLIAMS: There's some
element of authenticity to it.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.470
And do you know which one is me?

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.352
People sometimes get confused.

00:08:48.352 --> 00:08:49.439
AUDIENCE: Middle.

00:08:49.439 --> 00:08:50.730
RYAN WILLIAMS: Bottom left, no.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.987
Middle, yes.

00:08:51.987 --> 00:08:53.570
The bottom left is
my younger brother,

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.010
who looks like he took a
hockey puck to the face.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.570
He has no teeth.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.650
So is this authentic?

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.810
Again, please feel free to come
up to the front of the stage.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.310
Yes?

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.240
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.406
RYAN WILLIAMS: You think so.

00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:05.096
Why is that?

00:09:05.096 --> 00:09:06.554
AUDIENCE: Because
it's got the kind

00:09:06.554 --> 00:09:08.547
of lighthearted warm
feeling that you

00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:11.012
get when something
kind of candid happens.

00:09:11.012 --> 00:09:13.970
And candid is very authentic.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.109
It's the expression of
the moment as it happened.

00:09:17.109 --> 00:09:18.900
Whether this was staged
by your mom or not,

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.161
it was kind of an authentic
happening in that time.

00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:24.410
RYAN WILLIAMS: So it's candid.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.370
It's in the moment.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.750
It's staged by my mom.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.220
I have an authentic face.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.360
I am an awkward middle child
still, and at that moment,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.400
I was not self-aware
of who I was.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.090
So my older brother
just cracked a joke

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.210
because the photographer,
Virginia, had backed up

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.310
and stepped in dog poop.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.430
And my brother made a joke about
it, but he's a cool teenager.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.250
So he knows that he's got
to have his game face on,

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.850
but I feel like I could be
the most authentic person here

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.592
because I'm laughing
at the joke.

00:09:54.592 --> 00:09:56.300
But anyone else on
this side of the room?

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.220
Is this authentic?

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.339
And what do you think?

00:09:58.339 --> 00:09:59.214
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:09:59.214 --> 00:10:01.530
AUDIENCE: You always wore
red sweaters [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.880
RYAN WILLIAMS: Always, always.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.088
And you could see our breath.

00:10:04.088 --> 00:10:05.730
It's so cold outside.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.814
So when we all got pneumonia
afterwards, thanks, mom.

00:10:08.814 --> 00:10:10.980
AUDIENCE: It's authentic
to me because it reminds me

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.234
of my own family photos that my
mom would've taken growing up.

00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:17.125
So in my own point of
view, it looks authentic.

00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:18.500
RYAN WILLIAMS: It
looks authentic

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.740
because she can relate to it,
because her family tortured her

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.160
through pleated khaki
pants, matching red sweaters

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.100
and turtlenecks in the
blistering cold of Iowa.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.890
And anyone watching from
home on YouTube, please

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.240
leave a comment--

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.510
and I will interact with
everyone in the comments--

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.100
to tell me if my
family was authentic.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.520
Because I think everyone
here was right in a way.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.250
It's framed, which
seems inauthentic,

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.560
but our expressions
are authentic.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.350
And meanwhile, I just kicked my
younger brother in the shins,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.290
and he had punched me in the
stomach, and that's authentic.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.810
You can't manufacture that
type of brotherly authenticity

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.140
around the world.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.680
So again, please leave
a comment in YouTube

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.390
if you're watching
this because what

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.950
I call this is being
inauthentically authentic.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.350
And as storytellers,
we all need to think

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.430
about how to be real when
telling our same story again,

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.990
and again, and again.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.040
Who here works in sales?

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.640
How many times a day do
you pitch the same story?

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.560
A week, a month.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.380
And you rehearse that story.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.580
And we all need to
consider ourselves

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.420
that we work in sales,
and we're selling

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.840
ourself, because storytelling
can help you reinvent

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.660
your career, can help
you get that promotion,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.270
and it can help you
launch your idea.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.480
And it's not about
the elevator pitch.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.700
We're not here to talk
into a confined elevator

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.040
where I get 20
seconds to pitch you.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.510
I hate getting pitched.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.850
Coming back to South by
Southwest, where I went--

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.260
I used to go every year.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.130
People pitch you all the time,
and it's like clammy hands

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:51.710
central.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.080
People talking to you-- they
give you business cards.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.350
You throw a third of them
away, and ultimately people

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.780
don't know how to
network in a lot of ways,

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.640
because they think
they need to pitch you,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.720
and they're only going
to get 30 seconds.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.780
And if you can't get
a conversation going

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.210
with someone, it's not
worth telling a story.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.000
I recommend that you
consider that, when

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.420
someone wants to hear your
story, you're collaborating.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.240
And you want them to
opt in to your story.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.510
You want them to reciprocate,
and you're not pitching them.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.810
It's not a one way street,
because stories are connecting.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:29.635
And I recommend everyone have a
20 minute conversational story.

00:12:29.635 --> 00:12:31.010
And that's really--
I interviewed

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.450
a lot of Hollywood
screenwriters,

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.606
and Oscar nominated
directors, and people

00:12:35.606 --> 00:12:36.980
that are working
in entertainment

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.140
that pitch studios.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.840
And they said a 20 minute
conversational story

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.815
is the threshold
where you can actually

00:12:43.815 --> 00:12:46.190
make a difference in Hollywood
to get someone's attention

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.519
to get that next
meeting or opportunity.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.310
And when you think
about your storytelling,

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.700
you need to put yourself in
the other person's shoes.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.830
My dad gave me great advice
when I was interviewing

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.390
for jobs after college.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.140
And he says, when
you're in the interview,

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.710
don't let them ask
questions to you.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.780
You need to ask
questions to them.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.500
What's in it for them?

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.610
Everyone has a massive
ego, and people

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.780
love to talk about themselves.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.780
So if you can hear
their stories--

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.030
I mean, how many times have
you walked away from a job

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.250
interview where you've said--

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.860
that person says,
I really liked you,

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.232
and all you did was to listen
to them the whole time,

00:13:23.232 --> 00:13:24.940
and all they did was
talk about how great

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.520
they were, and all you
did was silently nod,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.690
or say I want to hear more, or
say thank you for sharing that?

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.414
Because ultimately,
storytelling works both ways.

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:36.580
And when you're in the right
room at the right time,

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.237
you need to tell
different stories,

00:13:38.237 --> 00:13:39.820
and you can't rely
on the same stories

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.190
over again because
people want to hear

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.800
different elements of
your life, and your story,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.480
and your work at the right time.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.770
So this is my story right now.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:56.120
It's funny, because I got laid
off from a big corporation--

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.260
Disney.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.250
And there's no photos on
Facebook of me depressed

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.750
at work getting laid off.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.160
You don't capture that.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.100
So I did a little freelancing
with my Photoshop skills,

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.750
and that's the parking lot where
I cried after getting laid off

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.100
from Disney.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.940
And I was ashamed with my
box of belongings in my car,

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.450
not wanting to call my wife
for fear of what she'd say.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.000
And I ended up going
to a Burbank taqueria

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.330
and drinking a margarita with
another guy who was laid off.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.190
Ultimately, I got a better job.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.560
Two weeks later I
started at Machinima.com,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.810
which is a big YouTube partner.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.570
And who here, just
out of curiosity,

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.820
has been fired or laid off?

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.280
Who here is not
telling the truth?

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.820
Who here just has had
the same job at Google

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.900
for their whole life?

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.010
One person.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.100
Two people.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.600
And if you're watching on
YouTube in the comments,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.730
tell me if you've
been laid off or fired

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.710
and where you've been
laid off or fired,

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.540
because ultimately
we're all going

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.160
to be rejected in our life.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.080
We're all going to go
through reinvention,

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.436
and for that moment in the
parking lot when I cried,

00:15:06.436 --> 00:15:08.310
there's nothing better
than getting laid off,

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.559
getting severance, and then
finding a new job, getting

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:11.747
a raise, and double dipping.

00:15:11.747 --> 00:15:14.330
For those of you that have been
laid off, when you double dip,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.550
you feel like a pro.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.190
You're like, I
worked the system.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.490
I totally had this moment where
I failed, but then I succeeded.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.710
In storytelling,
when we're bad asses

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:27.720
and we're trying to frame these
moments that we're authentic,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.780
that failure really
can become a positive.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.850
And so most of us
undervalue our stories.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.390
The majority of people--

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.180
they truly undervalue
their stories,

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.880
because they're worried
about taking credit perhaps,

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.815
or they don't want
to be braggadocios,

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.690
or they don't want to
be inauthentic and seem

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.480
like they're cheesy
or too salesy.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.310
And oftentimes,
these low moments

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.160
in our life, these underdog
moments when you rise up

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.380
are truly bad ass moments.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.710
So when you have
your bad ass story--

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:59.290
and consider this as an
exercise with your customers,

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.150
with your network, or
with your peers at Google,

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.510
but you need to think
about your story audience.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.400
And I don't recommend you
think about reaching everyone

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.960
with your stories.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.680
I highly suggest
you think about 11%

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.274
of your customer base, your
network, or your community.

00:16:17.274 --> 00:16:18.690
And I'll tell you
in a minute why,

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.200
but for starters, you have to
think about your collaborators.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.640
Your collaborators are
10% of your network.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.960
This is based initially and
inspired by an early 2000 study

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.090
about what made Wikipedia work.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.610
And Wikipedia-- we all
use it to this day--

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.170
is actually only written
by 1% of internet users.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:42.000
And 10% of the community
edits Wikipedia, and 89% of us

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.470
are lurkers.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.470
So in this room, all
of us are lurkers.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.810
And when you think about
telling your story,

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.580
presenting yourself
to the world,

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.820
talking about your business,
the collaborators--

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.460
these are the people that
I call your bar regulars.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.949
They're your network.

00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:59.490
They're your weak
ties that you maybe

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.530
met through an acquaintance
that can help you

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.294
open doors for new channels.

00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:05.460
And they're the people that
organize the happy hour.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:05.970
You come.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.079
You bring Dave.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.550
He brings three friends.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.530
He brings his team from Google.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.804
And then you spread your
word of mouth that way.

00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:14.220
Whenever you're
looking for a job,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.469
what's the first thing you do?

00:17:15.469 --> 00:17:18.250
When I got laid off
by Disney, I hit up

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.490
Machinima, who was
a client of mine.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.711
And I asked them if
they had openings?

00:17:22.711 --> 00:17:23.460
It's funny, right?

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.200
When you get laid off, you
have to frame your story.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.280
How do I say that I'm
in between opportunities

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.000
without saying that
they told me to go away?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.040
And those collaborators
are the people

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.660
to prove your concept out.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.220
And then there are
the influencers.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.845
And I'm not talking
about Instagrammers

00:17:39.845 --> 00:17:42.930
that get a bunch of likes, these
no talent zeros that look sexy

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:43.800
in blue jeans.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.330
I'm not talking about these
one percenters on YouTube.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.870
I'm talking about the
people that can make change

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.700
and that are game
changers for you

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.820
because they're able to
open doors, generate leads

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.280
for your business, make the
right connections for you

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.290
to further enhance your career.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.240
And you need to think
about 11% of the community.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:07.620
Who here watches YouTube videos
with professional YouTubers?

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.384
You subscribe to channels.

00:18:09.384 --> 00:18:10.300
You watch the content.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.840
They put it out consistently.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.380
So the YouTube phenomenon
about collaboration--

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.730
it's called collabing.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.880
Anyone here familiar
with that word.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.880
I imagine people
watching on YouTube are.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.340
So collabing is when you share
your story on another YouTubers

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.400
channel, and then they
come on your channel

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.080
to collab and share their story.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.560
So who here has
a hobby that they

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.960
would be willing to pretend
like they had a YouTube

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.164
channel about?

00:18:37.164 --> 00:18:37.830
You right there.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.750
Do you have a hobby that
we could talk about?

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.425
RYAN WILLIAMS: Zero hobbies.

00:18:41.425 --> 00:18:42.490
AUDIENCE: Zero hobbies.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.550
RYAN WILLIAMS: And
you work at Google?

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.396
AUDIENCE: Yeah, very boring.

00:18:44.396 --> 00:18:44.896
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:44.896 --> 00:18:46.162
RYAN WILLIAMS: Wow.

00:18:46.162 --> 00:18:47.144
Yeah?

00:18:47.144 --> 00:18:49.110
AUDIENCE: I'm and
illustrator and a painter.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.550
RYAN WILLIAMS: So let's say you
have an illustration channel.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.370
What's your name?

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.050
AUDIENCE: Alex.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.610
RYAN WILLIAMS: So Alex has
Alex's paint guru YouTube

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.390
channel--

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.610
100,000 subscribers.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.350
Anyone here into art, as well.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.616
What's your name?

00:19:03.616 --> 00:19:04.290
AUDIENCE: Khari.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.165
RYAN WILLIAMS: Khari.

00:19:05.165 --> 00:19:07.500
What kind of art?

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.000
AUDIENCE: Graffiti art.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.382
RYAN WILLIAMS: What find of art?

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:11.340
AUDIENCE: Graffiti aft.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.219
Yeah, that's great.

00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:14.760
Can you talk to the guy next to
you to give him some hobbies?

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.590
That's a really cool hobby.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.080
So we have a
YouTube channel here

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.420
with a million subscribers.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.670
So Alex's graffiti channel--

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.417
and you all are going
to collab, which

00:19:26.417 --> 00:19:28.500
means you're going to go
in each other's channels.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.640
Even though your channel over
here has 100,000, that's OK.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.890
It's a very focused community.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.320
It's niche, and even though your
graffiti channel is very broad,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.420
it doesn't matter.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.310
The majority of
YouTubers are givers.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.470
They want to open up
doors and channels,

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.350
and they want to lend
their influence to others.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.840
And true collaboration
happens when

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.320
you're able to tell your
stories to other folks that

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.672
then can share your
story to their networks.

00:19:54.672 --> 00:19:56.130
And as I mentioned
before, you want

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.842
to opt in with your stories.

00:19:57.842 --> 00:19:59.550
You don't want to spam
people like you're

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.580
posting frictionless
information on Facebook.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.680
If you can tell me a great
Facebook conversation

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.388
you have where you
change someone's mind,

00:20:06.388 --> 00:20:08.650
I'll give you $100 on the spot.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.400
But when you want to collaborate
with people, you opt in.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.620
So the collab happens
where you make a video,

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.050
say, three minutes long.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.010
You make a video
three minutes long.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.259
You're in each other's videos.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.350
They're separate videos.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.390
They go to those
separate audiences,

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.870
and then you drive subscribers,
and likes, and community to one

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.740
another.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.900
The million subscribed
graffiti channel--

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.450
you're opening up to a broad
audience with this 100,000

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.280
subscribed channel
over here, but you're

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.950
getting more of a niche
audience with this art channel.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.260
And that's really how
the internet works,

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.980
and how you surface yourself
above the fray with your Amazon

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.530
book, your YouTube channel,
your Instagram page.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.615
It's collabing.

00:20:44.615 --> 00:20:45.990
So metaphorically
speaking, think

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.209
about that with your network.

00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:49.500
There's a great book I
recommend called "Give and Take"

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.660
by Adam Grant, and
he was kind enough

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.670
to leave a blurb on
the back of my book.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.240
He talks about givers,
and takers, and matchers.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.380
And anyone familiar
with this book?

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.290
It's a great book, and
I recommend reading it

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.680
after you read my book.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.970
And we can start a book
club if you'd like?

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.160
Ryan@influencereconomy.com
if you'd

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.510
like to join the book club,
and it will be global.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.040
Ultimately, there's givers,
takers, and matchers.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.380
Most of us are matchers, right?

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.930
You help me, I help
you-- survival.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.320
Scratch my back, I'll
scratch your back.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.354
And then there's the takers,
which we all have to work with,

00:21:26.354 --> 00:21:28.770
which I think this guy over
here may be a taker because he

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.460
was very judgmental about
my family being inauthentic.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.450
Sorry, not sorry.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.840
And so takers you have
to work with, right?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.800
And givers-- so givers are
people that succeed the most,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.630
and they fail the most.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.900
Giving with purpose
is how you succeed.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.260
Giving with your own
self interests aligned

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.597
is how you succeed.

00:21:53.597 --> 00:21:55.930
And that's where Adam's
research really comes into play.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.730
So think about that with
your 10% collaborators.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.930
So this is a globally
renowned TV host,

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.280
and you may not recognize Oprah.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.110
This is back when her
show was only in Chicago

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.350
and not nationally syndicated.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:15.400
And she's wearing extremely
tight skinny jeans.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.670
And what I think
about authenticity

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.580
is it's when your
actions match your words.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.970
On my podcast, I've talked
to some legendary authors,

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.734
and YouTubers, and people
with a lot of influence.

00:22:26.734 --> 00:22:28.650
And I always ask them,
what is your definition

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.940
of authenticity?

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.690
And what I surmised is your
actions match your words.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:38.400
And why Oprah is important here
is she skinnied herself down.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.240
She lost 60-some pounds to
fit into these blue jeans.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.234
She actually now
regrets this episode

00:22:44.234 --> 00:22:46.650
because she didn't want her
to find her self worth through

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.020
whether or not she
could fit in blue jeans,

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.020
but ultimately she brought
out a bunch of fat and gristle

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.800
from a steak to show in a Ziploc
bag all the weight she lost.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.230
What happened in that moment
was Oprah allowed people

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.640
into her story, and
true authenticity--

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.890
the ability to tell your
bad ass story, the ability

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.230
to grow yourself
and your work comes

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.830
from letting people
in to your story,

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.150
giving them behind the curtain.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.620
If you make a mistake, it's OK
because don't worry about it.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.984
We're all imperfect.

00:23:16.984 --> 00:23:18.650
The second thing about
Oprah that I love

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.780
is she thought about
her story audience,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.280
and she had an avatar,
a character in her mind

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.630
that she had is a
Midwest housewife, Susie.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.690
So she said, what's
in it for Susie?

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.910
What will Susie get
out of the show?

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.360
What will Susie take
away from this episode?

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.095
And every episode she
did was for Susie.

00:23:39.095 --> 00:23:41.345
So think about when you're
telling your story-- you're

00:23:41.345 --> 00:23:43.160
in a sales pitch
at Google, working

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.250
in trying to get a new client.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.580
Who is your Susie?

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.830
Put yourself in their
shoes, and what story

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.170
can you collaborate
on to share with them?

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.620
And finally, true
collabing happens

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.870
when you work with others
to share platforms,

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.030
and opportunities,
and connections.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.580
She really took
off to superstardom

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.590
when Meryl Streep, the Bush's,
the Obamas, Tom Hanks--

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.220
all these A-list celebrities
came on her show,

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.580
and they became able to grow
their platform and hers.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.970
She really collaborated
with influencers.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.620
So you think about this
in context of your work.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.050
Try to find the Oprah
of your business.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.592
None of us will be the Oprah
of our business necessarily,

00:24:23.592 --> 00:24:25.550
but find those influencers
to present our story

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.200
to that really can
move the needle

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.970
like she does for other people.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.810
So these are your
three bad ass stories--

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.570
the underdog, the bad
ass, and the fixer.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.940
So a story that connects
you to an emotional level

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.510
is the underdog, specifically
when you overcame an obstacle.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.180
The bad ass displays
your expertise

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.860
in your specific field that
you can teach others about.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.930
And finally, the fixer--

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.346
it shares a problem
you're solving

00:24:48.346 --> 00:24:51.560
with a current customer, or it
presents your business thesis

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.250
or vision.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.250
The underdog story--

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.010
I want to tell you about your
bad ass story as an underdog--

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:02.100
Rocky, Philadelphia-- anyone
here from Philadelphia?

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.210
Back there, right?

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.680
Champion of the underdog.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.690
Eagles just won the Super Bowl.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.980
Ultimate underdog story.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.730
Rocky-- and Sylvester
Stallone-- a little known fact--

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:12.899
he packaged the deal.

00:25:12.899 --> 00:25:14.940
He wrote the screenplay
for "Rocky"-- did you all

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.890
know this?

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.570
And he said, I'm only going
to do it if I act in it,

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.240
and he turned down
money, and other roles,

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.580
and opportunities
because he wanted to act.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.420
And so he was an
underdog himself.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.150
But the underdog story is
when you're the outsider--

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.540
to pitch yourself,
present yourself,

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.240
and you succeeded in
the end, or your thrived

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.190
because you created that
opportunity like an underdog.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.520
I used to call this
story your tear jerker,

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.440
but it got a little too
emotional for people

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.072
because not everyone wants to
talk about emotional moments.

00:25:43.072 --> 00:25:44.280
Because-- little known fact--

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.430
I was a stand up
comedy performer

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:51.330
and simultaneously going
through clinical depression.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.340
And I will let you be
the judge if I was funny

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.310
or not as a depressed
stand up comedian,

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.790
but that is really where
I overcame my obstacle.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.840
I call it my jumping out
of an airplane moment.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.415
I was able to put myself out
there and feel the response

00:26:03.415 --> 00:26:05.040
from the audience,
and it really helped

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.250
me reframe my life to position
myself more in marketing.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.410
Realizing that-- who
here likes Public Enemy?

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.160
There's Chuck D, and
there's Flavor Flav.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.660
And what I realized is
sometimes you're the lyricist,

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.820
like Chuck D, and
sometimes you're

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.340
the hype man, like Flavor Flav.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.160
And we all go back and forth--

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.090
hype man to lyricist,
lyricist to Flavor Flav.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.130
So think about that
as you collaborate

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:35.040
and reach your moments of
sharing your underdog story.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.920
And the bad ass story--

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.440
that is what the stage is for.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.770
Every Google Talk, every TED
Talk-- it's a bad ass story.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.260
I've studied hundreds of them.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.050
What I realized was many of
them start with a tear jerker

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.510
and then roll into
the bad ass authority.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.620
Like, oh I'm an introvert.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.150
Let me tell you how
I'm introverted,

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.490
and let's tell you the
secret of introverts.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:56.960
Let me tell you
how I asked people

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.990
for money begging on the
street, and now here I

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:02.150
am talking about
asking for things

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.010
and how you can do
it for yourself.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.920
So the crux of this
story is Brene Brown.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.790
Anyone familiar with her work?

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.430
She talks a lot
about authenticity,

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.129
and she's a shame expert.

00:27:13.129 --> 00:27:15.170
And she talks about how
shame's on this spectrum,

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.080
and authenticity is
on the other spectrum.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.800
How's everyone
doing, by the way?

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.130
How are we doing at home?

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.870
If you are paying attention
on YouTube, like this video.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.310
Then they'll let me know if
there's 1,000 likes, but Brene

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.360
Brown-- she talks about
shame and authenticity,

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.230
and how we're all built
to not talk about shame.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.450
And so her TED Talk,
and her Google Talks,

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:38.537
many books she's written
are all about those topics.

00:27:38.537 --> 00:27:39.620
And she's an expert in it.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.270
She's done years of research.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.860
So she teaches you something.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.570
Hopefully today
you could take away

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.420
one thing or three things
with your bad ass stories

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.920
to bring to your
teams, your spouse,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.520
your significant others.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.634
And Celeste Headlee, who's
given a Google Talk, as well,

00:27:54.634 --> 00:27:56.300
and many TED Talks--
she talks about how

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.860
to have better conversations.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.630
She's in the red dress up there.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.144
I interviewed her on my
podcast, was a remarkable guest.

00:28:02.144 --> 00:28:04.310
I find the best podcast
guests are fellow podcasters

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.250
or authors because they
know how to frame a story,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.580
and the worst are tech founders.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.086
No offense.

00:28:11.086 --> 00:28:13.460
I don't want to hear about
going to Stanford and building

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.190
a company in your
garage, or how it's--

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.704
like raising venture capital,
or what your product does,

00:28:18.704 --> 00:28:20.120
because unfortunately
that doesn't

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.190
relate to 99% of the country.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.340
And Celeste Headlee
talks about--

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.380
sorry to bash tech founders in
the room, but Celeste Headlee--

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.810
she says there's three ways
to tell stories and converse,

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.350
and they come across
through body language,

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:38.600
through vocabulary, and
through physical language.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.640
And so email is
really inefficient,

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.920
because I only get
your vocabulary.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.780
And picking up the
phone's much better.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.700
Who here works in
sales and knows

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.702
to close you call
because you get the tone?

00:28:50.702 --> 00:28:52.160
And finally, body
language-- that's

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.410
why we want to meet
people in person.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.630
And the fixer story--

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:00.340
Olivia Pope, the ultimate
fixer, Winston Wolfe

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.280
from "Pulp Fiction,"
the ultimate fixer.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.030
Who here watches "Scandal"
or has seen "Pulp Fiction?"

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.240
So the majority of the room
in America has most likely.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.800
So the fixer is, how am I
solving problems for people?

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.285
And not how much money I make,
not six figures guy or gal.

00:29:16.285 --> 00:29:19.300
And definitely not what
your client base is.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.090
That can help sometimes
for some social proof,

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.640
but you want to say I
help people do blank.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.740
Think about the
context of what you do

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.000
based on how you help others.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.930
So Dave, how would you
frame your work based

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.220
on I help people do blank?

00:29:36.425 --> 00:29:38.630
DAVE: I help companies
better understand

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.555
what's going on in their
website so that they

00:29:40.555 --> 00:29:43.296
can sell more
product to users that

00:29:43.296 --> 00:29:44.924
find it valuable and helpful.

00:29:44.924 --> 00:29:46.840
RYAN WILLIAMS: So Dave
helps people understand

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.880
their website, and
he's making you more

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.730
money in the long run, right?

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.410
Dave, I'll write you
a check right now.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.640
That was a great sales pitch.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.270
So when you think about your
context of how you help others,

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:02.130
it's often based on
I'm providing value,

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.120
and I'm not going to
give you a dollar amount,

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.703
or I'm not going to
show you-- you all

00:30:05.703 --> 00:30:08.440
know these YouTubers that
talk about in their garage

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.060
and their Ferraris.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.770
They talk about
how rich they are.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.320
The whole self-help business
world is all about, oh,

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.960
I got laid off from my job, and
my girlfriend broke up with me,

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.390
and then I made a bunch
of money on LinkedIn.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.165
Those are not true
bad ass stories,

00:30:21.165 --> 00:30:23.290
because if you tell me that
you have to make money,

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.700
then you're not a bad ass.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.426
Sorry.

00:30:26.426 --> 00:30:28.900
So think about also the
truth in what you do,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.950
and we're going to go a
couple more slides here,

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.020
and then we'll get into
the framework for how

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.910
to tell the bad ass stories.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.890
So find the truth
in what you do.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.020
Who here has studied
improvisation?

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.810
We're based in LA.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.420
There's a lot of comedy here.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.740
Del Close is a great
improviser based out

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.500
of Second City, which
many "Saturday Night Live"

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.062
castmates have come from.

00:30:49.062 --> 00:30:50.770
And they talk about
the truth in what you

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:53.290
do when you're doing improv.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.775
True humor as a storyteller
isn't when you have punchlines.

00:30:56.775 --> 00:30:58.150
How many of you
have told a story

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.525
where you thought it was really
funny and no one laughed?

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:02.580
And then you're like,
oh, that's really--

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.413
yeah, I'm going to leave
the room right now.

00:31:04.413 --> 00:31:06.550
Exit stage left because
you didn't laugh.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.204
True humor comes out of stories
when you have a funny story,

00:31:09.204 --> 00:31:11.120
and you have moments
where people could laugh,

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.809
and if they don't laugh, then
you move on with yourself.

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:15.350
So we all have great
stories, and you

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.800
want to bring people
in, introduce conflict,

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.190
let them often figure
out the final answers.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.820
Using myself as a Guinea pig, I
mentioned I did stand up comedy

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.910
while I was depressed, and I let
you be the judge if I was funny

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.170
or not.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.620
Half the room probably thought
I was a typical comedian.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.990
Other half probably thought
I was a walking zombie,

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.810
but you don't have
to solve conflicts.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:37.960
And always be aware
of how awesome

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.610
you are, how much of
a bad ass you are,

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.900
and think about the word choice.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.680
And this is my father-in-law.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.890
Who here is married,
and has an in-law,

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.332
and knows how complicated those
types of relationships are?

00:31:51.332 --> 00:31:53.290
So my father-in-law has
a boiler repair company

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:54.150
in North Carolina.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:55.810
I live in California.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:58.210
And he wants to know what
the influencer economy is,

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.000
and what Machinima is, and
what YouTube videos do,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.100
and how these startups
that have so much value

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.640
don't make any money.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.210
These are obvious questions
that we should answer,

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.370
but with him I
asked him, you know,

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:13.360
what is your secret as a boiler
repair operator and owner

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.050
in Raleigh, North Carolina?

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.200
He says, you've got
to solve pain points.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.908
So when you think
about your storytelling

00:32:18.908 --> 00:32:21.250
to pitch your business,
yourself, or your work,

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.010
what is the pain point
your story is solving.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:27.010
How boring are you if you're
listening to someone talk--

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.114
or you're on the receiving
end of a story with no point?

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:31.780
So what are you solving
for that person?

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.610
Do they want to laugh?

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:33.820
Do they want to
hear you so they can

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.430
help you and tell their friends
that you need a new job?

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.980
Do they want to become someone
who's buying your product

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.720
and increase your sales?

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.240
And he says that he was very
good at developing a knowledge

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.690
or skill that he could tell
people just enough about to fix

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.150
their boiler, but
not enough that they

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.190
could do it on their own.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.740
Joe Moore over there,
father-in-law--

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.960
father-in-law of the year
if you're watching, Joe.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.939
And so he talked about how
the boilers are-- people--

00:33:00.939 --> 00:33:03.230
an industry where they think
they can do it themselves.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.938
How many of you all
have clients in sales

00:33:04.938 --> 00:33:06.667
that they think they
can not hire you,

00:33:06.667 --> 00:33:08.500
and then you give them
a little information,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.026
a free consultation,
and a phone call,

00:33:11.026 --> 00:33:12.650
and then they call
you up a week later?

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.674
Oh my god, I need you
to optimize my website.

00:33:14.674 --> 00:33:17.090
I totally want to make more
money, and I dropped the ball.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.455
We're now losing money.

00:33:18.455 --> 00:33:21.080
So he talks about you've got to
develop this knowledge or skill

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.820
and then share it
with people, which

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.040
why all these principles,
through collaboration

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.237
and influence, are
available online and offline

00:33:28.237 --> 00:33:28.820
for all of us.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.900
This isn't just an
online marketing program.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.060
And empathy-- over
the last year,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.840
many CEOs and executives
at large corporations

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.150
have talked about
the need for empathy.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:44.750
And with our online world
becoming very negative

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:49.160
at times, with our culture
at times being cynical,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.660
and with our
leadership being driven

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.250
by the bottom line
at companies, empathy

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.640
is important across the board.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.550
It's no longer going to
be just a nice to have.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.120
It will be a must have.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.290
And I interviewed Billy
Ray, who is a screenwriter.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.280
He wrote "Hunger Games,"
was nominated for an Oscar.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.120
And he told me when he
pitches in Hollywood

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.697
he needs to figure out what's
in the other guy's shoes.

00:34:11.697 --> 00:34:14.030
The other guy in the table,
the other gal in the table--

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.529
what kind of shoes
are they wearing?

00:34:15.529 --> 00:34:16.790
What do they want to hear?

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.206
And I want you to have empathy
for the other people you're

00:34:19.206 --> 00:34:21.409
talking to when you
present your story,

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.739
and more importantly,
have empathy for yourself,

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:26.270
because we are so judgmental
about our own stories.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.880
And we're so judgmental about
how we present ourselves.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.280
I sometimes hate
listening to my podcast--

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.080
and I am a podcaster--

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.848
because I can't stand
to hear my voice.

00:34:34.848 --> 00:34:36.639
So many of us don't
like to watch ourselves

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:40.650
talk because we say like, or
um, or modifiers to not say

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:41.900
what we want to say.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.980
So have empathy as you think
about your bad ass stories.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.760
So these are the
three bad ass stories

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.429
that Grumpy Cat is going
to help us to write now.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:55.520
So you watching at
home or you here today,

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.390
you all can hopefully have
takeaway value immediately.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.560
So number one of three things.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.450
Create a mind map.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.290
Anyone here done
a mind map before.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:11.460
A mind map is very good to
visualize problems you have.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:15.180
I recommend creating a visual
representation of what you're

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.180
trying to do, and
having branches

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.390
and connected topics that
remind you of your stories.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.670
So the central idea
is, what's important?

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:25.080
Being a bad ass.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.190
And I did this online.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.980
It's very easy.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.780
There's many mind
mapping programs.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.320
I also do them by
hand, and I wanted

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.870
to not edit this
professionally because this

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.340
is how raw our stories are.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.550
And many of us don't think
we have great stories.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.850
You could be watching this on
YouTube and think I'm only 18.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.716
I don't have any
stories yet, and that's

00:35:43.716 --> 00:35:45.590
where the undervalued
stories come into play.

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.330
So this is, like I mentioned, I
sometimes call the tear jerker

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.060
story, now the underdog.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.560
And so this is where I
went through to figure out

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.270
how to map my story.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.880
And I had a client who is
based out of Minnesota,

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.440
and he did this mind map when
he quit a pre-ROTC program,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.300
and he had lived with
shame in his life.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.720
And he told me figuring
out how to story edit what

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.950
happened allowed him to present
his failure with confidence.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.740
And so when I went
through with my underdog--

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.779
I was laid off.

00:36:14.779 --> 00:36:15.570
You see that point.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.550
I mentioned that story.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.830
I talked about how I
had shame with my wife.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:21.560
I talked about how
I cried in my car.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.780
I went to drink margaritas,
but I found a better job.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.450
So I'm bringing this
together in a way

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.892
to help you understand that
having empathy for yourself

00:36:29.892 --> 00:36:32.100
allows you to understand
that many of these negatives

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.092
can be positives.

00:36:33.092 --> 00:36:34.800
You talk about I was
promoted and demoted

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.740
at Machinima, which
is whole other story.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.740
Over beers we can talk about it.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.000
My stand up comedy career--

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.270
I was a film career lackey.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:43.200
I was a PA.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.210
I sound like an existential
crisis guy, right?

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:45.870
I've done film.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.940
I've done comedy, and
now I do marketing,

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.000
but ultimately I was
depressed in my 20s.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.504
And then here's
another mind map.

00:36:52.504 --> 00:36:54.420
If you want to really
make it more structured,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.590
I recommend mind
mapping your stories.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.950
So if you have a sales pitch,
and you have five stories,

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.590
and you want to figure
out which ones help,

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.630
this is a great
organizational tool.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.320
This is my bad ass story.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.360
And I talk about I'm
a public speaker.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.552
I think that's an
accomplishment.

00:37:09.552 --> 00:37:11.010
I ran marketing at
Machinima, and I

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.730
talk about all the
things I did there.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.580
I performed stand
up comedy 50 times.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.520
And again, using myself
as the Guinea pig here,

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.910
this is how you figure
out what to tell people.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.590
And it's a framework
that makes you understand

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.600
the elements of your
story, because you're

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.330
going to lose focus
sometimes telling your story,

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:28.440
and you may not remember.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.981
So I can look at this mind map
right now before I give a talk

00:37:30.981 --> 00:37:33.120
and understand the
points I need to hit.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.140
So the second point--

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.620
develop five headlines.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.179
Think of yourself as
a blogger, a YouTuber,

00:37:40.179 --> 00:37:41.220
someone creating content.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.930
What are your headlines?

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.340
Talk about in
those headlines how

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.006
you displayed an
expertise in your field

00:37:46.006 --> 00:37:47.100
because you're a bad ass.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.100
Something you could teach others
to help grow your influence

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.810
and help them grow theirs--

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.496
to make an emotional connection.

00:37:53.496 --> 00:37:54.870
And then more
important, you want

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.990
to collab with people
to create word of mouth

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.870
so they could
remember three things,

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.410
or at the very least, one thing.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.570
If you walk out here
today, I failed if you

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:04.970
can't remember one thing.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.172
Hopefully you remember
three bad ass stories,

00:38:07.172 --> 00:38:08.880
and if you didn't,
then I need to go back

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.754
to the drawing board.

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:13.142
So let's just all assume you're
remembering all of this stuff.

00:38:13.142 --> 00:38:14.850
And so and then you
write your headlines.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.380
You practice them.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.110
And you take your friends,
talk to your family,

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.322
your colleagues.

00:38:20.322 --> 00:38:21.780
Think about creating
a trust group.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.970
I always recommend having
accountability friends.

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.610
If you work at a company that's
small, you're an entrepreneur.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:29.100
And find the headlines
that are really compelling.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.980
Go bold, go big, and mash
them up if they don't work.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.520
And so these are my
bad ass headlines.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.800
I performed stand up comedy 500
times, including the improv.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.859
I overcame clinical
depression in my 20s.

00:38:40.859 --> 00:38:42.900
And if you notice, I mash
those two headlines up,

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.000
because on their own, those
stories aren't compelling.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.870
And I don't tell that
story to everyone,

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.720
because not everyone
I meet for 20 minutes

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.900
needs to know that I
struggle through depression.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.450
There are stigmas to it.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.424
Laid off by Disney.

00:38:56.424 --> 00:38:57.090
Cried in my car.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.939
Got a better job in two weeks.

00:38:58.939 --> 00:38:59.730
Launched a podcast.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:00.390
Wrote my book.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.180
So I don't want to just
get into all these moments

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.820
because true bad asses don't
talk about how bad ass they

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.060
are, right?

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.810
But that's where you
need to go with this,

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:13.140
and think about the stories
framing you in a way

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.150
that you're showing people.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.650
You're not telling people.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.110
That's when great scripts
are written in Hollywood

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.450
that show rather than tell.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.210
And if you create a metaphor,
or a visual representation,

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.280
or an example that resonates--

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.240
even acronyms work.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.420
I imagine at Google you
have many, many acronyms

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.030
to help people remember.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:33.180
So my final bad ass headline--

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.902
after a corporate layoff,
I joined Machinima.com.

00:39:35.902 --> 00:39:37.920
Our team launched the
video game "Minecraft"

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.680
before its $2.5 billion exit.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.730
If I talk to anyone
in the world,

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.310
they've heard of "Minecraft."

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:48.060
My book is coming out in
Korean later this year,

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.890
and everyone there
loves "Minecraft."

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:51.180
So that resonates.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.560
And I don't tell you--

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.100
I was not the founder
of the company.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.760
I ran the marketing campaign.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.870
So most of us understand that
we do really awesome things.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:02.600
We truly do bad ass
things, memorable things.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.772
And you could be a smaller
piece of a larger pie,

00:40:05.772 --> 00:40:07.730
and that's where I found
most people undervalue

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:08.970
their stories.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.250
They don't to take credit.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.520
They have some sort
of imposter syndrome

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.500
where they don't
feel like they--

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.930
how many of you feel like you
don't belong telling stories

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.690
because you're not the
one that did all the work?

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.602
And so that's where
the undervalue happens,

00:40:20.602 --> 00:40:22.310
and you can take
something small that you

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.575
did that was memorable, and
impactful, and had influence,

00:40:25.575 --> 00:40:26.700
and share that with others.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.540
And don't be afraid
to be a bad ass.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.280
And then finally,
the third thing.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.510
So we can mind map our ideas.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.440
We write five headlines is
the second element of this.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:41.330
The third thing is
write 20 minutes each.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.670
There's a study out of
UT-Austin that, when something's

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.160
bothering you, if you write
20 minutes of free thought

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.620
about it and don't
even look at it again,

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.090
it will ease your mind.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.520
How many of you use
voice-text recognition?

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.520
You're driving in the car
to remember something,

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.550
and it makes you feel
better because you're not

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:56.966
going to forget
it even though you

00:40:56.966 --> 00:40:58.670
forgot that you recorded it.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.440
That happens to me all the time.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.880
And if you don't feel
comfortable writing speech

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.260
to text, create a
video of yourself

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.510
and think about how
to transcribe it.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.310
Even if you want to
package together,

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.220
write a blog post about it, hire
and editor, because a lot of us

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.260
don't have empathy
for our own stories,

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.690
and we may be self-conscious.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:20.730
But getting that feedback from
other people could be helpful.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.480
And as we close up here,
I want to hearken back

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.230
to my comedy days.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:27.260
This is the improv in Washington
DC, where I performed.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.500
And I got some great advice from
a lot of different comedians,

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.254
including Mitch Hedberg, who,
if you're on YouTube right now,

00:41:33.254 --> 00:41:34.420
you should watch his videos.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.170
He's hilarious.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:39.350
And his advice to me was
always finish your set

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:42.230
and never get let the audience
get in the way of finishing

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.550
your jokes.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:47.150
So when you tell your
stories, have a set order.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.620
Don't freestyle.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.380
The best comedians that do
crowd work and they make

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.410
fun of people in the crowd
have scripted that most likely.

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.870
And they've practiced
it at open mic nights.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.980
And they go to open mics before
they headline the improv.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.550
And think about every comedian--

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.970
if you notice, they have
a beer, a glass water,

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:08.870
and a little note card on
stage, or they use a coaster,

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:10.940
and they have their
set list because they

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.440
want to remember the order.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.230
And I recommend not free
styling your jokes--

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.090
I'm sorry, not free
styling your stories,

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.460
because great comedians don't
freestyle, don't improvise.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.010
I want go see Seinfeld, Chris
Rock, whomever, Chris Tucker,

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.439
and hear their best jokes.

00:42:26.439 --> 00:42:28.730
I don't want to hear their
new jokes that aren't funny,

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.080
that aren't well rehearsed.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.880
So people want to
hear great stories.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.550
And don't be afraid, or
ashamed, or feel vulnerable

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.860
if you tell the same
story again and again.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.670
And ultimately, think about
comedians and how well

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:40.840
rehearsed they are.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.680
And in sales especially,
you all know that.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.900
You've got to have it
down, the same pitch, over

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.760
and over again.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.970
So coming back full
circle to my corporate guy

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.190
turns layoff into
career reinvention,

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:54.440
we're all reinventing
ourselves right now.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.975
If we haven't been laid off
now, we know friends that have.

00:42:56.975 --> 00:43:00.540
If we haven't been fired yet,
we know friends that have.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.540
That was really morbid.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.516
I said yet.

00:43:04.516 --> 00:43:05.640
None of you will get fired.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.240
It's an easy world out here.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.140
You're all millennials,
Generation Z. Don't worry,

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.580
it's not hard.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.940
But when I was laid off in
the parking lot, I'm crying.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.340
Tears are-- but I'm
quietly crying right

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.170
because I don't want
anyone to see me.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.485
I have my box of belongings.

00:43:22.485 --> 00:43:24.110
I'm nervous to call
my wife because I'm

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.729
ashamed of this failure.

00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:28.520
And then like I said,
I felt like a bad ass

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.895
because I got a severance,
and a better job, and a raise.

00:43:30.895 --> 00:43:33.230
And I wouldn't be on the stage
if I didn't get laid off.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.350
So when you tell that
story as a bad ass,

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.619
don't be afraid to
own those low moments.

00:43:38.619 --> 00:43:40.160
I got great advice
from a friend when

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.560
I was hesitant to
talk about depression.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.530
I still am because
it's stigmatized.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.880
And I only talked about it
once in front of an audience

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.960
because my friend said you
went through that moment.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.370
You're not trying
to exploit this.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:56.872
You're owning how you felt.

00:43:56.872 --> 00:43:59.330
So when you have those negative
failures, the moments where

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:02.150
you don't succeed, we
all turn those into wins

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:03.860
because we're all here.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.030
We're all in the room.

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.690
I'm on stage.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:06.680
You're in the crowd.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.090
You're watching it online.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.280
So think about that
as you leave today

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.980
when you write your
three bad ass stories

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.409
and you have your
framework for three ways

00:44:15.409 --> 00:44:17.450
to write those bad ass
stories, because all of us

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:18.740
are underdogs.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.450
We're all bad ass authorities.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.680
And ultimately, all
of us are fixers,

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.940
and we help people
solve problems.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.990
Thank you so much for
having me today at Google.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:32.464 --> 00:44:33.380
DAVE: Thank you, Ryan.

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.360
And we do have a few
minutes for questions

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:40.226
if we have any questions
from the group.

00:44:40.226 --> 00:44:42.690
RYAN WILLIAMS: Yeah?

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:45.540
You're my favorite audience
member, by the way.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.200
You're overwhelming me.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.500
AUDIENCE: So if you
have an idea and you've

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.170
been festering with this
idea for a period of time,

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:57.180
what is the pivotal
starting point?

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.700
Other than writing it
down and talking to close

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.090
trusted individuals about it--

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.390
RYAN WILLIAMS: Collaborators.

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:03.750
AUDIENCE: It's finding
the collab-- finding

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.640
somebody who is willing to jump
in the boat with you basically?

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.660
RYAN WILLIAMS: The
collaborators, yeah.

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.290
And realize not everyone's going
to want to jump in the boat,

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.581
but you're going to have to
find the collaborators that

00:45:12.581 --> 00:45:14.490
opt in to wanting to hear more.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:19.585
And if you're a lone wolf by
yourself and working alone,

00:45:19.585 --> 00:45:21.210
you have to figure
out the right people

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.407
to trust to talk about
your problems with,

00:45:23.407 --> 00:45:25.990
and that's most likely not going
to be your significant other,

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.080
spouse, or boyfriend
if they don't

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.590
work in the same industry.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:33.450
And so going to meet ups
and sizing people up--

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.970
we live in LA, where everyone's
looking for a quick deal.

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:37.860
It's really hard to
sort through the noise.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.920
You go to a networking
event, and everyone's just

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.550
a random jabroni, and you
have to fight through that

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.546
to find people that are real.

00:45:46.546 --> 00:45:47.670
And so I always recommend--

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.640
if you have a story or an
idea, and you use a mind map,

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.350
and then you write
headlines about it,

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.260
and then you have a story to
tell people, hone that story

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.637
and really talk to
the right people.

00:45:57.637 --> 00:45:59.970
And getting back to one of
the inspirations for the book

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.492
is influencers.

00:46:02.492 --> 00:46:03.450
If you have a startup--

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.030
and I interviewed Brad
Feld for the book, who

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:09.640
started Techstars, and he
invested in Fitbit early.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.990
And he's doing obviously very
well for himself, a big mentor.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.990
And he has a lot of pull.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.240
So why would you
go to him first?

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.290
He's an influencer.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.300
He's a one percenter.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.910
So you want to find those
10 percenter collaborators.

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:26.190
And realize you may
have to sift people,

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.290
and you can't treat
it like speed dating.

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.640
This isn't Tinder.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.340
You're not looking for
a fast opportunity.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.280
You're looking for-- see how I
thought about that before what

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.600
I said?

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.280
You want to think
about a longer term--

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.600
so I also think making a bigger
vision, a three year vision--

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.920
where do you want to go?

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.940
Who do you want to
collaborate with?

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.815
How do you get there?

00:46:45.815 --> 00:46:48.040
And I'll tell a quick story.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.330
So I met this guy Nir
Eyal through my podcast.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.220
He wrote a really good
book called "Hooked--

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.780
How to Build
Habit-Forming Products,"

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.890
which after you read
"The Influencer Economy,"

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.460
and "Give and Take,"
and "Hooked"--

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.050
with our book club
that we're forming.

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.000
Again,
Ryan@influencereconomy.com

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.639
will make this global.

00:47:04.639 --> 00:47:06.930
His book "Hooked"-- I wanted
to have him in my podcast.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.760
I sent him a cold email.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.840
Had a great headline.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.220
I spent some time crafting it.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.660
I met him.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.410
We talked.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:16.080
I ended up doing the
infamous airport ride.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.391
If anyone offers you,
hey, I'm really busy,

00:47:18.391 --> 00:47:19.890
can you pick me up
from the airport?

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:20.920
Do it.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.970
There's so many stories
in Silicon Valley

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.530
where someone met someone
through an airport ride.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.600
So I went, picked him
up from the airport,

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.210
collaborated on my podcast.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:31.710
He spoke in my Prius in front
of a co-working space in Santa

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:32.210
Monica--

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:34.740
very LA-- and made
great content.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.600
And then he went to speak
in front of 300 people

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.220
with his book behind him.

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.950
He then wrote a
book blurb for me.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:43.420
We've collaborated
on other projects,

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.450
and it was all
through a cold email,

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:49.380
but I didn't go to Nir for guest
number one, or book blurber

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.040
number one, or book
subject expert number one.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.390
I built my base.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:56.970
I had 25 podcast episodes.

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:58.476
I had been doing it for a year.

00:47:58.476 --> 00:47:59.850
I also was an
early adopter, so I

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:02.636
did podcasting before it
really became mainstream.

00:48:02.636 --> 00:48:04.260
And so think about
that, your strategy.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.759
So many great ideas
the because they

00:48:05.759 --> 00:48:08.220
have the wrong collaborators.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.250
And it's really your
integral launch opportunities

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:14.370
come through that team
of people to collab with.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:15.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.311
RYAN WILLIAMS: Thank you.

00:48:16.311 --> 00:48:18.401
That's a great question.

00:48:18.401 --> 00:48:19.484
DAVE: Any other questions?

00:48:22.388 --> 00:48:25.230
RYAN WILLIAMS: Do
you have a question?

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.730
No.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:28.690
You have a question?

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.070
No.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:31.800
DAVE: All right,
well thanks to Ryan.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.174
RYAN WILLIAMS:
Thank you so much.

00:48:33.174 --> 00:48:36.560
[APPLAUSE]
