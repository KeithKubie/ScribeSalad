00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:14.099
To 
most of the approximately 10,000 people packed

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.000
into Milwaukee Auditorium on October 14, 1912,
nothing seemed out of the ordinary in the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.190
moments before Teddy Roosevelt was scheduled
to give what was supposed to be a simple campaign

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.190
speech.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.939
The former President of the United States
was running for a near unprecedented third

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.250
term, this time as the Progressive Party candidate.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.070
However, when Roosevelt stepped onto the stage
with a sort of wobble, his friend and fellow

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.170
Progressive Party member, Henry Cochems, felt
obligated to tell the audience what had happened

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.149
– Roosevelt had been shot only moments before.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.500
Most people were stunned, while others couldn’t
believe it – one person even reportedly

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.920
yelled “Fake!”

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.969
Chuckling, Roosevelt opened his coat to reveal
a bloodied and bullet-pierced shirt.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.489
An audible gasp was heard as Roosevelt advanced
to the podium.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.809
Proving yet again, he was determined to make
men everywhere feel a little less manly, he

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.229
stepped up and started what would become a
90-minute speech, in spite of his injury.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.719
He began with, “Friends, I shall ask you
to be as quiet as possible.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.020
I don’t know whether you fully understand
that I have just been shot; but it takes more

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.020
than that to kill a Bull Moose.”

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.479
So who shot Roosevelt?

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.289
Why was he so determined to give his speech
anyway?

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.299
And why was the famed Republican president
now running under the so-called “Bull Moose”

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.299
ticket?

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.979
When Teddy Roosevelt left office in 1909,
he was thankful to leave the White House under

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.259
the care of good friend, William Taft – who
had been elected the next President of the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.590
United States by a substantial electoral margin
in large part owing to his promises to continue

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.729
Roosevelt’s programs and agenda.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.959
But the now ex-president always had this nagging
feeling that perhaps he should have run for

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.259
President again in order to ensure said progressive
policies would not fall by the wayside.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.340
By the time the 1912 election rolled around,
Roosevelt’s suspicion was confirmed.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.039
At least in Roosevelt’s mind, Taft had betrayed
him and many of the things Roosevelt had fought

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.520
for in his years as president.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.340
As such, Roosevelt lashed out at the president,
calling him a traitor and challenging him

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.299
as the 1912 Republican nominee for President.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.209
As the election season continued, Roosevelt
became the favorite.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.680
However, despite Roosevelt winning a majority
of the primary votes, Taft was awarded the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.790
Republican nomination seemingly due to his
ability as president to give out federal patronage

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.349
– essentially favors for votes.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.439
Dismayed by this corruption, Roosevelt formed
his own party – the Progressive Party or

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.750
the “Bull Moose Party” – and gave himself
the nomination.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.620
Meanwhile, the Democrats, were obviously ecstatic
at the Republican chaos- after all, a split

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.540
in Republican votes meant for the first time
in a long time they had a great shot at the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.540
White House.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.310
As such, they nominated New Jersey governor
Woodrow Wilson, who, interestingly enough,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.980
was a lot closer in policy to Roosevelt than
Taft.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.609
In the end, it was a four-way race: Roosevelt,
Wilson, Taft and the Socialist Party’s Eugene

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.609
Debs.

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:04.609
Not one to go half-way on anything (again,
see: In Which Teddy Roosevelt Makes Men Everywhere

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.609
Feel a Little Less Manly), he visited 38 states
on the campaign trail to ask citizens to vote

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.469
for him – more than all of his opponents
combined.

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:13.099
This brings us to October 14th, which started
as most others had for Roosevelt in 1912,

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.719
with him on the move.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.829
He began the day in Chicago, then moved to
Racine, Wisconsin before heading south to

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.200
Milwaukee for a nighttime address to an expected
large crowd.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.540
Roosevelt’s voice was nearly gone when he
stepped out of the Hotel Gilpatrick wearing

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.590
his Army overcoat to combat the fall chill
that was in the air.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.290
Inside his breast pocket was his neatly double-folded
50-page speech for the evening (after all,

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.249
Roosevelt was anything but concise) along
with an eyeglass case.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:43.250
As he hustled to a waiting car, a roar erupted
from bystanders upon noticing the former President

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.770
was in their midst.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.640
Roosevelt turned around and, with his hat
in hand, waved to the crowd.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.680
All of sudden, a loud pop and a puff of smoke
was seen as a bullet erupted from a Colt .38

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.340
revolver on its way into Roosevelt’s chest.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.489
John Schrank was a New York City saloon owner
until he decided that it was his duty to kill

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.750
“Colonel Roosevelt.”

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.560
In a later confession, he said that he had
at one time admired Roosevelt, but began to

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.860
think ill of him when he showed his interest
in running for a third term.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.720
He felt strongly that, “Any man looking
for a third term ought to be shot.”

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.060
He also would confess that,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.950
I was convinced that if he was defeated at
the Fall election he would… cry ‘Thief’,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.800
and that his action would plunge the country
into a bloody civil war.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.759
I deemed it my duty, after much consideration
of the situation, to put him out of the way.

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.759
…

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.759
I had a dream in which former President McKinley
appeared to me.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.080
I was told by McKinley in this dream that
it was not Czolgosz who murdered him, but

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080
Roosevelt.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.380
McKinley… told me that his blood was on
Roosevelt’s hand, and that Roosevelt had

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.949
killed him so that he might become President.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.260
I was more deeply impressed by what I read
in the newspapers than others, and after having

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.660
this dream was move convinced than ever that
I should free the country from the menace

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.919
of Roosevelt’s ambition.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.360
And so it was that on September 21st, his
stalking pursuit of Roosevelt began when he

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.380
bought a steamer ticket to Charleston.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.900
From there, he continued to follow his target
for weeks, traversing the country along with

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.150
him – from Charleston to Atlanta to Chattanooga
to Evansville to Indianapolis to Chicago to,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.350
finally, Milwaukee.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.740
As Schrank noted in his confession, at each
stop he was either foiled by a change in Roosevelt’s

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.949
schedule or Schrank’s own cowardice.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.979
In Milwaukee, however, neither got in his
way.

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.590
I came to Milwaukee Sunday morning and went
to the Argyle, a lodging house on Third Street.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.740
I then purchased newspapers to inform myself
as to Roosevelt’s whereabouts and learned

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.040
on Monday that he was to arrive at 5 o’clock.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.550
I learned also that he was to be a guest a
the Gilpatrick, and managed to gain a position

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.510
near the entrance where I could shoot to kill
when Roosevelt appeared.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.390
Schrank was only five feet away from Roosevelt
when he shot him in the chest.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.650
As Roosevelt stumbled back, the candidate’s
stenographer put Schrank in a headlock and

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.100
pushed him to the ground.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.310
While concern was obviously directed at Roosevelt,
the crowd went after Schrank – kicking and

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.310
punching the would-be assassin.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.070
As would later be revealed, the massive bulge
of the 50-page speech and his hard leather

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.860
eyeglass case in his breast pocket- not to
mention Roosevelt’s famously ample chest

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.349
muscles- prevented the bullet from doing significant
damage.

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.200
After an initial stumble, he coughed into
his hand to check for blood.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.460
When none came up, he felt sure that the bullet
had not pierced his lung.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.919
“He pinked me,” he said to one of his
aides.

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.720
Schrank was whisked away in a paddy wagon
(followed by a group of people yelling “lynch

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
him”).

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.030
He would later plead guilty, stating, “I
am sorry I have caused all this trouble for

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.330
the good people of Milwaukee and Wisconsin,
but I am not sorry that I carried out my plan.”

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.139
He was eventually determined to be “insane”
and would live out his days at a Wisconsin

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.780
asylum until his death 31 years later in 1943.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.529
As for Roosevelt, those with him demanded
that he go to the hospital, but that wasn’t

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:50.169
really Roosevelt’s style; he refused and
told the driver to take him to his scheduled

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.169
speech.

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.099
Once there, three doctors examined him backstage,
found the dime-sized hole where the bullet

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.409
had pierced him and a patch of blood.

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:01.780
They likewise implored him to get to a hospital,
but he insisted he had a speech to give.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.849
However, he did take time out to send a telegram
to his wife saying he was in excellent shape

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:10.840
and that the wound wasn’t “a particle
more serious than one of the injuries any

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.169
of the boys used continually to be having.”

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:17.900
Nevertheless, walking onto the stage, he reportedly
was pale and unsteady, and admitted to the

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.180
crowd, “The bullet is in me now, so that
I cannot make a very long speech, but I will

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.180
try my best.”

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.460
He then proceeded to talk for about 90 minutes…

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.789
The bulk of his speech was railing against
Wilson, saying that a majority of the trusts

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:36.169
that Roosevelt worked so hard to rid the country
of were organized in New Jersey – Wilson’s

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:37.169
home state.

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:41.740
About 30 minutes into his speech, his campaign
manager gently tried to get him to stop, but

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.370
Roosevelt remarked, “My friends are a little
more nervous than I am.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.260
Don’t you waste any sympathy on me.”

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.819
TR-XrayAs noted, he continued for almost another
hour after this.

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:52.990
Finally, he finished to great applause and
headed to the hospital.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.759
After an X-ray was taken, it was found that
the bullet was lodged next to a rib in his

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:57.759
chest.

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.710
It stayed there the rest of Roosevelt’s
life.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.819
This was probably for the best, as, contrary
to what is often depicted by Hollywood, leaving

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:07.479
the bullet in his generally better than trying
to remove it, even today.

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:11.669
Back then, this was even more the case due
to increased risk of infection, which was

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:16.500
what eventually claimed the lived of President
James Garfield and Roosevelt’s own predecessor,

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.310
President William McKinley, when they had
their own meetings with assassins’ bullets.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.699
Thus, choosing to essentially do nothing,
may have saved Roosevelt’s life.

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:28.900
Whatever the case, a week later, Roosevelt
was out the hospital and back on the campaign

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.900
trail.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.659
In a show of respect for Roosevelt, his opponents
chose to cease their own campaigns while he

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.000
was in the hospital, despite being so close
to election day.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.400
In the end, Wilson ended up winning the 1912
election because Roosevelt and Taft split

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.000
the Republican vote, with Wilson getting 42%
of the popular vote, while Roosevelt (27%)

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.770
and Taft (23%) combined for 50%.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.280
But the ex-president had no regrets, not even
about the assassination attempt.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.370
Explaining his thinking to a friend years
later about his decision to go forward with

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:02.590
the speech, “In the very unlikely event
of the wound being mortal, I wished to die

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.710
with my boots on.”

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.560
Or as he explained in his speech directly
after being shot, when whether he would die

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.030
or not was still uncertain,

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.000
I want you to understand that I am ahead of
the game, anyway.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.350
No man has had a happier life than I have
led; a happier life in every way.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.330
I have been able to do certain things that
I greatly wished to do, and I am interested

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.560
in doing other things.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.040
I can tell you with absolute truthfulness
that I am very much uninterested in whether

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.250
I am shot or not.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.560
It was just as when I was colonel of my regiment.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.670
I always felt that a private was to be excused
for feeling at times some pangs of anxiety

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:40.100
about his personal safety, but I cannot understand
a man fit to be a colonel who can pay any

00:09:40.100 --> 00:10:17.960
heed to his personal safety when he is occupied
as he ought to be with the absorbing desire

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:25.460
to do his duty.
