00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.200
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I just told
Hannah Pittard and Elizabeth Hand

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.130
that I was a little afraid of them.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.280
And if you are readers
of their wonderful

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.060
and slightly disturbing
fiction, more than slightly,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.080
you know what I'm talking about.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:35.740
They're both such inventive writers
who really take readers like us

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.090
into places that we
couldn't even imagine.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.730
And what I find after
reading both of,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.270 position:56%
especially their most recent novels,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.080
is that I can't get
images out of my head.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.420
And I can't forgive
them for some images.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.720
This is for you.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.550
So some of them know
what I'm talking about.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.850
Hannah Pittard is the author
of three novels, Reunion,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.520 position:56%
The Fates Will Find Their Way, and
her most recent novel, Listen to Me.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.360
She's published short stories in
American Scholar and McSweeney's

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.030
and teaches fiction at the
University of Kentucky.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.790
Listen to Me, in particular,
has garnered the kind of praise

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.610
that just gladdens
an author's heart.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.310
It is an editor's choice of
the New York Times Book Review.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.050
It was also selected by
the Washington Post as one

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.850
of the top suspense novels
to read this past summer.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.090
Elizabeth Hand is the
bestselling author of 13 novels

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.630
and four collections
of short fiction.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.350
And she spans almost
every type of genre

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.740
that you could possible think
of, speculative fiction,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.810
fantasy fiction, horror fiction,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.170
crime novels, noir,
she's done it all.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.460
She has won among other awards the
World Fantasy Award four times,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.640
the Nebula Award twice, the
Shirley Jackson Award twice,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.910
and the International Horror
Guild Award three times.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.590 position:56%
I had the pleasure of reviewing
Elizabeth's latest Cass Neary novel,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.930
Hard Light, for the
Post a few months ago.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.960
It's her third in her series
featuring Cass Neary who's a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.780
hard-living photographer and
also described as a woman

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.220
of a certain age with
substance abuse issues.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.750
Like her novel Walking the Moon,
which I read some 20 years ago,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.050
it is something that I now
can't get out of my brain.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.340
So I want you to please welcome me

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.510
in thanking Hannah
Pittard and Elizabeth Hand.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:57.370
[ Applause ]

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.670
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Thank you.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.090
That was well put.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.390
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Where do we start?

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.970
I want to start with your
killer first sentences.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.800
Each of you have written first
sentences that, you know,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.320
when I open up a book and I think
okay, especially if it's a choice.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.430
Do I go further with
this novel or not?

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.580
It's not just the ingenuity
of your first sentences,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.890
it's the authority of the voices.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.160
It's the sly wit.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.800
So Elizabeth, your latest
Cass Neary novel, Hard Light,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.370
begins a stolen passport
will only get you so far.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:45.020
And Hannah, your first sentence
is, they were on the road later

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.530
than they intended, sorry.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.930
They were on the road
later than they intended.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.980 position:56%
I'm yours for the rest of the novel.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.790
I wanted to know, first of all,
I think it would be helpful.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.830
Not everyone has read your latest
work, if you could give us a sense

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.810 position:56%
of what follows from those openings.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.860
And also, maybe talk about how
important the first sentence,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.840
the first paragraph is,
particularly to a suspense novel.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.960
To a crime novel.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.750
Are the stakes higher
with that kind of novel

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.670 position:56%
than with straight literary fiction?

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.380
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: I
think that they can be.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.240
Absolutely.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.380
For me, you have to set up a
lot in that opening sentence,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.790
in the opening chapter, in the
opening paragraph, that by the end

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.790
of the book, everything comes back
into light in a different way.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.110
That things viewed initially
change and morph by the end.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.210
But that the clues and the germ is
there, are there, at the beginning.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.700
And it's essential
that Mark and Maggie

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.640
who are taking this road trip
together, it's absolutely essential

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.860
that how they begin
that road trip is other

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.900
than how they expected to begin.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.290
Because everything that
happens afterwards,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.220
and causality is a huge part of
this novel, and it's something

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.320
that I'm very interested
in as a writer.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.620
But the fact that the
road trip begins other

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.260
than it should is responsible for
the events that unfold at the end.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.380
And the tragedy that occurs at the
novel's end would not have happened

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.570
if they had, arguably,
if they had gotten off

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.230
at the right time or earlier.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.420
If they'd missed the traffic
jam, if they'd been able

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.290 position:56%
to drive all the way through instead
of having to stop at a hotel.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.590
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Yeah.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.270
Yeah, I think it's,
I agree with Hannah.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.160
I think it's sort of a matter
of you never get a second chance

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.930
to make a first impression.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.890
And I think with suspense
novels or with noir,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:03.080 position:56%
even more than with other kinds of
fiction where, you know, as a reader

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.770
and a reviewer, I always
read the beginning

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.450
and the end of a book first.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.750
I always pick it up.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.530
I read the first sentence,
I read the ending.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.900
And I've done that my whole life.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.120
And I think I've had to
learn over the years how

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.810
to write a first sentence.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.790
And I think in particular with
writing, you know, noir novels,

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.280
suspense novels, there's more of a
weight on it because readers come

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.410
to those kind of stories with
different kinds of expectations

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.940
than you bring to another
kind of a book.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.490
So I think that other kinds
of fiction you obviously want

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.810
to have a hook from
the very beginning.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.320
You do want to have a
strong opening sentence.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.850
But I think that with more
quote/unquote, literary fiction,

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.350 position:56%
people can ease into the story more.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.860
Whereas, with a suspense novel or
a crime novel, the expectations

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.630
of a reader that you bring into it,

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.750
you want to immediately
be there in media rest.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.560
You want to be there as it starts.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.440
You want to be there in the, you
know, stuck in traffic trying to,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.100 position:56%
you know, get to where you're going.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.400
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Or
with a passport that's.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.700
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand:
Yeah, leave the storm.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.000
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard:
The stolen passport.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.300
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Yeah
or the stolen passport.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.470
So I think there's that sense
of immediacy that your book has.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.230
And though I have tried
to get in particular

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.420
with the Cass Neary novels.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.320
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: But,
you've already touched on it,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.780
but you both resurrected the
journeyism [phonetic] motif.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.420
Cass goes on a journey
in Hard Light.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.510
You've got Maggie and Mark
in this car with their dog.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.690
I mean it's as old as the Odyssey.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.150
You mention the Iliad.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.330
You start off with that
epigraph from the Iliad.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:51.430
How do you rejuvenate the
journey as a motif for a story?

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.960
&gt;&gt; I think it's, I can't
remember who was the first person

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.790
to teach me this because I've heard
it so many times and I teach it

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:05.090
so often now, but if you make
your characters want something,

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.990
that makes them relatable.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.840
It makes them interesting.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:16.340
And for me, with Listen to
Me, there is this very easy,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.490
natural thing that they both want.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.230 position:56%
That is the concrete visceral thing.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.270
They want to get to
Charlottesville, Virginia.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.570
It's very easy.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.550
Existentially, they
want other things.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.670
You know, Mark wants
his normal wife back.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.980
Maggie wants to lose the
feelings of paranoia.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.810
She wants to be normal again too.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.720
But I love the road trip.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.680
I think, I think it's a
very American type story.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.610
I think Lolita is a road trip
novel and a great one at that.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.260
And also a thriller and a mystery.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.720 position:56%
And you know, I begin my novel with
that nod to the Iliad which is this,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.660
on the one hand it's the
story of a ten-year war.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.420
But it's, you know, Homer
does this great trick.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.950
He tells us only about the
last three weeks of the war.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.780
But in telling us about those
last three weeks of the war,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.980
he fills in the ten years.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.090
And Listen to Me does something
sort of similar in many ways.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:23.630 position:56%
We're only with Mark and Maggie for
24 hours, but the trick of the book,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.410
if it's successful,
is to sort of fill

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.130
in a ten-year marriage
in just those 24 hours.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.510
You're going to ask
questions and I'm going

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.010
to constantly not answer them.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.310
Or switch [inaudible].

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.920
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: And I
think too the other thing

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.360 position:56%
with your novel is it's a road trip,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.440
which is this very
American trope in fiction.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.730
But it's also something just
about all of us have done

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.030
at some point in our life.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:53.310
And many of us have had this
awful claustrophobic, you know,

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.040 position:56%
sense of being trapped in a car with
someone, whether you're, you know,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.310
trying to get home from college
or Thanksgiving weekend or you're

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.430
with your spouse on vacation

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.670
and you've left too
late to get somewhere.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.280
Or you're a kid trapped in
the car with your parent.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.060
Or you're a teenager
trapped with your parent,

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.190
which is like the worst
thing in the world.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.680
And so I think you evoke
this kind of, you know,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.780
very iconic American
Experience with that.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:25.580
With the cast novels in particular,
which Hard Light is the third one,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.610
she's a character who is, you know,
old fashioned pinball machines

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.370
where the ball would be in play
and it's just bouncing around.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.130
You're trying to keep it moving
without going down the chute.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.220
She's kind of like a ball in play.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.880
Her life has been in stasis
for many decades living

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.030 position:56%
on the lower east side of Manhattan.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:50.730
And in the first novel she is kind
of tempted out of her lair and goes

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:56.600
up to, you know, an island off the
coast of Maine and hijinks ensue.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.270
And then in the second
book she goes to Reykjavik.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.700
And in the third one
she's in London.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.300
And she's basically on the lam.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.600
She's kind of on the run.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.760
So she's now in a place
on a stolen passport,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.140
but she's always pretty
much an outsider.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.150
So she's not, and I think
that's an experience

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.460
that Americans can have
a lot in this country.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.870
You know, because we're defined.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:26.780
If we're not defined by, we live in
different regions that, you know,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.800
living in downtown Manhattan
it's very different from living

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.270
in rural Maine or from
living in, you know,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.360
the panhandle of Texas
or something like that.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.110
So and then if you go abroad,

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.230
your sense of being an outsider
can be really magnified.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.340
So in that sense, it's kind
of a journey of what it's

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.140 position:56%
like to be the ugly American in your
own country and then somewhere else.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.440
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.770
I want to talk about weather,
because both of your novels,

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.400
you know, are just in a
sense extreme adventure tales

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.130
about weather as well.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.510
You've got a tornado going
on in Look at Me, impending,

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.880
which is also a great
device to knock out the GPS

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.080 position:56%
and everything else that we rely on.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.630
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: I'd do
anything to get rid of technology.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.470
I'll set it in 1980.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.770
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: I'll do anything.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.370
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.400
And when Cass arrives in
London there's a monstrous hail

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.000
and rainstorm going on that the
likes of which hasn't been seen

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.170
in what, 300 years or something?

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.960
I mean it's fun weather as
almost another character.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.820
But I did feel in both your novels
that the weather was also this way

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:45.020
to sort of peel off that
skin of normalcy and say,

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:50.390
things can get really weird
in ordinary life really fast.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:55.540
And if you'd like to talk about
weather and how you came up with

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.500
that device, I'd love
to know about it.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.830
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.130
Because I hadn't thought about it.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.990
I think that's one reason why
I loved your book so much.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.360
I love reading about bad weather.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.180
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: We
both like bad weather.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.480
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Yeah it's funny.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.760
Throughout my career,
many of my books and a lot

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.900
of my short fiction has had kind of
apocalyptically bad weather in it.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.200 position:56%
And I think, actually for me I think
it actually goes back to, you know,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.860
my childhood being raised
Catholic and from a very,

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.290
very young age this notion
of the end of the world.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.280
Which I could only imagine
was like an earthquake.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.690
Which, you know, I
grew up in Yonkers

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.940
where there's not a
lot of earthquakes.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.010
And but I think from watching,
you know, movies or things,

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:43.330
I was really impressed and
frightened by apocalyptic weather.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.920
And then moving to Maine where
basically all people ever talk

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.480
about is the weather for
six months of the year.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.580
It's like no one in
Maine has never seen snow

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.670
because the way they
talk about the weather.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.930
It's just, you know, of course now
with smartphone technology and,

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.170
you know, the disaster Weather
Channel and everything else

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.150
and with climate change
that gets intensified.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.790
But yeah, but I'm really,
I'm fascinated by it.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:14.040
And I've been writing about, and
thinking about climate change for,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.870
you know, almost 20 years.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.240
And seeing a lot of
the things that I wrote

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:25.210 position:56%
about in earlier speculative fiction
books, sort of near future books,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.890
in which all of these terrible
weather events would happen.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.890
I would never in a
million years have imagined

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.980 position:56%
that actually we're living that now.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.680
You know, when I wrote those books
or stories, it was science fiction.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.280 position:56%
And now it's like our everyday life.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.530
So, you know, I can't
keep up with it.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.780
So it was very easy
for me to transpose

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.060
that say to London or Cornwall.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.240
And these are very fragile
places that we found, you know,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.160
found out here and in
New York after Sandy

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.260
and New Orleans and
Vermont after Irene.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.740
Which is not a city, but, you know,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.130
the weather is something
we cannot control.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.170
And where like in your book
on the small scale, you know,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.930
if you're in this little
bubble of a car.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.950
Tornado, that's like
my worst nightmare.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.250
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Yeah,
I think there's something

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:22.760
about weather that, at least for
me, I am terrified of being out in,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.020
you know, terrific rainstorms.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.110
I don't like driving, I'm
like my grandmother, you know,

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.670
I don't like driving
in the rain at all.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.220
But there is, at the
same time, there's this,

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.290
it seems like there's
nothing like weather

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.720
or the promise of bad weather.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.310
Not when it's actively happening
but just when they're telling you

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:44.630
that it's going to happen to elicit
in me a terrific amount of hubris.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.550
I can see that it's going to 65%
chance that it's going to rain.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.950
I will look my umbrella in the
face as I am leaving and I'll say,

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.670
you know, I'm not going
to take the umbrella

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.390
because I'm pretty sure
I'm going to time it.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.110
And then I'll stand, I'll stand in
my office and just watch the water

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.460
and think, there was the umbrella.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.530
I had space in my bag.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:06.830
What was I doing?

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.960
And so that's a really
small scale version

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.820
of what Mark and Maggie
end up doing.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.440
You know, there is a four
state storm that has been going

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.270
on for four or five days, because
when they finally get to the hotel

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.860 position:56%
where they're going to stay for the
night, they find out that the people

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.550
at the hotel haven't had
potable water for a week.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.370
And yet here is this, you
know, this city folk couple

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.890
who presumably has the
television on all the time,

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.830 position:56%
the Weather Channel on all the time.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.390
But they've decided because
they're in Chicago, it's 90 degrees

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.610
when they hit the road, how's it
going to happen to them, right?

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.970
Why would they run into the storm?

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.630
And I just, I love the idea
of something like weather

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.470
that is so beyond our control.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.780
And of course, in my book the
weather's just the weather,

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.670
but it is also, it's the marriage.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.540
And you can love somebody
as much as you want,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.910
but you cannot control what that
other person's heart is capable of

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.210
or what it's going to do.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:10.890
We just, we only have ourselves
that we are in control of.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.190
And that's if we're lucky.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.490
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.790
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Sometimes
characters who aren't even

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.960
in control of themselves.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.670
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: You know with
both of your books, it almost felt

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.410
to me like the weather served
like the haunted house does

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.750
in those old movies from the 30s,
40s, 50s, where the characters

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.970
who say, oh there's no
such thing as ghosts.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.730
You know, there's no such
thing as the supernatural.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.030
And they go into the house,

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.240
and they're always the first
ones killed or scared to death.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.110
As the weather intensified
in both of the books,

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.030
things got weirder and weirder.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:49.240
One of the scenes I loved in your
book, Hannah, is fairly early on.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.490
Although the weather is looming.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.750
And Mark and Maggie
stop at a gas station.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.710
And she is treated to
one of those comments

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:06.160 position:56%
that women sometimes get treated to
where a man walks by in a cowboy hat

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.520
and comments on her body.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.470
And then she doesn't
know, he acts innocent.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.460
She doesn't know whether
she heard it or not.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.760
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Right.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.790
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: But
things start to get stranger,

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.990
almost like there's a
climatic electricity

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.500
in the air that's disturbing
the atmosphere.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Things go
downhill from there in a slight way.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:33.190
And I was, I reread that chapter
not long after writing it.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:37.730
And I don't think it was until then
and the comment that this man made

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.180
and the doubt that Maggie feels.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.480
Did he say it?

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.780
Did he not say it?

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.340
I don't think it was until I
reread that chapter that I realized

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.440
that I was writing a thriller.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.250
Because I was scared by it.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.010
And I was really uncomfortable
with what a gentleman he seemed

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:59.030
to be after, because she
confronts him slightly.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.810
And he denies it, and he's sweet,

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.090
and he waves to his
wife in the distance.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.570
And his wife waves back.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.790
And I made myself really
uncomfortable at that moment.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.890
And I thought, I think this
book might be something other

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.210
than what I meant it
to be at the beginning.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.190
And I just sort of
followed that trajectory.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.520
And that man, that character
was supposed to disappear

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.680
in the next chapter, which
was Mark's point of view.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.730
I realized that he'd come back,

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.040
and he's even creepier
there and more aggressive.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.340
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yes.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.560
And then, of course, if
Cass had been subjected

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.240
to that comment, she would.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.540
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: She
would have just kicked him.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.300
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: She'd would
have kicked him in the right place.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.060
I see, in at least one
interview, Elizabeth,

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.440
you talked about your affection
for characters who were sort

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.150
of unlikeable or, and I like
Cass, but I'm not sure that she

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:58.190 position:56%
and I would do so well if we were
seated next to each other on Amtrak.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.560
She's tough.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.860
She's brisk.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.270
She's not particularly nice.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:09.520 position:56%
This issue of unlikeable characters,
especially in novels written

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.710
by women, seems to keep
coming up all the time.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.890
I guess Clare Messud in The Woman
Next Door, was that the title?

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.190
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Upstairs.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.490
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Upstairs, thank you.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.180
She was treated to a lot of
criticism about this character

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.200
who she had created who didn't
seem particularly likeable.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.230
Is there something defiant
about creating a character

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.310
like Cass who, she
isn't a nice girl.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.960
She goes, you know, V.I.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.390
Warshawski, Lisbeth Salander.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.910
All of those other not
nice girl characters.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:49.720
I think ten times better in
terms of being an outlaw almost.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.760
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: I didn't, I
was thinking of it consciously

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.960
when I created her as a character.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.460
I always, I love Lolita.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.130
I loved the fact that here is a
character, a central character,

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.650
a narrator who is, you know,
a pedophile, a kidnapper.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.730
He's this horrible
person, sociopath.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.190 position:56%
And yet we are seduced by his voice
enough that we read the entire book.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.960
And also by Patricia
Highsmith's Ripley novels.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.660
And I, and many of my
works, earlier books

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.440
and stories have had
unsympathetic female characters.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.120
Because I've just found
an interesting perspective

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.420
to write from.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.370
And technically, it was sort
of a challenge that I set

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.380
for myself with the Cass novels.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.540
How far could I go
with this character

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.610
and readers still come
along for the ride.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.600
And it was interesting
because with the first novel,

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.600
which came out almost ten years
ago, you know, the reviews of it,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.610
this was before the Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo came

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:53.910
out in this country.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.470
So it was, you know, all the
reviews touched on the fact

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:01.700
that here was this very unlikeable
out there, traumatized person.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.220
But what some of the reviews talked

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.760
about as being among her many
transgressions, you know,

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.710
being bisexual and, you know, and
alcoholic and an addict and this,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.090
that and the other, was
that she was middle aged.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.950
And that was considered to
be a transgressive element.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.920
And one of my editors
actually asked me

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.160
with the second novel
would I make her younger.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.400
And I just like, well
how would that even work?

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.870
And I said no, I'm
not going to do that.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:37.070
So, I wanted to kind
of set that bar and see

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.690
where I could go with it, you know.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.120
I think she does have
some redeeming qualities.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:47.510
I think if she was just a totally,
you know, she may be unlikeable,

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.890
but she has a certain kind
of dark charisma, I hope.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.160
I mean she certainly
has a lot of fans

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.690
that I think make people
want to read about her.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.930
And also I hear from a lot of
women, a lot of young women.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.820
A lot of women, you know,
of a certain age, mind,

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.920
who really relate to her.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.630
And some of them say
yeah, that's me.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.010
I've had those experiences.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.080
And some of them are like oh yeah,
I'm so glad I can be, you know,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.330
my age and I can live vicariously

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.170
through a character who's a woman
who's, you know, middle age,

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:20.930
who's doing these things,
and she doesn't give a.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.230
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.190
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: I first
encountered this comment

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.890
about having characters, and
specifically female characters,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:31.440
who are unlikeable when I was still
in school for creative writing.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.150
And I remember a young man who I
liked quite a bit as a human being

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:41.020
and a writer, we were workshopping
a story of mine about a family

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:47.420
and very strong women and the sort
of weaker men that surrounded them.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:52.840
And he stopped mid-workshop, and
he said, you know what it is.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.500
And he had this southern accent.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.340
And he said you know what it is?

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.640
He said, I don't like them.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.490
I don't like a single
woman in this story.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:03.890
And I remember turning bright
red and, you know, looking down.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.780
And of course I looked down
and I was torn between laughing

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.930
and crying, because
there are three women,

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.910
and they were 100% me,
my sister and my mom.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.790
And I was like.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:20.150
I was like, well you
like me, don't you?

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.630
All I'm doing is admitting what's
going on behind the surface.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:30.180 position:56%
The layers and layers of complicated
complex thoughts that I think most

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.140
of us, not just women, have.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.730
But you know, the realization

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.310
that boy it would be easier
to lie right now, right.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.520
Just that, on a daily basis.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.890
You know, I just don't
want to say something nice.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:42.620
I don't want to go to this party.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.070
I don't want to be nice and
polite for a half a second.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.370
I'm tired.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.390
I love this idea of the middle age.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.130
Can you make her younger?

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.830
That is just, that makes me want
to make every character older.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.730
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Well
it'll happen sooner or later.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.910
You don't need to rush.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.820
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
I don't know if either

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.390
of you read Rebecca
Traister's interview

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.270
with Hillary a few months
ago in which she said

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:16.710
that in her downtime she
loves to read Maisie Dobbs,

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.760
and she loves to read
Donna Leon's novel.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.630
And I did think after reading
that interview, as great as,

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.960
I mean I love both of those
series for different reasons.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.510
But I kind of wanted
her to pick up Cass.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.770
I thought, a woman of a
certain age acting tough.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:40.120 position:56%
Maybe she could learn a little from
Cass about, you know, hanging tough.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.870
I don't know.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.590
I wanted to come back
with you, Hannah,

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.750 position:56%
to talking about the domestic novel.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:53.040
Because I can't figure out why,
but I feel like we're living

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.020
in this sort of golden
age of these novels

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.790
that are exploring
marriage from both sides.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.930
And, of course, there's Gone Girl.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.290
I'm just, it just flew
out of my head.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.870
There've been a whole slew of.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Fates and Furies.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.670
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Fates and
Furies, thank you, Lauren Groff.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:15.610
Where you're getting a picture
of a marriage from both sides.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:22.470 position:56%
And I mean I think one of the things
you do so beautifully is you don't,

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:27.210
Mark and Maggie are both, you
know, they're equally as compelling

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.360
as voices and points of view.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.950
And, you know, I kind of found
myself sympathizing with both

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.670
of them and also then
distrusting both of them.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:41.090
I mean why did you decided to write
about a marriage at this point?

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.590
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Up until
last month I was married.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:52.370
And I sometimes wonder if writing
this book I wasn't channeling,

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.240
exercising, some of
the difficulties,

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.390
intentions that I was aware of
in my own marriage at the time.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.740
But didn't want to talk
about or weren't coming

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.600
to the surface in the right way.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.700
You know, I think like a lot of
writers I definitely go to the pen

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.540
and go to the paper when I
should probably be using my words

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.620
and talking out loud, and you
know, tapping into my emotions.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.650
But I prefer writing books.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.160
No, I wanted to, it's
really important to me

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.150
with every character I write, and
specifically with this couple,

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.530
to portray them believably,

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:36.850
and I like every character
I've ever written.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:40.550 position:56%
And most of the characters that I've
written have at least gotten one

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.760
or two reviews that talk
about their un-likeability.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.140
And I think that they are
all me to a certain extent.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.310
And in going back and forth
between Mark and Maggie,

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:56.370
it was very important to me
to try to tell their stories

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.350
from their points of view.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:02.310
And I think if there's a
reason that I'm a good teacher

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.990
or a good listener of other people,

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.260
or if there's a reason
I'm a good friend,

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:12.980
it's because before
taking anything personally,

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.510
I always try to imagine
wait a minute, I know,

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.900
I'm going to keep using
my sister as an example

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.200
because she's in the audience.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.790
I know that my sister just
said this terrible thing to me.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.790
But before I get mad at
her, why don't I think

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.410
about why she might have said it.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.590
And I try to trace
through all of the reasons

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.320
that she might have just
said what she said to me.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:38.130
And I am always able to, rightly
or wrongly, come up with a reason

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.200
that is, that makes sense to me.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.230
And makes me forgive her before
I can even be mad at her.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.800
And so when I'm talking about
this husband and this wife,

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.730
what I wanted to do was really
try to tap into their points

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.760
of view in an honest way.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:00.230
So Mark is mad at Maggie because
she was mugged nine months ago,

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.630
and she's not back
to normal yet, right.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.990
And on the one hand from
Maggie's perspective

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.690
and from Maggie's friends
perspective,

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:12.190
and certainly from Cass'
perspective, Mark is an asshole

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.240
for not being more patient.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.580
But on the other hand,
from Mark's point of view,

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.430
when you're reading his chapters,
it's because he loves her so much.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.670
And he misses what they had.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.250
And it's the impatience is

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:32.230
because he doesn't truly understand
the extent of her suffering.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:35.440
And part of that fault is
because she's not using her words

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.330
in the right way to
the right extent.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.810
So I think anybody who's
married or anybody who's

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.830
in a long-term relationship
with a sibling, with a brother,

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:49.170
a sibling is a brother, with
a brother, a parent, a dog,

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:52.440
you understand that
there are ebbs and flows.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.490
And the reason that
they last, if they last,

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.940
is because at some point
you start being able to try

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.110
to at least put yourself
in their shoes.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.970
And I just, I wanted to take apart
I guess my marriage and take apart.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:10.950
This is a crazy institution that
many of us voluntarily enter into.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.510
It's insanity.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.730
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: No,
I love the visual of them

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.430
in the car, down the road of life.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.730
That's kind of sometimes
what it feels like.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.210
And, you know, there's no exit.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.140
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Chris
Tillman told me famously,

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.900
and I use this in class
all the time.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.940
If you don't know what to write
about, put two people in a car

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.960
who don't like each other
or who are fighting.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.810 position:56%
Something is going to happen, right.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.750
They think they can stay
quiet for 500 miles.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.050
They can't.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.350
They're going to have
to talk at some point.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.680
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: You've
got two people in the car,

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.800
but you've got three
sentient beings.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.410
Those are now approved,
have been now acknowledged

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.870
as sentient beings,
in France at least.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:52.170
Yes.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:53.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: That is terrific.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:54.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Isn't it great?

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:59.120
I know. They're taking care of
their dog, who I love the scenes

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.400
where they keep running out
into this rain, urging this dog

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.100
to please do his business.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.760
And he's taking his sweet time.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.460
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Has anyone ever
tried to walk a dog in the rain

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.940
to make it use the bathroom?

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.240
It's impossible.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.340
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: And Cass
in a certain way is taking care

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.650
of a young girl at
points in Hard Light.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:25.260
Again, it struck me that
certainly this caretaking business,

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:31.890 position:56%
being responsible for somebody or a
creature who isn't quite as capable,

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.770
it added to the suspense
of both stories.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:39.010
Were there other reasons why
you threw these dependents

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.010
into the story?

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:45.070
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Well I
did it because, you know,

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:51.070
I wanted to have a means by
which Cass could demonstrate some

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.700
compassion, almost despite herself.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.000
Which she's shown before.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.700
I mean she, you know, in Generation
Lost she helps this, you know,

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.170
helps find this, or looks
for this runaway girl.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:09.130
And nothing really
analogous in the second book.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.020
But in this one I wanted to kind
of return to that because it seemed

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.070
to me it would be something that
would come out of her character.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:19.430
That she is somebody, she
was very damaged herself

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.100
when she was a young woman.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.190
And when she sees, you know,
homeless kids on the street,

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:29.550
when she meets the young girl
Sam in West Penwith and Cornwall,

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:34.200
this sort of very androgynous
young person, you know,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.580
she's kind of drawn to them.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:40.370
And with Sam she kind of
recognizes herself in a way.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:46.960 position:56%
And so even though she's not, you
know, Cass, a warm and fuzzy person,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.580
you know, I think even
people who are.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.880
If we're going to be
honest in looking

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.140
at depicting unlikeable people,
you know, and this is something

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.610
when I'm dealing with my writing
students I tell them, you know,

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:05.370
the villains in a story do not
perceive themselves as villains.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.850
The villains on the real world
stage do not see themselves

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.150
as the bad guys or the bad women.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:15.160
And I think it's important
if you have an antagonist

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.240
or if you have a flawed protagonist
to kind of show all of that.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.460 position:56%
You know, if you have an antagonist,

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:27.270
that person has some
humane traits somewhere

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.570
at some point in their life.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:32.030
Maybe they don't have it now,
but as a child or something.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.530
So I think, you know, it's like the
Leonard Cohen line there's a crack

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.830
in everything.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.130
That's where the light gets in.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.900
And I think it's important
to show that in people who,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.700
in characters who are flawed.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.860
We see it in characters
who are not flawed.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.760
I have to say for,
just for the record,

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.320
I did not find Mark and Maggie

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.620
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Thank you.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.920
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand:
unlikeable characters at all.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.910
I thought they were very
real and honestly depicted.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:59.800
And I thought that your
depiction of Maggie as somebody

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.310
who has experienced a
trauma and living with that,

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:07.830
how that changes you and changes
the way you look at the world.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.340
I thought that was really
exceptionally well done.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:18.210
And to me, that perhaps it didn't
excuse her, some of her behavior.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.780
But it was the explanation
that to me made perfect sense.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.410
And I could also see how Mark
not having had that experience

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:28.930
and not being a woman and not
being vulnerable in the way

00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:31.570 position:56%
that she was and is wouldn't get it.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:35.190
And would kind of resent
her and would want,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.340
you know, his old wife back.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.450
But I didn't, you know, I
just wanted to say that.

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:41.750
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: No, thank you.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.050
We'd probably be friends.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.840
No, and I promise I'll answer
the question about the dog.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.480
But I was thinking
about this recently

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.450
and the trauma that
Maggie experiences.

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:58.230 position:56%
It's almost as though this is when
she's eaten the apple, and she sees,

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.240
you know, she sees the
ugliness of the world.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.200 position:56%
And Mark hasn't eaten the apple yet.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.840
Because prior to the mugging
they've both been living this sort

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.350 position:56%
of wonderful, complacent in the best
way possible, upper middle class,

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:14.720
very pretty life and
lifestyle together.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.310
And Maggie takes a bite of
the apple, and she starts

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.610
to see the world differently.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.210
And by the end of the
book it's, you know,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.650
does Mark basically take
a bite of the apple?

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.230
And does he start to see
the world as she does?

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.040
But at least they're
going to do it together.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.280
Or, does he not?

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.340
And I think that the novel
doesn't answer that question.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:37.910
But Jerome, the dog, was
always essential to me.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.450
They were never going to be
in the car by themselves.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.740
And part of that is because I
have a dog, and I love dogs.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.210
And the other part of that is
because a dog trainer told me

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:55.100 position:56%
about two, three years ago, he said,
it must have been longer than that.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.590
Four or five years ago he said.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.930
I'm distracted.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:02.920
We have ten minutes left just
in case anyone's wondering.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.660
A dog trainer told me that
he can walk into any house

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.390
and he knows whether or
not the people in the house

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:10.750
with the dog have been fighting.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:15.050
And I looked at him and I was
like, do you know that my husband

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.350
and I have just been fighting?

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:18.870
And he said, why do
you think I said it?

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:23.170
And I was like, fix our dog, dude.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.910
Fix the dog, and maybe
that will fix the marriage.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:29.280
And he was telling me something
that Cesar Millan says,

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.430
dogs are mirrors of their owners.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.260
And I think that is
absolutely correct.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:38.190 position:56%
So I thought, what a fun thing to
give these people something to love.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.220
Which is the thing I
tell my writing students.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.070
I love your advice,
the idea of the people

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.750 position:56%
who are bad don't think they're bad.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.170
I tell them, everybody
loves something.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:50.570
Humbert Humbert doesn't
just love Lolita.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.870
He loves language.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.270
He has a sense of humor.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:55.420
He is in awe of America, right.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.660
He can find beauty in anything.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.220
The kitch [phonetic]
is amazing to him.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.190
And so I'm always telling
my students,

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:05.800
don't make the stepmother 100%
evil because she can't be.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.210
That's not interesting.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:12.140
And so Mark and Maggie, even if
you as a reader can't stand them,

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.850
you're going to love
Jerome, and you're going

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.770
to love that they love Jerome.

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:20.490
So it's always important to
have something that characters.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:24.030
And for this childless
couple, it was also essential

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:27.350
that they had something that they
both loved and loved equally.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:31.260
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I
could talk to the two of you

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.440
for another three hours, but I know
there are people in the audience

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.740
who want to ask questions.

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.370
And we are running out of time.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:42.130
So I'd invite anyone who wants
to ask a question, comment,

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.430
please come to the microphone.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.140
&gt;&gt; Hi. Question for Miss Hand.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:53.920
As a Fantasy Award winner,
do you agree or disagree

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:59.090
with the recent decision to
remove H.P. Lovecraft's likeness

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:00.390
from the award, and why?

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:01.690
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Oh well,
you guys think like Trump

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.220
and Hillary are a big thing.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.550
I have to say myself I've never
been a Lovecraft fan, per se.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:16.310
So, I think that, you
know, so I'm not a huge fan

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.300
of his fiction, and
I never have been.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.750
There's been a few
stories that I liked,

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.940
but he's just not in my wheelhouse.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.540
And he was a racist and an
anti-Semite, and, you know,

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.890
those things kind of bleed through
his fiction the way that somebody

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.750
like Albert Payson Terhune was
a writer I did love as a kid

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.210
and wrote around the same time.

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.620
You can't re-read his work
now, or I can't re-read it.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:46.190
So I was sorry because the image
for the World Fantasy Award

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:50.550 position:56%
and that's affiliated with the World
Fantasy convention for those of,

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:51.990
most people probably don't know it.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:55.710
It was Gahan Wilson who is
the New Yorker cartoonist.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:39:00.350
Gahan did a caricature
of H.P. Lovecraft.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.880
And it's a great image.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.770
So for that reason, I
was sorry to see it go.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.290
But otherwise, I have to
honestly say that, you know,

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:14.830
I can understand absolutely
the reasons behind it.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.130
So.

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:21.390
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering in your
free time is there is any,

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.600
what sort of books do
you yourselves read?

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.750
Do you have any favorite
author or authors?

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.350
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: I sure do, yeah.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.730
Doris Lessing has been taking
up a lot of my time recently.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:40.220
And I also, I think she
is a terrifying writer.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.690
And I mean that in the right way.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:45.320
I read The Fifth Child I
think it's called recently.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.150
And if anyone out there
is on the fence

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.950
about having children,
read this book.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:54.200
And I think it's going to help
you see clearly where you stand.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.430
So Doris Lessing is a go to.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:00.790
And you're going to want to devour
everything that she has written.

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:03.710
Elizabeth Taylor is somebody
that I have discovered.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:06.550
I'm reading a novel right
now called Angel by her,

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.260
which is about a young
writer with huge ambitions

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:14.190
and a much higher opinion of
her work than she should have.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:19.030
And it is funny, but it also
manages to be quite disturbing.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:21.110
Muriel Spark.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.070
These are all strong women writers.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:29.800
I've certainly, Tim O'Brien
I go to all the time.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.550
In the Lake of the Woods
is probably the book

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.060
that I wish I could have
written if I were capable of it

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.300
and it hadn't been written.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.490
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand:
I, because I do a lot

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:44.720
of book reviewing and
have for many years.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.110
I teach an MFA program.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:52.920
So I have to do so much reading of
fiction for work that when I read

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.440
for pleasure, which I don't
have as much time to do

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.740
as I really would like to.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:01.080
I tend to read nonfiction,
so I tend to read historical,

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.290
you know, books about history.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.190
I like biographies.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.790
I'm not a huge fan of memoirs.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:11.010
Having said that, recently I read
Hannah's book, which I loved.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:15.220
I'm reading Elena Ferrante's
My Brilliant Friend,

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.410
which I'm finding really
interesting.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.650
And I'm reading a book about 14th,

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.380
a village in 14th century
France called [foreign language]

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.130
that I've been trying to get
through for a couple of years.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:31.410
It's a great thing to read at
night before going to sleep

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.170
because it's the perfect blend

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:37.930
of like engrossing and
completely tedious.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:41.500
So you could kind of, you
know, read a page or two.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.060
Well that's enough, which
is why it's taking me

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.470
so many years to get through it.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.420
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: My Brilliant
Friend goes back to this idea

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.080
where we started of
the opening sentence.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.270
The entire opening chapter,
I don't know how she did it.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.360
You have to read the
whole book to see.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:02.610
But it's, I still, I think
this, you can't do this.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.320
But how? I mean it's a
mystery and it's all there,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.650
but it's also nothing is there.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.580
It's just mind blowing.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:12.420
It's an absolutely mind blowing
opening to a novel that seems to be

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.000
about nothing to do with it.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.600 position:56%
But it has everything to do with it.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.700
And then when you get to
the end of the series,

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.010
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
She comes back to that.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.260
&gt;&gt; I have a question about story
structure for both authors.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:29.890
I'm curious about how you find,
or to what extent it is applicable

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:34.290
or useful to use the ideas of the
Joseph Campbell Hero's Journey type

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:37.900
of story architecture
as you're writing.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.390
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Yeah,
I have found that useful.

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:45.650
I tend to be kind of a seat
of the pants organic writer.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.330
I don't really outline
as much as I should.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:55.480
But when I'm forced to try to think
through a schematic for a story,

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.840
I do some, I do sometimes
think of that.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.840
But I, I don't follow it very
rigorously I have to say.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.110
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: I'm a fairly
instinctive writer as well.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.370
I do, I tell my students, you know,

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:13.810 position:56%
every story is either a hero takes a
journey or a stranger comes to town.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:16.900
And sometimes I find myself
saying that and I think,

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.290
what does that even mean?

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:19.590
I don't know.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.780
I mean maybe, I hope it helps you.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:27.530
I don't outline much
either until I get stuck.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:32.600
And for me the way through a
book is often writing the end.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.140
And so if I have enough at the
beginning, if I've gotten halfway

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.020
through and I know I
don't want to abandon it.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.320
But I feel stuck.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.900
I think it's a lot like reading the
last chapter or the last sentence.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.160 position:56%
I think, where do I want them to be.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.450
And this was the case
with Listen to Me.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.280
I had a realization.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.820
I didn't know what they
needed to be doing in the car.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.340
I didn't know really yet what the
book was about, but I had an image

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.710
in my head of the ending.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:01.890
And so I wrote the end, and then
it just, it sort of fell together.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:05.070
You know, it tumbled
to the conclusion.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.920
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I think we
have time for one more question.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.340
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask,
did you always know

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.250
that writing was what you wanted to
do, or was it coming to that more

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.580
of a process each of you.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.380
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Oh I've
always wanted to be a writer.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.420
I didn't think it was
possible I thought

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.720
that it was a fantasy,
a 100% fantasy.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.910
No, and it is, I'm
grateful for it every day.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.560
I love it.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.860
It's the best job in the world.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.160
It's the hardest job in the world.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.660
I absolutely love it.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.910
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Yeah
what she said, exactly.

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:40.210
Really, you know, I've always
wanted to be a writer, and I never,

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:45.190
you know, I'm still amazed, I'm
amazed that I'm here, you know.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.650
Truly, every day, all the time.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:50.020
Any time if I'm in a bad mood
or self-pitying or whining

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.910
about something, I'll stop and
think, could you ever have imagined

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.000
that you would have done this?

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.820
That you would have
written books, you know.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.140
Because I was a relatively
late bloomer

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.850
by today's standards, you know.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.710
I didn't really publish until
I was about 30, early 30s.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.330
So there was a long time
where I felt like, oh my God,

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.350
this is just never,
ever going to happen.

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.660
I'm delusional.

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.530
So yeah, I'm very grateful for it.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:17.830
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: And so are we.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:19.130
Thank you.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.430
&gt;&gt; Hannah Pittard: Thank you.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.730
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Hand: Thank you.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.370
