00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
&gt;&gt; Chairman on the Intergovernmental Battle
on climate change and also director general

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.670
of the energy and resources institute which
is a not for profit research institute headquarters

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.980
in new delhi but we have presents in several
parts of the world including North America,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.480
Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia, and the Middle
East. And very soon we hope to be in Africa

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:36.500
as well. Well I'm very happy to give my views
on the Davos question. I personally think

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.180
that we are at critical juncture where we
could address the twin challengers of meeting

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.820
the energy needs of a growing population,
and also try to address the problem of climate

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.681
change by ensuring that we mitigate the emissions
of greenhouse gasses in the years ahead. And

00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:04.410
what I would like to focus on is the very
severe and large problem that more people

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.120
around the world are facing. There are well
over a billion people on this planet who have

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.860
no access to modern forms of energy and there
for a number of them don't even know how to

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.940
get lighting once the sun goes down. Some
of them are able to burn a candle, some are

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.021
able to use a little lamp kerosene oil or
other forms of oi,l but quite apart from the

00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:36.060
fact that those are polluting options. They're
certainly not satisfactory. And often they

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.220
turn out to be very expensive as well. So
what my institute has come up with is a set

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.340
of devices which include solar lanterns these
will over take base lanterns. As well as solar

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.210
dorrtays or flashlights if you want to call
them that and these use a led lighting systems.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:05.060
The benefit of using these is theat there
are no running costs because it's solar energy

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.670
which gives you the lighting that product
needs. And what we are trying to do is promote

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.340
these on a large scale through a program that
I call lantern lighting leading lives. The

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.310
effort is to see that corporates, governments,
foundations around the world start looking

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.120
at this option and providing resources by
which poor people around the world can get

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.480
light into their lives. This would make such
a difference to them because not only would

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.000
they be able to, not only would they be able
to get lighting for their own daily uses,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.740
but think of the benefits that young children
might get. They might actually be able to

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.000
prepare their lessons, they might be able
to read something. In several parts of the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.810
world there's also a major challenge of adult
literary. Elderly people work in the daytime

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.540
can spend at least a little bit of time in
the evening trying to get literate. So essentially

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.440
this is a highly viable technology. Just to
give you an example a solar torch costs no

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:31.680
more than ten dollars, or less than eight
euros. A solar lantern cost the equivalent

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:41.440
of about seventy dollars, and with this set
of devices you could really take care of the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.770
needs of the whole world. Having said so,
we need an institution arrangement because

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.240
every village where to need to deceminate
this particular technology you would have

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.430
to have a local representative, someone who
can carry out very minor repairs, not that

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.820
repairs are required with this technology.
And can also act as the source for marketing

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.640
reasons for these devices. So there is need
to create market based local institution infrastructure.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:21.850
Now what I will submit is anyone that wants
information on this can get in touch on the

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:29.630
website of my institute, which is the energy
and resources institute. The website address

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:40.700
is teriin.org teriin.org. And you can get
all of the information you require on the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.870
particular set of watchings. We're hoping
that if we are fortunate we will have the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.840
kind of dedication that one is looking for
that in the next two to four years we might

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.440
be able to cover the entire planet and provide
those who have no means for modern lighting

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:05.870
systems who can get access to these technologies
and literally light our their lives. So this

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.280
is what I wanted to share with you and I hope
we can make a major beginning this year because

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.090
this would not only address the critical need
for energy as far as people in the world are

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.810
concerned but also to find a critical solution
for me to get emissions of greenhouse gasses

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.540
or potential emissions of greenhouse gasses
in the future. Thank you.
