protein engineer do you think that is
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.849
protein engineer do you think that is
part of the secret of your success that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859
part of the secret of your success that
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380

differently I think there's no doubt

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
differently I think there's no doubt
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.600
differently I think there's no doubt
about that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
about that
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.890
about that
I was able to look at the problem with a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
I was able to look at the problem with a
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.850
I was able to look at the problem with a
totally fresh set of eyes a problem that

realized that that the way that most
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.140

for me changing fields has been fun and
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.209

I still feel that way many years later

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219
I still feel that way many years later
 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.069

would it be fair to say that what you do

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
would it be fair to say that what you do
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.469
would it be fair to say that what you do
is to sort of manipulate nature's

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
is to sort of manipulate nature's
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.219
is to sort of manipulate nature's
inventiveness for human benefit what I

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
inventiveness for human benefit what I
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.570
inventiveness for human benefit what I
think of what I do is

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580
think of what I do is
 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.290
think of what I do is
copying nature's design process right

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300

beautiful design algorithm and what I do

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490
beautiful design algorithm and what I do
 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.990
beautiful design algorithm and what I do
is use that algorithm to build new

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000
is use that algorithm to build new
 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.960
is use that algorithm to build new
biological things and it's it's not it's

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970
biological things and it's it's not it's
 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.510
biological things and it's it's not it's
obvious it's totally obvious that this

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520
obvious it's totally obvious that this
 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.690
obvious it's totally obvious that this
is the way it should be done can you

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
is the way it should be done can you
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.820
is the way it should be done can you
give me an example of one of your

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830
give me an example of one of your
 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.380
give me an example of one of your
favorite things that you've been able to

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390
favorite things that you've been able to
 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.360

someone asked me what's the funnest

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130
someone asked me what's the funnest
 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.800
someone asked me what's the funnest
thing or what's the best thing that you

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810
thing or what's the best thing that you
 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.199
thing or what's the best thing that you
you've ever done it's always what I'm

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209
you've ever done it's always what I'm
 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.290
you've ever done it's always what I'm
doing now so what I'm doing now is

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300
doing now so what I'm doing now is
 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.750
doing now so what I'm doing now is
looking at this question of how do you

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760
looking at this question of how do you
 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.530
looking at this question of how do you
evolve innovation how does innovation

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540
evolve innovation how does innovation
 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.040
evolve innovation how does innovation
happen how do you get a whole new

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050
happen how do you get a whole new
 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.640

better than humans do I'm not I said
 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.000
better than humans do I'm not I said
absolutely I suppose nature's doing this

absolutely I suppose nature's doing this
 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.650
absolutely I suppose nature's doing this
all the time that it's coming up with

not so different really is it well we've
 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.030
not so different really is it well we've
been tinkering with nature for tens of

thousands of years look at a poodle we
created all sorts of organisms and
