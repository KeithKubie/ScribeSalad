simply revive them and in that sense

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130
simply revive them and in that sense
 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.910

well the double is in the details first

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260
well the double is in the details first

of all if you suddenly freeze the human

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720
of all if you suddenly freeze the human
 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.320
of all if you suddenly freeze the human
body the problem is that ice crystals

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330
body the problem is that ice crystals
 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.439
body the problem is that ice crystals
begin to form inside the cells as the

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449
begin to form inside the cells as the
 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.899
begin to form inside the cells as the
ice crystals expand they rupture the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:36.909
ice crystals expand they rupture the
 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.319
ice crystals expand they rupture the
cells so in other words freezing the

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329
cells so in other words freezing the
 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.270
cells so in other words freezing the
human body seems to work only

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280
human body seems to work only
 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.399
human body seems to work only
superficially but if you look at the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409
superficially but if you look at the
 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.099
superficially but if you look at the
human tissue in the microscope you find

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109
human tissue in the microscope you find
 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.430
human tissue in the microscope you find
massive tearing and disruption of cell

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440
massive tearing and disruption of cell
 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.680
massive tearing and disruption of cell
walls now you may say to yourself now

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690
walls now you may say to yourself now

wait a minute fish do it right don't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120
wait a minute fish do it right don't
 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.569
wait a minute fish do it right don't
they simply get frozen solid and

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579
they simply get frozen solid and
 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.569
they simply get frozen solid and
wintertime frogs aren't they being able

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579
wintertime frogs aren't they being able
 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.219
wintertime frogs aren't they being able
to thaw themselves out when it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229
to thaw themselves out when it's
 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.770

springtime from a block of ice and the

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780
springtime from a block of ice and the
 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.080
springtime from a block of ice and the
answer is yes but they do it with

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090
answer is yes but they do it with
 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.350
answer is yes but they do it with
antifreeze that is glucose here's how it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360
antifreeze that is glucose here's how it
 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.080
antifreeze that is glucose here's how it
works you know you put antifreeze inside

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090
works you know you put antifreeze inside
 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.120
works you know you put antifreeze inside
your car so even though outside

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130
your car so even though outside
 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.670
your car so even though outside
everything could be frozen solid but

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680
everything could be frozen solid but
 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.100
everything could be frozen solid but
inside your car liquid still flow

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110
inside your car liquid still flow
 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.590
inside your car liquid still flow
normally and so your car still runs in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600
normally and so your car still runs in
 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.110
normally and so your car still runs in
the same way glucose is an antifreeze

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120
the same way glucose is an antifreeze
 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.810
the same way glucose is an antifreeze
for frogs and certain fish that their

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820
for frogs and certain fish that their
 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.640
for frogs and certain fish that their
bodies could still be in liquid form

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650
bodies could still be in liquid form
 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.370
bodies could still be in liquid form
with blood circulating even though they

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380
with blood circulating even though they
 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.820
with blood circulating even though they
are frozen solid on the outside now this

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830
are frozen solid on the outside now this
 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.530
are frozen solid on the outside now this
doesn't mean that at some point in the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540
doesn't mean that at some point in the
 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.660
doesn't mean that at some point in the
future we might be able to create a

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670
future we might be able to create a
 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.640
future we might be able to create a
natural kind of antifreeze for the human

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650
natural kind of antifreeze for the human
 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.280
natural kind of antifreeze for the human
body however at the present time the

substantive animation would kill a human
