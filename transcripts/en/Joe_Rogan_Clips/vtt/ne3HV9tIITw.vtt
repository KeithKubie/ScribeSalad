00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.150
The why is it that we think that the known universe is larger than we can

2
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:10.710
observe?
Well,
one point is that it's,
um,

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.410
expanding and we always see the same radiation out there.

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.640
So the glow of the big bang,
but there are some deeper reasons.

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.670
And the one from the theory of inflation,

6
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.590
the,
the,
the,
the,
the best way to explain the universe,

7
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:36.300
the properties that we see is that it's very much bigger than the piece we can

8
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:40.890
see.
So for example,
we measure space to be what's called flats.

9
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:42.930
I don't even know how to say what's called flat.
It is flat.

10
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.430
So if you imagine slices of space,
let's say,

11
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:48.660
imagine slices of them at different times.

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.980
So say to slice the universe and say there's a big sheets like this today,

13
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.650
I could tell as a sheet of space.
And then another sheet and another sheet.

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.840
And it can,
it can have a geometry.

15
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:01.290
I can be flat like a tabletop or it could be curved,
uh,

16
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.340
like a sphere or it could be curved in the opposite directions of like a saddle

17
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:08.790
or a bowl.
And we can measure that.
And when we measure it,

18
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:10.380
we see it's absolutely flat.

19
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.750
And that's a very unusual thing for it to be like,
um,

20
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.470
it requires,
because what Einstein's theory says is that the,

21
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.550
the shape of space that the curvature of space and determined by the stuff

22
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:24.384
that's in it,

23
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.530
that's us basically Einstein's theory of general relativity put stuff into space

24
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.070
and it curves and bends it in warm sea and stretches it and so on.

25
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.300
And what we find is that there's precisely the right amount of stuff in the

26
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:40.800
universe to have a completely flat universe.
And the,

27
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.850
the explanation,

28
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.880
the most favored explanation for that is the university is way bigger than the

29
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:47.730
piece we can see.
And so it's like looking at piece of the earth.
I,

30
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:52.170
you look a little one mile square of the earth,
right?
Then it's,

31
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.870
it is flat,
right?

32
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.560
You have to look at big distances kind of evolved at the radius of the earth or

33
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:02.740
not,
you know,
bigger,
bigger than one kilometer.
Anyway,
on one mile to see the,

34
00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:06.810
actually you're on a curved surface and that's one of the ideas about the

35
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.400
universe and white appears to be the way that it is because it's way,
way bigger.

36
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.690
So we were just talking a little piece and that's why it looks flat and that's

37
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.850
one of the ideas.
Now when you say flat like that,
my,

38
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.650
my brain doesn't understand this because from our perspective when you look up

39
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:28.950
at the Milky Way,
you see all these stars all over the place.

40
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.110
So if you're saying flat like what,
how much height and what,
what are you saying?

41
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.270
Ah,
so terms of like the way to measure it,

42
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.020
the best way to think about it is not to think of three dimensions of space

43
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.660
because then we can't picture it.
Okay.

44
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.150
But you can think of to like this tabletop and that's all right.

45
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:46.500
We just forget the other one for now.

46
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.400
And so you know what flat is on this table mean you could define it.

47
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.480
So you could say,
for example,
that if I draw a triangle on the top of the table,

48
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.590
then all the angles add up to 180 degrees.
So that actually defines flats.

49
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.410
If you did that on the surface of the earth with a big triangle,

50
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.490
then the angles wouldn't adopt two under 90 degrees.
Um Oh.

51
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:08.920
You could draw a circle and say,
what's Pi?

52
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.700
So Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

53
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.070
That's only true on a flat surface is different if the surface is curved.

54
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.230
So you can define flatness.
So when you,
but when,

55
00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:25.060
when you're saying flat and what is the height and what is the width?

56
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.880
Like if you're were talking about it as if it's a table,

57
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:31.150
there must be some sort of a,
there's a dimension to it,
correct?
Oh yeah.

58
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:35.200
There's a third dimension of space.
But the,
the same applies.

59
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:39.510
It's just a generalization of geometry.
Then say you can pay their fighters.

60
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.060
We can picture it in two dimensions,
but you can,
you can draw,

61
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.780
you can quite literally,
you could imagine sending light beams out.

62
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.860
And we do this measurement.
Actually we can look at the,
the,
the disk,

63
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.600
the most distant light we can see,

64
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.280
which is something called the cosmic microwave background radiation,
which is,

65
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.750
if you imagine looking out,
if you look at the Andromeda Galaxy,

66
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.600
which we can see with the naked eye here in la,
you can see that.

67
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.260
So the most distant object you can see with the naked eye,
and it's about two,

68
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.390
2 million light years away or so,

69
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.590
which means the light took 2 million years to get to us.
So it's a long way away,

70
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.483
but it's very big.

71
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.130
So as you look further out into the universe to more and more distant galaxies,

72
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:24.850
you're looking further back in time cause you look at something that's a billion

73
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:27.430
light years away.
Then the light took a billion years to get to us.

74
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.380
So you see it as it was a billion years in the past.

75
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.010
And we can actually look so far out that we can see almost back to 13.8 billion

76
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.580
years ago,
which is very close to the big bang.

77
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.690
So we can look to light that began its journey before they were galaxies.

78
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.920
And that's the,
the oldest light in the universe,
which is,
by the way,
one of the,

79
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.920
one of the pieces of evidence,
when people say,
I don't believe in the big bank,

80
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.900
the answer is,
well,
you can see it.
Sorry.
It just,
that you can see,

81
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.750
we have pictures of it.
Um,
that light,

82
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.190
it turns out that there are some structures are ripples in that light,

83
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.570
um,
which we can use as a ruler.
So quite literally as,

84
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.010
as a ruler on the sky.

85
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.920
And then because that light's been traveling through the universe,

86
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.910
we can see how that rule has been distorted as,

87
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.020
as the light has traveled through space.

88
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.330
And so we can infer where the space is flat or curved or how it's warps,

89
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:24.220
if you like,
just from that measurement.
