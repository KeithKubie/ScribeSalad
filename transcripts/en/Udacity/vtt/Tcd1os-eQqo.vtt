00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's see. Let's convert this velocity to meters per second.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When we do this conversion, we get a speed of 3890 m/s.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I know β is just v/c where c is the speed of light 3&lt;i&gt;10⁸m/s&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and when I carry this out, I get a value of 1.3&lt;i&gt;10⁻⁵.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So actually a very small fraction of the speed of light and actually this leads us

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to a gamma of 1.000000000084, barely larger than 1 but large enough.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
These machines are so sensitive that this actually makes a difference and in fact,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
they pretty quickly accumulate errors if you don't correct for special relativity.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, the engineers who designed these aren't so certain.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
They don't want to gamble entirely on special relativity being true so they had an option--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
special relativity mode on or off.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Einstein would be pleased to know that the special relativity mode

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is still very much on for the GPS satellites.
