00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington D.C.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.220
&gt;&gt; I', Kristi Finefield, I'm a
Reference Librarian in the Prints

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.040 position:67%
and Photographs Division, which essentially
means my job is to connect researchers

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.420 position:70%
with the visual materials in our collections.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.520
And I do that both in the Prints
and Photographs Reading Room,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.310
as well as online in our
Ask a Librarian service.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.600 position:61%
I also write for the Picture This blog,
and moderate the flicker photo stream

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.160 position:59%
that Prints and Photographs maintains.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.170 position:56%
I actually remember a lot of my
interactions fondly, usually they --

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.970
a lot of them start very
typically, like I think it's going

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.160
to be a very straightforward
simple reference question,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.330 position:61%
and it evolves into something much
more interesting or much more exciting,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.600 position:64%
or I learn something from the researcher.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.770 position:72%
I had just a quick example, I had a researcher
who wrote in, I never actually met him

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.710
in person, he never actually
made it to the Reading Room,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.150 position:67%
and yet we had a very engaged
conversation about photo -- about drawings.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.590 position:72%
He wrote from Canada, and yet he was a student
of the U.S. Civil War, which is interesting.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.040 position:72%
And he was trying to find the digital versions
of our Alfred Waud documentary drawings

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.680 position:69%
of the Civil War, so these are sketches done

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.480
on the battlefield, right
there in the line of fire.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.480 position:72%
Some of the only, kind of, eyewitness accounts

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.220 position:61%
of the Civil War during battle are
these drawings done by various artists.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.840 position:70%
So, we have about 1,000 or so of his drawings
digitized, and he couldn't find them.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.910 position:56%
So, the question was very simple,
"I was trying to find, or I can't --

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.060 position:64%
I know you have them, and I haven't
found the right spot to start searching."

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.640 position:58%
That's an easy question, very
straightforward, I sent him the link,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.020
showed him how to do the searches.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.530
And then he wrote back and
thanked me, and was said oh,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.820 position:59%
he was seeing drawings he'd never seen
before, you know, he'd only seen ones

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.970 position:70%
that had been published in books, and there's
hundreds more that weren't readily available.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.230
So, I ended up -- and he said he
was going to give a presentation

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.430 position:56%
to his Civil War Round Table group,
and they were going to just love it.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.790 position:63%
So, I ended up writing back, and telling
him some things that aren't evident

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.190
from the digital images, which
brings me to why it's so valuable.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.580 position:72%
If you can, come to the Prints and Photographs
Reading Room, you get a new perspective

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.550 position:59%
on original materials that you can't
necessarily get as effectively online.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.100
So, I explained to him, make sure
you pay attention to the size

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.750 position:75%
of the drawings, we have the size in the record.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.790 position:67%
Some of the pieces of paper are this big,
and he's drawn a full battle scene on them.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.990 position:72%
Paper was precious or scarce, hard to come by,
sometimes we could do drawings on both sides

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.400
of the paper, and we scan
both sides and indicate that.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.470
So, he said that added a
lot to his presentation,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.480
but he was so enthusiastic
that it got me enthusiastic.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.410 position:64%
I looked at the drawings again, you know,
I'd looked at them many times before,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.350 position:69%
but it gave me new perspective on how
exciting they are to see for the first time.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.960
So, then he wrote back, and told
me all about his talk later so,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.010 position:67%
it was like we became buddies, or friends
over the material that he was engaged with.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.520 position:67%
One thing I'd like to tell people about our
collections is, don't stop at one image.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.050 position:63%
When you find an image you're
interested in, don't let that be the end

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.780
of your research, or the
end of your exploration.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.660 position:58%
Because inevitably that image relates
to something else in our collection,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.820 position:75%
it's either part of a larger group of photos, if
it's a photo, it's part of a large collection.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.850 position:69%
It might relate in some way to a different
format we have, and I just think if you stop

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.320 position:61%
at one, then you sell yourself short on
learning the full context of an image,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.640 position:63%
and that's where the story lies I think.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.970 position:64%
