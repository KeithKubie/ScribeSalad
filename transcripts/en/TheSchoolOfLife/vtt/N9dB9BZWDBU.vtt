00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.620
Charles Dickens was the most famous writer in the English language during the 19th century.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.500
And one of the best-selling authors, of all time.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
He can seem remote, the frock coat, the velvet collar, the fish tail beard, the bow tie.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.720
But he has a lot to say to us today.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.740
And that's because he had a remarkable ambition.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.580
He believed the writing could play a big role in fixing the problems of the world.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.440
Dickens didn't just write.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.240
From the very beginning there were signs of a great showman.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.040
As a child he loved putting on plays in a family kitchen.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.180
And singing songs, standing on the table in the local pub.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.440
Before radio or television, going to hear Dickens giving a reading was to experience an exceptional showman.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.340
Often to the dismay of later literary friends,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.840
entertainment remained at the heart of what Dickens was up to.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.640
He was always hoping to get us interested in some pretty serious things.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.260
The evils of an industrializing society.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.120
The working conditions in factories.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.300
child labour

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800
vicious social snobbery

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.700
the maddening inefficiencies of government bureaucracy.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.000
In theory, we recognized that these and the modern versions are pretty worthy themes.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.660
Bu if we are honest with ourselves, we admit that they don't sound very inviting as things to read about in a novel in bed or the airport.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:35.480
Dickens's genius was to discover that the big ambitions to educate the society about its failings didn't have to be opposed to what his critics called: fun.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.740
Racy plots,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.760
a chatty style,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.980
clownish characters,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.420
weepy moments

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.460
and happy endings.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
He rejected the idea that we have to make a fatal choice between being worthy but dull, or popular but shallow.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Dickens sat at educate via entertainment

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.280
Because he so well understood how easy it is to us individually and collectively to resist certain tricky but important lessons.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.760
Dickens is significant because he was working out for his own time how to do something that's crucial for us.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.600
How to be seductive about serious things.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.540
Charles Dickens was born in Portsmouth in February 1812.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.900
His father was  a clerk in a navy office.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.840
They had to constantly move about to follow his different appointments.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.960
It was a genteel  life at first

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.500
But there were always money trouble looming.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.740
When he was only ten, Dickens had to leave school, because his parents could not longer afford the modest fees.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.020
He was send to work in London at the blacking factory.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.160
Where they made polish for giving a dark sheen, much admired at the time to metal surfaces.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.760
It was a grim experience.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.680
Young Dickens hated the fumes and numbing speed with which he had to carry out repetitive tasks.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.140
The people he worked around were bullying and sinister.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.560
Then his father was arrested for debt.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.320
At that time debtors could be confined to prison along with their dependence

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.760
by their creditors until they were able to start paying  off what they owned.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.680
So the whole family moved into the squalid Mashalsea prison.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.900
Except young Dickes who lodged nearby and continued with his horrible job.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.640
Part of the continuing popular affection for Dickens comes from his very strong sense of the precariousness of life.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.180
And his deep compassion for those who are its victims.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.680
When Dickens's live improved, in his early twenties he discovered that he was an outstandingly brilliant journalist.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.400
Dickens was very good at remembering his own suffering.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.620
And he used it in a very clever way.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.340
He always put really nice characters into the awful places of Victorian England.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.780
The blacking factory is described in David Copperfield

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.980
through the eyes of young David, who is sensitive, intelligent and charming.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.840
David is the reader when young or the reader's son, or nephew.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.180
Dickens is saying, imagine someone like you or someone you like was in somewhere like that.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.000
When he writes about poor houses, which were local force labour camps for people unable to support themselves,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.300
Dickens sends in a little Oliver Twist

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.760
who actually belongs to a well to do family from whom he's been separated by a series of tragic accidents.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.840
Oliver is not typical at all of the people who ended up in poor houses.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.860
But he is there, so that his readers -who at that time  would genuinely be quite prosperous- could think, what if this were me?

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.640
On one occasion when Dickens shows us the miseries of the debtor prison.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.720
It's in the company of a lovable buffoon,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.400
A modelled but very sweet and well-meaning man, called Mr. Micawber.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.400
The background protective assumption that only rather shady types could end up here is punctuated.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.400
Dickens was working with the key assumption:

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.900
of course everyone knew already that there were poor houses, horrible working conditions and debtors' prisons,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.100
these were obvious facts of early nineteen century life in England.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.820
The point was that comfortable people, the kind of people who had the power to change things, generally didn't feel much sense of urgency.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.720
They didn't feel personally connected to the problems.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:05.780
So Dickens used his own experience to get people to feel interested in and sympathetic to the plight of others that they normally had been emotionally very distant from.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.260
He didn't say look how awful it is for them!

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.200
He said: here is what it would be like for you.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.400
In an ideal world we perhaps care equally about everyone,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.880
But in reality our concern is much more readily directed towards the misfortunes of people we know and   find likeable.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.520
So if, like Dickens, your project is to draw attention to a failure in the system,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.960
it's a very good strategy to follow the methods he was using.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.840
Get us to like the  people who are having a hard time  and then, and only then, can we start to feel engaged.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.520
The other thing that Dickens did to keep us on board with his high minded vision of social reform,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.560
was to keep on showing how well he understood the cosy, pleasing, enjoyable things of life.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.440
He desperately didn't want the big causes

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.720
to come across his meaning, you couldn't keep on liking all the sweet comforts of life.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.980
So Dickens was particularly good of evoking the pleasures of home.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.080
In one of his novels, he takes us to the house of a lovable old eccentric

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.420
who's  refashioned  his small suburban  house as a miniature castle,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.380
complete with the tiny drawbridge that can be pulled up by legs of twine to keep the wild world at bay .

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.400
Dickens loved picnics, games of cricket in the park,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.400
going shopping for a new tie,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.520
donoughts, sitting by the fire, having friends around for a dinner,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.520
warm blankets and going on holiday.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.160
Being a caring and good person - he is saying - doesn't mean disdaining the ordinary small pleasures.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.880
This is a key element in Dickens's general strategy.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.600
He knows it is going to be hard to get people to think about difficult things,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.980
if you don't start from the deep recognition of what we are already like.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.680
Otherwise you can come across as cold and a bit obsessive .

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.540
Dickens took the practical business side of writing very seriously.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.560
He was immensely productive, he churned out books

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.660
and he was deeply concerned about copyright laws, sales figures and profit margins.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.380
But Dickens didn't simply want to sell a lot of novels.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.160
He wanted to change things in the world.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.440
But he knew perfectly well that a book wouldn't have an effect unless  it was in wide circulation,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.520
unless the business side was going well.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.500
His writing draws attention to many things that were going wrong.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.200
The poor law, the dreadful state of schools, rampant  nepotism and harsh working conditions.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.980
But he wasn't trying to advocate specific schemes of reform.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.340
If you'd ask what exactly the government should do to improve the conditions in factories

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.980
or what the better legal system would look like

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.280
he wouldn't have had carefully worked-out alternative policy to hand.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.940
What he was doing, was shaping the climate of feeling and opinion,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:44.040
which makes it much easier for people trying to get an act through Parliament raise funds or make local improvements.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.800
Others can much more readily see the point of political action.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.200
Once the issues have moved up the mental agenda and feel close to us emotionally.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.400
Dickens was very interested in trying to help the world.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.460
And hugely sensitive to the suffering of others.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.540
But closer to home, things didn't work out so well.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.580
He wasn't a good husband or father. He got married in 1837 when he was in his mid-twenties to Catherine Hogarth.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.540
And they had 10 children together, 8 of whom survived  into adulthood.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.700
But Dickens increasingly found her dull and passive,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:22.100
and when he was in his mid-forties he fell in love with a nineteen year old actress, Ellen Turner.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.440
He couldn't get divorce: it was completely taboo for a major public figure

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.600
to take such a step.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.100
So they separated, his wife left after 20 years together

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.740
and they never saw each other again.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.700
Dickens was unimpressed by all of his children whom he regarded as idle and ever ready to sponge off him.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.120
They were prone to drinking too much and to gambling .

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:46.400
Dickens is a painful reminder of the terrible conflicts that can arise between different kinds of devotion.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.800
Dickens was immensely painstaking with his work.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.620
He'd stay up as late as needed.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.720
He'd think of it at first in the morning, he exhausted himself.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:59.620
Yet around his children and his wife, he was plodding, conventional and often coldly detached.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.240
We could blame him and say he should have been a better partner and father,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:12.760
or we can feel a touch of pity to the horrible limitations of our nature, which can make it hard to us  to be very good at two very different kinds of things at the same time.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.180
And hopefully a little of this pity can extend to ourselves.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.060
Since we are the ones who now actually need it..

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:25.440
On the 8th of June 1870, when he was 58, Dickens died at home after his usual intense day's work.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.440
He was at the early stages of his fifteenth novel.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.240
The Guardian published in the obituary  the next day:

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.840
Dickens's power doesn't lie just in the particular things he wrote.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.400
What's even more impressive is the bigger idea to which he was loyal all his life.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.420
That the task of writing and art more generally is to make goodness attractive,

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.800
to make it easier and more bearable for us to learn uncomfortable lessons

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:13.820
and to broaden our sympathies by helping us to identify with people whose outward lives are maybe unlike us but whose inner lives are not unsimilar.
