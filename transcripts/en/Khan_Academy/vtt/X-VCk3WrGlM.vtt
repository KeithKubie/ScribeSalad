00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.300
In the last video, we saw a
potential mechanism where if

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.800
we reacted hydrogen bromide with
this alkene right over

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.910
here, that we could
essentially add.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.370
We had the addition of this
halide to what started as an

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.800
alkene, and then it ended up as

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.370
2-bromo-pentane, as an alkane.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.630
But when we did that, we made a
somewhat arbitrary decision,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.880
or I didn't explain why
we made the decision.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.010
We said, look, this hydrogen
is going to be partially

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.610
positive, because this guy's so
electronegative, and maybe

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.880
when it's partially positive,
it'll be attracted.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.970
Maybe it'll just bump in just
the right way into one of

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.660
these carbons.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.490
It'll maybe swipe
its electron.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.310
We somewhat arbitrarily in the
last video decided that it

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.300
would swipe this
guy's electron.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.750
But you could just as easily
imagine a world where it

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.940
swipes an electron
from this guy.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.100
So let's draw a mechanism for
that and just think about

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.530
which one is more likely
to actually happen.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.730
So what happens?

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.180
So once again, this guy-- let
me draw all of his valence

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.280
electrons, so this
is the bromine.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.510
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven valence electrons.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.710
You have the hydrogen.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.250
I'll do it in the same color.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.500
The hydrogen has its electron
right there.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.580
This is partially positive and
this is partially negative.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.640
The hydrogen might want
to swipe one of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.520
these electrons away.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.270
Let's do it from this
guy right here.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.720
So he has this electron right
over here, so the other side

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.000
of that bond, it goes to the
hydrogen when the hydrogen

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.210
goes near it, or maybe
it's attracted to it.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.070
And when it goes to hydrogen,
then the hydrogen lets go of

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.780
the electron that the bromine
wanted all along, because it's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.520
so electronegative.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.760
So then that electron
goes to the bromine.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.350
So after we do that, what
will it look like?

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.140
What will be the next step
in our reaction?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.740
And it will look fundamentally
different than

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.360
this right over here.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.040
So now what happens?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.190
So we have a carbon bonded to
two hydrogens, and it only has

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.720
a single bond to the other
carbon, which is bonded to the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.480
original hydrogen right
over there.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.670
Let me write my hydrogens a
little bit-- actually, let me

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.396
write this whole thing
a little bit neater.

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:25.080
So you have your carbon bonded
to a hydrogen and another

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.060
hydrogen, and now it only has
a single bond to this carbon

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.270
right here, which is bonded to
a hydrogen and then the rest

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.346
of the chain.

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:36.820
Let me just draw the rest
of the chain right here.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.110
And now this electron went
to the hydrogen.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.670
The other electron that it was
paired with is still with this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.320
carbon, so now this carbon is
now bonded to that hydrogen

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.240
over there.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.700
So this blue electron is
now with the hydrogen.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.790
Let me draw.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.380
So the blue electron that was
here has now gone over to the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.910
orange hydrogen.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.535
Let me draw it a little
bit neater than that.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:03.360
It has now gone over to this
hydrogen right over there.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.800
And then the hydrogen lost its
electron to the bromine.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.820
So the bromine originally had
seven valence electrons: one,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.530
two, three, four, five,
six, seven.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.480
And then it nabbed an extra
electron from the hydrogen, so

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.750
now it will have a
negative charge.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.370
It is a negative ion.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.730
It is bromide.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.340
It's a bromide anion, I guess
you could call it.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.690
And since this guy lost an
electron, he had four valence

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.980
electrons, lost one to the
hydrogen, he now has a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.000
positive charge.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.250
He's a carbocation.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.670
So notice the difference.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.090
Before, this guy lost the
electron, and so the hydrogen

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.110
bonded to this carbon.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.510
In this situation, this guy
lost the electron, so the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.420
hydrogen bonded to
the other carbon.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.460
And so you can imagine, from
here, something very similar

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.580
happens as what happened in the
first video, but now it

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.940
happens to this carbon
right over there.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.720
So let's do that.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.930
This carbon is positive.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.960
The bromide ion is obviously
negative, so maybe he'll want

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.690
to swipe his electron away.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.240
So this electron then goes to
the carbocation and then it

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.560
will form a bond.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.899
This green will go to the
carbocation and then this

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.839
purple one still stays
with the bromine.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.930
And so they'll have a bond.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.720
They're paired up, you
can imagine it.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.260
So then we're left with,
we have a carbon.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.770
We have our original
hydrogens.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.580
We have this carbon, that
hydrogen, the rest of the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.110
chain: CH2, CH3.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.140
And then you have this
hydrogen right here

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.960
that it bonded to.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.520
That was our first step.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.420
And now the bromine
has bonded to this

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.850
carbon right over here.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.990
The bromine has bonded over to
that carbon right over there.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.920
And we're done!

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.440
This is another possible
mechanism.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.130
This one we ended up with
2-bromopentane, right?

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.600
Because it's on the
number two carbon.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.080
Here we have 1-bromo-pentane.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.360
One, two, three, four, five.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.290
Still five carbons.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.560
It's just the bromine is
attached to the one carbon

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.080
here, attached to the
two carbon here.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.040
So we now need to think about
it, because on a first cut,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.880
these both seemed like
reasonable mechanisms. But if

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.450
you did it experimentally, you
would see that this is the one

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.380
that you'd really observe.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.830
I actually haven't done this
exact experiment, so I don't

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.580
know the proportions.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.600
But you're going to observe this
one disproportionately.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.750
The great majority of the
products that you see are

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.960
going to be this one,
not that one.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.200
And so the question is, well,
you know, they both seem like

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.750
reasonable things
to do up here.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.210
Why is this one so much
more likely to

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.360
happen than that one?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.040
It all comes from something
called Markovnikov's rule.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.840
And there's a couple of ways
to think about it.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.950
When Markovnikov thought it
up, or he observed it, it

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.730
seemed to work.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.620
They weren't 100% sure
about why it worked.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.880
We can think a little bit
about why it worked.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.500
So Markovnikov's rule,
a couple of ways you

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.340
can think about it.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.170
You can think of it as the thing
that already has more

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.290
hydrogens is more likely to get
more hydrogens, so that's

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.950
what happened here.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.160
This thing had more hydrogens
on it than the right carbon

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.540
right here.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.860
This right carbon had a
hydrogen, but it had some

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.010
other alkyl group
attached to it.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.600
And so the thing that had more
hydrogens ended up with the

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.350
hydrogen, and then the thing
that had more groups, this

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.740
character right here had
more groups, right?

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.880
He had one group over here.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.480
This carbon over here
had no groups.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.630
He ended up with the bromine.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.210
So the thing that has
more hydrogens ends

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.260
up with more hydrogens.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.990
The thing that has more groups
ends up with more groups.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.890
So I guess you kind of go more
in the direction that

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.930
you are going in.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.350
But that still is just a rule,
so why does that make sense?

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.150
It starts to make sense when you
think about that in both

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.190
mechanisms, we had to
have a carbocation.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.560
We talked about it in
the last video.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.160
We had a carbocation
right over there.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.500
This is the left carbon
being a carbocation.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.570
This is the right carbon
being a carbocation.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.450
And Markovnikov's rule all comes
from which carbocation

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.840
is more stable, which one has
a lower energy level.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.590
It turns out that the
carbocation that is a bonded

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:34.140
to more electron-rich molecules
or atoms is going to

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.610
be more stable.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.120
You can imagine it has more
things that, look, it's

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.830
positive, but it has more
carbons around it so it can

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.130
share some of those electrons.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.700
The electron clouds will help
it out a little bit to be a

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.700
little bit more stable.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.170
This one right here is only
bonded to one other carbon, so

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.920
not as much sharing.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.150
This is bonded to two.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.130
So, in general, when you're
only bonded to one other

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.240
carbon, you're called
a primary carbon.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.340
And if you're carbocation, this
is a primary carbocation

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.250
right here.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.710
This guy is bonded to two
carbons, so he would be called

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.020
a secondary carbon.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.825
Since it's a carbocation, it's
a secondary carbocation, so

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:16.130
this right here is secondary.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.390
So a secondary carbocation is
more stable than a primary.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.280
And actually a tertiary, if you
had another carbon group

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.980
here or something else that had
a lot of electrons around

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.270
it, that would be even
more stable.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.160
So bonded to three things, more
stable than two things.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.710
And when I say two things, two
things other than hydrogen,

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.470
and then, more stable
than one.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.010
So Markovnikov's rule all is a
byproduct of the fact that

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.710
this carbocation is
more stable than

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.179
this one over here.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.500
That's because it's secondary
versus primary.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.290
Because it's secondary, it can
borrow electrons from some of

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.210
its friends.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.580
It has more neighbors to borrow

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.940
electrons than this one.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.010
And since this is more stable,
this is more likely to happen.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.250
This is a more likely
intermediate to have. This is

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.690
a less likely outcome
to have in general.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.230
And that's why you're more
likely to get to this left

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.340
product, the 2-bromo-pentane
than the 1-bromo-pentane.
