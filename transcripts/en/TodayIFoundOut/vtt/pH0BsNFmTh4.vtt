00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:15.330
In comparison to the multi-million dollar
star-studded display of excess that is the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.399
modern day Academy Awards, the first Academy
Awards ceremony was a relatively muted affair

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.109
that could even be described as quaint if
you were so inclined.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.420
Held in a medium-sized banquet hall in a Hollywood
hotel mostly known for being haunted today

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.480
(Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel), the May of 1929
event wasn’t even broadcast to the public

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.809
in any form.

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.860
As unbelievable as it may seem given how massively
popular the Academy Awards are today, the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.050
idea of an awards ceremony to celebrate various
achievements in filmmaking was initially thought

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.109
to be absurd.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.890
You see, few in Hollywood believed that any
members of the studios within the industry

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.390
would vote for anything but their own films.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.850
As for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences itself, it was a relatively new

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.000
organization, in part formed by producer Louis
B. Mayer in 1927 with the intent of uniting

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.430
the various branches of filmmaking, as well
as to try to curtail these entities from unionizing.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.479
When it came to the Academy Awards themselves,
he also hoped this would similarly allow him

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.250
extra direct control over these groups.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.320
As he would later state, “I found that the
best way to handle [filmmakers] was to hang

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.979
medals all over them … If I got them cups
and awards, they’d kill… to produce what

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:29.979
I wanted.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.560
That’s why the Academy Award was created.”

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.180
Others in the Academy had less nefarious motives,
with the hope being that the Academy Awards

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.539
would lend more prestige and legitimacy to
the industry, helping to convince the public

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.840
to take this relatively new form of entertainment
more seriously.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.000
So, yes- even from the beginning the Academy
Awards have always been about the individuals

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.539
working in movies trying to make it seem like
they are extremely important…

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.500
This all brings us around to the story of
Rin Tin Tin, a German shepherd dog that was

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.200
found in a half blown up kennel in France
during WWI by an American gunner named Lee

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200
Duncan.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.850
When Duncan came across the kennel, most of
the dogs inside were dead from the bombing

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.140
of the area, excepting one mother dog and
her five pups, two of which he kept for himself,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.160
naming them Rin Tin Tin and Nanette.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.150
(Named after little Rintintin and Nénette
yarn dolls often given as good luck charms

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.400
to soldiers and others fighting to free France.)

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.690
After the war, Duncan brought the two dogs
back to the states with him, with Rin Tin

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.230
Tin ultimately becoming a huge star in Hollywood,
prominently appearing in a whopping 27 films

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.330
during his career, almost singlehandedly popularizing
the German Shepard breed in America and playing

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.470
a large part in keeping the struggling Warner
Bros. afloat in the early days.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.670
In the year leading up to the first Academy
Awards, he also starred in four hit films,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.980
Jaws of Steel, A Dog of the Regiment, Tracked
by the Police, and Hills of Kentucky.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.750
(You can watch Rin Tin Tin in action in that
one here, valiantly defending little Davey

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.750
from a pack of wolves).

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.870
So when said award ceremony came around, the
story goes that he, naturally, won best actor.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.170
But as a huge point of the Academy Awards
was to try to make filmmakers and their films

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.180
seem more important and prestigious, having
a dog win one of the top awards didn’t sit

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.670
well with the organizers, so the Best Actor
award instead went to Emil Jannings.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.790
Or, at least, this is the story off repeated
on the interwebs, even on some of the most

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.060
otherwise reputable sites.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.980
So is it true?

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.810
Nope.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.650
When the first Academy Awards were held in
1929, votes were cast well in advance and,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.400
unlike today, weren’t kept a secret at all.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.120
As a result, all of the winners (and losers)
that first year knew well ahead of time, as

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.120
did the public.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.250
In fact, the LA Times published the results
about three months before the ceremony took

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.250
place.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.090
From the fact that these ballots were public
(and they still exist in the archives at the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.900
Academy’s Margaret Herrick Library), we
know definitively that Rin Tin Tin didn’t

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.700
even come close to winning Best Actor, receiving
only a single mocking vote by Warner Bros.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.230
executive Jack Warner, contrary to what almost
literally every source we could find on the

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.230
matter states.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.510
The genesis of the rumor that he not only
did receive many votes, but won, can be traced

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.489
back to a different Warner Bros. executive,
Darryl Zanuck.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.000
He was one of many who initially thought the
Academy Awards were a stupid idea.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.349
The story goes that when he first caught wind
of a ceremony celebrating Hollywood, Zanuck

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:32.819
wrote a letter to Academy executive Frank
Woods that including a faux ballot that only

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:37.780
nominated Warner Bros. features and workers
to demonstrate what he believed would happen

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.550
if the idea became reality- that everyone
would just vote for their own stuff.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.169
He then further showed his contempt for the
idea by writing Rin Tin Tin’s name in for

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.169
Best Actor.

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.690
Zanuck (who actually became a strong proponent
for the awards in later years) evidently told

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.050
this story one too many times at a cocktail
party or two, leading to it becoming enshrined

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.849
in Hollywood lore and repeated ad nauseum,
which in turn resulted in the story ending

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.180
up in a 2011 book by Susan Orlean, Rin Tin
Tin: The Life and the Legend . The news media

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.599
picked up on this, spreading the legend as
fact, and seemingly few have bothered to look

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.300
into it from there.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.990
The truth is that when official ballots were
actually cast, Zanuck didn’t even bother

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.669
voting, joking or not.

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.819
So, sadly, despite arguably being one of the
most popular stars in Hollywood and, by all

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.669
accounts, a very, very good boy, Rin Tin Tin
was completely snubbed by Hollywood insiders

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.250
thanks to their blatant and unapologetic speciesism.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.930
And so it was that German actor Emil Jannings,
who would later go on to make many Nazi propaganda

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.800
films, was honored instead…

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.669
As for Rin Tin Tin, he remained a good boy
and, despite being a German (shepherd), never

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.780
appears to have had any Nazi leanings.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.449
On top of that, he doesn’t appear to have
ever discriminated against anyone based on

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.310
their species, race, nor seemingly had any
prejudices of any kind, except (presumably)

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:14.849
a deep loathing 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:26.720
of mailmen.
