00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:08.410
JESSICA HARROP: Hi, I'm Jessica.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.650
And I'm going to show you
a chemical demonstration

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.240
that I like to call
let's drink to that.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.210
Now performing chemistry
demos is hard work.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.610
And MIT's Dr. John Dolhun--

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.710
here he is-- is thirsty.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.720
Let's watch him and
his assistant Barry

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.790
at the Cambridge
Science Festival.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.390
[WHOOSH]

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.431
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: Here
you've got some Fiji Water,

00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:31.460
but I figured you could
try some of, I don't know,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.060
my personal favorite
tap water as well.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.180
I don't know.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.000
JOHN DOLHUN: I think I'm going
to stick with the Fiji water.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.220
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: You're
going to stick with that?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.090
OK, that's fine.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.670
Well, if you'd like
I could treat you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.589
to something a little better.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:47.130
I don't know.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.710
What would you imagine?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.252
What it would like
to drink right now?

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:52.460
JOHN DOLHUN: A glass of wine.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.250
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: A glass
of wine, absolutely.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.600
JOHN DOLHUN: Do you have a list?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.140
Wine list?

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.452
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:00:58.452 --> 00:00:59.660
JOHN DOLHUN: Oh, you do have?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.493
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: Oh.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.490
JOHN DOLHUN: You
left me a wine list.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.910
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: Is there
one in particular you'd like?

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.660
JOHN DOLHUN: Actually, you
have a cabernet on there,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.480
$15 a glass though, Barry.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.394
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: OK,
I got it just for you.

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:14.060
So one cabernet.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.350
JOHN DOLHUN: That's
a nice light wine.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.600
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: There you go.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.560
JOHN DOLHUN: Has a
little color in it.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.070
Nice.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.710
[WHOOSH]

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.900
JESSICA HARROP: So Barry
turned water into wine.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.150
In our video recording
of the experiment,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.490
the wine doesn't look
very red, but you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.790
can see the red color forming
at the bottom of the glass.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.950
He started with a
clear, colorless liquid

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.750
that looks like water
but that actually

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.330
contains sodium carbonate.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.810
Now, in water, sodium
carbonate breaks apart

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.380
into CO32 minus, HCO3
minus, and OH minus.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.160
To go from water to wine, Barry
poured this sodium carbonate

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.710
solution into a wine
glass that contained

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.660
a little bit of the
indicator phenolphthalein.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.680
In acidic solutions,
phenolphthalein is colorless.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.890
But in basic solutions,
it's dark pink.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.180
So here's a pH scale.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.850
At around 8 on the pH scale,
phenolphthalein turns pink.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.210
So it goes from acidic to basic.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.860
And the OH ions in Barry's
fake water make it basic,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.100
so the indicator turns pink.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.660
So when mixed with
phenolphthalein,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.180
the sodium carbonate
looks like wine.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.620
Now, let's see
what happens next.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.120
[WHOOSH]

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.280
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: I have my own
favorite drink, milk, you know.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.560
It goes well with
cookies and everything.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.580
I really love it.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.750
So I'd love to show
you that if you--

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.750
JOHN DOLHUN: All right,
you convinced me, Barry.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.140
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: OK.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.520
JOHN DOLHUN: I'll go with milk--

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.600
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: OK, absolutely.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.724
JOHN DOLHUN: --and cookies.

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:07.390
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: I'll give you
the cookies afterwards, yes.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.270
So just take that
from me for a sec.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.880
Here's your milk.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.720
JOHN DOLHUN: Wait
a minute, Barry.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.620
That was my $15
cabernet and it just

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.180
turned into a glass of milk.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.790
[WHOOSH]

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.420
JESSICA HARROP: So Dr. Dolhun
wants milk for his cookies,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.370
but all he has is wine.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.400
So to go from wine to
milk, Barry pours the wine

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.020
into another glass.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.870
This glass contains
barium chloride.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.920
And barium chloride
dissolves in water,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.630
forming barium 2
plus and 2 Cl minus.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.530
Now, the barium 2 plus reacts
with the carbonate ions

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.250
in the original solution to
produce barium carbonate, which

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.020
is a solid white precipitate.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.640
And, of course, the
solid white precipitate

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.900
makes it look like milk.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.170
But is Dr. Dolhun
satisfied with milk?

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.841
Let's find out.

00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:04.340
[WHOOSH]

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.760
JOHN DOLHUN: That
was my $15 cabernet.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.670
And it just turned
into a glass of milk.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.400
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: Oh,
sorry about that.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.760
I thought you wanted the milk.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.240
JOHN DOLHUN: Barry,
it's a bad deal.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.750
Is this milk organic?

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.750
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: Uh, no.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:22.314 --> 00:04:23.480
JOHN DOLHUN: Barry, come on.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.040
You you have to do
something for me.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.050
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: OK, fine.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.674
How about this?

00:04:26.674 --> 00:04:28.360
I'll treat you.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.360
I'll give you some beer.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.430
It's on the house.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.180
JOHN DOLHUN: Beer?

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.810
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: Yeah.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.143
JOHN DOLHUN: Now you're talking.

00:04:34.143 --> 00:04:37.200
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: As a little
substitute, a little pay,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.080
you know, return for
messing up your order.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.220
So just take that
from you right here.

00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:01.750
JOHN DOLHUN: That is nice.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.216
A beer with a frothy top on it.

00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:08.476
BARRY KRIEGSMAN: Enjoy, enjoy.

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:09.380
[WHOOSH]

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.490
JESSICA HARROP: Finally, Barry
turns the milk into beer.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.920
To do this, he adds some
hydrochloric acid to the mix.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.070
Now this dissolves
the barium carbonate,

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.374
the solid white precipitate.

00:05:27.374 --> 00:05:28.415
And this is the reaction.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.720
So he adds the hydrochloric
acid, which breaks apart

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.940
the barium carbonate solid.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.120
This yields barium, water, and
carbon dioxide gas is released.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.110
And this H plus in
the reaction comes

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.360
from the hydrochloric acid.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.100
To get the yellow
beer color, Barry

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.710
throws in some dichromate,
which is yellow.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.550
And he puts a lump of solid
carbon dioxide or dry ice in it

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.290
to make it bubble.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.380
So what did Dr. Dolhun
and Barry show us today?

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.920
They took a clear solution
with certain chemicals in it

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.490
that turns color, pink, when
another chemical is added,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.430
then goes milky when
another chemical is added,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.130
then goes clear again
when another is added,

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.410
and then goes yellow
and bubbles when

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.720
two more chemicals are added.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.250
This shows us how
chemistry can be

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.580
used to program a system to
take on different observable

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.570
properties.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.620
It's truly magical.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.280
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.120
That's it for me.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.480
Hope you enjoyed the magic.
