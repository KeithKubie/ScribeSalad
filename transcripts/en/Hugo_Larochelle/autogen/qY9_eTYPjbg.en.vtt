00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.710
 in this capsule we will see some 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.710
 definitions related to the Béziers network in 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.580
 dynamic 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.650
 so we saw that a network of a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.150
 dynamic it's actually a network 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.410
 beziers where the notion of time has been 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.850
 embedded so we want to model a 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.039
 process that takes place in time 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.269
 and we go into random variables that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.869
 go and clues and by the time or 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.550
 correspondence and different variables 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.410
 random we see the variables 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.939
 excited random which are the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.420
 variables associated with it is not 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.829
 observed in my environment and we will 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.719
 random variables india and who 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.050
 are the variables that they are 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.180
 observed at different times of the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.649
 phenomenon that I'm trying to model with 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.360
 my network beziers so here and the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.910
 notion energizes that comes from the fact so we 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.219
 is modeling a process where 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.739
 a distribution on elephants 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.680
 read the forgive elements of our 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.149
 environment that will vary as and when 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.149
 as time goes by 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.210
 so that's all that has specific 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.830
 from a general point of view on 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.659
 Dynamic Bezier Networks Resorbed 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 and normal on the probabilities stage 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.080
 between the random variables that are 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 in this case if our set of 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.049
 variables excited and so was you here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.820
 to learn equal tea values ​​1 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.409
 up to grant and where one could even 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 model a process that has not 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.470
 necessarily hungry with big tiger 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:36.299
 infinite so we would have been without a 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.579
 fox and x2 2 a website and in our 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.799
 bezze network whose coordinator associated with 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.799
 each of these random variables there 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.159
 and we have to determine how does that 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.110
 we connect with arrows so 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.329
 comment on what you place and a draw other 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.490
 in a graffit is out of water so 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.229
 define who the parents are and what 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.719
 are the tables to enjoy between 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.549
 different variables which is so there 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.960
 a somewhat random illustration a 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.329
 sign and so that's what we have to do 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.420
 to get the dynamic hobbesien going 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.399
 to model but variable x is a 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.289
 index and by the time one of the problems 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.780
 we are facing is that in 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.500
 does it may require if we do not 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.870
 not pay attention 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.490
 to define a very large number of 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.690
 probability tables actually we have 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.760
 need a table of probabilities for 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.480
 each of the tents and we had a table 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.920
 quality for each of the excited and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.090
 interests and priorities in a network 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.380
 normal beziers all these steps of 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.580
 enjoy this very different so that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.380
 would do a very large number of tables of 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.209
 probity has stored in memory and in addition 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.440
 each table have made a priori for 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.260
 involve a very large number of 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.720
 parents so if I am so I 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.280
 I am interested in the description 2 x 1 then 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.510
 2nd st leu in this case too I have all 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.890
 the former one up to 99 and 1 to 99 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.380
 that I can use it as parents 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.930
 potential to his two voids 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.489
 so that will be another problem we are going 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.080
 to think about commenting on what we 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.760
 defines our parents for refusing 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.300
 beziers that still usable in 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.300
 convenient 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.040
 then we will see three solutions to these 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.239
 problems there three assumptions we're going 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.310
 do that will allow us to get 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.930
 hobbesian dynamic networks need 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.910
 dynamics that are usable in 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.519
 practical and that are still useful 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.660
 solves various problems 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.700
 so the first solution 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.440
 it may be to assume that the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.040
 dynamic changes associated with my 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.870
 environment 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.820
 so the changes in the distribution 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.799
 variables from my environment to 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.060
 as time goes by 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.910
 will match what's called a 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.590
 stationing process what it wants 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.180
 to actually say it's just that the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.410
 probabilities of but random variable 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.750
 excited upstream associates and to hide and 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.940
 also the probabilities the 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.400
 distributions two associated with 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.980
 variables that are not going to change in 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.549
 time for example as far as 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.570
 the distribution of tillage equipment 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.060
 existed at time t given its 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.890
 parents it's going to be the same for all 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.910
 size values ​​so what that 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:17.120
 does that mean that pdx including x12 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:20.600
 know the image of its parent cx1 and that 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.780
 imagine that for x3 we only have that 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.580
 depends only 2 x 2 ben it's two 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.830
 distributions were exactly the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.600
 same is going to be the same tables of 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.310
 conditional policy stored in 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.690
 memory for these two distributions 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.600
 envelope and it's going to be really done 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.020
 whatever the time index here 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.460
 it's true for aix 4 knowing x3 or x5 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.610
 knowing that they are capturing and institutes and 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.770
 so in this case also we do not know the 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.510
 main property behind what we 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.380
 call a stationary process that's 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.970
 to say that it's always the same 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.690
 distribution that models the 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:58.880
 changes of my state x of a state you 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.310
 in the next step and plus 1 the 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.419
 second solution 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.979
 its high size to assume that the 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.870
 dynamic changes that are all at 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.539
 and stamps continues a 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.130
 process we're going to say marco well what 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.039
 that means a marco process 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.320
 so it's actually the toques 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.260
 will depend only on a man ends 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.389
 of previous state and the case that we will see 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.740
 the mainly in the capsules that 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.539
 is going to be that of a process mark 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.510
 comic we will say first-rate 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.690
 that is, the distribution of 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.110
 excited knowing all the variables 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.490
 random associated with x time 1 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.250
 to the tempted - a gift that's what 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.380
 1.2 point witness at the hearing and which one 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.450
 can see on the vector x variables 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.880
 2 x 1 until excited - 1 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.199
 so this distribution here is going in 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.680
 actually be modeled where we do there 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.210
 suppose dependencies 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.030
 conditional which makes that this 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.820
 distribution is equal to p2 excited sacha 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.580
 only existed minus 1 so in 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.639
 other words if I know the hidden state 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.740
 at the position or at the moment t - 1 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.880
 I do not need to know the others 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.120
 variables know excited -2 ​​up to x1 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.750
 so I do not need to know them 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.250
 to find out how was generated xt from 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.030
 more technical way it means that 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.160
 Says ex witnesses are excited and 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.099
 independent of six witnesses two up 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.719
 aix and so that's a marco process 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.830
 comes from first rank have said that this 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.550
 first dress because we are going to search 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.310
 a random variable 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.870
 in front the last random variable 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.560
 second order 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.570
 we would only depend on x 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.300
 witnesses hours and excite - clashes - 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.130
 two would have been so we would have cost 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.720
 less of here it would be second order 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.660
 and institutes so this model here here on 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.340
 commented what my and the seal 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.320
 changes from one state to another so what 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.700
 call the transition model 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.810
 so the transition model this is 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:04.830
 which models the transitions between mountains 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.840
 and to hide and from one moment to another and 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:11.190
 so this is the second position that makes 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.390
 that in fact in this case but tape of 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.780
 probabilities will not depend on a 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.700
 increasing number of elements they go into 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.550
 talk about one piece of knowledge 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.690
 in the code of a chain of a process 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.670
 marc collienne first rank he goes 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.020
 depend on a single element before so 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.460
 to have a single parent if it takes big 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.110
 policy steps will not be too much 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:33.420
 serious and six in the third 6 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:38.210
 positions that we will often do is 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:42.570
 the one that observation and generate 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:45.090
 the observation generated solely by the 

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:47.520
 current rates so that means that the 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:51.810
 distribution of what is observed at 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:54.600
 time t given all hidden states 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:57.450
 previous state of time 1 until 

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.170
 attempted and all the observations of the 

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:03.450
 time 1 until the previous time and -1 

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:06.810
 will actually be reduced by the 

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:09.720
 tea distribution sacha the kosher state 

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:12.930
 or even time ie xt so that's 

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.910
 technically means that shan the vise 

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:18.150
 stamp at a given moment 

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:21.810
 the distribution of observations to this 

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:24.900
 moment is independent of forgiveness the 

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:27.960
 random variable of observations to 

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:33.000
 the moment t will be dependent on all 

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:37.470
 states hide extras until xt 

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.900
 -1 and will also be dependent on 

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:45.300
 observations or in 1 until witnesses 

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.100
 ok so knowing excite a tea is 

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.990
 independent of all these variables at the 

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.990
 canvas 

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:53.760
 so this distribution here here we go 

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.380
 call it the observation model 

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.850
 since it's a model defined a 

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.730
 distribution on my observations 

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:02.940
 knowing in that it's only my 

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.770
 and takashi and by doing are still a 

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.870
 once we have managed to have a network 

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.100
 dynamic pleasure have a table step 

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.990
 of distribution that will not be too 

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.080
 great in this case also the head of 

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:15.030
 distribution sells a size that is going to be 

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.860
 proportional to the number of values 

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.210
 possible for observations both on 

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.890
 number of initials possible for the state 

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.870
 hide what is very reasonable in 

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.500
 practice compared to a table of 

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:27.180
 distribution that would have depended that who 

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:32.370
 would be addicted to everything they 

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:34.610
 had before having an example of 

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:38.280
 the application of these three positions there 

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.870
 imagine that we want to model the 

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.310
 following situation we kept a 

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.550
 security that spends a month in a 

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:47.880
 underground building get by and every 

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.630
 day his director arrives with or without 

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.150
 people 

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.590
 so that's the observation that our 

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.140
 security guard does to all 

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:57.540
 days and the keeper wants a ferrer it's 

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.630
 what is the possibility that is more 

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:04.170
 or not depending on the sequence of 

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:06.140
 observations of the umbrella that bring or 

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:10.100
 not the 

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:12.440
 the director in this case varied dishes 

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.440
 upstream and with the csq stamp and rain or 

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:18.830
 not it's a reign 

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:20.690
 and so that's it I'll use rt 

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:24.080
 as of attention for this barrier was 

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:26.810
 war there and then but variable observed that 

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.310
 is going maybe the director has 

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.770
 led his father rained in English a three of a kind 

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.950
 or not so we will use ut as 

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:37.160
 symbol since behind the canvas and 

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:39.640
 so if we want to implement network 

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.600
 bezian that satisfies all 

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.790
 assumptions that I mentioned 

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.830
 previously the three assumptions but 

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.190
 it gives us a network although the 

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:52.670
 next structure so we notice 

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:55.550
 the excited state so exist that corresponds 

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:58.790
 in my favor at war rtd during his 

00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:02.180
 godfather is only aix 

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:05.420
 witness so no arrow directly 

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:09.280
 between exist and else and takashi 

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:14.870
 before or observations recalled 

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:17.540
 also the distribution or by the null 

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:20.710
 to rely on hunting observations so 

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.710
 a blaze the author goes 

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:26.960
 but only as parent the variable 

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:29.930
 random excited because if that's it 

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:32.620
 means that if I know rtm relay 

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.310
 were the parents of all the others 

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.130
 all other variables 

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:39.740
 previous random because rt so I 

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.940
 crt it's going to block the path between here 

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.880
 and all other variables 

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:46.760
 previous random 

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:49.430
 and finally the lottery position this is 

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.250
 that actually the table to enjoy rt 

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:56.120
 sacha rt - hours it's the same table 

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:59.570
 pole tes that the table to enjoy rt 

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.520
 more sincere herti this is exactly the 

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:04.100
 same table for all the values ​​of 

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:08.300
 possible tea then in the same way the 

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:10.910
 table to enjoy 1 volt and sasha rt 

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:14.240
 it was exactly the same as the one 

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:16.640
 narrated plus a sacha llorenti plus a 

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.920
 well same thing for a sample three of a kind 

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.019
 a sacha gathered witnesses 

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.260
 my observation model is the same 

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:26.000
 for all the moments your data 

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.430
 so that's the kind of structures we 

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.910
 will take our network beziers it's a 

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.380
 otherwise bezian network that like the 

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.040
 Roubaisiens we had before the state 

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.199
 enjoy 

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.430
 we have a serious no variables 

00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:39.019
 random the probabilities step 

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.579
 define the distribution of these 

00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:42.529
 random variables there what we have 

00:12:40.579 --> 00:12:44.360
 added it's constraints on which 

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:45.769
 kind of connection have little to see what 

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.570
 kind of arrow we can have between nonu 

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:49.610
 is also add the fact that 

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:53.000
 the probabilities stage are linked in 

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:57.070
 in the different moments that I 

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.070
 model with my Béziers network
