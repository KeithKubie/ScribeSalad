Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hello, David. Here we go. We're live. We're, we're doing it. Yes, we're doing it. I'm nervous. I'm nervous. Don't be, I enjoy your show. I really do. Thank you. It's a pleasure to watch you. You're very smart guy, man. You, and like I said, we were just talking about it. You're very reasonable in this world. I think there's so much of this, the youtube political world, the youtube commentary world where people are so fucking toxic, you know, there's, there's so much negativity, there's so much what they called dunking on people. There's so much dunking and you do a little Dunkin. Some of it's warranted. It is warranted. Yes. But I don't know if it's beneficial, uh, to the, to the people doing the dunking. Yes. Or even to the cause. I think it is temporarily, but sometimes it's good because it showed that mocks people's positions and it makes people realize, yeah, that is a ridiculous position.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       So if you're on the fence or if you're not really quite sure how you feel about things and you see someone get mocked for ridiculous position that maybe you even shared for a little bit. Right. Maybe maybe haven't explored it deeply and you see someone who has explored that deeply sort of expose all the flaws in this line of thinking it's good. But my thing when I interview a lot of people on the right and a lot of people on the left and I just hate all this conflict that I, I'd say the unnecessary conflict I think is when you, when you watch television today and you see Antifa fighting with the, you know, Trump supporters and all this, all this weird conflict. I don't, I don't necessarily think that most of it is, is necessary.

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       Necessary. Well I think the devil's in the details. Yeah. So like as an example, if you want to bring together, I don't know, people who are on opera opposite opposite sides of the climate debate for example. Good luck, I'm sure. Right? Well, why is part part of that you could argue is if one side just does not accept science, how can you really bring those people together? It doesn't mean you need physical conflict to resolve it. In fact, I completely agree with you. The physical conflict is totally counter productive, but at a certain point on some issues, I understand why there's like an intractability to the debate where it seems completely impossible to move forward because whichever side you're on, I would argue that I'm on the right side of these issues and others would disagree. When you're far apart in a way that you can't even agree as to like what the starting point facts are about the conversation. How do you even, how do you start? I have some ideas as to how I try to do it, but it's very tough.

Speaker 1:          00:02:37       It is very tough. I just don't think dunking on people always like constantly shitting on people is necessarily the way.

Speaker 2:          00:02:44       Yeah, and I think it's important to distinguish between just straight up ad hominems where someone is wrong and bad, uh, because I think they're a bad person or they're an idiot or whatever to recognizing when somebody is a participant in bad faith in a conversation

Speaker 3:          00:03:01       to when someone has maybe fallen prey to audience capture or whatever else might be kind of influencing what, what and how they're doing. I think that those criticisms are legitimate, but you got to stay away from just ad Hominem. Yes, yes, I agree. And I think that it's just so common today. It's, it's, it's, it's also extremely attractive. The, the Youtube Algorithm, uh, you know, as far as, um, comments go, I mean, it actually kind of encourages it and so does Facebook. So it does, you know, anytime there's a social media platform that is add dependent, one of the best ways to get people to engage is to have something they disagree with so they can get angry. Yes. Until it becomes no longer brand safe according to whoever's running the platform. Right. I mean, you go back to April, 2017 where I woke up and saw that my youtube channel made 19 cents the previous day.

Speaker 3:          00:03:59       And I text Kyle Kalinsky and I say, I think there's like a glitch. Is it like it says I made 19 cents? And he says, he says, I made 35 cents or something like that. Uh, something's going on. And it was the beginning of like an apocalypse 1.0 and that was a rough three week period. And uh, so, so you know, encourage the debate and the battle of ideas so to speak in all of this stuff until advertisers get worried and they say, oh, you know, our ads are showing up on stuff that's a little bit touch and go for us. That's a weird one to me because um, I, youtube has always been a secondary thought for me. The first thought was the audio version of the podcast and in fact when we were uploading it to youtube at first I was like, why are we even doing this?

Speaker 3:          00:04:43       I guess why not? Some people probably want to watch it and then somewhere along the line it became at least close to as big as the audio version of it. And then maybe even more significant because one of the things that the youtube version has is the comment section, which is often the fucking dumpster fire, but it at least there is some sort of like a community engagement aspect of it that doesn't really exist in iTunes. Like an iTunes, it's sort of, it's in a vacuum. Right? Sure. Um, but when the ad pocalypse thing happened, I was like, hmm, what was going on here? Like wasn't, it wasn't my primary focus, so it wasn't terrifying. But people that only did youtube and people that relied on that for their living, I mean it was, it's a huge blow. It was huge. And at the time, I'm trying to think back, I think maybe like around 30% of my entire shows revenue was coming from youtube at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:05:38       So it was not everything, but it was still significant. Right. I mean, I've staff and overhead and all of that stuff, so just overnight, 30% going away is huge. And that's why I've tried to move to the model of telling my audience, you can skip all of this stuff. You know, even, uh, uh, some of these other, you know, super chats and all of this other stuff. Like we run a membership program on my website, I control a hundred percent of it. So it's not a patriot and you are on Patrion, but it's not big for us. The way I think about it is as long as, I mean, listen, yeah, there's, you know, marijuana companies that are having trouble even processing payments. But assuming like stripe and paypal, don't say you can't even accept payments anymore. David Pakman, I control the entire process on my website.

Speaker 3:          00:06:22       So when people pay their six bucks, all but 2.9% gets to me. And when ad apocalypse happened, I saw it as a maybe blessing in disguise and that I can now explain to the audience, here's the problem with these algorithms. Here's the problem. When it goes from, I am fighting white supremacist content to an algorithm, can't distinguish between that and white supremacists content. Right? That's bad for me. Right. When I interviewed Richard Spencer, I obviously don't agree with Richard Spencer. Uh, but can an algorithm figure out that there's a difference between an interview I do with Richard Spencer and white nationalist propaganda? I don't know. But we can kind of get around all of that if you just go directly to me. And that's why my focus has been growing that those direct members you interview Richard Spencer. Yeah. Did you get shit for that? Yes. Yeah. That's a weird one.

Speaker 3:          00:07:13       Right. And you know, um, I'm sure you're aware of that, uh, that, what is it called, data and society that can, whether there was a woman who made a bunch of connections, like Joe Rogan knows David Packman and Joe Rogan also knows Alex Jones. Alex Jones wants to be friends with David Pakman. Like the math sort of, it was like one of those minds and it was really weird. It's like guilt by association. I saw a couple of them. There was like an initial one which made be thinking of, then there was a map of like the youtube sphere specifically left middle and right or something like that. Yeah. And this idea that everyone's like on a part of a grand conspiracy to help each other out and push right ideology. Even though you know a lot of people that were labeled as right. Art, right? Like who like me, Oh, I'm not writing at all.

Speaker 3:          00:08:01       My sense is you're politics are pretty left on most stuff. Um, although I don't, I mean, I don't know you personally beyond just seeing your shows. Um, but maybe the critique is based on, because I think that those maps were based on what is the youtube algorithm suggesting. And so that may not be in line with your personal politics. Maybe what we're talking about, like if you're interested in conflict and if you're trying to get engagement, that's the way to do it. Like in a few youtube out youtube algorithm is constantly suggesting people like Ben Shapiro, right? Gavin McInnes or whatever. And those videos come up over and over again. Sure. And I mean, so a lot of those people's channels do really well on youtube. So if you interview someone who has a channel themselves, there's a very good chance that the algorithm, if they're watching your interview with that person, will say, well, here's a lot of their stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:08:53       And then once you click there, the algorithm very quickly starts to build a picture of, of every individual user. If you watch your interview with Ben Shapiro and then it takes you to a daily wire video, then it takes you to like the daily wire, second string or guy, right. And then you're off. Who knows where, right. It's all machine learning. Right? I mean that's one of the most part. Yeah, that's a, it is. It's a troubling aspect of that thing that they do where they suggest the next videos, which didn't use to be a thing. It used to be you would go to youtube, you would watch a video, right? And then you would go find another video. Right. They didn't suggest anything. And then somewhere along the line, I don't remember what year it was, but this started happening and then they started auto playing the next video.

Speaker 3:          00:09:37       Auto play. Yeah. I think there was some kind of recommendation thing very early on, but initially it might have been restricted to just other videos from the same channel you're watching probably, and at a certain point it started to recommend other things. And I don't know if you look at your analytics and see what percentage of your views are coming from that recommendations feed from other stuff. Um, but it's significant for a lot of youtube channels. The, the tagging your videos and getting the right metadata on them in order to bring an audience is an important thing. So it's a double edged sword in some sentence it sounds, sounds like, but to get back to what you were saying about so rich labeled you owe is Richards. Okay. Yeah, I was going to say it. They labeled you as right, but you're not right. Do what other ones?

Speaker 3:          00:10:22       It's disingenuous. I mean, I've said it over and over and over again. I've never voted for a Republican in my life. I've voted independent for Gary Johnson just because he did my podcast. Okay. I wasn't happy with Clinton and I wasn't happy with Trump. I was like, this is gross. I'm just going to vote for Gary Johnson. I mean, I didn't think he was going to win. You know, he had almost no chance when he didn't know what Aleppo was. Right. I was like, that was his, he was his scream. You know, like, uh, what's his face from New Hampshire? Howard Dean. Howard Dean. Yeah. Well voting in California also. I S I assume you've, I'm sure it wasn't going to Joe. Yeah. Um, but people conveniently, we'll just as, or they'll say that like you're a Trojan horse. They like a pretend left wing person who's really just pushing right wing ideologies.

Speaker 3:          00:11:08       I'm like, well which one? Which, which right wing ideologies that gay marriage is it, what is it? I put, I'm on the left on everything except maybe a second amendment right. I think the criticism that um, could be levied if one wanted to make it into a criticism would be if you engage with right wing ideas and that you don't agree with, right. Like I take you at your face, you know, at face value that you don't agree with a lot of the stuff that you're right. When guests say one could make the argument that by not challenging those ideas, it's implicitly lending them more credibility than maybe you think they should have. That's interesting because what I try to do with people, um, unless something, say someone saying something egregious, I try to let

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       them talk. I want to know how they feel. I want to know what their thought processes. And so instead of just challenging on it on everything, I want them to elaborate. Right. And I feel like by doing that, I get a sense of how they've come to that conclusion and whether it's logical, right? Whether it's a, when they're, they've, they've actually used their thoughts and they've really calculated and thought, this is the position I take. And this is why. And I, a lot of people don't know, there's a lot of, a lot of the times we challenged people in their positions, you find out like they don't really know what the fuck they're talking about and that the best way to find that out as the, let them talk like Candace Owens on climate change,

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       right? That was, I mean, there's the Socratic method of questioning, which is why do you think that? And how do you know that that's true? Et Cetera, et cetera. And sort of some other questions that come from it. Uh, which I do as well. Um, I mean I think, I don't know to, to tie it to the Richard Spencer interview that I did, some of the criticism I received after was from people on the left. I mean, the people, I would assume it was most of the people on the low for doing the interview. Yes. Or for what I said in the interview for what I'm doing it. Okay. Yeah. For doing the interview at all. The criticism was more from the left for what I said in the interview. The criticism was more from the right, from people who just agreed with Richard Spencer, like what things did they agree with that it is inevitable that people with different ethnic or religious backgrounds simply will not be able to coexist together peacefully and we're better off trying to figure out how can we separate people based on their membership in ethnic or religious groups. Separatism. I mean literally separatism.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       That's sad. That's a sad thought that you just can't get along with people that do other things that are interested, interested in other things that come from other places that have different religions that have different points of view. Like why,

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       uh, the Oh, well they, they have a series of, uh, you know, decades of what they call scholarship supporting their view. But for the context of my interview, I made it abundantly clear that I didn't agree with that stuff. Right. Yeah. And my view is, and everybody can have a different view about how they do interviews. My view is if I just allow the, what I consider to be disgusting views to be spread out, right. You know, like a spray bottle to spray them everywhere, not do anything else. Uh, I can't say that I'm doing something that I think is valuable. I don't feel like it's valuable. So my, my approach is, are the ideas known enough to be worth refuting? That's number one. If it's some weird conspiracy theory that has not even any following whatsoever, I'm probably not going to choose to even entertain it because it's irrelevant in, in sort of always.

Speaker 2:          00:14:38       So my first question is it was Richard Spencer relevant at the time outright was rising, this guy was considered by many of the sort of creator of the outright, he was growing a following in the context of the Trump candidacy, the time or maybe administration. I don't remember when exactly it was, it was I think 2016 or, I'm trying to remember when it was. I don't remember when I first heard his name. Yeah. But how did he become, how did he come to prominence? I don't know the sequence, but I think he had a wet, an alt right website that had articles of some kind and then, um, he, that website became more known and the fucking term, so talk the alt right, you know, all left the centrist, like all these, all these different labels or talk about issues. I agree with you there. So clunky.

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       But, so, you know, first thing was I did want to interview him, but if I had felt that I wouldn't be prepared to make it abundantly clear that I don't agree with the guy. And I think his ideas are terrible. I wouldn't have done the interview yet. So the problem I had with the critiques from the left of me doing that, some who said, the last thing we need to be doing is giving this guy a voice. That's often how they say it, or a platform. My response was this guy's getting interviewed in lots of other places that aren't even challenging him. Right. I'm at least making an attempt here to get something in the record that there are arguments against these ideas. These are bad ideas. And I don't want to be part of the diffusion of just the ideas themselves. I'm gonna have to, I'm going to be pushing back.

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       I'm going to have to watch that note. Now. When you did do that, like what was his response was during the interview, what was his response to your push back? Uh, I mean he had answers, you know, he's, he's, he was well prepared. I don't know if they're, they were unique or new arguments that I was making. Um, but there was no argument to be made that I was letting him just parrot white nationalists talking points on a post, which I wouldn't, I just wouldn't feel good about that. It's not how I do interviews. Yeah. And then the left was upset that you're giving him air quotes, a platform, very small portion of the left. I just want to be super clear. Let's go left. I mean my audience is very left. Almost everybody understood what I was doing. 10 years ago I was interviewing the Westboro Baptist church.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       Most people understood what I was doing. They were more prominent at the time, but there was this sliver of the left that just didn't want the conversation to take place. And I always struggle with this because as you can see, I have no problem criticizing that sliver of the left. My concern is getting like overly wrapped up to criticisms of the left that are only held by these like niche slices. Yes. And that's why, um, I try to avoid going further than necessary into those criticisms. Like I think there are more serious critiques of the left to be made, um, beyond anti speech or want to limit speech or whatever. I mean that's, that's a pretty big issue. Well, I don't, I don't actually agree that it exists on a significant portion of the left. Like I think a bigger issue, for example, like if you said what is like a serious issue that the left needs to contend with right now?

Speaker 2:          00:17:39       I would say a more serious issue is if you look at the progressive accomplishments of the early 20th century, for example, like 19 five to 1925 and the new deal accomplishments that the left had in the time of Fdr, what was different, I think then than the left now is that you didn't have to be completely in line with a specific set of policies or ideas. And I worry that now there's a little bit, um, of the left maybe having this idea that if you're not in line on all of these issues, whatever the checklist is, so to speak, you're not really worthy of being a participant in what is clearly a leftward move in sort of the average Americans political orientation. I don't want to see that prevent progress.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       Right? Yeah. That's the, that's the hard tribalism, right? That's worth the, the line gets drawn. You're with us or against us. And there's one way to think

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       there is, there is a lot of that. I mean I saw it with healthcare recently with healthcare. I don't think that you can make any serious case from the left that healthcare is fine and the for profit employer connected system that we have is working. Like I, I don't think there's any progressive case to be made for that. Where people will differ is what about Medicare for all versus some other system system that looks more like Canada's or the UK or Germany or whatever. And I've already started to see like when I say on my show, I'm kind of agnostic on this, like the system we have as a disaster, we need a system that will get coverage to everybody. The the numbers can be made to work any number of different ways we've looked at it, but 80% of people on Medicare I believe it is have some additional coverage.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       They either are still working part time or full time and get coverage that way or they're poor enough to be on Medicaid. The point is medicare for all doesn't solve every issue. It's way better than what we have, but here's like a dozen other possibilities. Looking at other countries, there is a portion of the left that doesn't like that because I'm saying I'm against Medicare for all. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is there are a number of different ways to improve upon the system. We have all of which sever this relationship between usually your employer and these for profit insurance companies. Y'All yet we'd be open to them. I really

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       don't understand private citizens that don't want easy access to quality health care for everybody. That confuses the shit out of me. Like, have you ever been hurt? Have you ever been sick? Have you ever been broke? Right? Do you want to be broke and have no access to healthcare? No one does. No one wants anybody to care about to not have access to health care of all the things that we concentrate on this country, there's two things that drive me fucking crazy that people just dismiss education and healthcare. The idea that you have to like my buddy Greg, Greg Fitzsimmons, he's sending his kid off to school. How much did he say that it was? 65 or $65,000 a year for both of his kids, for each of his kid. So you know, he's got two kids that that's, that hurts my head. Even about spending $130,000 a year just on, if you're a regular person with a regular job, how the fuck do you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       Impossible. It's impossible. It's so much fucking money. And then that's not even paying for housing. And Food and transportation and books and everything else that you're going to need to. And to make it more difficult for young people to succeed is one of the worst ways to make a stronger country. If you want to see a strong country, you want educated people that get to pursue their dreams. And the idea that we are so willing to spend so much money on these costly regime change wars and flying troops overseas to these places that they don't want to go. No one, no one wants it to happen. And it's trillions of dollars and people are fine with that. But you talk to them about some sort of socialize education system and people freak out and think you want to turn us into Communist.

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       Well I think what is really important to understand is that the facts you just laid out don't matter to people who see this as an issue of what do people deserve? What do they deserve? So if you say to a fiscal conservative, you know, if you consider the amount that the employee pays for premiums plus the employer, plus your copays, a plus Co insurance, right? You, you put it all together into some amount and you explain to them. There's lots of great analyses that have been done which tell us that with roughly the same amount of money, maybe small payroll tax in addition with roughly that same amount, it all could be done with a single payer system that covers everybody. It's the same. You're taking all of these individual risk pools where you have different for-profit insurers and then you have systems for people that don't have enough money.

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       Medicaid, you have systems for people that are over 65 medicare. You put it all together, you spread the risk far wider. The employer no longer has to pay their part of the premium. The employee no longer pays part of their premium to the for profit insurance company. The numbers work. They're still not going to say, you know what, that? That sounds great. It's actually pretty fiscally conservative. Let's do it because at some point there is a portion of the right that just doesn't think people have earned healthcare. They just haven't earned it. They have education or education. Yeah, that's right. And it's very hard to change people's minds when that's their view. I think it's might be George Lake off who I believe calls it strict father morality, which is like how would a really strict father treat a child who comes to them and says, Hey, you know what? I figured out a way that we can all have healthcare. The strict father, even if the numbers make sense, would say, I'm going to teach you a lesson. You haven't earned that health care either because you don't work or you don't make enough money or you're on disability, whatever the case may be. How do you convince someone to change their mind when that's the world worldview?

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       Yeah. How do you, when it's a, an ideologically based decision and the you're on team our or team l, you know what, which uh, which group of

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       ideas do you adopt? Right. Ah, in the UK system sucks. Need you talk to people that get health care over in the UK it's socks, but at least they have a system. It's just not the same quality health care that you get in America. Same with my friends in Canada. I have friends in Canada that have come down here to get surgery because they find better doctors over here because the Paul was going to Canada to get his, um, uh, operation. That was, why was that? Why did he do that? The best places in Canada, the best place for Hernias for that type of hernia, I believe. Yeah. Hmm. I mean, here's the thing, even in saying the UK system and the Canadian system, neither one is that good, right? Those two systems are totally different, right? So if I fucked the whole socialized medicine, they are both, well, yes, in some sense.

Speaker 3:          00:24:27       I mean, the Canadian system is administered at the province level. So the province is sort of like the market. Instead of having all these submarkets attached to individual for-profit insurers at the provincial level, uh, that's how it's organized. The UK has a, the national health service where they're actually, they don't actually run the healthcare facilities, but they're the ones who are contracting them. So it's sort of like the health care facility still, uh, isn't own entity. It's not that you're going and the government is the employer of the doctors so to speak, but they're contracting with the health care facilities. But the point I want to make is that there are criticisms of all of these systems, but there are different ones. So when we say the British and Canadian systems aren't that good, right, let's figure out in what ways each is not that good.

Speaker 3:          00:25:16       Because there are different ways, whether you're talking about health outcomes, early detection, cost per treatment, whatever. You really have to drill down and figure out in what way are we saying it's not as good. Yeah. What I'm saying is that there is no perfect system. There is no perfect systems are right, but I believe that most of the best doctors in terms of like North America at least, or in the United States, I'm sure there's probably some very good doctors in Canada that do specialize medicine, but I think really good doctors are incentivized by profit. I really do. I think there is some motivation for if you spend so much money for medical school and you, you bust your ass, you want to make a lot of money and some of the best doctors earn a really good living, then I think, I think limiting their, uh, their ability to earn that money won't incentivize people to be excellent.

Speaker 3:          00:26:08       So a couple of different things. I mean, number one, to be clear, we're just now starting to get into a little bit of broader economic philosophy. Like I'm a capitalist, I'm, I'm for social democracy, which is a mixed system. That's a capitalist system that says we're going to invest, uh, tax revenue in a particular way to make sure that no one falls below a certain level. So I, my, my, just to contextualize that, my point of view is not from one of becoming a socialist country. So I think we share those views. I think. So. Um, a lot of doctors will say that even though on sort of, on paper, in a socialized

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       medicine system, they might make less for a particular procedure, for example, or something like that. A lot of them are still in favor of those systems because it would drastically reduce their overhead. So there's all of this apparatus that includes medical billing and coding both on the insurer end and at the healthcare provider and the hospital and the insurance company both are battling over what is it that was done right and what are the codes that apply here and how, what are our reimbursement rates? There's fraud when it comes to that. Um, and that requires an apparatus for investigating and adjudicating that that adds more and more cost. So I don't think it says easy. I don't think it's as obvious that under those systems, at the end of the day, a doctor that owns a PCP, a group for example, or an orthopedic clinic or whatever the case may be, I don't know that it's that clear that they end up taking home less money. Hm.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       That's interesting. I'd wonder if in practice that would play out that way. I mean, maybe I'm talking about just like high end orthopedic surgeons that do knee surgeries for athletes and things along those lines.

Speaker 2:          00:27:56       They often would be outside of whatever insurance apparatus we were talking about anyway. A lot of those folks are often being paid out of pocket anyway. So it's less in belief, some at least some. So for the average person's experience, I think it's less relevant.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       Yeah. Um, then there's also liability insurance, which is extremely expensive. That's a giant issue with, with doctors. It's a huge expense.

Speaker 2:          00:28:17       It is. Yeah. I mean I think it is necessary. Uh, there's a question as to whether it's organized in the best way. I know less about that component than some of the other ones, you know? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       th th th the education and healthcare, those are the two things that I think we can both agree we need to invest money on and we need to figure out some way to make that more accessible. Yes. Yes. And I don't understand people that don't think that. And if that's what that is the strict father mentality, that just, the only thing that it makes sense to me is that you don't want people who are kind of half ass in college did that can just get in.

Speaker 2:          00:28:53       I think that that comes up a lot. Yeah. And you hear about so called Free College, which isn't free. It's where we're saying we're paying for it through taxation. Really important to point that out. It's, it's just not for everybody. And that's okay. I mean, I think that that, that sometimes gets lost. Yes, yes. There are more and more jobs that require college degrees. Even though you could make the case, maybe the college degree is not actually necessary, but it's a way to sort of thin the herd of applicants in order to just make hiring, uh, you know, more, more practical. Um, but I do think that it's okay to say that college isn't for everybody, but the same ideas that apply to so called free college, meaning college paid for through education could apply to trade school. They could apply to retraining programs. There's a whole bunch of other ways that it could be done. Yeah, no, I agree. Yeah. I just, the

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       college is not for everyone. Thing is more true now than ever before, particularly with certain technology studies. You're learning things during your four years at a university that are just going to be completely outdated by the time you graduated in what kind of program? For example, Jamie, what he did with audio engineering. Oh I see. You went to school for audio engineering. By the time he got out it was all useless, but that was not a four year bachelors program. Right. It is now. Oh it is now. Okay. When I went there, it wasn't available for that. But since then they have made that available and that's also in the time that youtube has made basically education free for a lot of people.

Speaker 2:          00:30:19       Sure. So I mean I think with that, the issue is in my mind that when you consider the cost relative to the earnings potential, as you pointed out, when you're talking about $68,000 a year or you know, whatever it is, guest taught at Boston college and I think it was like 64,000 or something like that. Um, depending on what field you're going into, it's, it's almost impossible to pay that off ever. So some, at some point something needs to change. And this kind of gets us into the technological automate automation and unemployment stuff of what happens as computers and technology start to replace jobs. And that's where I think there's a pretty clear line between a free market capitalist, a Social Democrat like myself and actual socialism. Like what should happen with the gains that come from those technological advancements. But as far as the education piece is concerned, so it's completely unsustainable the way it is.

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       No, I knew about you before this happened, but then I really kind of got on board with you when someone was trying to get you fired from Boston University. And I remember some college, Boston College, sorry. And I tweeted it and I was like, right, like what? What is this? This is craziness. So it's a woman named [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          00:31:33       Amy Siskind, who, I don't know. Other than that incident

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       where you had a disagreement about something, it wasn't, it wasn't toxic. It wasn't hostile, I would think. Said I didn't lose that. Explain what you said and what she, what she had said that you disagree with. So we may be able to

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       even find the tweet, but she tweeted something that just being, um, that she would not be supporting any candidate in 2020 who's white or male. I think that that was the gist of it. And I responded, I'm going from memory here. The gist was something like, isn't that the definition of racism? You're sort of preemptively excluding someone from consideration on the basis of race and in that case, gender, if it was white and there it is right there. Uh, yeah. There's a court, I will not support white male candidates in the den primary unless you slept through midterms. Women were our most successful candidate, biggest dem vote getters in history. Obama, oh eight Hillary 16 white male is not where our party is at. Entities are at least safe option in 2020. Right. So I said, isn't something not progressive

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       about preemptively dismissing a candidate based on their race and gender? I feel like there's a word to describe that as a progressive. I won't be jumping on board. Yeah. So you can explode basically. Didn't even say it's racist, right? You said there's a word to describe that. Yeah, and that's a very polite way of disagreeing with someone. I thought it was polite and she tried to get you fired. Yeah, she contacted as far as I know, so. Okay. I don't, I'm going by what she said. She said she contacted Boston college and told them not to allow me to teach there. That's insane. And Boston College, since I've just an adjunct, I'm not on staff when I'm not teaching, like during the three months of the semester I'm employed there and the other nine months I'm not. So I think Boston College said he's not currently employed here and I think that that's basically as far as it went.

Speaker 3:          00:33:29       But I did talk to some other faculty there who were aware of the thing that was going on. That's a crazy thing to do just to think. So it's a nasty mean thing to do to like what someone can't disagree with you. And it's a very good point. I think she probably got upset because you made a very good point and tweets started coming her way and a lot of people, they read those fucking comments and people get toxic in those comments. Yeah. Random strange people that you don't know and then you're forced to, you know, look at their opinions and their criticisms and their insults. That incident started me down the path of drastically limiting my social media use. Good for you. Yeah, I mean that, that was the beginning and then it became, I mean, you know this way more than I do because I think on all platforms you have roughly 10 times the following that I do, no matter what you do post or whatever, if you look at what the feedback is, it's extraordinarily toxic and horrible negative stuff that is only a distraction to what I'm trying to do.

Speaker 3:          00:34:32       And most of it probably isn't, but I hadn't evolved on yesterday number all Brown Mckenna. Yeah. And one of the things that he brought up this so, so huge, it's so true is that you can have 10 positive things, but that one negative will outweigh the 10 positives in your mind. You, me and your mom. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Especially if you're a person who's self critical or a self, uh, objective, you're analyzing your behavior. Was that good? Was that bad? Right? Then you read that one bad comment. Fuck, are they right? You don't read all the people that say you're great. Oh brilliant. Loved it. Yeah. Fuck you. Loser. Oh, absolutely. I mean when I announced I was going to be doing your show, if you look at what the comments were, almost all this is awesome. Great Wing voice talking to Joe Rogan. Go get him. David.

Speaker 3:          00:35:17       This is such a great opportunity. I can't wait to watch you face plant. Oh Geez. And that's the one where I'm like, man, are they right? Like I'm not going to money in a face plant. So I don't know. I'm just trying to limit the amount that I'm on social media. One thing I am doing though because I mean my show is in part as successful as it is because of social media. So it, I can't that right. You don't have to engage. I don't have to engage. And I also can just say, I will check our networks in the morning, then I'll spend the whole day, I'll do my show, I'll do what I need to do and then before I sign off for the evening, I'll check it [inaudible] right. Because what if you read the worst shit right before you eat dinner and go to bed?

Speaker 3:          00:35:54       Well know it'll be like 5:00 PM so you'll have five hours, 30 hours to cool off it and it's way better. And weekends, I'm almost, I mean, uh, people are like, David, you're still treating on the weekends. A lot of those are like prescheduled tweets where I'll just sit and schedule some stuff and I am trying to stay off it and it's been really great. I mean, it's been a fantastic, looked at our phones yesterday. Uh, we did a sober October podcast with my four friends. Yep. We looked at our phones to look at phone usage and I use my iPhone four hours a day on my phone for hours a day and like, fuck. That's a lot. What app did you use to measure it? It's something on your iPhone. Oh, okay. Yeah. You have a android. I'm sure they have a similar thing. Yeah. Yeah. Four hours of screen time.

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       I'm like, Ooh, that's not good. They're adding that to the a computer too, so it's going to combine. You'll know how much you're looking at all screens soon. Yeah. What if you're writing? Well, I was going to count that kind of sure. Work staring at the screen. That's how it worked. Pitch. Hey, that's what the argument you guys are making for the phone just as birth. Sorry man. Yeah. Well Burt's arguments not good because he doesn't even write. That's ridiculous. One thing I did that actually is useful is I used to have my social apps on the home screen and cal Newport and some others have said got, you've got to get rid of those. He actually advocates getting rid of the apps all together so that you have to go on a computer and choose to go to facebook.com or Twitter. I haven't gotten there yet, but even just removing them from the home screen makes me significantly less likely to even pull them up.

Speaker 3:          00:37:18       It's two clicks to swipe up and scroll over to the APP. Right. But even just getting them off the homescreen keeps me off of them significantly. That's smart. That makes sense. Yeah. I need a certain amount of access to those things with my business. Right. Scheduling shows and things along those lines, but yeah, it's not good for you. I mean, I think one of the biggest realizations is that people don't really miss you that much. They don't hear from you for a couple of days. Like that's one of the things where the idea of needing constant engagement comes from sort of like a slightly narcissistic point of view where like people are going to notice if I don't tweet for from Thursday night until Monday morning or do anything. Right. Right, right, right. They really don't. They don't. They don't. There's a lot of other people to pay attention. Yes, there are.

Speaker 3:          00:38:06       There are a few people that tweet on you that, that are kind of crazy and that want to hear from you all day long. Yeah. Yeah. But they'll get used to it. They'll get used to you. They will vanishing. And I don't know, I mean, cal Newport has, have you had him on, he wrote deep work and then more recently he wrote digital minimalism and he goes into detail about just the effect of, uh, uh, write it down on my phone, but it feels sacrilegious to put that as a take it out right now. Yeah. I mean, he goes into detail this stuff and just about, you know, we need more uninterrupted periods of concentration for what is the book called again? Deep Work and then digital minimalism. And they're both, I interviewed him recently. Really just solid, very solid stuff. Awesome. Yeah. Um, what were we just about to get into?

Speaker 3:          00:38:55       Oh, so when he says this woman, Amy Siskind, did you reach out to her when she did that? And privately? Yeah. No, no. Did you read a job publicly? Uh, well you did publicly declare that you try to get you fired, right? Yes, I did. Did she respond? I don't know cause she blocked me. Oh God dammit. She blocked you over that. Yeah. Geez us. That is so sensitive. And what, what is Twitter for? Right? Is it just to fall in line? Is it just to agree with everything someone says with no questioning whatsoever. What's extra interesting about it is she blocked me on Twitter, but then I treat my Facebook profile basically as public. So I post stuff on there. It's the same whether you're friends with me or not. And I had posted something totally innocuous about, I was at a restaurant or drinking an espresso on it. I don't even know what it was. She showed up there and commented that she had called Boston college and told them not to, you know, not to hire me or to fire me or whatever. Honestly hosts about you having an espresso. It was just a personal posts. Right. But the point she determined that the exchange was worthy of blocking me on Twitter. But then she came to my personal Facebook page and said, I'm calling Boston college and telling them to fire you. There's a word for that.

Speaker 3:          00:40:22       God, that's really a few. This is a gang, but there's a big one. Yeah, this is a four letter one that I just don't understand why someone would want to do that to someone. Why? Why can't you disagree? Why can't you, and she's just upset that you pointed out a glaring problem with what she was saying. Yeah, I apparently, and you know the thing is I don't, I, the way I operate, I don't think even necessarily that she's a bad person. I just assumed that she has, you know, some emotional thing going on. She could have had a terrible date as far as I know, someone near and dear to her died that day. I am. If someone near and dear to me died, I wouldn't go. Wouldn't be necessarily be on Twitter or your Facebook post about you drinking an espresso fair, fair tote.

Speaker 3:          00:41:02       People. I've tried to get you fired. But my approach is I just, I really do assume most people are pretty good people and even when we have disagreements, I tend to give the benefit of the doubt that if we could only talk the way we were doing, we could figure out 95% of the disagreement. Maybe not all of it. Right. But most of it. So I don't pick Roger. I mean, yeah, I don't, I, she behaved in a way I wouldn't behave, but who knows what she had going on. You know? I mean it's, yeah. Well it didn't get you fired so it's not that bad. But if it did that would have horrible, it would have been a different situation. Would have been probably a good publicity. Yeah. I probably would. Helps you. I think so. You got excited about that. It's funny, the reason I'm thinking back actually to a conversation I had at the time where someone said to me, uh, if you do get fired, it's the best possible thing that'll happen. Right. It would just be fantastic. And it didn't, cause I wasn't actually employed there at the time. That's the irony of it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:57       Well, this is the thing, the the falling in line, the no room for deviation from the ideology. Sure. This is a, this is a giant issue that I have with both, both parties. It's, and I think that's one of the reasons why people were in these parties to begin with. I don't necessarily think that people have clearly thought out every single aspect of whatever part of they align with. I think they fall in line and they adopt a predetermined pattern or behavior that seems to be attractive at the time and then they fall in line with whatever that party is saying. I think that is a giant percentage of people. When someone deviates from that, like you did someone who is also clearly a progressive and clearly a left wing person and you're criticizing something and very, very politely and that, that she just goes haywire over that.

Speaker 1:          00:42:45       That's the thing, right? It's like are you responsible for the people who also comment on your post and this is, this is where we're getting to this like vox thing that's happening with Steven Crowder right now. Right. Are you responsible for the reaction? To what you post because if you look at what Steven Crowder said to that, if we don't, people don't know the story. Steven Crowder got into it with this guy who is a writer for Vox who, uh, is he's gay. His Twitter handle is gay Wank, right? Told us Mazda. Yeah. So it's not that he's hiding that. He's gay, talks about it all the time. He's kind of a feminine. And Steven Crowder mock that and he mocked that in these videos where he was criticizing Carlos, his position on Antifa is specifically what I saw. And in doing that, he called him, uh, this queer Mexican, this like, and he's doing it in a ribbing way.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       He's doing it in a joking way. And then Carlos Mazda posts all these horrible tweets that came his way. And apparently he got docs. So people got his phone and they were saying debates, Steven Crowder, who was getting all these text messages in and all this, a hateful stuff that was coming his way. So the question is, who is responsible for that hateful stuff? If Steven Crowder calls him queer is what is queer. Okay. Is Lbgtq. What do we do there? What do we do if the queue is, is he is, is it okay to call someone gay who identifies as gay? If he calls him the gay little Mexican, is that, is that bad? Like what is, how bad is like what is that?

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       You know what I'm saying? But so do you feel what I'm saying here? It's like, do I know where you're getting at? Let's zoom out a little bit and then we'll, we'll get into this man. Where do you even start with this? Because there's a lot to unpack here, right? If we will analyze the specifics in a second maybe. But first, if you look at the policy, the terms of service of Youtube, there's a verge article from yesterday before, a few days ago, earlier this week before youtube had made the decision to demonetize Steven Crowder. Well, they made the decision to not act initial say that it didn't violate the terms of services. And then today as I got in here, Jamie informed me that they made a decision to demon. That's right. So in the article where they made the decision not to act, they actually put what Youtube [inaudible] terms of service are with regard to bullying and harassment.

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       My reading of it, and we could go through them. If we could pull them up, we could go through it line by line if we wanted. My reading was that the, that definitely did break the terms and conditions. That was my view as I looked at what it was that was done by Steven Crowder and what the terms of service are. Just matching it up, not looking at the comments from either poses specifically. It was, um, specifically targeting an individual on the basis of sexual orientation, but he wasn't targeting them on the basis of it. He was mentioning that with his bad ideas. He was targeting his bad ideas in regards to Antifa a lot of that he was dismissing Antifa but if you look at is video, I can't believe I spent so much time doing this, but that's not like a whole hour on this two days ago.

Speaker 3:          00:46:00       Yep. Um, he was talking about how Carlos just dismisses and tiff has being not that big a deal and that there's bias in the media whenever there's anything negative that happens. But if you look at the overall picture, and then Crowder goes on to talk about all the assaults, all the murders that there was sexual assaults, there was rapes, there was all these things that happen with Antifa. He was talking about all these different people that got maced in the face, all kinds of people that got hurt and, and he's highlighting all, like this is not something to easily dismissed. Sure. And that the FBI had labeled Antifa a terrorist organization. So, so far it's just politics. It's just what, what does he think? What do I think so far it's just that part of it. And along the way he's like, yeah, but the Queer Little Latino says this.

Speaker 3:          00:46:43       Yeah. And when he does that, that's where it's like, okay, what is he doing? Is He ma? He's kind of mocking him. Right. And he's mocking them by saying he's queer, but he says he's queer or he says he's gay. Yeah. But that's like saying, I mean listen, just because the n word is in rap songs, it doesn't mean that any, that that defined to go and I put the n word is not in like, it's not like the LBGT n, you know what I'm saying? It's not like a part of their, their organ. It's, I think the principle though is you're suggesting that because a certain word is sometimes used self referentially by members of a group that any use of it from the outside is by definition not problematic. And I'm just saying it's more complicated and you've got certainly more complicated. You have to look at specifics.

Speaker 3:          00:47:28       I'm g I'm going from memory, but wasn't Steven Crowder also wearing a shirt that said fags with the a with an asterisks, wink, wink, nudge, nudge. It said socialism is for figs and how he's calling a gay gay is a fig instead of a, an eye as he's calling a gay guy couldn't Mexico. Yes. Yeah. I mean in total it's not crazy. So, but no, there's a, there's certainly an argument that, well, I don't necessarily think the t shirt is for Carlos Mesa. I think that's a t shirt that he just has cause he thinks it's funny. And because Che Guevara, who's on the shirt is, that is one of the weirdest things that people worship. That guy, he was a horrific human being. A mass murderer, a terrible sociopath, a psychopath. And because he looks good and it in the Cuban revolution and I'll it with a bra on, you know, he's, he became for a long time.

Speaker 3:          00:48:22       I mean it's kind of died off, but he became like the woke poster boy. I'm from Argentina. I know. Uh, yeah. I was born there. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. So I mean, listen, here's my country bro. I made it. Um, so listen, I think that, I do appreciate what you're saying and I agree with you to a certain extent. I believe that when Youtube yesterday said, we looked at the content in total and we don't think it violates our terms and conditions. I disagreed with them. I thought it very clearly violated their terms and conditions. Where I am thinking about it now is the application of those terms and conditions violations. Because a similar thing happened with Alex Jones as well, which was there's lots of way smaller players that are violating the same terms and conditions, but nobody knows about them. Youtube doesn't know about them.

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       They don't get any attention because they have no audience. So I think there's the question of the application of these terms and conditions, conditions in a way that's sort of fair and is not ultimately going by the public blow back or reaction to situations because that that's how I'd pocalypse one point, oh it happened again, I think it was a coke ad appeared on an obviously racist video on a channel with like 800 or a thousand subscribers. The Wall Street Journal, I think it was, did an article saying, look at these screenshots of these advertisers on these crazy racist videos that led to blow back because youtube didn't want to lose money and ultimately that's what this is about. I know that there are people who say youtube has an inherently left wing bias. Others say youtube has a of right wing by whatever youtube is. Bias is towards corporatism and profit.

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       Yes. That's fundamentally what it is. And as a company to have a left wing bias, I don't know that in what sense? Well, in the sense that the woman who's the CEO of Youtube was talked about it pretty openly, like the fact that she doesn't, what was it that she had gotten into? Oh, well first of all was the James Damore thing. You know, she was talking about the Google memo and she was talking about how it was a incredibly damaging, the damaging, damaging stereotypes against women, which it just wasn't, it's not accurate. Is Home Depot a right wing company because the CEO supports Trump? That's a good question. Um, I'm basing it on that. They're a part of Facebook and Facebook is pretty clearly left wing. Who's part of Facebook? Google. Oh, sorry. Google. They're part of Google. I'm at Google. Google is a very, very left wing group and it's all silicon valley, which is almost entirely left wing biased.

Speaker 3:          00:51:04       So I think we have to distinguish between the personal political biases of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and the broader place that Google has in the sort of corporate sphere. Google is part of the group of huge multinational corporations that um, lobbies for particular tax policy to avoid paying taxes legally. That is not a particularly left wing thing to do. Uh, Google is um, part of the large tech companies that in order to avoid serious regulation of their businesses have come up with this idea of regulating themselves. Okay. Which I know is a topic self regulation that's come up before on your program in in a variety of ways. So those are not left wing things. And if you want to make the case that as a company it has a left wing politic in the outward facing world, you have to have something more than just a lot of their engineers live in Palo Alto and are hipsters who go to coffee shops.

Speaker 3:          00:52:07       You think? I think that in the, in terms of the place that it occupies within the economic system we have, they are not very different from all of the large corporations that are pushing against regulation, pushing four ways to avoid taxes, period. So in terms of economic decisions, yeah. I mean, listen, if, if we want to talk about how the personal politics of the employees translate to policy, we can do that, but we need to be able to make some specific claims about how, how it does, what I'm saying is we know the way in which the structure that Google is a part of leads to it advocating for things that are center, right. Corporatist, capitalist, the status quo of tax shelters, havens and not paying taxes, regulating ourselves, et Cetera, et cetera. Well, that's what's interesting about this crowd or things. They're ultimately, the decision was to allow him to have his freedom to post videos on there, but the punitive aspect of it is they're going to reduce his ability or eliminated his ability to make money. Right, right. Well, I should say reduce, right? Because he could, could he put videos, just put ads up in his video? Yeah, sure. So like we won, one thing that I do

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       is we, uh, we kind of split off the ad sales for my show into an ad agency and we're doing ad sales, not just for my show, but for other shows as well. And those include ad placements that are not like the pre roll ads on Youtube. It's, the host is actually talking about a product or whatever. It's a re, you know, alive read sort of thing. Unbox therapy does a lot of that. Hmm. Yeah. That's where I first saw those who does some pretty extensive ones. Okay. So of course you can do that. I mean, yeah, there's nothing he can

Speaker 1:          00:53:55       do that, but he can't just collect revenue like I assume he's been doing before. He has a significant number of followers. I think his, uh, his youtube subscribers are more than three and a half million. So it's very high. Yeah. More than me and Dave just eliminated his income that comes out of youtube. And this was their decision based on his, his way of talking about Carlos Mesa.

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       That's, that's what happened. Yeah. I mean, so what, what are the concerns? To me it's not that he didn't violate terms and conditions. Like I said, I think he pretty clearly did the concerns to me are um, is youtube only going to even look into these circumstances or instances when there is a public outcry? The answer is probably yes because why would they look into stuff nobody's paying attention to. It's not a good use of change. Their decision based on public outcry, based on Carl's mazes, reaction to the initial decision. I happen to think their initial decision was the wrong one. But I have a sort of broader concern here, which is about the fairness of the application and also the distinguishing between a content that is promoting whatever falls under any of our definitions of hateful or whatever content and those who are fighting against it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       So is it because he mentioned his sexual orientation and that he called him a list, be little queer or whatever, you call them, more queer Mexican. And if he just called him a fucking idiot and he received the exact same amount of hate, would you still think that that was a good move?

Speaker 2:          00:55:36       No. I mean, I think that it would not fall under what they are now claiming is the justification for the demonetization. It would be different because it would have the same, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       Result. The only difference would be they wouldn't be attacking his sexual orientation specifically because of crowd. That's the only difference. It's policing speech, you know? It really is.

Speaker 2:          00:55:58       Here's a, so who gets to decide if not the private businesses, what their rules are. That's

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       where the real question comes up. Right? Tulsi Gabbert believes that it's a first amendment issue and she believes that everyone should have the freedom of expression and then as long as you're not doing anything illegal, you're not putting anyone to danger by giving up their address or doxing them or something along those lines or making overt physical threats. Right. That you should allowed to do that because

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       that's what the freedom of speech is all about. And freedom of speech. When you eliminate social media in this country is your, your, your freedom is basically, yes. Yelling, yelling out in public. I mean you're, we're in this weird place. It's always a culture. As a culture. It's unprecedented really in terms of the waters we're navigating right now, there's a couple of different things to, so I like the principal, like my principal is, we do almost no moderation on any of our platforms that my program is on. My only thing that I tell my team is if you see something that really seems to be illegal, it's calling for violence, it, whatever the these are, we have a very, very high bar before we will remove anything. And quite frankly, we're just too busy. Do you mean by that? I'm confused. Like who's not your videos?

Speaker 3:          00:57:13       Whose videos? So if we find out that on our videos, someone is posting endless comments in the comment. Second comment, my personal view is if it's not illegal, I just, just let it all be there and sit. That's my personal view. And that's a great principle to have. Well, we don't touch them. We leave them alone. Even though we get accused of it, but the, the question is youtube at one point in time had thrown out there that they were going to make people responsible for the things that were in their comments. I vaguely remember that. But it didn't ultimately think they backed out of it very quickly when they realize that places like yours, right. Which like your average video gets how many thousands of comments a lot and many of them antisemitic. And how would you, yeah. And how would you even be able to look at all those?

Speaker 3:          00:57:54       I mean, you would have to be 24 seven monitoring. I'm Bryce. You've also got people that are watching your videos from overseas at all times in the night. Yup. So I think that the principle of only only illegal content will be removed is great. That's, uh, that's my personal principle. However, I think that there is no serious case to be made that a private company can't say these are our terms of service. And if you want to, I mean, it's sort of almost a conservative principle, right? The idea that unless illegal things are going on, uh, we are not going to tell a business how it is that it should be run. And that's where I think a lot of right wingers start to stumble on this issue because they're calling for a very invasive form of government regulation. They're calling for the government to step in and even break up these organizations because they've gotten too large.

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       And, but you're hearing that from the left as well? Yeah. Well I think there's a difference. There's a difference though between Elizabeth Warren saying we should separate the social platform Facebook from the ad sales revenue generating piece of it. That's one thing that falls under antitrust. That's different than saying the government should come in and it should tell anybody who runs a social network that you can't even, you can't do anything unless the content is illegal because there are financial considerations, right? I mean there's lots of content that would not be illegal, but it would make a platform video platform like youtube not financially viable because advertisers would see it and they'd say, oh, we're not going near that. Right. So I have a very hard time taking what is a very authoritarian perspective that the government should come in and say, this is how social networks should be run.

Speaker 3:          00:59:37       Now if you want to change the law, here's the way it could be done. If you want to change the law and argue that these platforms have gotten so big that they represent more of a town square so to speak, then okay, maybe you could pass a law that changes how they would be regulated, but that's typically the type of stuff the right is against because it is more regulation. It is more regulation, but it's regulation to keep a private company from regulating against free speech. Do you see what I'm saying? It's, it's a sneaky kind of regulation. It's a regulation that's enforcing the first amendment and the people's ability to freely express themselves if we're admitting or if we're agreeing that we are entering into this new world. Yes. Where this is I, that's my position is that it is a town square and I, I feel like everybody should be able to communicate.

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       The really unfortunate, unsavory aspect of it is when someone gets harassed like Carlos Mesa was because of this, where people are sending him all these homophobic tweets and all the in these getting text messages and all this shit. That's, that's the unsavory and unfortunate aspect of it. And how do you stop that? I don't know how you stop it. I don't know exactly how you stop it, but I think it would be useful. I mean, one thing is when does a platform get big enough in your mind that it would qualify for this like town square designation? Well for sure. Youtube. Let's talk about that one. Cause that's the one we're on. I mean fucking God damn it. It's huge. It's gigantic. So are there other types of businesses through which communication happens that you think should be regulated in the same way? That's not really clear.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       So I'll give an example. Okay. If you start regularly sending people via ups, uh, similar things to some of the content that exists on youtube and ups says we're getting reports that you're sending people harassing stuff, we don't want you as a customer anymore. Here's the question though, isn't there a difference between someone sending something to a physical address and someone sending something? Just let's say to you when your social media apps or on the third page of your phone and you have to swipe all the way over to get them and open it up and you have to read them. If you want to find them, well you don't necessarily have to read them. There's a difference in a practical sense, but I guess the question is would we want the government, would you similarly want the government to enforce for telephone companies? If you are harassment, getting harassing texts and you report it and report it, that's a different thing. I think. I think what's coming to your phone and the phone is ringing. I think that's a another step. It's another step towards invasive. It's a big gray area. Is the phone ringing? Is it a phone call? Is it a text? Is it it? Is it a whatsapp message to read that text? Right? Yeah. No, I feel

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       you. I guess where I hesitate, and again I'm speaking of someone from the left who believes regulation of businesses is an important thing I would want to be really sure about how exactly it is that the government would step in and mandate essentially that their view has to be listened to over the terms of service that a private company you would wish to have.

Speaker 1:          01:02:44       Yes. I feel like when you give people a gun, they start looking for targets and the, that is a very common thing. If you give people the ability to censor and give people the ability to censor based on their political ideology or based on what they feel is offensive or other people don't. It's a slippery slope and I think that that can, that can lead to all sorts. Look that woman, what is her name again? The one who tried to get Amy Siskind. Imagine her being in charge of a social media platform should try to get you fired from Boston College for something that was incredibly polite. Right. That is what I'm talking about is there are very action, that very same type of thinking that she tried to impose on you. That's what I'm worried about. I'm worried about people that are really strictly trying to promote their ideologies and what they think is okay and not okay and it's very slippery cause there's a lot of weird people out there that believe a lot of weird things and want other people to conform to those weird things.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       And we sort of have to decide like that's why I'm bringing up this crowd or thing like do I think that what he said was good? No, it's not nice to call someone a little lispy queer. It's not nice. It's kind of mean, you know? And especially when that guy wasn't even engaging with him. But he's making fun of him. He's a comedy show. He's mocking them. So the question becomes like when, when is that mocking considered homophobic and when is it just ribbing? Right. And that's his position. His position is that it's just ribbing.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       This is the problem with a discussion that is only about the principles. So like a lot of our conversation for the last 15 minutes has been what is our principal about, what types of business regulation is okay for the government to do and is not okay. Or when we talk about free speech, what should do we have a principle of anything short of illegal content versus something that is more strict? The reality is that it's it, there's more gray area.

Speaker 1:          01:04:36       Yeah. We're trying to sort of regulate the way people communicate with each other. So it's not, it's like if someone said that to someone in a bar, a cop would not arrest them. Like yeah, you listen a little queer, you know, that would be like, oh, that guy's

Speaker 2:          01:04:50       basil. But the bar would be perfectly within their legal right to say, we don't, we don't want you in here. You're making our customers uncomfortable. And nobody would say that. It would be against the law for the bar to say, you got to go.

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       That's a good point. If they were doing it to their face. But what if he was in a corner talking about this guy that wasn't there? And he was saying, yeah, so he's talking about Antifa has lispy little Mexican queer. If you came along and decided to kick the guy out of the bar, then

Speaker 2:          01:05:15       it would, I mean, listen at some bars,

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       if you go into the corner and you yell about Alyssa, right? Mexican queer, they're going to ask you to leave. And it still would not be illegal and the bar would still not be doing anything. Right. But that's a bar, right? That's a private business where people are physically there. Yes. Isn't there a difference between that and something like Youtube, which again falls more in line with like a town square? Maybe that's what we need to revisit that because so much human communication is now happening across these platforms. I would imagine most of it, or most of it, we know we need to maybe stop drawing this arbitrary distinction that in person is a completely different thing than over the Internet. I mean, maybe it's not increasingly, maybe it's more the same. Yeah. Um, so I'm torn here, right? On one side I say, well, it seems like they still allow him to have his freedom of expression because he's still on youtube.

Speaker 3:          01:06:10       He still is able to upload his show on Youtube. He will have to find other ways to make money. Sure. So one part of me looks at it that way and no one has a right to monetize on youtube. Right? Right. So in a sense, they haven't violated his first amendment rights because he's still able to express himself. But then you go as a company, they've made a punitive decision to eliminate his ability or is radically reduced his ability to make an income off of their platform. That seems like, and I'm not supporting that, they did it, but that seems more reasonable as a decision, right. To say we're going to demonetize you. That seems more reasonable. But the problem is there's no alternatives. There's nothing remotely like Youtube to over there is an alternative to youtube for him to regain that same level of monetization.

Speaker 3:          01:07:02       Yes. Or for people that share his viewpoint and share his ideology and chair his positions. And there's no right wing. Youtube is my point. And there's this like I would challenge the idea that youtube is, is left wing. I mean in terms of it's enforcing its policies. How so? I mean they had just this, just this particular issue, but this isn't, this isn't a left wing. How is this a left wing enforcement? I mean they think it is because Carl's mazes progressive and because the argument that he was making is a very left wing progressive argument and this is what Crowder was going after. He was going after the argument in the process of going after the argument, he mocked his sexuality and his appearance. I can assure you if it was focused merely on how much of a problem Antifa is, this would not have happened. I mean I think we both, oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. No, it's all about the mocking the guys sexual orientation and looks. That's worth Carlos Maza where a gay Republican and the exact same thing happened. Do you think the outcome would've been different? Yes. Why? I just don't think people be interested. Oh, well that's a dip up. But so that gets to the real crux of it, which is my real concern with this is youtube only getting involved in even publicly saying what they're doing about a channel,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       right? When it becomes very public and it starts to have the possibility of impacting their bottom line and brand saying, yes, this is too hot and we're getting out. Well in that sense what Carlos did once it was revealed that youtube was not going to take action was very effective. Absolutely. I mean he started tweeting like crazy and people jumped on board. He connected it to the LBGT movement and, and then it became this thing. I mean the other side of this is, I mean I don't know if we even want to go into identity politics so to speak, but there has, I've s I've read some comments on some of the few articles that have been written about this that are saying that this is effectively youtube enforcing a defense of identity politics, so to speak. And I think that that's just again, opening up the door to the incredibly broad application of that term identity politics.

Speaker 2:          01:09:11       I don't even really fully understand that, but I don't know. And I don't even know if that's a path we want to go down to. Talk about like the identity politics component of what's going on with a lot of this regulation. Find what you mean by the identity politics of it. I mean listen, so I guess in order to define it, define it, I, it would be good to point out that uh, I have been critical of quote identity politics on the left in a very limited way that I think it is actually damaging while at the same time recognizing that identity is a really important thing to consider when we think about sort of how the world should be organized. So like for your audience who may not know when identity politics is used, you know, like a, like a knife to enforce that because of someone's identity, their opinion supersedes and is the opinion that is the valid one over everybody else because of membership in some kind of group.

Speaker 2:          01:10:07       I'm against that. I think that's extremely destructive. It would be very, uh, incorrect to believe though that identity doesn't play a role and that we shouldn't understand how one's identity might make us think differently about certain issues. I mean, any example would sure would make that pretty clear, you know, I, as an immigrant to the United States, do I get some privileged position to decide what policy should be overall native born Americans because I immigrated here? No, that would meet be me using identity politics is like a mallet or a cuddle or whatever, but as someone who did immigrate here, we should recognize that. I may have things to say about it, which would be valuable and worthy and important to sort of think about it. That's my shore on identity politics. You're just not interested in the hierarchy of oppressed people. I'm not interested in the oppression Olympics and they're not interested in using identity to silence ideas that could be perfectly good coming from someone who is not a member or checking a certain box. Exactly. Nor Am I. I, I strongly believe in the individual and I think it's one of the most important parts of a collective

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       group of human beings like our country than we recognize that we're all different and there's a lot of weirdness amongst us but are individuals and I like to treat people based on who they are, not what classification they fall under. Now do you think that that bad version of identity politics that I mentioned is a big problem on the left or not a big problem? I'm curious. I think it's certainly a problem, but I think it's a vocal minority problem. That's what I think. I think if you just regular people that are on the left that are working jobs and having families and doing their hobbies and they just have left wing ideas, I don't think the vast majority of them hold those positions. I think those positions are things that people use as revenue. I mean not as revenue, but it's like they, they, they get points from it, you know, they, they get points from certain types of behavior that they support certain types of thinking that they support.

Speaker 3:          01:12:09       And it, it lets you know you've got woke social justice points and then we agree. Yeah. I mean I, Jen I asked because I genuinely didn't know. I mean I've heard them talking about any politics dangerous number though in terms of college campuses, when you look at like what happened in Evergreen state, Bret Weinstein, it, it, it, it's very disruptive. Yes and no. I mean I do think that it's disproportionately a PR. I think it's a small problem like you're saying. I think a lot of the problem exists in the college campus setting, but um, I mean even at Boston College, you know, I had sort of maybe been incorrectly, um, indoctrinated into the idea that this was really a problem everywhere on college campuses and I had an incident, the details of which wouldn't be appropriate to talk about, but with a student when I taught at Boston college that because of the circumstances and the identities involved, I was ready for it to go into.

Speaker 3:          01:13:02       This is going to be resolved the wrong way on the basis of the toxic identity politics I'm hearing is existing on college campuses. And it was not, it was the exact opposite. So I think the same way that when you look at Yelp reviews, people who had a bad experience are way more likely to go and write about it. Yes. These individual stories get way more attention than the percentage of the problem that they represent. I believe you're probably correct about that, but when you see videos like nick, Nick Christakis getting, uh, just shouted down at Yale by a group of students and that they supported the students and that kind of Shit, you say, well, it is real. It does exist. It's real. It exists. I think that sensible people on the left like me, uh, call it out, but I want to be careful. Imagine that you had someone from Cato on the show, which is sort of like a traditional conservative or American Enterprise Institute. Maybe he's like a better example. And a lot of the conversation was about getting them to talk about or denounced the alt right, for example. I'm sure they would do it, but how much should a denounced the outright when that's like a different thing sample?

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       Yeah. It's a very good analogy. Yeah. I think we oftentimes are responding to this very vocal minority. Yes. And those are the people that are most invested in getting these ideas pushed through and they're there. It's also people that, you know, for lack of a better term, they're probably mentally ill and I only mean mentally ill in terms of like have like legitimate diseases. But in terms of their thought patterns, they're probably obsessive. I mean I've had friends that were, uh, especially friends that were heavily involved in this kind of stuff before and it was very damaging to their mental health, this type of stuff, being politics being woke, left wing, shout out at people attack people politics. But then you realize somewhere on the wine and then one of them, my friend Jamie Kilstein was a, they turned on him and then, you know, devastated his life and he realized along the way like, oh Jesus Christ. Like what? What was I doing? Like I was checking my Twitter every five seconds and insulting people left and right. And attacking people just to get everybody to say, yeah, go get him. And, you know, showing everybody how woke I am and how progressive I am. And it becomes a weird sort of a, a point system. Like you're, you're trying to score points, you're, you're trying to gain favor with your party.

Speaker 2:          01:15:25       There's a lot of that. I think it's really important though. So there's people on the left and right who get pulled into political wokeness, whether it's I'm now tea party in 2010 people that got sucked into tea party on the right and Tifo whatever. These are all groups with different sort of followings. They're not all the same, whatever. I do think that there is a difference between getting extremely passionate about the idea that everybody should have access to just basic health care. Then getting extremely passionate about the idea, uh, that we need to go out of our way to shut down every abortion clinic in the country. I think that there's just, there's a difference. So I don't want to participate in a false equivalency between, well, you got very far left in very far right people and they're the same and you've got center left and center right.

Speaker 2:          01:16:14       And they're the same. It's just two sides of the same coin. Like obviously I have a perspective that is based on my politics. I'm glad to debate any of these issues with anybody who wants to on the merits, but I don't want to make the false equivalency. I mean, listen, when you look at Anti Defamation League numbers, for example, the vast majority of, um, of, of hate incidents in the United States are coming from the right. We could talk about other ways that the left is active. We could talk about what it means or how things should be categorized, but that's the reality. And so I want to make sure I don't play a false equivalency game. My audience would crush me if I did that, number one. Um, but I think it's just wrong. I think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the facts bear it out.

Speaker 1:          01:17:01       I think you're right there. And I also think that these false equivalency kind of conversations or they're ridiculous because each individual conversation about each individual issue deserves its own discussion. Yes. And to say, what about this? Or what about that? Those? What about Isms? Those are the, the death of

Speaker 2:          01:17:19       any real rational discussion because they go on forever. There they go on forever. There's no, I mean it's like scroll, this is why scrolling Twitter endlessly is a problem because there's really no end. You can always scroll a little new to it to the end for right. Yeah. I mean, yeah, the it's the new tweets are coming fast. It's the same with a lot of those kind of one's ever done that just scrolled until their phone died. Just charge it, wake up in the morning and just scroll down all day. How long does it take? I think you wouldn't because the new content appears faster because of the algorithm, but you still never run out? No. Just keep going. No. There's a few things. I don't know if this would be interesting to go into, but there's a few things that I've found have been somewhat successful in conversations with people who really disagree with me and at least like lowering the temperature a little bit and getting people to maybe engage in a good faith way.

Speaker 2:          01:18:13       One of them is how do you think I came to my position? Mm. So you might be four total free market for profit healthcare. I am for a system where the government is more involved and even if you can't pay, you get care before we even start. If I say, how do you think I arrived at my position? That has been pretty useful. Um, another example is, uh, I think this came from Peter Bogosian who I think you've had on, yes. The Duffy's ability question, which is what evidence if I presented it to you would bring you over to my side. I'm not saying I have that evidence or that it exists, but give me a framework as to what is keeping you from seeing this my way. Because sometimes that exists, the person just doesn't know about it. Those are two tools that I have found super useful in trying to make some headway with people who are hyper partisan and very escalated with a lot of these issues.

Speaker 1:          01:19:08       Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. It's, it's very difficult to have good faith conversations with people when you disagree with them. You know, and you have to have discipline and you have to have some sort of a sense of self. Yeah. And you have to know how to be calm and kind, you know, the, the, the, the descent into insults and dunking on people as one of the, one of the reasons why I, at the beginning of the conversation, I was saying that I've, one of the things I enjoy about your, your youtube videos is you're a very reasonable, rational person and you don't get crazy and animated and insulting. And I think there's, we need more of that because I think even though you're not going to convert some people, there's just a certain subsection of the population that disagrees with you that's just going to write. But there's a significant number that I going to go, hey, this David Pakman guys, he's reasonable. He's making a lot of sense. He's intelligent. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:19:58       my goal is, and I think that it's sort of working and that we have a lot of Trump supporters who are paid subscribers to my show. A, we have some

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       are they taking notes? Uh, maybe they are to the boss, but my, uh, my goal is, my goal is, yeah, that would, I mean that, that would be an interesting day if I wake up and Trump has responded to one of my videos about him, what would you do? Uh, I think it'd be a good day. Well, that's what Cole bear did. That was how funny was that when Cole Bear was on TV's like Donald? Yeah. How did you not know that you shouldn't respond to me? Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's rule number one. It's an important one. Unless you want to create a shit storm of a very certain email. My goal is I don't pretend to be neutral. I think neutrality is almost always false because on most issues, people, they're not indifferent. I mean neutral is another way of saying in different, you could be conflicted in neutral, you can be conflicted in neutral, but I try to at least be objective and transparent in how I arrived at what I believe, so you can disagree with my conclusion.

Speaker 3:          01:21:01       You can even come to me and telling me the facts. I've used to reach the conclusion or incomplete or wrong, but I'm completely genuine and how I arrived there and I think that that is why we have some, I mean, yeah, there's obviously, if you look at Youtube comments that are right wingers that watch my show, but choosing to support it financially is a different thing and I get emails from conservatives who say, I don't agree with your conclusions, but I do find that you're at least reasoning through the issues in a way that resonates with me and I want to support the fact that you're doing that. That's outstanding. That's a huge victory. There really is in a sense in my eyes is in this day and age, I think this is the most polarized time. I can remember as a 51 year old man looking back at my history of paying attention to social issues and the way we communicate with each other and just to partisan attitudes that people seem to have.

Speaker 3:          01:21:52       I don't, I don't, I mean I think it's probably because of Trump. That's a giant part of it, but it's also just a sign of the times of social media. I think it's in part engineered by the algorithms at Facebook and Twitter and all these other social media companies utilize. And it's also been engineered by Beth bad faith participants and people that are actually manipulating it. Um, I don't know if you've paid any attention to Sam Harris had a fantastic a podcast with a, and we had one with her as well. Rene de Resta when they arrest a analyzed all of the various accounts that the IRA had created, would the internet research agency that was responsible for all of these fake accounts that people thought were black lives matter accounts or pro southern secession accounts or all these different accounts that were very polarizing and arguing with other people that these were just Russians that were working for this organization that was specifically trying to start chaos. They were specifically trying to start arguments and when you, when you, you see that and then I mean that's

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       a factor. That's a giant factor. That kind of shit is a factor and that that is sort of become part of the sport of social media has been arguing. Absolutely. I don't do it. I don't engage, but I do go on Facebook sometimes when someone makes an abortion post and I just watched the chaos like, oh my God. Yeah, it's in or anything having anything to do with Trump or anything having anything to do with the second amendment or anything that has anything to do with the the wall or immigration.

Speaker 2:          01:23:33       So I don't know that people are actually enlarger disagreements, right, than they were previously. I think that yes, Trump has coarsened the language and the way in which it's now acceptable to talk about a lot of these things. That's number one. I think the social media algorithms like you're pointing out, reward the most extreme and polarizing comments and reactions in a never ending feedback loop where the most polarizing initial tweet generates a more risky, more responses than less polarizing tweets and then the sub responses that are most polarizing and and aggressive do the exact same thing and it's never ending feedback loop. I think it's all those things, but I don't know that people are having bigger disagreements than in times past. I just think that they're public in a different way.

Speaker 1:          01:24:20       Well, there's more disagreements because people have more opportunity to disagree, so they have more opportunity to engage. In particular when you're talking about people that are addicted to their phones and it's coming from a guy who uses fucking phone four hours a day. I'd like to think that one hour that is productive, but I know that three hours of it is me staring at butts on Instagram, looking at muscle cars and watching crazy videos. And then how much are you on? Like a computer? I don't know. Hmm. I didn't, I don't have that, that data. Right, but it's not as much and mow, the good thing about it is most of my bullshit I'm doing on the phone, most of my computer work, unless I'm laying in bed and I just watch, embarrassingly enough, I watch youtube videos on pool. That's what I watch real. I go to bed. Yeah, that's interesting. Well, I play pool so I'll watch like professional pool matches before I go to bed because it's calming, it's relaxing and I analyze positions. It's interesting. I do the same thing with chess. Ah, that's what I, there's like chest streamers that I watch and it's similar. It's key. You could kick back and sort of, it's, you're engaged. But it's nothing crazy. And it's also kind of stimulating in an intellectual way or, yeah, it's different than politics. Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 2:          01:25:28       Like on weekends when people, you know, like my mom will, you know, I want to talk to me about politics and I'm just like, I did this all week, mom and your mom watch your show. She does. And she watches other shows and my family, super political, so real and so on the weekends, if it's Saturday, I'm right in the middle of my break period because they left wing. Oh yeah. Thank God. Yeah. I imagine, could you imagine some

Speaker 1:          01:25:51       mean dad calling you up? What the fuck is wrong with you, David? I might've had to de fu. Ah, de fu. Mm. Yeah, yeah. Anyway. Anyway, indeed. Um, I think that there's more opportunity as her saying, to descend, to disagree with people, more opportunity to argue. And in those more opportunities you're seeing more conflict. And I think more polarization. And I think, again, the social media algorithms and all the other nonsense that gets, I think there's, I really do believe that the, the feeling that I get, but it also might be because a big part of my job is being on the Internet. So maybe I'm more engaged with it.

Speaker 2:          01:26:29       RV folks skews it a little bit. Yeah. But I think, so in practice it, Matt, let's imagine that the disagreements are equal to what they've always been, but there's more opportunities to disagree and the algorithm favors more escalated disagreement than rational conversation. The effect is that you might meet someone with whom you have 80% in common in terms of your political views, but the circumstances in which you engage with that person are going to be on the 20% that you don't. So it makes it seem as though you just have very little common ground with anybody, right. Because the 80% agreement becomes background and the social media platforms, the debates happening on youtube elsewhere are focused only on like the most divisive fraction of one's entire political views. And that's, I think what the problem is. Mm. But it makes sense because most people agree that, I don't know gas stations. I mean just to pick something innocuous. Most people agree that it's good to have a regulatory system that makes sure that when you think you've pumped five gallons of gas, you've gotten five gallons of gas, it's so uncontroversial that nobody's going to talk about it. Like it makes sense that the focus is going to be on the disagreements. Where it's damaging is then when you meet people in real life and it's hard to relate or even be in the same room because only those differences are sort of like played up. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:27:51       Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Yeah, but the conflict gets highlighted. You have conflict bias. Yeah. Yeah. I, I don't know where I see this going. That's one of the more interesting things about particularly with social media and like things when you come to this crowd or situation, I don't know where this is going cause I didn't know this was ever going to be a thing. I had never really considered that there was going to be some digital town square that we're all going to be enjoying. Whether it's Twitter or youtube or whatever it is

Speaker 2:          01:28:25       that might even need, right.

Speaker 1:          01:28:26       Yeah. That might even need regulation. But getting back to the Crowder thing, um, the issue that you, so you agree with it in the sense that he was mocking this person's sexual orientation and appearance.

Speaker 2:          01:28:44       I agree with the assertion that Youtube's terms of service as written were violated on the basis that he was singling out an individual and the characteristics that that individual was being, uh, targeted with or spoken were, uh, sexual orientation in terms that, that, um, uh, the terms of service say is not allowed.

Speaker 1:          01:29:10       Is that different in your opinion than someone singling something out for what you believe is their mental incompetency?

Speaker 2:          01:29:19       Well, the mental and comp, do you mean that they are in marketing or that they're, that they're mentally ill or cognitively limited,

Speaker 1:          01:29:25       cognitively limited, mocking their ability to think, walking their intelligence, mocking their decisions, mocking their, the way they talk, and then encouraging other people to do the same thing. And then that person gets harassed based on their intelligence, based on their performance on particular youtube videos and conversations. And there's active harassers, there's people that do that. Is there a difference between, say what Sam Cedar does to Dave Rubin? What does Sam do to Dave Ruben? He has, I don't know that I seen that video. Dozens of videos. Don't say that video. He has dozens of videos where he's just dunking on Dave Rubin.

Speaker 2:          01:30:02       So I, I mean I, I have some as well. I believe that they are substantive. That's my, my view is that my video is about Dave Rubin or substantive. I really, I don't really watch any left wing stuff because I want to try to isolate myself enough to make sure that what I'm saying are my id is unique and that I'm not taking them. So I know Sam's a friend of mine and I, oh, that's interesting. And a comics do though. I don't know. But if there some specific examples we could comment about them. But, um, I think that there too, to your first question, there is a difference, uh, between going after someone for sexual orientation, right. Then going after them for the fact that they say things that are wrong or don't know stuff until you're making fun of someone who has an actual handicap of some kind, some kind of, you know, uh, limited cognitive limitation that would be a disability of some kind. Then you are mocking someone for a decision.

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       The resulting effect of the harassment. The, see this is what I was getting at before with Crowder. Like what Crowder said was one thing, but one of the things that Carlos Mesa was discussing was what the people that had watch Crowder, what they were doing, how they were going after him as if see that and that is a real discussion. Like what, what happens when you say something about someone and then your fans agree and then they take action.

Speaker 2:          01:31:19       Which I didn't see that in the Steven Crowder decision that the reaction was part of youtube evaluation. Now I may just have missed that, but I didn't see youtube say that part of the calculation had to do with what other people were.

Speaker 1:          01:31:36       I don't think they did say that and I don't think they would, but I think Carlos Mesa did say that it was one of the things that he was talking about this endless assault. He's experienced.

Speaker 2:          01:31:45       Well he's right to, uh, call it deplorable. I think we would agree with that. I think your question is more about whether you choose who's responsible for it, where is responsible for it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:31:54       He's anonymous. People that can just lash out at someone and insult them out of ultimately

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       they are responsible. Those people respond. People tend to agree. However, um, so there's this term stochastic terrorism, I dunno if you're familiar with the Catholic terrorism, is the idea that if you have a big enough audience, um, and you go and every day you're talking about someone should really do something about a particular politician, you're doing it every day. You're doing every day, uh, at a certain point, given a large enough audience and enough repetition of that. And the fact that there's like a distribution of people's emotional states, cognitive capacity, et Cetera, it is statistically probable that someone from that audience is going to go and try to do something about whoever it is that you're targeting. That individual who has the show and is hammering on this person day after day after day, they're not going to be legally responsible for that person from their audience who went and did something.

Speaker 2:          01:32:58       There's no way that you're going to hold them legally responsible under the current legal system that we have, but you could argue that it is irresponsible in some way not to understand that your consequences have actions. Of course, the person who goes and does the violent act is the primary person who is responsible, right? But as long as you're not calling out for that act, how do we make this distinction that someone is encouraging that act or someone is at least inspiring that their judgment calls? I mean, listen, I can go on my show and I can speak in vague terminology or specific terminology. You know, imagine that there's a local business that I don't like. I could go on my show and I could say this business did this and I need everybody in my audience to show up there and to make it impossible to get in and patronize that business.

Speaker 2:          01:33:48       That's very clearly on one side of the gray area. I could instead say, you know, uh, there's a business and I could say the type of business, but I not, not name it. If it's a small enough town, people would know exactly what business I'm talking about and I really don't like the way I was treated there. And if only there was some way that someone could do something about it, the effect could be the exact same on it. Right. I don't know how you measure when it's on one side and yeah. It's like, yeah, right. You could somehow or another remove your,

Speaker 4:          01:34:19       you're, you could somehow or another make it so that it's, yeah, I'm agreeing with you. Yeah. You can remove your responsibility for their actions. Some sort of what was just got interesting. Uh, um, I was just, I was trying to find a tweet from Mazda about him sending or asking people to flag Crowder's videos. Did you get the one where he asked people to go assault people with milkshakes? So he ate them at every turn you to tweet it an hour ago or yeah, 1230 that to clarify, this is responding to Carlos Mazda to clarify. In order to restate monetization on his channel, he will need to remove the link to his t shirts. Oh, so it's the figs t shirt? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       Oh well that's all he has to do. He specifically asked about that and then they respond. That's why I have to do wow. That's well using. That's pretty, pretty straightforward. It's pretty straight forward. Yeah. The shirts stupid. But you know, he's a comedian. I mean that's a crowd is doing. And his doing the thing about Mesa, he's mocking him for his appearance. But Carlos Mesa specifically encouraged people to throw milkshakes at people that disagree with him and to harass them publicly and humiliate them. So one thing that does not justify the other, no, it doesn't have that. But that is more egregious. How fast can people to assault people and asking people to physically humiliate people in person, in my opinion, is more egregious. I don't agree with mocking his physical a p well as physical appearances. That's just what it is, you know? But the sexual orientation aspect of it, it's like, yeah, I get it, I get it.

Speaker 1:          01:35:53       It's not, it's not nice. How far do you think, sorry, this is just a comedian thing goes because I hear that a lot in just excusing things that are said. He's trying to do comedy, right? So He's trying to make fun. Izzy yell, hold on, but make comedy and making fun of someone are two different things. Like I don't do comedy, but I will sometimes make fun of things people say. Right. But he's doing it to be funny. He's making fun of things specifically to be funny. And sometimes you know, when you do that, you go too far, you cross lines. I genuinely did not realize that Crowder does a comedy show. Oh yeah, yeah. He's so when he, so when show is a comedy show. Wow. Yeah. A lot of it is funny. He does some funny shit. He really does. Whether you agree with them or disagree with them.

Speaker 1:          01:36:34       He's done some hilarious bits. I genuinely, I'm, I'm reacting in real time because I had no idea. He has his spit. He does about this French socialists. He puts on a wig and pretends to be this different person. He's pretending to be a transgender person is pretended to. He's done a bunch of these infiltration videos. We'll, he'll go into these ridiculous organizations and ask them questions, but it's very much a comedy show dressing up like a trans person's funny. It is. If you're funny at it, if you could, I mean, Mrs Doubtfire isn't that funny? And that's what he was doing. He was dressing up as a woman. He was dressing up as a woman, right. He was dressing up as a woman and that's a great movie. I agree with you there over there's some funny shit. And look how many times and in living color did they dress up like women, there's, there's some humor to someone who is a man who's dressing up like a woman.

Speaker 1:          01:37:23       Sure. That can, that can be an, I shouldn't comment specifically on crowd or doing it if I hadn't seen it. Now he's got some funny shit he does. You know. And I'll take shit for that for saying that. He's funny. He makes me laugh too. I'm staying quiet. Yeah I know, I understand. I get it. I don't agree with him. You know constantly going on and on about this guy being queer are calling them a lispy little queer but he's doing it to try to be funny. So the question is when can you do that to be funny? And apparently with youtube you can do that and be funny as long as you were always on the tee shirt tee shirt. Yeah. This is interesting

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       actually. Even that's even weirder now this is weird that they just, if he removes a t shirt of link, a link to the tee shirt, oh he can still sell it. He just can't link to it from Youtube. I think that's what they're saying. That's so minor that it's hard to, I mean it is what it is

Speaker 1:          01:38:09       cause it's sort of an encouraging people to buy it. And then youtube would say, well, if you have an add on that, then you're encouraging homophobic behavior and we can allow that with our monetization policy.

Speaker 2:          01:38:22       I mean it's minor in the context of everything else that's wrapped up in this I buy it might be an important fun, you know, revenue generating tee shirt for I think so much of this, again,

Speaker 1:          01:38:33       these disagreements on issues, it comes down to what you and I were talking about before that if two people are in a room together, 95% of what they're talking about, you're going to agree on when someone's making a video on someone. If they just to say like fucking David Pakman man, I, here's my deal with that guy and then you just ranting thing and is I hate his fucking neck and I don't like his shirt and his face is stupid. When people do stuff like that, it's just, it's a, it's a terrible way to communicate because it's, first of all, you would have to be a real asshole to say most of the things that people say about things and they're dunking on them in person. You have to be, you used to be a bad person, so you know the person's going to see it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:11       So you're just deciding I'm going to be a bad person, but I'm pretend I'm not a bad person because I'm going to do it in a way where they're not in the room, so I'm just going to shit all over him and give him my, my real opinion. But it's not like a real, it's not like you and I are at dinner and you're like, you know, fuck this guy. And that's, that's how people talk. But when you're doing that, but you're doing it, you're broadcasting it. I think we're all learning in this process of doing podcasts and video blogs on this stuff. We're all learning that you're not alone. You are doing this and you're saying it in a way that that person's going to see in the same, could be applied to, uh, Dave Ruben and Sam Cedar dunking on them all the time. It's kind of the same thing. And Michael Roberts as well. So same sort of thing there. That that's what they're doing. Yeah. And they're saying things that they wouldn't say if he was there in person. Right. But sure. Okay. Guilty. They were sitting around having lunch together, talking shit about some stupid thing that he said the night before.

Speaker 2:          01:40:14       Yeah, that, that's fine. And I don't think, I mean whether or not you would say something in person doesn't tell us whether it's a fair or unfair critique. True. I think it's fair to say I try to avoid strict ad hominems I will, I mean listen, we're all trying to get, build an audience, right? So at a certain point, yes. Like I will pick titles that I think are the most interesting titles to get people to watch the thing or whatever. Or I'll use vocabulary that I might not use in person, but at least what I'm trying to do is make it as substantive as possible and to sort of like justify how I came to my conclusions. That part of it in, in person conversations usually will not lend itself to like screaming or violence or whatever. If that part is the focus. I I completely agree with you on that.

Speaker 1:          01:40:57       Yeah. I think we'd be better off if we did try to communicate with, but when you're doing comedy that goes out the window.

Speaker 2:          01:41:04       It does. But Co even comedy aside, I agree with the principal communicate battle of ideas, a marketplace of ideas, very, very big ideas we all want to hear about and what are the best ideas and let's rank the ideas. There are people whose views are so extreme that you can't really bring them to the table as reasonable negotiating partners for figuring something out. Right? Like Richard Spencer. Oh sure. Or, or even, I mean, okay. Imagine Farah Khan, uh, Louis Farrakhan who I've spoken out about, uh, many times. Imagine that we want to figure out what the tax rate should be. Something that politicians have to do all the time. If you have a group of people who believe that we need a 25% flat tax and a group of people who want, you know, like an escalating progressive tax that gets as high as 70% on income, over 10 million, whatever, right? Like Philadel all, then all those people are going to be able to have a conversation. If someone comes in who says any taxes that the government collects are a form of slavery, how do you integrate that into the conversation about how to set tax rates?

Speaker 5:          01:42:09       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:42:11       You can't, right? Yeah. So all of this stuff, you know, there's this new movement now, which I think is great about long form conversations going in depth, figuring out what our disagreements are like. I'm for all of it. I'm absolutely for all of it. I think you do it. I do it, I do it, and I'm sure, okay. But where I do think that there's like a lack of of pragmatic reality to it is some people's ideas are so extreme that they can't in any sensible way, be incorporated into an actual good faith discussion of how society should be organized. That is the,

Speaker 1:          01:42:44       the problem with having conversations and scale, right? And that's the problem with Twitter and with youtube that you're dealing with millions and millions and millions of human beings. And when you have that broad spectrum of humans, you're going to have people on the far ends of both sides.

Speaker 2:          01:42:57       And at a certain point they're a decision. Has to be made about who actually gets to participate in the decision making conversations, right? It's great for everybody to have a voice on taxation on Twitter. But imagine if there was a significant portion of the, of our elected officials who straight up think taxes are slavery. Like I just don't know how that becomes integrated into a decision about tax policy.

Speaker 1:          01:43:19       Right? Um, I think the argument would be that bad ideas should be combated with good ideas, not with silencing someone. And that when you do silence someone, you just sort of create this blockade where the idea of builds up behind it and then the opposition to your perspective builds up and then people start picking teams and picking sides. And, and I honestly think that that's something that's going to be going on right now with the sole Crowder Crowder, vox thing. I think people are going to pick sides and they fucking love it. People love a good to get into. There's

Speaker 3:          01:43:51       a lot of people in the cubicles right now that are weighing in and firing up and there's people that want to dock him again and these people want to infiltrate as Facebook and it's Twitter. That's what people do. And you're dealing with milk. I mean the car, what does the crowd or have 3.5, 3.8 million, something like that. I mean, I think what you have to also remember is it's not just the reactions that are, uh, sort of like tailored to continue the escalation. I mean, in the end, maybe Crowder personally in his personal life does refer to people he perceives to be gay or who are gay as queers. I don't know. I don't, or he uses the word fags. I have no idea. Well, he didn't use that word. The t shirt. It has the asterisk I get, it's a goof. It's actually as a fig.

Speaker 3:          01:44:35       It doesn't have an asterisk. The okay. Or an ae is a fig. Okay. For figs. It's the idea. It's an, I got it. Okay. It's a goofy joke. Fair. My point is, um, I don't know, you know, any sensible person who lives in the west and has access to media like Steven Crowder or whoever knows that the use of that language has a very specific path, that and set of reactions that it's going to trigger you. Specifically the, that shirt, the shirt and honoring to Carlos Mazda as a young queer Mexican or, or whatever the phrase is. That's a w one w the queer one is a weird one because it's what it's with Lbgtq. Like what is like, here's a good one, right? National Association for the advancement of colored people. Okay. Naacp. You can't call people colored people. Sure. But that organization was named a long time ago.

Speaker 3:          01:45:31       It's, it's more acronyms than anything else at this point, Sam. But it's not right. You both, we both know what the acronym with the individual letters or words in that acronym are. I think the word queer is not a derogatory word, but it is, or it cannot be, depending on how it's, Yo, you fucking queer. Yeah, sure. I mean, listen, it's the same way with Jew. Right, right, right, right, right. I'm in a family thing and it's a bunch of Jews or whatever. That's a word that can be used in a way that if someone shows up, if Richard Spencer shows up or one of his followers and goes to a bar Mitzvah and talks about this room full of Jews, the word is the same root word less. We're talking about two very different things. That's a good point. But should he be allowed to say this room full of Jews allowed? I mean, it's not illegal. No, it's not illegal. He wasn't allowed. He is allowed, but where does it like this room full of w where does it get toxic? Well, if Richard Spencer shows up at a, at a bar Mitzvah and yells about this room full of Jews, I think, uh, it's gotten toxic. Yeah. That's a good subject to break this stalemate of this subject, not steal me, but just sort of end this antisemitism, right. Seems to be ridiculously on the rise and that, that's stunning to

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       me. That shocked me when I lie because of the Internet, the Internet sort of exposed antisemitism that I didn't necessarily know existed. I see at the levels that existed at, I knew there was antisemites, but I didn't even know there were so brazen in over.

Speaker 2:          01:47:04       Well, they've gotten brazen since January of 2017. Oh, okay. I don't know that Donald Trump has created antisemites. In fact, he probably hasn't, well his son in law's choose son-in-laws Jewish, his daughter converted to Judaism, etc. Uh, but I think that Richard Spencer told me, we know that Trump is not literally a white nationalist who is going to talk about let's take control back from the Jews. But we see him as the closest thing to what we would like. He talks about people from Mexico, he talks about shithole countries, et cetera. Um, so it's just emboldened the movement. It doesn't necessarily create

Speaker 1:          01:47:47       people from Mexico and should hold countries that doesn't necessarily really equate with Israel.

Speaker 2:          01:47:53       No. Well, antisemitism in Israel also are two totally separate thing. I mean, think it's just a, you could be against the current Israeli administration as I am like Benjamin Netanyahu and still call out antisemitism against Jews in the short states, for example, or whatever. I see what you're saying. It doesn't, one is not directly linked to the other, but if you're a group that already has these views and then you see a guy who opens his campaign talking about, um, they're sending rapists and criminals, but some I'm sure are good people and I don't want people coming here from shithole countries. What about Norwegians? Whatever. Right. It's a signal. It's a signal. And I've spoken to former KKK people, some of whom are really interesting people to talk to and they know exactly why it's appealing because they see the signals and the vocabulary and the dog whistling. So I think it's just brought it out into the forefront. I don't know that new antisemitism has necessarily been generated, although it being in the forefront probably does start to get some people kind of curious like, oh, maybe all the problems are because of the Jews. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:48:55       Mm. It's just a, I guess they find groups of like minded folks and they join along. Right? Is that the antisemites? Yeah. The, they find them online and then you can stumble into it where you ordinarily wouldn't be around people that are having those discussions

Speaker 2:          01:49:12       that can happen. And a lot of the people that I've talked to that got into those beliefs and then out of them said that they got in usually on a community level, there was something about the community that was appealing to like gangs, gangs, or in the case of KKK and white supremacy, people that, um, had a bad home situation and they found a group that would accept them. Like partially they would accept them because they were white. Right. Um, and then they got pulled into the beliefs and eventually they, they sort of got out of them. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:49:44       It's just a, so you think the rise of in 2017 there's more antisemitism, or do you think it's more or for overt,

Speaker 2:          01:49:52       I believe it's moreover because Trump was the president. Yeah. Hmm. And you know, groups that track these, uh, incidents like the Anti Defamation League and others, they have the data and there have been increases.

Speaker 1:          01:50:04       Hmm. Yeah. It's, it's stunning to me. You know, you, you see it online so many different places now and I just don't remember seeing it before or not like that. Not that's you'd run into it. So often are people calling people design is shills.

Speaker 2:          01:50:19       Yeah. I mean that's an important thing to talk about. I mean, people call me that all the time. Mm. And, um, you know, I feel like that is an issue where I try to speak, I mean she'll to me suggests that you're saying one thing, but with some kind of other agenda that you're trying to push in some way. In other words, you are, you are being in some way deceptive about your actual intentions in what you say. So I think when people call me a Zionist shill, what they mean is I'm talking about one thing with the secret goal or below the surface goal of actually promoting some action by the state of Israel. I think that's the idea of a shill. Um, but you know, I mean, I, I, I'm opposed to the current prime minister in Israel. Uh, I've made clear that isn't in trouble right now.

Speaker 2:          01:51:11       Uh, yeah. I mean he's been in tentative trouble for a long time. His wife is in trouble as well, I believe. Um, but that, I mean, the problem is, and I know that there are people on the left and right, that when I say this will, I'm gonna, I mean I'm going to get crushed from what I'm about to say. Sometimes when someone says Zionist Shill, it's related to your view on the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Sometimes when someone's has sinus shell, it's covered for just wanting to insult someone for being Jewish or for antisemitism. You gotta look at every instance one by one.

Speaker 1:          01:51:43       Yeah. And sometimes people just like saying things too. Yeah. Yeah. It's a popular thing to say, especially if they find out that you're Jewish. Absolutely. It's like a thing. Yeah. It's a thing to say it's a little weapon to use. It absolutely is. Do you find, this is sort of an abstract question, but overall like doing this show and, uh, and having this increased ever increased exposure, do you, do you enjoy it? Are you, are you weirded out by the interactions with all the people? Do you feel pressure by all the comments and the, the, do you feel like a little bit of anxiety from all the social media aspect of it?

Speaker 2:          01:52:23       I, I do. Um, so I, I enjoy the idea that people are listening to my ideas and either agreeing or disagreeing, but they're considering them and then integrating it into how they figure out what they think about the world around them. That's awesome. I do get weirded out by sort of like safety, security stuff that sometimes comes up, which I try not to even like put too much attention on because I feel like it just feeds, it gives people ideas and um, people who, you know, come up to me and I mean, I'm more curious to actually hear your thoughts about this. Uh, come up to me and you know, they may not necessarily see the world the way I see it and I'm unsure sort of like what are their intentions type of thing. I mean, I, it gives me anxiety and it gives people that are close to me. Anxiety for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:53:14       Yeah, because your profiles, just if you keep doing this, you're very good at it. Thank you. You're going to continue to get more and more popular.

Speaker 2:          01:53:21       Yeah. And I mean I guess it's a double edged sword. I mean, I don't know. Like when when you do a comedy show afterwards, is it kind of like a free for all where people can come up and chat with you

Speaker 1:          01:53:31       sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. And do you get skiddish? No. You don't know. Most people are nice. I agree. The vast majority of people are nice. I agree. They, they come to see you. They're there. They're usually fans and they just want to take pictures of say what's up.

Speaker 2:          01:53:45       Yeah. I guess it's a little different when what you do is like overtly political. Yes. Versus other areas. Like if you're an actor, comedian doing the right things, race, car driver. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:53:54       Right. You are in a much more conflict driven profession. Yeah. In a sense. Yeah. I mean I, I have political people on like you, but um, you know, I'm not entirely engaged in politics like you guys are,

Speaker 2:          01:54:06       right? Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I do worry that no matter what happens in the next few elections, I don't know how we reverse the, uh, radicalization polarization effects of the social media echo chambers that we've been talking about. And I only see that as further. I mean, we could still accomplish good things while that's going on. Like I think if we elect the right people, maybe we can get good things done. But in parallel, there is this like hyper radicalized, polarized narrative that's going on. And I don't see any way that that's going to turn around.

Speaker 1:          01:54:40       I wonder myself. I do. I, and, and I'm very, very confused by it because I don't see any longterm solution for this other than some radical change in the way human beings communicate with each other. And now that I've contemplated that and hypothesized, theorized and I really think that if what has changed the way we communicate as technology and this, um, the immersive immersive aspect of social media technology, the fact that we carry these devices with us all the time that allow us to communicate and allowed us to read other people's communications and, or watch or the people's communications. And I have a concern that this is going to escalate with each x, each expansion and each innovation in terms of like what I, and I don't know what it would be because no one saw the internet coming. If you go back 30 years ago, no one ever thought anything was going to be anything like it is now.

Speaker 1:          01:55:38       Well, Al Gore did. Ha, I bet he did. Um, but if you, but if you go 30 years from now, I mean, what are we really looking at? What, what, what, what, what is this world going to be? I don't think anybody has an idea. I think we have no idea. And I think it's going to be, if you look at the trend, the trend is not towards calming people down and giving people space and allowing people to meditate more and know that the trend is to get more and more immersed. Right? The trend is for us to get closer and closer to each other to remove boundaries, room boundaries for information and ideas and even in longterm, um, contemplations of this, I've often thought that everything right, all of our communication is basically ones and Zeros. It's all information. It's all words and thoughts and videos and now you're getting into cryptocurrency now. Crypto currencies, essentially ones and Zeros. It's all digital. Everything is digital and the bottlenecks, if any bottlenecks are there at all. The bottlenecks are slowly but surely getting removed. This, the, the Bot, the blockades and the walls. I think we're going to probably experienced some sort of a level of immersive technology in our lifetimes that's going to change the way human beings communicate period. And that we're going to look back at this time like, Huh, I remember when we thought that like social media arguments where like the big deal. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:57:01       I um, I was a recent, I used to have more of like a techno Utopian view and it started to sort of change partially because of some of the Psi Phi I read [inaudible] and everything. But most recently, so like 15 years ago I read the Richard Came Oregon book altered carbon. Uh, and at the time I was like, this has to be made into something. That's the one that's on Netflix now. And then like a year ago, Joel Kinnaman was in the series and it was just awesome. And the series is quite good as yours is quite good. Yeah. And I really liked Joel Kinnaman and I, you know, Richard came Morgan, I interviewed who wrote the book years ago, but that genre started to move me away from techno utopianism and technology's just going to solve so many problems because it also is going to create new problems that we don't even yet know about.

Speaker 2:          01:57:52       So as an example, I went all the back, all the way back to the beginning when humans went from hunter gatherers and figured out we can domesticate some crops, we can start agriculture and settle and be in one place. That was the acceleration of what we know of as wealth ownership. What it was like the start, right. So much of what we had, I mean agriculture allowed people to be able to live and do stuff other than find food which developed specialists who created technology, which created armies like it all came from agriculture in that way, but tons of bad stuff came from it as well. Right. The beginning of the concept of a sedentary lifestyle came from agriculture diseases that we got from animals and then that we brought other places and they killed tons of people. So I've kind of adopted that view to technology, which is, yeah, all

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       the cool stuff we can imagine and improvements. I'm sure we'll be there, but problems we aren't even aware of yet are also going to be there. Yeah, I agree with you 100% that's what I meant by looking back at this social media problem. I think we're going to have a far more invasive problem. I think the, I think we're going to probably have some sort of a wearable thing that allows us to communicate through thoughts. Sure. Well thoughts would be a next step, but at minimum, I mean replacing, you don't need the screen on your phone. You have contacts that are connected to something and everything is just displayed. I mean there'll be steps, Jamie, whatever happened with that Microsoft thing that we were looking at. Remember when they had like the little mouse that was dancing in your hand or the elephant that was dancing in your hand?

Speaker 4:          01:59:20       That is a micro segmented. Yes. That wasn't available. It wasn't. My Microsoft has hollow Lens and they're on a Hololens to, but they've moved more towards like a, uh, commercial applications for it as opposed to like consumer availability. There are consumer availability, ar things coming out right now. They're what apple just showed up there. A WWDC event this month or actually on Monday is really cool. [inaudible] it's still just like watching a, through that phone though. They're not, I don't think anyone's made the device like a glasses type ar thing yet because the uh, field of view isn't right to haven't mastered that either. A projecting light into your eye, which is what magic leap does, are projecting onto the glass that you're then looking at, which is where I think hollow Lens and the other thing does that sort of figured it out yet. Beta Max versus VHS race to see who figures things. So yeah, but like the oculus quest, which is different just also just came out is really cool and there's so close, so much closer. There could be within a year or two or something good come out at the end of this year that hasn't been announced. We're very close. Question is like how much is that going to affect daily life, right. With augmented reality. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:00:30       Yeah. The other one that relates to that also is right now you at least can put your phone away. That's what happens when the line between the technology and the body is a bit about it. Um, I'm very concerned. I really am. I'm just a, I think we're giving up agency to something that has no feelings for us at all. Well, there's no, I mean I think the problems people have, uh, in practice often are different than the ones. I mean there's no transparency with a lot of the companies that are developing these technologies and setting up the algorithms and whatever. Um, there's really no transparency about what it is that's going on, what the end goals are, what the broader effects on society are going to be. Um, I know you've had Jonathan Heit on who was talked a lot about the disproportionate effect of social media on suicidality, particularly in young girls, relative to boys. Um, it's been years now that this stuff has been around and we're now kind of figuring that out. So it's inevitably we're behind always and figuring out what the effects are because you need time to measure it and that as things advance more and more quickly, whatever damage

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       is potentially going to be done will happen even faster.

Speaker 1:          02:01:42       Yes. Yeah. That's what the concern is, that we are always behind and that it's sneaking into our lives before we have any idea of how dangerous it is.

Speaker 2:          02:01:51       Sure. I mean, this happened with, you know, the food, the canned and processed food revolution of the fifties and sixties it was slower, but it was the same type of thing where all of these advancements and being able to make food last longer via how it was processed and stored. It all sounded awesome at a time when food would just go bad. Then we started learning about all that things that come with it. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          02:02:14       Yeah. Uh, anything more for rabbit up?

Speaker 2:          02:02:18       I think that's it. Oh, I w so two things I wanted to mention. One, when I announced that I was going to be on the show, companies started contacting me saying, we will give you money if you work hour, a name our product into the conversation. What's the product? I'm not going to say, but I do want to talk about car insurance briefly. Um, have you heard that that's happened to other guests?

Speaker 1:          02:02:39       No. You haven't? Interesting. That's interesting. Yeah. Wow. That's a weird, sneaky thing. Yeah. And no one's ever paid me to do that. No one's paid you. No, no, no one's ever paid me to uh, to have an like a, a conversation on a podcast. Oh. Um, but one company did want to advertise and they wanted their CEO to come on the podcast and discuss their product and I was like, give me like an infomercial. I was like, no. And they were like, well you've talked about people before that have had products before. I go, yeah. Because I liked their product and I think what they're doing is cool. Right. I is zero financial investment in their product. Right. Only did it because I like it.

Speaker 2:          02:03:23       Sure. Well, I mean, peep, my audience knows that we do sponsored stuff like adding whatever I disclose it. I'm clear and my approaches, I'm super upfront with my audience, which is listen me to only like half a percent of you are paying for a membership. The memberships are six bucks a month. I know like 80% of you can afford it. Only like half a percent are doing it. That's fine. I'm going to keep doing the show, but I'm going to put some sponsored content up. You don't have to watch it. I'm in a market as such period. And I feel like for the most part we have kind of an understanding of how it all,

Speaker 1:          02:03:54       there's nothing wrong with it as long as this products that you actually enjoy and again, that you maintain that transparency and honesty. There's nothing wrong with that. If I don't have that with the audience, I don't have anything. Right. And, and I, I've asked, been asked to compromise it. You hadn't? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. It's just flick. It would be worth so much, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:04:15       Yeah. I mean there's this moral hazard sort of situation that exists with insurance where the people who don't really need the insurance are the ones that the insurance companies want to insure. And the people that are more likely to use the insurance, the insurance companies are like, we're going to have to charge you six times as much type of thing. It's easier to get the sponsorship money from stuff that's less interesting or less aligned or whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       And I don't know. I mean, it's an ongoing battle. I don't talk to any of our advertisers. Like we have a team that handles all of that and that is great. Um, but they're, you know, there are still calls to make about like what is on this side of the line, what's on that side of the line. I tried to make the right calls. No, I think you're doing a great job. I appreciate your show. I appreciate your time. Thanks for coming down here and tell everybody where they can find you. D pacman on Pa k man on, I'm on Twitter at d pacman. I'm on. Where am I? I'm on Instagram at David Dot. Pacman and uh, my website, David pakman.com. Alright, thank you David. My pleasure. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 6:          02:05:16       Great.
