How the fuck are you? I don't have time. I don't have time for your fucking shit today. Yeah, I got people coming in town to see my dog. Right. So I got a bunch of Shit I have to do. You know, you know when you got family, the folk and family, Becky, we're having problems with your family baggy sched what movie? We have a Brabant with the family. Baggaged the Vegas fucking mafioso line ever. I'm not going to say, you know, cause I want to shit on the fucking writers. I'm like shit on people that I'm in this industry sort of. That was the laziest fucking writing ever. You see sort of a mob guy? Yeah. Nah, they're having family problems with the family back east. How Far East you're in La. Are you having problems with the family in Nevada and problems with the family baggy? Um, I'm in construction. Oh, it's not that movie. All right. Anyways, it's not the one, you think it was more recent and they evidentaly

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       From what I gathered from the writing was they were having problems with the family. Baggies, sorry, I'm going to kill this thing here. Um, anyways, you know, when you, when you got fucking relatives coming out, you know what the deal is? You got to fucking clean your house up. You know, you, you got to get all spiffy, go out and get a haircut of you, meet you shave it down, right. You're looking at, in my head how successful I'm doing. Well, right. You gotta track him to all these fucking spots. You got to try to impress people, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       Kinda hit me yesterday as I was, I was scampering you know, somebody don't do a lot scampering something. Usually a marsupial does up a tree, I believe, um, scamper around the house, just trying to fucking make it look like I, I don't live in a world of clutter. And at one point I'm just saying, I, you know, built, nobody gives a shit about you. Nobody is coming out to see you. Nobody gives a fuck what you're doing. It's all about your daughter. And I was like, I was just great. It's perfect. She's the headliner. I'm just hosting. Hey, how's everybody doing? You want a burger? Boom. Let's keep this show moving right along. Put the act. Y'All came here to seek my lovely daughter. That's all I got to do. All you have to do is host to show those to show. As long as she's cute, what she can help. As long as she smiles, when she can help, that's all she does is smile and laugh. She's the fucking greatest kid ever. I'll be fine. So there you go. Why am I trying to do all the dishes?

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       It was funny. All you really do, whenever you have company over, you have like that, the, that one fucking closet. You throw everything in or maybe one closet and every room you just take all of all of the clutter and you just throw it into the closet. Like for some reason as this pressure that your house has to look like, you know, like a show room at a furniture store. Like, we don't have any knickknacks, we are living a minimalist lifestyle. Everything is neat and is in order. Everything is in its proper place. Harmony is what you're experiencing here. We never fight is never a look crossword, um, day. He can't live up to it. So I just decided I got to a certain level of clean. I'm like, all right, well this is what it looks like. You know, what are you gonna do?

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       Oh God, I'm still nervous. Anyways. Um, let's get down to the fucking tax that are brass here. Um, oh boy. The city of Washington DC, the district of Columbia. Oh, their morning today. Jesus Christ. I actually went to a city Gab with Josh. He had a mys and um, this is how big a hockey fan I am. The Celtics were playing the wizard jested at game five. I thought it was game six. I got lost with all the sleep deprivation from all cutie cakes downstairs. Right. Um, and I actually, we went in the cigar bar and we were watching the game seven and in between periods we would click in to the Celtics. I know Bradley had a huge game. I know that the wizards went up like four to nothing and then that was it. We gave him the old right there, Fred and kept our foot on their neck.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       Right. So that was the biggest night in Washington d c sports perhaps ever. I had fun cause I woke up cause I was supposed to, um, yesterday I woke up early by Doodoodoo dude and I was supposed to call 'em a Regina, Saskatchewan, cause I'm going up there for some shows. Uh, I don't know where the fuck I'm going. I think I'm in Winnipeg. And then I'm driving all the way up to fucking Saskatoon, which is like an eight and a half hour drive and I'm doing it and everyone's like, Oh you don't go bug the toy. Good to put your farms. I don't give a shit. I'm going to have a great time. He and Nick Craig, we're going to go up, there's gotta be some sort of ice cream store of some fucking stupid tourist attraction along the way. And even if there isn't, who gives a shit?

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       I like driving that stuff. Seen it, that it exists. I did the drive one time from California to El Paso, Texas, and, uh, that's one of the great drives over dead, especially I believe, I don't know if it was in Arizona or New Mexico when you just get into the badlands. I always thought the badlands meant, you know, some Badass dudes live there and it's just bad as far as like, you can't grow anything that's like scorched earth. It's like basically the direction we're headed in. If we keep fucking, and I don't know if you believe Al Gore, I mean, I tend to believe a man who invented the Internet, you know, anyways. Um, so we're going to be doing that drive. And uh, so I had to call, cause they added, they added another show in Regina because who the fuck ever goes to Saskatchewan? You know, nobody.

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       So people are excited. Like, Holy Shit, this guy's not my favorite, but he fucking showed up. Let's go. Right. They and Brahms, we fear me baggies. So they added a second show. So now I gotta, I gotta put on my top hat and my tales and I gotta fucking sell it. So I'm waiting to call the radio. This is such a long story. So I'm thinking in my head right now, I'm like, wow, this is the biggest day in Washington DC sports history. I should call the fucking sports junkies. I'm going to do it. I called in, talked to larch and everybody yet, uh, I thought the capitals were going to win. I just thought how badly they beat the penguins in a, in game six. I just thought that they, uh, they was shutting down their offense, that the penguins were frustrated. You know, I knew the fucking flower they was going to have, was going to have a good game, but I just thought they just needed to break the seal.

Speaker 1:          00:07:11       They had to get that one, give him a little bit of happy feet, give him some to fucking think about it. So I called in there, then it called and Randy a Bauman and bill Crawford at wd DV. And uh, I wasn't a contact on either one of them. My team side of it. I'm not going to try to be a killjoy, you know, I, this is the deal. I actually, I don't know what happened. I used to hate the fucking penguins. I don't anymore. It's a combination that they don't really have any, like overtly cheap fucking knee breakers anymore. And I got a lot of friends that either live in Pittsburgh or you know, out here that are from them. Fucking pardon me. I can't root against partners. So I go to the cigar bar and I, uh, I'm watching it with fucking Josh, Adam Meyers, and he's just like, you know, I said, look, dude, I'm not going to lie to you.

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       I hope you go one in one. I want the Celtics to win and I'm going to root for the capitals. I'm sitting here with you. I'll fucking root for them, you know, secretly I'm like, well, if they don't win, I'm happy for fucking Randy Crawford and partner. Can those guys, what, what do I care? I'm, my fucking team's not in it. So we sit there and Josh is fucking losing his shit. And um, it was just unbelievable. You know, I call him the flower all the time. I forget his fucking name already. Mark Andre Flurry. What a fucking game he had. They just, Oh my God, fucking captive, just snake. But even when they had the guy beat, even when they had them fucking beat, they just couldn't get it on this day. They was wide open and kicked the fucking thing and I just couldn't do it. They couldn't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       But I have to say right now, game seven, NHL playoffs, I will put that up against any, uh, any sport out there. Um, the NHL playoffs, you know, and I actually, I actually totally missed the Edmonton ducks one because I had to go and I had to do a couple of shows and I thought I taped the game and I fucked up. I didn't someone have to go on the NHL app today and Rewatch that game knowing full well that the ducks won, which I had a feeling they were going to do. I just thought they had a little more experienced. They'd been there and that type of shit. So yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:14       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       the fucking Josh, Jesus Christ, he was just like, you know, by the end of it, he was just like, you know what, fuck this. He goes, I'm just going to stress, eat a fucking large pizza and I'm going to go home and watch cops. Um, I dunno, having said that, I still don't have confidence, you know, with the Celtics and the wizards I have, I have no idea. Like, uh, this is a weird series. Um, it kind of seems like the teams are gonna hold, serve, you know, and hopefully that happens and we'll win a game. Seven, I have no idea. But just watching like a DC sports fan, it reminds me I beat, I always have empathy for all of those people cause that was my life right up until basically 2004, I guess the Patriots had already won one at that point. But um, yeah, that was kind of my life as a sports fan for the longest fucking time. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:10:10       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       So my condolences to the city of Washington DC still got the wizard GNR out of it. Congratulations to Pittsburgh. Oh, this is going to kill me to say this. Congratulations to Anaheim. Whatever you are down there, whatever that is, Orange County, whatever the fuck that is down there. I don't even, I don't even, it's just one of the most soulless fucking places I've ever made me know what I'm judging the place. I always drive down there, you know, to do the Improv or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:10:44       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       bought me hockey stuff down there. They got fucking Disneyland's down there. It's just, I don't know what it is. It just looks like a giant movie set. It doesn't look like I'm, it's like when I went to San Jose and they had that little mall area where they had all that high end shit. They tried to make it look vaguely fucking, I dunno, European and you just like this. This was clearly all built at the same time and there's no history here. I don't know what happened cause I read a Steve Martin's book. I'm born standing up I the hardcover original version. I loaned it to my neighbor and I never got it back. What a fucking asshole. That's still bugs me that I did that. Um, but he was talking about how he grew up in Orange County and riding his bicycle to Disneyland past all the orange groves and just the way he painted the pictures, like, wow, that sounded like a beautiful place.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       And now you go down there and it's just, you know, one fucking strip mall after another. I mean, it was getting hold. I mean, human beings had done a lot of unpretty, you know, a lot of fucking lot unprotected sex since then. And uh, just kind of push the oranges out really bill, is that what happened? I mean, evidently, evidently as far as I can surmise. Um, anyway, so I did two shows last night, did a benefit at the laugh factory and I did a, and I did the all things comedy network show at, uh, the comedy store. And I had also done a show Monday night where I ran the whole hour and at the risk of sounding like a fucking bald, arrogant cont, uh, the new hour is crushing the man, a great time. Somewhere in the, during those Cleveland shows that put me over the top and now I have confidence that uh, people aren't going to feel like they're getting ripped off when they go to see me.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       So, um, anyways, I dunno, I got a bunch of fucking shit on my mind cause I got to go down to the fucking airport. I got to pick up some, I gotta pick up the fee and we babies. Um, oh by the way, my apology to a MotoGP fence. I didn't even know there was a race this past week and I went on to my, uh, my DVR or whatever the hell you call it. And low and behold, there it is, you know, and the way my whole laugh just watches whatever the hell she wants and now deletes it. I didn't feel like I had to include her now. Like she likes motorcycle racing or anything. So, um, I believe they were in spanked. I just sat there with my daughter and I watched all three races back to back the moto to the three in the fucking GP race and they will all fucking great races.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       You know, it's funny. At first I didn't like moto three with their little skinny bicycle tires. Now I'm fucking into it. All three of them were great races. The motto too, I think the model two was the one with the guy. The guy in the lead fucking just dumped the bike. He fucked up coming out of a turn. Um, and then the other guy was just up to him not to blow it. And uh, I don't know. I loved all of it and I'm just watching the, uh, the MotoGP race. All of a sudden it goes up towards, I got thousand CCS. Valentino Rossi, you haven't probably, Hey Nini, what's up? How are you? I'm flailing over here. I got like another 16 minutes to go and I'm so stressed and I gotta go to the fucking airport then I'm all, I'm all over the map.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       Um, Valentino Rossi, I was so weird watching everybody pass him. He had problems with like his tires. This is why this guy's this shit. He's been doing it for, he's been doing it for so fucking long. I even know who this guy is. And he came in 10th place and he's still in first place. That's pretty God damn impressive. This early into the season. And uh, I kind of became a fan of that. Yohan, Yohan Asarco I like the bike, all black and he just was fucking passing everybody. He ended up being, I don't know what he finished like fourth, maybe he's a French guy. I like the French, you know, I don't know, but I'm totally into it. I don't know any of the fucking names. I know mark my cares. Right. That's it. I'm looking at all these other, I've got 'em all a whole list here.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       I could pretend like I know these guys off the top of my head. I don't, I have no idea, but one of these guys are, but I will tell you, like, he, I mean if you think racing is boring, motorcycle racing is a good one to start with because, uh, you know, if you're not into racing, you want to see some crashes and uh, you know, motorcycle race exists. I mean literally the guy he just imagined with every fucking stock car race, every time there was an accident, the guy like flew out of the car.

Speaker 2:          00:15:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       I mean I'm not sitting there saying I want to see anybody get hurt. But I mean it is riveting.

Speaker 2:          00:15:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       It's just fast. Like first of all, the level of technology of the suit that they can be going like 150 miles an hour, lay the bike down. You know, they lean too far. They fucking hit their knee or some shit. I don't know what happens is I've done it. That handlebar hits the ground, there's so low and they causes the bike to slide out from underneath them and then they go in like whatever hundred 30 miles an hour, just slide in and dig pop right back up.

Speaker 2:          00:15:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       Cause the suits are made out of space. Age.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       You know, it was funny when I was, uh, when I had my brief motorcycle riding career out here in la before I smartened up and realized that, uh, I'm not a motorcycle guy. I am a fan, but I am. I just, I was riding scared and everybody's texting and something bad was gonna happen, man. Um, I, uh, I actually was going like trying to think of how to protect myself and I was thinking I was going to get either a Ducati or I was going to get that Harley, uh, that throwback seventies one. And uh, I was gonna buy one of those MotoGP suits. We'd probably gonna cost more than the bike. I thought it would be. Larry's just be riding a Harley wearing a GP suit. You look like he's supposed to dress like, you know, you used to be in a biker gang. There's something about being on a Harley. You have to wear like jeans. It's like not acceptable to have the leather on leather suit. Hello. Lovely. Hello handsome. What's going on? Another thing I was just going to say, you know what's even more boring than watching racing? You just, you just don't like it at all. Well, listening to you talk about racing, it's probably more boring.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       like four hours. It feels like there's a swarm of killer bees. That's what it sounds like does no. Like what, how, why you're just, we're waiting to watch the crash. Right. I was, I was hearing you from the kitchen. Did you like that's literally what you're at. Cause it's so fucking boring. Like that's the level to which like the boredom you feel when you watch it. Like you're waiting for an accident. Like that's all your mind goes with dark plays cause you're so bored. You're like what is this? Someone does like crash. No, no, no, no. It's boring. God it's boring. No, no I was, I was saying when you first sit down and watch it, that's what you're hoping for. Cause you don't understand what's going on. But when you, once you start on just hoping for that, nobody's hoping for it when they watch it. Is that why people watch what I'm saying? If you're not into it, that's why you would watch, she'd be like, well I'll see an accident. I mean nobody likes an accident.

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       Everybody like when they see somebody changing, a fucking tire will cause four lanes of, you know, traffic people going, oh is he the car gonna fall on his head. What's going on over there? Yeah. The rubbernecking, the most interesting part of the racing now that I've watched with you is when is it Lewis Hamilton? He's the champion. Right? He Know Nico Rosberg is the ferning champion, but his wife told him, well, now that you won the championship, it's time for you to pay attention to me. And he fucking retired. Or he was like, oh, I don't want to deal with Lewis again. And he just left. Hmm. Well, anyway, I'm here wasn't him that I stout his team mate and they were like, these two have it spoken at over six months. Yeah. It was like a whole days of thunder thing last year that the dead or the day.

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       Yeah. There's all of that stuff goes on. There's the pride of the country, the Ferrari's, the Mercedes, right. All of that shit. And then once you get into like the different tires, when to pit the strategy of it and all of that, it's amazing. And this year, um, the adjustments that they've made on the cars is way more passing. I'll tell you last year was it was a little boring where it's like, what was, it was a race to the first turn. Whoever got to their first just to held that position for the rest of the race because you couldn't pass them. Wow. Riveting. Well, listen, I'm going to go. All right. She's crying. She's crying. Go, go, go. I don't mean to trash your your interests. I just thought it'd be funny to come in. You don't find it interesting with them what those motorcycles go on that fast like the balls at that takes the fucking balls.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       I don't, I don't find it interesting. No doubt balls, but not interesting. All right, so you'd rather watch a bunch of balloon tinted horse screaming at each other. Yeah, near and Renee Hill. Everybody. There you go. And that's why that's there. Right there. That is the fissure in our relationship. That's the fault line right now. You know what? At some point we're going to talk about the fact that you spend like hours watching people fight each other on Worldstar and all these other kind of websites. But then you want to come at me because I watch real housewives and people are arguing. Well, they never get to the fight every time they've already to fight a cameraman breaks it up. If those women would beat the shit out of each other, I'd watch it. If you just sit there and say mean shit to one another. Well somebody dabs at the rise with tissues.

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       It still bugs me to this day that that white woman spitting fucking Miss New York's face and they owed it to her. They owed it to her to give her a couple of fucking swings. Oh, the way she did the about face, like that was the end of it. After she spit in somebody's face. True. They should, uh, let her beat her ass. Oh, there you go. That's why I don't like reality TV pop off all of them. Like she down there just, it drives me nuts. It's like you order to ignore reality TV is, it's just like fucking, it's like blue balls the whole time he comes to fight, he comes to fight, they're starting to swing. I bring it up, break it up, break it up. The tension just keeps building and it never happens. It's like, you know when there's a big fucking UFC fight coming up, right?

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       Imagine if they just kept running the promo and Joe Rogan just kept getting more and more amped up about how great the fight was going to be and then it never happened. Right. As they went to fight, Dana white comes out, hey, there'll be enough of that. That'll be enough for that. And then you had to deal with the two fighters fucking talking to the camera. I just felt like for me, I wanted to have a fight to decide it, but you know, for me, all right, I'm sorry. Let's, let's read a little bit at that stead is the number one fucking expression in reality TV. I know I say it all the time, nineties feeling for me.

Speaker 4:          00:21:57       For me. I just feel like for me, that for me, I need to like, I need to just do that, but I am not doing it for her. I'm doing it for me.

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       Um, all right. Let's, uh, let's do a little bit of the, uh, the reads here for the week. All right. Give me Luke. Craig. Everybody on a quest for epic gear.

Speaker 1:          00:35:30       yes. Got me in trouble with fiance's family. Uh, hey there. Billary Brrrum Clinton. I'm I fucked up man. As you can probably guess from the subject line cue the o g a m as a little background, I'm getting married next month to my fiance who was wonderful love of my life and all that. We were visiting her family last night and playing board games, which we often do. Oh Jesus. [inaudible] what happened? We had drinking. Did you get competitive? Huh? She accused her mom of cheating. Uh, he goes, I'll spare you the details, but we were playing a card game with a bunch of characters. Everyone gets the same people, but when you use them is really the key to the game. There was a particularly powerful card I had held onto until the very last stage of the game. The character's name was granny Wada,

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       um,

Speaker 1:          00:36:29       pronounced Gary water. I gave you the pronunciation and accent so you wouldn't fuck it up. Well, it is spelled w a t a granny. Ah, it's the last round of the game and everyone's going around revealing their card. I was last and my plan had worked perfectly as I went to reveal it, my inner bill bird took over and I really got excited. I flipped it over. Oh, you did it? He goes, oh no. Oh No. He goes, I said, it's granny fucking

Speaker 5:          00:37:03       whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       Don't you drop the F pub? Oh my God, I wish I had podcast tee shirts. I'd send one to you.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       No, you did. He goes, silence followed as an echo through the house. My fiance's family were stunned. They're not super uptight people, but people just don't, just don't throw fucks around during a board game. You know? From there it only got worse. My fiance is listen to your podcast, so she knows I was imitating you. She tried to stammer out an explanation. Oh No. She had to explain away your behavior.

Speaker 3:          00:37:45       Ah, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       He goes, but it didn't really do anything. I also tried to apologize sheepishly. Then on top of that, that move gave me enough points to win the game over everyone, so I had to awkwardly mark my score, which made me the winner.

Speaker 3:          00:38:04       Wow, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       When you're getting married next month, so the fucking taste of this is still going to be in their mouth. He goes, we left almost immediately after, and of course I got yelled at all the way home. I knew I deserved it, so I didn't even put up much of a fight. That's your first good move in this story. Oh Wow. He goes, my question is do I try and go out of my way to remedy the situation or do I just hope everyone forgets about it and moves on? We're getting married in six weeks, so it's not like I can avoid them for very long. I'm pissed because I fucking crushed the impression too.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Sorry for the Hillary Clinton reference in the open or I think she's a cunt to a, I don't think she's a contractor. Just don't think she's an honest person. And I don't think just because of the fact that we've never had a woman president that that's reason enough to elect someone is dishonest and as phony as her. Um, anyways, though, you know what? I would, I would actually, uh, without your wife. I would just drive over there and just say, listen, I got to apologize. I listened to this podcast. I'm a big fan of the guy. Um, I was making a joke and in the moment I didn't realize that you guys didn't listen to the podcast if you want. And just Cav a cue up a clip where you have it, which might be a bad thing to do, but like just have me like save something else. Dr cabbies, easy shave butter, but any might be fuck cause I don't say fuck,

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       um, [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       just say, just tell him you're really embarrassed or whatever. I think if you went over there by yourself, I think a, especially her dad, because I think that's the big one there. I think there's, there's something extra when it's, you know, it's always extra,

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       you know, when, when you're getting married like a, you know, if you're a guy, you know, the, the, the dad's going to be looking at you twice as hard and the moms can be like, oh, he's, no, it's relaxed, you know. And then the other way around is if you know they have a son and he brings a woman around, like the mother's going to be fucking looking at her to see if she's a fucking, you know, and evil little whore. You know, the dad's going to be looking at you like, is this guy going to be overbearing and slap my fucking daughter around or whatever. You know what I mean? I see a piece of shit, right. Um, oh my God, dude. Wow. You said it's granny fucking water. Oh God. Dude, if you film that, oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:40:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       Jesus Christ. Dude, I got to give, I got it. My tip of the cap for you there, man, for doing that. Holy Shit. I'm getting uncomfortable just thinking about that. Well, can I, I'll apologize. Can I apologize to your fiance for being a bad fucking a

Speaker 2:          00:41:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       A bad, um, influence. Hey, you know what? Play this to a, play this to your year, your future in-laws. Dear future in laws. Hello, I'm bill burr. I'm the one who says granny defin. I say this type of stuff. I have been the bad influence. Don't be mad at him. I'm sure he's a wonderful human being. I'm sorry you missed up. He messed up your little cad game there. Um, yeah, he's gonna make a great son in law. You know why? Cause he uses Dr cabbies easy. Shane don't play that to them. That's not going to get yet anything. Just can say he listens to morons. He must be a moron. Are they going to have half a moron?

Speaker 6:          00:41:46       [inaudible] be like walking up. [inaudible] it's gone.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       It's still bar and a, this is not the Monday morning podcast. This is the replacement for the podcasts that I fucking made yesterday. That uh, oh and I completed this. I already tried to fucking do this and I just been talking for fucking 20 minutes and I looked down and I wasn't recording. So this is actually the third fucking time I'm trying to do this. So I'm going to get right to the point on what the fuck is going on in my life right now. Uh, kind of like, you know, when you break your arm or the first time you tell the story, you got every fucking detail, right? Then the next time you tell it there's a little less detail and then by the fifth time you just pissed and you want to smash your cast over the fucking person who asked you, how'd you break your arm dude?

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       Y'All do? What'd you do that for? Did it hurt? All right, this is what happened. I recorded a podcast on Monday. All right. And um, I was actually really excited because somebody sent me this really cool MP3 that they had made where it was an amalgam of, uh, all the podcasts I'd done in the background, you know, in the past. I mean, you know, just made this really cool like 92nd thing. So I was like, you know, that's awesome. This is going to be a great new thing that I can add to the podcast. Right. Start it off with my little 16 year old chick flip flown, you know, cell phone, those awful podcasts. And I bought the Olympus ls 10. Then I got a mixer and a microphone, you know, and you guys are probably sitting there going, how the fuck can he take this to, to an even higher level.

Speaker 1:          00:44:17       There's no way. And I was about ready to go. Like, yeah, there is a way you mother fuckers, I'm going to fucking have MP3 of the week and start having people send me in these mp3s and I fucking put it into garage. I edited the whole thing in and I turned it into a fucking MP three. And for some reason g cast is not taking it. I don't know what's going on, but uh, you know, I'm sure it's me, so always ends up being me. So I'm going to figure out how to do that. And uh, in the meantime, I will tell you a quick story. This is only going to be like a 20 minute podcast, um, of what I'm dealing with to my life right now. I, uh, I got a dog, I'm just pausing right now waiting for all the animal lovers out there to stop going.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       Oh my God. So that's, could it be so good for him? That keys can be so good for him? Um, yeah, it has been good. Um, except for, you know, a number of things. Uh, one I didn't pick out the dog, I was on the road. This is a typical female thing, you know, her heart was in a good place. She's like, you know, he wants to get a dog. He just doesn't know how to do it cause he wasn't hugged or loved as a child. So I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go, I go get a little fuzzy. Why's he dog? And I'm just going to have it here and I'm going to surprise or whatever the fuck she was thinking. Right. So basically I'm on the road and it's typical how women do shit like this. Okay. I don't know what they call it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:46       Like a, you know, a finagling manipulation, whatever the, it's whatever the euphemism is. It's, they lie to you, you know, and they tell you in bits and pieces, what the fuck is really going on? This is, this is how she did it. She left a message and she said, hey honey, it's knee. Um, I did something and it involves both of us. Um, but don't worry, I think you're gonna like it actually. You're gonna love it. You're gonna love it. Just call me. I'll tell you what it is. Okay. By click right. Call her up. And she says, listen, a friend of a friend of mine has a dog and she needs us to watch it for a week. And I was like, perfect. That is awesome. I'm a commitment phobe one week, you know, that works perfectly for me. So, uh, I go, yeah, fuck it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:33       Let's get it right. And she goes, great. Awesome. Great to only be here for a week, you know, I'm like, cool. Next phone call. Yeah. So anyways, I got the dog. She's so cute. Above, above, above, uh, yeah. And we keep it for a week and at the end of the week, if we want to keep it, we can have it. And if not, they take it to a shelter and it gets put down. And I'm like, what? What? Wait, wait, what? You just got us a dog, right? She got a rescue dog. The exact thing I've been making fun of in my act that the joke I did on Conan that got me all that mail from all the dog lovers. And uh, not only that, it's a pit bull. Isn't that great? Huh? I'm just waiting for it to be like, dude, what do you, how do you fucking mind?

Speaker 1:          00:47:17       He already fuck them out. Fucking two hoes fucking dogs to, I'm trying to fuck a loyal dude, but I'm telling you one day you look the other way. They did. They just fucking snap too. One time I heard about this guy, there was this guy, right? [inaudible]. There was this guy and he got a pit bull, right? There was this guy and he had a pit bull shut up. So anyways, we've got this fucking pit bull and evidently they found it down by the La River and a, yeah, it's a fucking awesome dog. I can't even, I can't even lie to you. It's a fucking great dog. It's a scary looking dog. I'm not gonna lie to you. It looks like it wasn't by the La River was more by the fucking river. Haiti's it's definitely looks like a hell hound, but it is a fucking sweetheart. And uh, you know, by the second day, I love the thing. I'm like, fuck this. We're keeping it. I loved it. I walk it down the street, people cross the street. It's great. It's fucking great. So Kevin, a gun that, that you can pet.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       It's a fucking awesome dog. And uh, you know, I've had other dogs have charged it. It hasn't freaked out yet. You know, it's gonna Freak out to fucking time. Bomb them out of my mind. I should give this dog back. I'm out of my fucking mind. This, you just know there's a lawsuit at the end of this. The only way it ends with a pit bull. It ends with a lawsuit in a missing limb in a second cousin that never talks to you again. And the only time you see him is when he drives down the street and his fucking customer, El Camino that he bought with the 50 grand you gave him and he gives you the finger. He takes his one arm off the steering wheel, gives you the fucking finger and continues on down the street and his lime green fucking Elderado. Um, anyways, so this dog is this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       I love having an around. I fucking love this dog. She's awesome and I want to keep it, but this is the problem. Um, when we leave, it fucks up the apartment or it has twice. It scratched the door and it's scratched something else in the back. And it's like, dude, I don't own this place. Okay, I have a deposit. Do you understand that? And one day the landlord's going to come over to me and be like, what the fuck is that? And then I'm going to point at you and you don't have a wallet. And not only do you not have a wallet, you don't have, you don't have money, you don't have any money. All right? You dumb fuck. Which means it's coming out of my deposit. Okay. And that's what I've dealt with on the last week is literally watching my deposit slowly disappearing. You know, you ever been up like two grand playing blackjack, you know, and you just sit in there like it's never gonna end, you know, and your buddies like dope, dope.

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       We'll walk away dude. I'm telling you kick you up to a grandkid walkway, do sweet money. It's free money. Right. And he keep fucking sitting there and the horrors coming over there with the whiskey and you keep drinking. Right. Then some vacuum cleaner salesman sits down and starts hitting on 17 and you start doing that dumb shit going dude, that was my car. Cause you guys taken all my cards. You know like if that fuck wasn't there, you would continue to when you wouldn't. All right do the fucking math. How do you think they keep the lights on all day long with the air conditioning on and the fucking doors open in the middle of the desert and they still can afford to do it. Cause dumb fucks. Like you sit there and the longer you sit there, it's simple fucking math dude. I got it. System.

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       Um, so anyways, so I was like, listen, I have, we, I'll, I'll keep the dog, but we gotta put this thing in a fucking cage when we go to leave. Okay. So I go over to Petco. Okay. And um, I didn't want to go there. There was a local pet store. You know me, I want to go to the mom and pop store, but my girls just like, oh, it's right around the corner. Everywhere I work. Yeah, they got all this, you know, they start doing that shit and you just feel all the fucking, you literally feel the fucking energy draining out of your legs. You just like, all right, we'll go where you want to go. Right. And then they do this shit. Well, she said, if you don't want to go there, we're good. No, forget it. We'll go there. I don't know why you have to get mad.

Speaker 1:          00:51:36       I'm like, well, if you just fucking, why do you ask me where I want to go? If you already know where we want to go and you were going to go there anyways. Why do you put me through that fucking test? It's like fucking verbal waterboarding. It's brutal. So anyways, so we go over to fucking PETCO and it's a typical corporation. It's 90,000 square feet and they got two people on the floor. All right. And there's literally like, people are gathered around the one person with the fucking apron that's the same color as the sign outside. So you like, obviously they work here cause they have a fucking apron that matches. It's the same color. Blue is the fucking sign. And there's literally people gathered around this person, like they're famous, like they're waiting for an autograph when the reality is is they're trying to find a fucking flea collar and this fucking Goddamn mega church that they have for fucking dogs, right?

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       Jesus Christ. I almost fucking spun out of control with all the references here anyways, and we plow ahead here. Was that even remotely funny? Anyways, let's go. So anyways, get to the point bill. So I'm fucking, they said the guy's like, all right, I go, listen, I need I gotta I gotta I got a fucking pit bull. Evidently it's a pit bull mixed, but I think it's mixed with another pit bull cause it fucking looks like a pit bull to me. The guy's like, hey sir, don't worry, I'm gonna, I'm going to be over there just about 10 minutes. Don't worry about it. So I say fine. And I stand over there for about seven minutes and I'm like, you know what? This dude's not fucking showing up. He's not fucking showing up. So I just grabbed the biggest fucking cage I can find cause I want it to be nice and Roomy, you know, be a responsible pet owner.

Speaker 1:          00:53:10       I don't want to be cruel. I don't wanna act like a fucking puppy mill. You know, fuck a thing's huge. You could fit a fucking Jacuzzi in the corner. All right, it's a big cage. So I bring the thing home, air dam. Lo and behold, a buddy of mine calls me up, says, tells me he's got a Gig back east for the whole summer directing a bunch of actors and some bullshit. So He's, he's having a Gig and he wants me to come by and say goodbye. So I say, absolutely. My girl's not around. So I go, I fucking stick the dog in the cage. All right? And I feel awful. The dog standing there shaking like a leaf. I literally get the thing to go in the cage. It's facing the back of the cage and it's not moving. It's just standing there shaking like you know, like it knows a fucking earthquake is coming or something.

Speaker 1:          00:53:55       Okay. So I'm sitting there trying to convey to the dog like, dude, I know you scared right now. You know, I know you were abandoned, but I'm not going to abandon you. Do you understand? You're just fucking up my apartment and I can't have that. So how do you say that? And how do, how would the dog whisper convey that? You know, I don't know how to do it. All right dude. Um, I'm coming back. Notice I'm leaving and I'm not bringing you with me in the cage. I could see if I was doing that. I could see then you've fucking do it. Just stop shaking it right. You know that if you feel awful, stop, please, please stop shaking. So I leave, I go to the party in the party for two fucking hours. All I can think about as a goddamn dog being scared in the cage and it's killing me.

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       It's ripping my heart out. So I'm following. It's like, dude, I got to get out of here. I got this dog. I can't, I can't fucking leave it alone. It's killing me. So I fucking drive back and I'm taking all this dogs and be self psych to see me. You know, that's the best thing when you come home, when you have a dog, the dog is fucking psych to see it, right? So I come home and I opened the door and who's fucking sitting on the other side of the door is the God damn dog just sitting there wagging its tail, thumping it on the floor, you know, completely, you know, normal look on his face like, hey bill, what's going on? You want an egg? You know, stick it about making a lake breakfast. What'd you get into tonight? Height. And you get some pussy.

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       What's going on with you and you? I've just fucking regular and I'm looking at the dog like, did I dream that I did? I not put you in a fucking cage. The fuck is, you know what the fuck is going on here? Right. So I walk out to the kitchen and I don't know how to describe this without pictures. The only way I can describe it is it looked like the cage got raped and then thrown in front of a locomotive. The fuck was like, it was lopsided. It was, there was a big chunk taken out of the side. And then there was these all this blood on the floor. And um, I was beside myself. I was, I couldn't believe it. And I, I want to say that the cage door was still closed. She just, she just fucked this thing up. And now I'm sitting there freaking out going, oh my God, she hurt herself.

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       There's blood all over the goddamn floor, the amount of blood on the floor. I would have thought that she'd be laying there unconscious. And she just sitting there looking at me wagon, his fucking tail on the Goddamn linoleum now. So I, you know, I'm looking at its mouth and there's nothing in there. There's a little bit, it's like one of the fucking x-men. What's that extra. And you know, you, you cut it and just automatically heals. That's what it looks like. It's just completely fine. So I didn't, I don't know. I was like, I was like half. Yeah, I was definitely bummed cause I was out a couple hundred bucks, especially with all the fucking fuzzy, let's make this cage a home shit that I bought to put in it, but a part of me respected it. I was like, God damn, this is a fucking dog, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       And uh, I was like, all right. Evidently I bought the wrong fucking cage. So Jesus Christ, I don't even know any more than fucking two days later. Right. I haven't left the house. We haven't left the house and left her alone. We keep bringing her in the, in the Goddamn car. And that's another thing. Bring in the car. She fucking stands there. She shaking like, Oh fuck. What did I do this time, man? I'm getting a bandaid again with the fuck man. You know, we're like, dude, we're not abandoning you. We just fucking relax and stick your face out the fucking window. Like a regular dog. Jesus Christ you, you know, you're making me nervous, you know? So finally we're like, look, we need to have a life. Okay. You know, I have to go out and do stand up. You have to be able to go work.

Speaker 1:          00:57:47       I have to have, you know, we got to get another cage. So I finally go to Petco again and I find one of those douchebags with the Blue Apron or whatever and I go listen to actually brought the dog. I'm like, this is what I have. This is what I bought and this is what the fuck it did to it. Do you have anything to help me? Okay. The guys are like, yeah, no problem. No problem. A, it was all dealt well that we get one of those wire cages and we'll get it a muzzle. Cause that was a big thing with me. I was like, I don't want the dog to get hurt trying to get out of the cage. I want a cage that can't break out of and I want to leave the dog in a situation where it can't get hurt. So it gives me, it gives me this muscle to put on the dog where can still drink, relax you fucking animal on loving jackasses. It can still drink. Okay. It could vomit if it had to. So it's not going to die like John Bonam, you know, a lot of people don't know that. Not only did he have 32 shots of vodka, he, they actually found him slumped over in a doggy cage. All right. Um, face down in a fucking water dish.

Speaker 3:          00:58:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       All right. I can't believe I just said that about one of the guys I love the most anyways. Um, so we get all the shit. I get the fucking cage. All right. And this time we're doing like dog whisperer shit. So literally an hour last night we work with this doc. We walked the dog by the cage, we walked it back past the cage, you know, and it's freaking out looking at the cage and the cage has two doors. So I got my girls got both doors open so she's got half a body in the cage going can make Cleo comedically. Oh good girl. And she would sort of come close to the cage and put her head down and wouldn't go in it. And then we'd walk away and we just over and over and over and then one half hour into it, nothing but positive reinforcement.

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       All of a sudden it was like magic. It's like a fucking afterschool special. She just crawled, walked, you know, like a little fucking marine trying to go underneath barbwire, went into the cage and we will like that's a good girl, we will pet in it. And you know, my girl rubbed its head till it fell asleep a little bit and then when it got up and wanted to get out of the cage, we let it get out of the cage just so it had that vibe, you know, like this is your home, this is, you're not being punished.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       So then we do that exercise a number of times. Another five, six, seven fucking times. Kept walking into the cage, praising it, telling it was a good girl scratching it. And then when I wanted to get out of the cage, we let it out of the cage right down the fucking dog whispering numbers on how to do this shit. So the end of the night comes, we slide this big mother fucking cage. Okay. Um, at the foot of the bed, she likes to sleep on the foot of the bed. We take the two pillows that she likes to sleep on, we put them in the cage, we put her in there and uh, and we closed the cage and she's sitting there and uh, we caught out the lights and then she just, she whined sort of panted in wine for like two hours. Just gone.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       Just like that. I couldn't believe we didn't pass out. That's how quickly he was breathing. Literally. Is that annoying to listen to if you're on a plane right now? That's what the fuck that thing did for two hours to the point. I was like, Jesus Christ in here. Let's just let the thing out of the fucking cage. And she's like, no. If we do that, then it's gonna learn that that's all it has to do is that annoying sound, which I won't do again to fucking make you guys fucking teeth hurt, you know? So anyways, she finally ends up going to sleep. We go to sleep the next morning, she wakes up, we let her out of the cage, he's all excited. And I've been doing what I've been doing with this dog. I fucking run it up a god Damn Mountain and I've run it right back down.

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       You know, fucking thing is all muscle. It's the shit, right? Fucking dog is awesome. Um, so anyways, no roids either. This is all natural. So anyways, so today I get up and uh, my beautiful girls got to go to work and I had a meeting, you know, trying to come up with a show idea, trying to get a show on the air, trying to come up with a better idea so it won't get squashed like a bug, like a, my last fucking idea did right at the last second when I thought I was home free, you know, gliding along free as a bird than smash right into fucking windshield. That's what I have my last idea. But we, that's a whole nother podcast. We won't get into that shit. So anyways, we uh, bring the dog, the cage. She's definitely don't put the muzzle on it so it won't hurt itself if it tries to get out, which we know it's going to try to, I put it's water in there.

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       We close the door, we tell it to just tell her she's a good girl and a, we saw it, you know, I went out did, you know, had my breakfast out in the kitchen and I kind of peaked in the bedroom and it was laying down. The muzzle on thing was totally cool and I thought, I thought everything's great. This is awesome. We have our lives back. You know, I like to, I gotta be able to do stand up and I like to play drums in that type of shit. I like doing that shit during the day when I fucking can't stare at the walls anymore. So a off we go into the wild blue yonder, I dropped my girl off at work, I go and I, you know, hanging out with this other comic, we're trying to come up with the TV show idea and I actually brought my shit along with me cause I'm feeling free.

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       I can go play drums. The dog is cool. And I was actually thinking halfway through, right? Just like when I was at the parties like, Oh man, I gotta get home, man. I feel bad. The dogs in the cage. I fucking love that dog. I fucking love that dog. I got to let the dog out of the cage. I'll hang out. You know, I'll play some guitar and stead right then I'll watch the Bruins. Hopefully beat the fucking hurricanes tonight and game six, right? That's, that was my game plan. And uh, so I come home like this dogs and be so fucking psyched on it, you know, and I show up, let it out of the cage. It's going to be flipping out, jumping all around. It's awesome. It's awesome. When you come home and you got a dog, right? So I come home, I open the back door and then we had this other doors, got this big glass window and I go to put the key in and I looked down and who the fuck is sitting there? Right on the other side of the door just sitting there wagging its tail.

Speaker 1:          01:04:01       The fucking Goddamn Cleo. And I'm looking at the dog going, are you fucking shitting me? And I look at its face. It's got a little bit of dried blood on its muzzle and right by its eye and it's happy as shit. It doesn't give a fuck. It's just wagging his tail. Hey Bill, how was your meeting? You know, did you come up with any ideas? You know, don't give up man. I'm telling you, you're going to get a TV show idea. You want to go for a jog, right? And I'm sitting here looking at this fucking thing like, dude, you gotta be shitting me. You got to be fucking kidding me. And I walk into the bedroom and here is this fucking cage that this Douche bag down at Petco said I would be fine. Oh by the way, the fucking thing still has the muzzle, but it's off.

Speaker 1:          01:04:49       It got it off and it's hanging down around its fucking neck. Like a Bandanna, like some douchebag in prince's band way back in the day. Remember that guy who played the fucking guitar keyboard? The guy in the revolution, prince and the revolution, right? That's the way the muzzle is. All I needed to be was like some sort of fucking neon leopard print and that thing was good to go. Right. So I come walking in and I can't even describe to you how fucked up this cage was. And there was blood all over the fucking floor. And once again, I'm checking her mouth. I'm checking her paws. There are areas where there's sort of dried blood on her fur, but she's not bleeding. This dog is, is not from this planet, but this cage is, and you know, I took a fucking picture of it. I should put it up on my, on my myspace page.

Speaker 1:          01:05:43       This, yeah. I don't know what it did. I don't know if it just fucking started jumping up and down and slam it into the sides of it. But this, I'm looking at it right now. I can't, there's like metal is just twisted around. It's, it's wreckage. That's what the fuck I have. It looks like the rest of the cage is fine. It looks like this. The front of the cage had a front end fucking collision with another car. I, so I don't know what I'm going to do. People I have, I have a situation because you know I'm all for rescue on a dog, but I didn't sign up for this shit and I've blown over $300 in cages and I've used both of them once and this dog fucks him up. And you know, I'm telling you, you can't talk to animal lovers because they're fucking crazy because they will tell you anything just to get you to keep the fucking dog, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:06:43       Oh it's just because it's scared. It's scared that it's going to be abandoned. You have to build up the trust and it's like, you know, that's not my fucking problem. I want to keep this dot. But what the, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Okay, so there's my a, this isn't a podcast, this is just me telling you why. Well, I guess this has no reason to do why there was no podcast. There's no podcast. Cause I couldn't figure out how to go from garage band to g cast and make it work. So if you can help me with that. And if somebody out there has rescued a fucking pit bull and has gone through this shit and they somehow figured out how to get the dog to, to be cool in a cage because, uh, not only is it cost me a lot of money, this dog is injuring itself and it's fucking killing me.

Speaker 1:          01:07:33       So if you can help me out, I would appreciate it. Uh, and that is it. That is, this is a very special Monday morning podcast done on a Tuesday. I actually have a cause. Okay. Oh, by the way, if you've got any new mp3s or any type of shit that you want to send me, uh, you know, go ahead and send them. I don't know. You know what? Don't send it to me yet. Just wait til I get my first one up there that I understand how to fucking know. If you know how to do it, please let me know. That is it. I hope all you guys have a good week and hope I have some good news for the next week. All right, dude. Bye Daddy. Say, dude. All right. And you'll see what I mean beside myself.

Speaker 6:          01:08:11       Alright, bye [inaudible].
