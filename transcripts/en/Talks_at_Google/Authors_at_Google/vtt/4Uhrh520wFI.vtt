MONICA WALSH: Today, the
Talks at Google series

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.530
is featuring author Marcy
Madden and her wife, Jeanette.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.450
Scottie Jeanette Madden.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.050
And Marcy recently
wrote a book called

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.890
"Just Because My
Husband Is a Woman,"

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.910
and it's receiving five
star ratings on Amazon.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.920
I'm really looking
forward to her telling us

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.159
her story, her
side of the story.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.600
So I'm going to tell you
a little bit about Marcy

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.130
and Scottie before
they come up on stage.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.020
For those of you that
are here in the room,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.440
we've got free books.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.560
So if you're nearby,
and you want to come,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.730
please make your way over.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.560
We've got at least 50 copies.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.650
And ping me afterwards
if you want extra.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.460
If you want some, we'll
send you the extra.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.850
Marcy and Scottie
are co-founders

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.000
of Zuzubean Press, an
independent publishing

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.360
company dedicated to
creating a safer, more loving

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.250
world for LGBTQIA plus
people and their families.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.310
They've been married
for over 28 years.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.540
I've known them for about
20 plus of those years.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.650
And each has a rich and varied
background as business owners

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.120
and also in the
production and TV world.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.570
First, Marcy.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.860
Marcy went from managing several
psychiatric offices in Marin

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.890
and also has owned several
production companies.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.040
She's been a director,
producer, voiceover talent,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.470
and wildlife rehabilitator.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.550
And now she's an author.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.820
Her new book was
released on October 11,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.140
and it's entitled, "Just
Because My Husband Is a Woman,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.750
Marcy's Side of the Story."

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.210
Scottie, who was just at Google
last year giving her talk,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.560
has served in several capacities
as well in the TV and film

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.520
industry.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.410
He's been a director--

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.949
she has been a director,
a screenwriter,

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.220
and adventure documentary
reality show runner.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.680
More recently, Scottie has added
speaker and author to her bio.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.850
Her memoir, "Getting Back
to Me, From Girl to Boy

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.630
to Woman in Just 50 Years" is
on Amazon's LGBTQ biography best

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.720
seller list and
is in the process

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.470
of being made into a TV series.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.920
Marcy and Scottie share
intimate and pertinent stories

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.120
about their real life experience
transitioning together.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.130
Their story is both
vulnerable and prescient

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.410
in our current times.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.220
Like I said, I've known Marcy
and Scottie for over 20 years,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.680
and it's a great
privilege and pleasure

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.740
to bring them to the
Talks at Google series.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.640
And so I'd like to welcome first
up, Scottie Jeanette Madden.

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.690
SCOTTIE JEANETTE MADDEN:
Thank you, Monica.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.410
I'm out here to kind of set
a little bit of context.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.120
I'm the husband that
Marcy spoke about.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.920
What's important for you to know
is that for about three years

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.440
solid, every morning, I would
wake up at about 4:00 AM,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.010
and I would pray
to God for Marcy.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.610
And Marcy came.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.110
I wasn't praying
for her by name.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.870
[LAUGHS] But I knew in the
deepest fiber of my being

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.050
that Marcy was out
there, and I just wanted

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.490
God to finally bring her to me.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.210
I knew it as truly as I
knew it that I was a woman.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.240
I knew that despite what
my body was telling me,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.140
what everybody else in
my life was telling me,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.470
that I was a woman.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.710
I also knew that
Marcy was out there.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.540
So when Marcy says
just because, the story

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.180
goes a little bit
deeper than that.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.190
I'm so proud of her that
she wrote this book.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.260
But even more, what
I'm happy about

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.530
is for you all to know now
what I've always known,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.960
and that's how amazing Marcy is.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.940
So I'll let her
tell you the rest.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.960
MARCY MADDEN:
Thank you, my love.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.350
Thank you, Monica, so much.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.380
It really is a
pleasure to be here.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.020
Being here with
Scottie's book last year,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.270
I had no idea that I
[LAUGHS] would write a book.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.550
And I guess I should
tell you that it's

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.040
obvious because of
what Scottie just said

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.130
and the title of my
book that there's not

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.130
going to be a big aha ending
at the end of the talk.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.440
You have that up front.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.830
So the point of what
I want to be here

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.610
for today is to tell
you the part that

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.940
comes after the ellipses,
"Just Because My Husband's

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.600
a Woman," dot-dot-dot,
"Marcy's Side of the Story."

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.010
And just a little bit
of a warning here.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.620
I don't know if any
of you have ever

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.630
thought that you might
want to write a book.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.890
I think it's kind of a romantic
idea that a lot of us share.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.310
I certainly did.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.240
But my problem was I
thought I would never

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.350
have a subject matter.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.060
So this is a warning to be
careful what you wish for.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.140
So yes.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.550
My spouse, Scottie,
is transgender.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.700
We've been married
almost 29 years.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.020
20 of those years,
I thought I was

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.440
married to my husband, Scott.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.120
Then one morning, Scottie
came with coffee early

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.290
and blurted out the words
that she was a woman.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.230
This was 20 years
into our marriage,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.120
and it wasn't planned.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.880
It was just as if her emotions
and her mouth took over.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.320
It was not something that she
ever really expected to reveal,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.700
and she really thought that
she'd be going to her grave

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.480
with this secret.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.720
Nowadays, we hear transgender,
that word, quite a bit.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.520
It's been in the media a lot.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.670
We're very familiar with it.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.020
It was not that
familiar a word to me,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.890
especially in my early
years, but more people

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.470
have stepped out of the
darkness of their feelings

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.110
and their sadness and are
coming forward and speaking up.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.000
Of course we still
really have a long way

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.940
to go to find acceptance.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.620
Because we can sense that, I
think, in the political arena.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.710
Although after the
elections from last night

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.880
and the results, I think we've
got some positive movement

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.640
forward again in
that arena, too.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.600
So Scottie wrote her
book about coming out,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.160
and we don't really hear
much about what goes on

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.460
when a person is married, and
what happens to the spouse

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.250
when one person
wants to transition.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.300
And statistically, the most
recent statistics that we have

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.880
say that only 21% of marriages
where someone transitions

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.110
survive.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.650
So when Scottie came
out, and we'd already

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.430
been married for 20
years, what happened

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.630
was when she would be going on
her book signings and tours,

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.820
and there'd come
time for Q&amp;A, perhaps

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.900
in one of those sessions, some
people would raise their hands

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.110
and start addressing
questions to me,

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:04.940
like, how did you do this,
and why did you do it?

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.072
What was it that prompted
you to want to stay?

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:10.780
Because a lot of times
what they would do

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.090
would be to put
themselves in my position,

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.970
and they just
couldn't imagine it.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.200
So "Just Because My Husband's
a Woman" is my story.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.200
I'm going to give you a
little bit of background

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:29.260
of my history, because it goes
way back into the dark ages.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.730
But I think part
of my upbringing

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.470
was a big arc in my whole
journey of coming around

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.690
to accepting what was
happening in our lives.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:47.110
I was born and raised in New
England, very much the boarding

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.010
school type of raising.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.560
Manners were a big
thing in our household.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.140
Both my parents had
been to boarding school.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.790
I had-- I still
have-- three brothers.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.250
And even from the
early days, when

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.430
people would ask my mother
how many kids she had,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:11.380
her answer was, I have four
boys, and one is a girl.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.620
So as I look back
on my life getting

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.420
ready to write this
book, I started

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.810
to see little hints
along the way of things

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.650
that I was learning that either
stood in my way for growth

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.740
or actually helped
me along the way.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.459
But so it was expected I
too went to boarding school.

00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:32.625
I was there for three years.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.510
And I think I'll tell you
a little sidebar story,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.690
just to show you
again how far I've had

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.990
to come with this whole topic.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.930
But I remember once
sitting my roommate down

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.680
after I'd been there
for several months.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.120
And I said, have I
done something wrong?

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.100
Have I said something wrong to
the other girls in the house?

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.750
They just seem like
they're very standoffish,

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.390
and I feel like maybe I
said something I wasn't

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.550
aware of that pissed them off.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.640
And she said, oh, well.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.220
And she shut the door to our
bedroom, and she sat on the bed

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:15.180
opposite me, and she said, well,
they think you're a lesbian.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.837
And I went, oh my god.

00:10:17.837 --> 00:10:18.545
What's a lesbian?

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.800
So to say I was
somewhat innocent

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.430
is perhaps an understatement.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.650
After boarding school, I
went to a two-year college,

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.160
a woman's college
in upstate New York,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.270
and majored in an
overseas program which

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.710
took me to Geneva, Switzerland
for a year, where I worked.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:49.620
and after that, I
came home in 1969.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.970
And I ended up moving to
California, starting out here

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.260
in the Bay Area.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.900
And for several years, I was
working for psychiatrists

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.970
during those years.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.520
There's a few stories
about experiences with them

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.670
and of that in my book.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.470
Some of it was quite humorous.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.310
And also another
little bread crumb

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.334
that I'd forgotten about
until I went back in my memory

00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:20.250
to think about what to
write about in my book,

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.660
and I went, oh, wait.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.930
I was kind of exposed to
the subject of transgender

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.660
back then, but I hadn't
even remembered it

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.880
or put it together
until looking back.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.050
So after several years
with the shrinks,

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.820
I started in the
production business.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.130
I volunteered for a
company, and then I ended up

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.450
being one of the owners of it.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.880
It was a recording
studio in San Francisco.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.530
I had gotten married
while I was still

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.600
working for the psychiatrists.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.780
Then when I went to work
at the recording studio,

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.580
I fell in love with one
of the partners in that,

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:07.010
and so ended up in a divorce,
moving into marriage number

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.900
two.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.170
And as I looked back,
what I realized was

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.810
I really have always
been looking for love.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.460
I always had been.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.840
And I felt like my parents
had a storybook marriage.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.510
My dad would come home
from work every night

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.200
and find my mother first
and give her a movie dip

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.560
kiss when he got home, and
they'd sit and have a cocktail

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.470
together.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:32.930
And he would download his day.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:37.220
And he really-- she was
his muse and his confidant

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.990
and his advisor.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.030
And I just thought that's what
a marriage should be like.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.900
And so when mine weren't
fitting that or when

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.010
it felt like the
feelings were gone,

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.330
mostly probably just because we
settled into in everyday life,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.130
I thought the love was gone.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.130
And so that's how I would
end up being attracted

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.800
to somebody else and
leave that marriage

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.960
and go into another one.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.750
Believe it or not, I actually
repeated the process again.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:11.100
So I met this wonderful, very
creative, witty, funny writer

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.370
who was with one of the ad
agencies who was our client,

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.360
and we started having
lunches together.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.530
And of course, I thought,
well, this is the one.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.510
He's the one.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.480
You know?

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.870
Number two was not
working out so well.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.530
The chinks in the armor
were definitely showing.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.410
So sure enough, I
broke off that marriage

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.520
and entered number three.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.930
And years down the
line of that marriage--

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.510
I think I hung in
there for a while--

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.030
he was the one who broke it off.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:46.140
So at least that was a little
bit of a change in my pattern.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.350
And he also had
not been faithful.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:55.200
So I realized I probably just
needed to really re-evaluate

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.380
what I was looking for and
how I was looking for it

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.500
and needed some space to
figure out who I really was.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.840
So I lived on my
own for a while,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.650
and then along came Scott.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.620
I had no idea--

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.600
because people ask me
this all the time--

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.180
no.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.540
I had no idea that
Scott was anything

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:21.330
but a creative wonderful,
thoughtful, loving, smart,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:28.000
witty, funny man who was
very much in love with me.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.220
And so this one, especially
because I had taken the time,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.350
I hadn't leaped from one
relationship to another,

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.830
this just felt right.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.090
And we fell together
pretty much from day one.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.930
Except I get teased that I sent
Scott home the first night,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.660
because I didn't want to
seem like I was too easy.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.660
So at this point, I want to read
you a little bit from my book.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.950
Because I've hinted that
surprisingly, to myself,

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.100
there were some bread crumbs
along the way that were maybe

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.720
little clues of what was really
going on that I hadn't really

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.280
seen for what they were.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.210
So this might tell you
a little bit about what

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.110
that was like for me.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:22.580
This is yours.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:31.060
No, I have placeholders
and everything.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.760
I love your book.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.820
Getting back to me.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.500
Oh, thank you.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.010
SCOTTIE JEANETTE MADDEN:
Thanks for the plug.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.010
MARCY MADDEN: Thank you.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.520
Yeah, I know.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.020
I did that on purpose.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.306
OK.

00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:48.510
[SIGHS] "Journey back
with me to 1992."

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.780
Some of you probably
weren't even born then, so.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.160
"Scott and I were on a TV
shoot in India for two weeks.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.610
Being in India is like taking
all the volume and color

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:03.120
saturation knobs on your
viewing and listening devices

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.580
and turning them up to the max.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:10.170
The colors are intensely vibrant
and can burn your eyeballs.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.380
The sounds are a
strange symphony

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.620
of familiar and
unfamiliar noises.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.670
And the smells, ah, the smells.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:25.110
Smoke mixed with fragrant
flowers, some not so fragrant

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:29.640
elements, incense
and teeming life.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.720
We visited temples and
teachers and mountain shrines.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.570
And during the
annual Magh Mela we

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.450
took a boat out onto
the water at sunset,

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.230
at the sacred confluence of
the Three Rivers, the Ganges,

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.370
the Yamuna, and the Saraswati,
where hundreds of people

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.700
were waving and dipping in
the water to be cleansed

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.500
and to pray.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.770
I took the opportunity
to pray too.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.880
The energy was thick
with the vibration

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.050
of something otherworldly,
something hallowed.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.819
Since Scott and
I were into yoga,

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.430
we felt deeply affected
by being in the land where

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.170
yoga was born.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.710
We were so grateful,
even giddy, to be there.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.720
Though the host of the TV
show was far from home,

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.050
including mentally
and emotionally,

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.160
Scott and I felt
very much at home.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.060
We were curious to see
and try everything.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.040
Despite the challenges
of a small crew

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.950
with lots of equipment
to lug around,

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:37.290
and despite the show's host's
mini-tantrums, we thrived.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.090
The crew were all
good friends of ours.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.710
Family, really.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.610
We were all like kids
in a new playground.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.420
One day, we visited a
Jain temple near our hotel

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.340
in Mount Abu.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.710
The temple was built
into a hillside

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.190
and had no decoration or
indication on the outside

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.290
that it was a temple.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.560
This was to protect it
from attack at wartime.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.250
It just looked like part of the
rocky hillside, disguised so it

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.610
could not be seen from the air.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.430
Once we stepped inside,
we were in a wonderland

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.200
of carved marble.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.460
It took the craftsmen years
and years to complete the work.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.270
There was room after room of
intricately carved marble,

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:26.650
and every inch of space was
done, floors, ceilings, walls,

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.290
and columns.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.900
Often there were
carvings within carvings,

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.840
one carved marble
column within another.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.460
It was as if the
whole temple was

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.260
made of the most intricate,
delicate, white lace.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.810
In some places, you could
look into an ante room

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.810
and see other shapes and figures
that were so tucked away,

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.960
it seemed we weren't even
supposed to see them.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.050
One such room had two huge,
life-size marble elephants.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.540
I could just see them through
the lacy wall and door

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.210
that was only cracked open.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.910
And there were statues
of deities and saints

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.850
surrounding the outer
circle of the temple.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.110
They all had
brightly painted eyes

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.200
that when you stared
at them drew you

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.530
into a deep and
meditative state.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.940
There was one such statue that
completely had me mesmerized.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.420
I just had to keep staring
into those all-knowing eyes.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.690
I was filled with a
feeling of warm love.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.670
I felt completely connected.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.660
Completely one with that being
and with everything around me.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.760
And Scott was there too,
seemingly in the same state.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.950
When we compared
our experiences,

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:42.090
Scott told me that as his
gaze was locked on the statue,

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.530
he saw himself reach back to
the middle of his shoulders,

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.760
grasp a zipper, and
unzip from there and up

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.820
over the top of his head,
until the sheath that

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.580
was his body just
fell away, revealing

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.660
a body made purely of light.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.800
As the sheath fell away, like a
lightweight Halloween costume,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.280
he stepped out of his skin
to stand as the new light

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.970
being who said to
him, I'll miss god.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.680
He was really fun.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.010
I was confused by that
and a bit frightened.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.220
It sounded as if Scott was
not long for this world.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.380
Was he going to die?

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.730
Scott didn't really seem
very concerned about it,

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.240
so I didn't say anything about
the questions it brought up

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.010
in me.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.430
He seemed deeply touched
by the experience.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.110
It was amazing.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.150
Over the years since
that trip to India,

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.570
I would flash back on Scott's
experience in the Jain temple,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.000
and I often wondered
if he did too.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.760
If he relived the
words, I'll miss god.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.040
He was really fun.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.710
Now I know each of us did
revisit that experience

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:49.950
many times.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.170
And now those words have a
different significance to me.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.070
I had taken the experience then
as a spiritual experience where

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:01.280
Scott was becoming less
attached to the physical world

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.880
and identifying more
with his universal self.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.560
Yes, he was less
attached to the physical,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.700
but not necessarily
for spiritual reasons.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.830
This was real, physical, a
direct hotline to who he was.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.710
He was less attached to
his body because he never

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.510
felt he belonged in it.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.780
He probably felt like unzipping
it and stepping out of it

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.330
most of the time,
and yet he might

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:29.387
have to stay encased in
that ill-fitting costume

00:21:29.387 --> 00:21:30.470
for the rest of his life."

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.720
So you've had a little glimpse
into my personal history.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.460
As I said, there's
more in the book.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.280
Some fun stories.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.990
This isn't all scary stuff.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:22:00.030
Though transgender has
been around for centuries,

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.400
it really has not
been talked about very

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.980
much until more recently.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.800
And as people have talked
about it and come out--

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.490
some of the names you know, I'll
let you fill in the blanks--

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:19.290
and covered by the media, one of
my earliest experiences of this

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.010
was when I was
watching an Oprah show.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:27.000
And Oprah had on a couple
where one of the two

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.590
had transgendered.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.440
And the couple was
staying together.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.390
They were a beautiful couple.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:34.360
Happily married.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.130
They had kids.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:41.220
The one who had been
a husband was a doctor

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.600
and was maintaining,
now, her practice.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.670
She was gorgeous, by the way.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.110
And they talked about
their whole experience.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:55.800
And I swear to God, I
looked at the television

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.850
and said out loud,
well, at least I'll

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.520
never have to deal with that.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.520
So I want to be
sharing this with you

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.540
because that's an example
of how far I've had to come.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.130
That was my feeling about what
transgender was at the time.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:22.450
So suffice it to say,
it's been quite an arc.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.050
My life has been an arc of
discovery, of questioning,

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:31.930
until I could find peace
and understanding and love.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.440
I talk about all the
phases that I went through.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.600
And I think they're
the phases of loss,

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.050
anyway, for a lot of people.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:49.840
I went through denial,
fears, ultimatums.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.210
OK, you can do this, as
long as you don't do that.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.090
OK, you can pierce your
ears and grow your hair,

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.260
but no way are you going
to wear dresses and--

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.167
at the time, Scottie
would say, that's OK.

00:24:02.167 --> 00:24:02.750
That's enough.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.240
I don't really want more.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.314
But obviously, for a
lot of trans people,

00:24:07.314 --> 00:24:09.230
they're not really
complete with their journey

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.230
until they even go all
the way through the point

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.020
of having surgery and having
the body that bespeaks

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.120
the gender they identify with.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.520
I was so determined
that this was just maybe

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.450
a phase or a midlife crisis.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.590
In fact, when Scottie
came downstairs

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.740
to say to me that early morning,
with the two cups of coffee,

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.020
and just blurted out,
the first words she said

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.610
were, I don't know who I am.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.310
And so my first
thought was, oh god.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.310
Midlife crisis.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.000
You're going to want a Porsche.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.720
And suffice it to say that
as the journey progressed,

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.670
I was kind of wishing it had
been the desire for a Porsche.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.740
I had bouts where I
played Nancy Drew.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.430
I'll get back to
that in a minute.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:25:04.490
But I also sent Scottie to
our homeopath to get a remedy.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.440
Because I thought
there's just some kind

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.820
of mix-up in the system.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.880
All she needs is
rebalancing of some kind.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.800
And to her credit, she went.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.630
I'm sure rolling her proverbial
eyes in her head the whole way.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.360
But she was willing
to do that for me.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.840
So all of my steps were baby
steps towards acceptance.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.560
Now, I don't know if any of
you grew up with Nancy Drew.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.130
"Nancy Drew" was a
series of detective books

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.917
about a young woman
who was a detective.

00:25:35.917 --> 00:25:37.750
They've been upgraded,
even, over the years,

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.910
because they were a very
famous popular series.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.640
And I think now Nancy
probably does drive a Porsche.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.650
At the time, she
drove a Roadster.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.380
So you're just going to have
to Google that and figure out

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.540
how that old car looked.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.860
But I started snooping around.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:58.750
I couldn't stand the feeling
that there was a secret.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.000
And even though Scottie
had come out to me,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.370
I didn't understand
what transgender was.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.640
I started researching, which
actually was kind of a mistake.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.470
Because as you, of all
people, probably know,

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:17.340
a lot of the things you can find
on the internet are disturbing.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.900
You can find very
disturbing stories.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.510
So I thought, well, this
isn't where I want to be.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:28.030
So I admit I would go
into Scottie's computer

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.490
and look for clues.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.240
And so I became
quite the detective.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.000
And I was pretty
good at it, actually.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.550
I surprised myself
at how good I was

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:43.090
at finding phone
numbers that were coded

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.620
and things like that.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:51.960
So I don't know if you can say
that you know someone who's

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:59.060
transgender, whether you have
a family member or a friend,

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.640
but now that you've
met Scottie, you

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.690
can no longer say you don't
know someone who is transgender.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:11.130
And I don't know if
there's any questions

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.140
that we can check in to see
if anyone's asked questions.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:19.090
If not, the--

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.860
MONICA WALSH: So no
questions on the Dory,

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.570
but this is a good
time to remind people

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.250
who are listening
on live stream,

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.660
if you have questions, please be
sure to write them in the Dory,

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.167
and we'll get back
to them in a few.

00:27:30.167 --> 00:27:31.000
MARCY MADDEN: Great.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.880
Thank you, Monica.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.680
Part of the reason I say that
is because Scottie and I are

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.410
making a real point to
getting out and about.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:48.820
We've spoken at universities
and other corporations and LGBTQ

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:53.320
organizations, IA plus.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.190
Because we really want our
lives to be an open book.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.700
We want us to be the people
that you can count on

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:05.950
to ask questions of where no one
will be upset by the question,

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:11.890
no one will feel shamed
or hurt by a question.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:16.900
Because we really want people
to be educated about this.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.780
When I run into any kind
of resistance or bumps

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.250
with people, I really find it's
because people don't really

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.750
understand.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.820
One of the biggest signs
of that is somebody

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:32.300
might say, why would you
choose to be a woman?

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.316
And a lot of my women
friends will say that.

00:28:36.316 --> 00:28:37.940
Who would want to
choose to be a woman?

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.145
But it's not a matter of choice.

00:28:42.145 --> 00:28:44.270
And I think that's one of
the biggest things that's

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.770
really important to say.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:54.350
People ask me why
and how I did it.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.540
So a big part of
what I had to do

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.600
was look through
my own concepts.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.960
What is a husband, what is
a wife, what is marriage,

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.170
what is love, what is gender.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:11.830
I mean, heck.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:15.820
I'd already been misgendered
as a lesbian years before.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.520
So what's in a word?

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.810
And I dug deeply
into those words,

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.460
but my relationship with them.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.070
What did I think love was?

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.890
And what did I
think a husband was?

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.740
As my mate and my
spouse and my beloved,

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.040
Scottie was fulfilling
those things

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.790
that we really look for
the most in a relationship.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:50.150
So I thought, well, does it
matter that I call this person

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:54.810
my husband, or do I have love?

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:59.591
And I kept thinking how
I had looked for love--

00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:00.090
OK.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.310
In all the wrong places.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:05.640
I'd looked for love for a long
time until I found Scottie.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.920
And I also thought
about all the ways

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.220
that she had stuck with me.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.410
That she had really
been generous.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.620
She's a great cook,
which really helps.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.840
But took good care of
me all along the way.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.500
Was loving.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.170
Was the love I'd
always looked for.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.560
When I was diagnosed
with ovarian cancer,

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.920
she didn't run away.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.670
She took care of me and
went with the doctor to me

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.910
and has always supported me
throughout the whole process.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.420
So looking at the
words that we have

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.190
and re-asking ourselves,
how do I relate to that.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.700
How do I relate to the
things that my parents

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.780
or peers or teachers
taught me back when?

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.082
It's really a
valuable thing to do.

00:30:54.082 --> 00:30:55.790
And we've often played
a game with people

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:56.840
when we talk to this.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.360
We call it the binary
game and ask people

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.850
to say some of the things that
maybe they were taught or was

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.270
said to them when
they were little

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.690
or even now that has affected
their opinion of something.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.880
And even with the young
people in the universities,

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.960
it's amazing how much
those kinds of messages

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.300
are still being given to them.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:25.880
Scottie will often share how
her dad would say to Scott,

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.830
you run like a girl.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:33.360
Or if you're going
to cry like that,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.820
Mary Jane, go put on a dress.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.580
So first of all, that's a double
whammy of putting a woman down,

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:43.080
but also telling your son that
he's less than by saying he's

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.710
like a girl.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:50.810
My mother really screwed
me up, because she

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.170
wanted me to not
drive like a girl

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.410
or throw a ball like a girl.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:01.400
So she was the one who had
to teach me how to do that.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.380
So that's kind of confusing.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.820
Did you have something, Monica?

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.945
MONICA WALSH: Yeah, there's
a question on the Dory,

00:32:06.945 --> 00:32:10.790
and it's relevant to how you're
speaking about these questions

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.940
that you're asking
yourselves around binary

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.780
and what that means.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.370
So the question is
how did you feel

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:23.120
about the impact on
your own identity,

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.940
given that you were
part of a binary, woman.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.930
When did you decide to continue
to be with your trans partner?

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.371
Did you feel your
identity was being erased?

00:32:37.371 --> 00:32:39.620
MARCY MADDEN: Oh, just a
cute, light, little question.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.650
It did occur to me that
I would maybe leave.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.150
I think it was a
knee-jerk reaction.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:53.440
Like, well, I can't be here.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.400
I'm not a lesbian.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.980
I can't be with this person.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.060
But again, by evaluating
some of those things.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.760
Well, wait a minute.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.590
Who is this person?

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.490
I had to really
think about that.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.539
And I'll get to the
erasure part in a minute,

00:33:10.539 --> 00:33:12.330
because I do have an
answer about that too.

00:33:15.676 --> 00:33:18.920
But one of the biggest words
I really had to look at

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.570
was commitment.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:24.140
Because I'd already been in
marriages where basically I

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.950
gave up on the commitment,
or someone gave up on me.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.040
So what is commitment?

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.220
I mean, in our vows, we
say till death do us part.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.890
And I started looking
at other couples who

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:42.110
have stayed together, like
Michael Fox and Christopher

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.800
Reeves.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.640
And stuff happens in life.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.780
And stuff happens
to your partner.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.510
So do you walk away?

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.820
As I said, Scottie hadn't
walked away from me

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:56.350
when I got a deathly
ill diagnosis.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:01.490
So looking at commitment
was one thing.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:06.980
Yes, it made me
question a lot about me

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.915
and me as a woman at first.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.929
And I used to sometimes
to tease that well,

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:18.110
now I'm the one who wears
the pants in the family.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.870
Scottie's very into feminine
stuff, and I wasn't.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:22.219
I was a tomboy.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:24.710
So yes.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:30.239
It made me question my
own identity as a woman.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.230
Another sidebar
was because Scottie

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:38.040
was getting so much
attention, I started

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.480
to ask the question,
what am I, chopped liver?

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.184
It's more like I just felt
pushed aside a bit as a person.

00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:52.969
A couple of things that
helped me get through that

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.610
was Scottie herself.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:59.490
And I want to say this
because sometimes you'll hear

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:03.350
that trans people are selfish.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:07.050
And I think, especially if
they come out later in age,

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:09.042
they just want their life.

00:35:09.042 --> 00:35:10.500
They've put it off
for long enough.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.560
Dammit, I want to be who I am.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.410
Scottie was very generous
and patient with me.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:20.120
And I could beat on her chest
and scream and cry and accuse.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.100
How could you do this to me?

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.600
How could you lie
to me this long?

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.610
But learned, because
she was patient.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.170
And we talked about everything.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:35.030
We worked it all out together
that she wasn't lying to me.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.580
That actually, she was the
opposite of being selfish.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.080
She had pretended to be
a man for all that time

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.150
so that she wouldn't hurt me.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:51.050
So the other side of
that is our friends.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.360
Thank god the
friends that we have

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.200
and the family that
we have in our lives

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.840
didn't allow me to be
chopped liver for too long.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.660
Because pretty much as soon
as they would hear the news,

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.700
the next question would
be turning to me and go,

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.030
how are you?

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.680
So I was included.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.540
They knew that this
might be hard for me,

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.177
and I felt that they
were there to support me.

00:36:13.177 --> 00:36:15.510
And I have a couple of funny
stories about friends, too.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.480
But it sounds like--

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.980
MONICA WALSH: That
was certainly one

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.330
of the questions I asked you.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.730
How are you?

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.080
And I'm glad you're doing well.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.410
That was another question
that has come up.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.640
Actually, two questions.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.290
One is how has your network
of family and friends

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:35.110
changed over time?

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.990
And a question that
I actually had too,

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:42.820
just out of curiosity, what in
your day-to-day has changed?

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.100
What's different in
your day-to-day life

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.970
and your relationship
with Scottie?

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:49.720
MARCY MADDEN: Wow.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.340
OK, you may need to remind
me of some of those.

00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:56.350
Well, family and friends.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.730
So this is maybe a
good place for me

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.354
to tell a couple of
my friends stories.

00:36:59.354 --> 00:37:03.220
[LAUGHS] Because I realized
too, one of my biggest fears

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.582
was telling people.

00:37:04.582 --> 00:37:06.040
Like, are they
going to be shocked?

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.847
Are they going to
think we're weird?

00:37:07.847 --> 00:37:09.430
Obviously, they think
we're queer, now

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.960
that I know what queer means.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.980
But I really was afraid
of people's reaction

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.530
and that we might be
shunned and rejected.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:22.390
And so I give these two
examples in the book, too.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.920
A dear friend,
Melissa, who I had

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.880
worked with for a really
long time, I waited--

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.196
I didn't want to tell people
for a really long time.

00:37:29.196 --> 00:37:31.570
I think because I kept hoping
that Scottie would suddenly

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.250
wake up some day, and it would--

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:33.760
oh my god.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.900
I don't know what
I was thinking!

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.950
I'm your husband again.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.390
But that never came.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:42.340
So I was feeling quite
alone for a long time.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:46.767
And I told my friend Melissa,
who was there to visit, I said,

00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:47.350
you know what?

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.130
I have something to tell you.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:53.650
And she went, what?

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:59.060
And I said, well,
Scottie is a woman.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.320
And she said, oh, thank god.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.370
I thought you were going to
say you were splitting up.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.620
And that instantly--
it did something

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.210
inside my whole being.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:14.235
Like, this wasn't a bad
thing that Scottie was trans.

00:38:14.235 --> 00:38:16.830
The bad thing was
this love story

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:21.690
that so many of our friends had
subscribed to and looked up to

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.870
and wanted to clone my husband
to have one of their own

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:26.970
like him.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.220
That's what mattered
to them, was our love

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.220
and preserving that.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.570
So the other one
was I was sharing

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:40.850
with a friend, who is a lesbian,
of our childhood crushes.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.580
And I had a mad crush on
Richard Chamberlain, who

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.640
played Dr. Kildare
in a TV series

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.190
way back when I think TV
was still black and white.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:51.830
But I just had the
biggest crush on him.

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:53.600
And she said, oh really?

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.300
My crush was Haley Mills.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.680
So I said, yeah, I know.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.040
But then I find out that
Richard Chamberlain is gay.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.810
And she goes, yeah.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.490
And you ended up
with Haley Mills.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.270
[LAUGHS]

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.135
MONICA WALSH: Nice.

00:39:11.135 --> 00:39:12.510
MARCY MADDEN: Oh,
and day-to-day.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.330
MONICA WALSH: So the biggest
change day-to-day in your life

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.190
and in your relationship
with Scottie.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.770
MARCY MADDEN: I'm
more into makeup now,

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.440
because I have someone
who can teach me.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.380
I really saw how
much I was a tomboy.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.990
And I shunned makeup.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:31.630
And Scottie was so into it,
at first, it really bugged me.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.780
But then I would
watch her put it on,

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.110
and I'd go, oh, where'd
you get that color?

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.645
So makeup is a
day-to-day change.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.790
I think part of it is also
my priorities have changed.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:52.390
Some of that has been with
the diagnosis that I got,

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:58.420
but I'm relying a
lot on my humor.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.080
I always did, but I
think that was also

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.150
one of the things
that got me through.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:07.500
And seeing the
synchronicity in everything

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.570
that happens around me
and how sometimes things

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:13.140
are almost a joke by the
universe or a perfect pun

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:13.950
on life itself.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:25.940
I'm now less resistant to
being affectionate in public

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.620
with Scottie.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.420
I was at first.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.420
Like, oh, don't kiss me.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.740
Oh, don't hold my hand.

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.990
And now I'll be the one
to reach for her hand

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.954
or give her a kiss.

00:40:34.954 --> 00:40:35.870
Because you know what?

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:36.411
I don't care.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:41.469
My relationship even
to the word lesbian,

00:40:41.469 --> 00:40:43.010
I was worried that
people would think

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.070
I'm a lesbian, because
now I was with a woman.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.710
But of course, I flashed
back on my high school days

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.080
and went, hm.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.050
OK.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.110
That's interesting.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:55.820
But I don't need a label.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.380
People kind of want to put you
in a box and name it something,

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:08.470
and I don't have to be a lesbian
to be in love with my spouse

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.620
just because she's a woman.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.480
MONICA WALSH: Nice.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.911
Are there any questions
here in the audience?

00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:16.494
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:21.434 --> 00:41:23.910
MONICA WALSH: Mic runners.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:24.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.660
So Marcy, my question
is are there any--

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.900
I mean, there are so
many spiritual aspects

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.970
to what you've just described.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:34.640
But are there any
other lessons that

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.010
were particularly
powerful for you

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:41.519
from a spiritual point of
view about what's happened?

00:41:41.519 --> 00:41:42.310
MARCY MADDEN: Yeah.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.476
Thank you for your question.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:54.070
I think contemplation was an
important one and contemplating

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.530
words, and does this
resonate with me?

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:00.490
Do I need to accept this word
anymore in my vocabulary?

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:03.050
But one of the things
that really is to me,

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:10.420
I think, the most is
that I believe in karma.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.900
And not kind of the everyday
variety, the way some people

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.810
sling it around.

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:18.530
I mean I really do believe that
what goes around comes around,

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:21.090
and that everything
in one's life

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:27.480
is a result of past behaviors,
thoughts, beliefs, actions.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:34.630
So once I kind of had
this aha that Scottie

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:37.250
didn't do this to me.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.900
I was in this situation
because it was my karma

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.680
to be in this situation.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.430
I might not exactly
see the reason why,

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.350
but I was supposed to be here.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:50.020
And that erased the blame.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.760
It wasn't Scottie's
fault. Scottie

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.290
wasn't doing this to me.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.920
I was supposed to be here.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.440
So now what are you
going to do with it?

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.330
And it was actually
Scottie's dad

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:08.050
who had a saying that became
my guiding light through all

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:11.950
the rest of my process, which
kind of has to do with that.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:17.280
And Jim Madden used to say, "you
can go sitting up in the saddle

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.330
or strapped across
it, but you're

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.630
going riding, Jesse James."

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.511
MONICA WALSH: [LAUGHS] Nice.

00:43:23.511 --> 00:43:24.010
Good.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.529
So we have another
question in the audience?

00:43:26.529 --> 00:43:27.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.778
MARCY MADDEN: Hi.

00:43:27.778 --> 00:43:29.470
AUDIENCE: Hi, Marcy.

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:32.680
I just want to ask, how
did you guys first meet,

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.573
and how long did you date
before you got married?

00:43:35.573 --> 00:43:37.390
MARCY MADDEN: Ah.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.180
We first met when we were
both working for a production

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.320
company in San Diego.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:48.460
Apparently, when Scottie saw
me-- is this fair to say?

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.800
It was love at first sight.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.450
I had this little
stumbling block,

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:56.920
as I think I've told you, that
I was married at the time.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.620
But Scottie and I struck
up this great friendship,

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.850
and we'd have great
philosophical talks.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.110
And I think this is one
thing that was important,

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.060
and I would actually offer as
advice about relationships,

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:14.500
is that friendship is really
a key, core, important

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.640
ingredient.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.410
So we were friends first.

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:20.890
And we'd have arguments about
karma and philosophical things

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:22.320
like that.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.700
And I will also admit that
Scottie is quite a bit

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:32.560
younger than I. So I
thought I was going to--

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.140
because this guy was
so great-- fix him

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.150
up with my stepdaughter.

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:42.100
And she was on the
cheer team for--

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.950
she was going to Oregon
State, and her team

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:49.660
was coming down, the basketball
team, to play at UCLA.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:53.260
So since she was going
to come as a cheer girl,

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:58.030
I invited Scottie to
come with me and Bill

00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:59.650
and come meet Kelly.

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.230
And the whole drive up
from San Diego to LA,

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:05.440
all Scott did was talk about
these flipping earrings

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.060
that he made for
this other woman

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.800
that he was interested in.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.020
And they were yin-yang.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.410
And I remember sitting
in the front seat

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:19.100
next to my then husband, and
literally said to myself,

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.090
I wish somebody
loved me like that.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:29.960
And after my marriage ended,
and I'd had a few months,

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.330
and Scottie had had
an experience where

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:39.032
she was meditating one day
and said that she saw me.

00:45:39.032 --> 00:45:40.490
And this had been
months and months

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.390
since we'd worked together.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:45.730
She called and said,
I have an experience

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:47.830
I want to share with you.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:49.840
And came to visit.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.330
We went for a walk,
and I just fell in love

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.220
with this being on the walk.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.100
And she basically
never left after that.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.550
MONICA WALSH: So it sounds like
your marriage and relationship

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:08.200
has both moved
through transgender

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:16.600
and has also transcended
any kinds of labels or boxes

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.960
or naming of any
kind, and that's

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:24.080
really inspiring in this time.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:29.740
I want to thank you,
and thank you, Scottie,

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:33.160
for coming to Google
and sharing your story

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:38.830
and being human
with us about how we

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:42.200
can love in any circumstance.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:42.880
So thank you.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.390
MARCY MADDEN: Thank you.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:44.390
MONICA WALSH: Thank you.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:46.180
MARCY MADDEN: Thank you, Monica.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:47.380
Thank you guys.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.730
[APPLAUSE]
