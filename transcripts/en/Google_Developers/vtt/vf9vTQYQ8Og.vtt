JEFFREY CARDILLE: OK.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:01.980
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.790
Thanks For coming here today,
and thanks for tuning in.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.640
My name is Jeff Cardille.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.710
I'm a professor at the
University of Montreal in the

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.030
Geography Department.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.830
And I'll be talking with you
today about a Master's project

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.390
that we have just finished up in
the last few months called

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.520
GeoSearch, which is a new
virtual globe application for

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.980
the submission, sharing, and
visualization of point-based

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.600
ecological data.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.110
The work that I'm presenting
here is not really so much my

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.170
own as Rodolphe Gonzales'.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.320
He's a student who was
co-supervised by Lael Parrott,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.780
my colleague in geography,
and myself.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.790
And Rodolphe really is
responsible for both

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.910
conceiving of, developing in
most of the cases, and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.060
managing, in addition, the
work that you see here.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.300
There are also some huge
contributions by the people

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.360
you see on the right side
of your screen there.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.740
Gael Deest, who did database
development, Caroline

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.380
Gaudreau, who did
interface work.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.680
Benoit [INAUDIBLE], who gave
us the ability to introduce

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.960
data to our network.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.720
Casey Brown and Jean-Francois
Marsan, who came on in the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.930
last few months.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.460
And of course, all of this is
built on the development in

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.090
Google Earth and Google Maps,
the prefuse library of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.200
visualization technologies,
and World Wind.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.530
I mention there are also the
students of my course 6352,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.960
which I'll talk about for a few

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.050
minutes at the very beginning.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.460
So this is the first time I've
ever been recorded, I think,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.870
for a talk in my life.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.780
It's for sure the first
time I've ever been

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.010
recorded for YouTube.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.530
And as a result I've gotten lots
and lots of advice from

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.960
everyone from our babysitter
to people at the day care.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.150
My wife has some ideas, my
mom has some ideas about

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.140
what I should do.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.620
And they center around trying
to make the video viral.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.900
So I've had suggestions to rap
the entire presentation.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.580
So if I had some good rapping
skills, that might be

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.690
something we'd do.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.070
Also animating a dancing baby
seems to be a very popular way

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.510
to get a lot of hits
on your site.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.750
Let's see, anything with Star
Wars in it seems to be quite

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.050
popular, whether it's waving
a sword around or

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.500
making my own videos.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.040
And of course, anything
that has to do with

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.880
Evolution of Dance.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.310
So if it were possible for me
to do Evolution of Dance,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.790
perhaps combining that with a
Diet Coke and Mentos, while

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.840
rapping, or possibly having a
dancing baby rapping the Star

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.810
Wars theme, while dancing around
and doing our Diet

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.110
Cokes, that's what I would do.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.810
So I'm not going to
do that, for sure.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.250
But the main advice
that I got from

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.600
everyone is to be yourself.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.155
So hopefully, some
of that will come

00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:31.390
through during this talk.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.420
So as I say, we'll talk about
the course, first of all,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.140
because that really is the
source of all of the work that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.300
you see here.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.960
And then second, talk about
GeoSearch, the globe-based

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.190
data browser.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.510
Third is the Sustainable Forest
Management Network

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.670
Social Network Browser,
which we developed as

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.130
part of this package.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.020
Third, looking at project
locations.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.300
And fourth, looking at journal
article study sites.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.460
So I mentioned this course
because, really, it's the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.450
foundation for all of the
work that you see here.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.050
It's a practical graduate
seminar that I developed when

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.870
I arrived at the University of
Montreal three years ago.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.620
And this seminar focuses on the
capabilities and recent

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.700
developments in Google
Maps and World

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.840
Wind and Google Earth.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.910
I mentioned that it's a
practical seminar, and the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.050
reason is that we have a
practical component.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.210
It's one of the few graduate
courses where we have three

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.360
hours in lab each week.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.080
And some of the labs that
we've developed for this

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.870
course, you can see there
written on the screen.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.580
We have two for Google Maps.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.090
We introduce these graduate
students to

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.040
MyMaps and shared editing.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.700
In the earlier days of the
course, three years ago, there

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.590
was no MyMaps so that lab
in particular has

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.810
changed quite a bit.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.700
Second, you can see three
ways to embed your

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.900
map on a web page.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.280
Students learn that in their
second or third week.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.700
Then we have a second module.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.170
The students do a small project
in Google Maps making

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.550
a mashup of some sort.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.710
For the second module,
we look at the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.780
Introduction to World Wind.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.680
We've developed a lab for
that, looking at the New

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.790
Orleans data provided by
the World Wind system.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.840
Data with World Wind looking
at web mapping servers,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.810
vector, and rectified
raster data.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.220
And that's for the World
Wind component.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.180
For the third component, looking
at Google Earth, we

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.340
have written labs looking
at KML and Google Earth.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.399
And in particular, in that one,
what we do is we have

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.480
students pick apart an
existing KML file.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.340
The KML file that we use is
one created by National

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.220
Geographic for elephant poaching
several years ago.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.740
It's got a real wide range
of things that KML

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.820
is capable of doing.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.110
And so students pick that KML
apart, change it a little bit

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.230
for their own purposes
as part of that lab.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.530
You can see the other
labs there as well.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.560
We have one on Yahoo Pipes and
Google SketchUp, and that's

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.420
the practical part.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.570
For the seminar part, you can
see here that the students

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.880
collaborate throughout the
semester by annotating

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.690
websites, annotating blog
postings, talking about

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.550
mashups that exist, and looking
at the various cutting

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.430
edge things that are done with
Google Earth, Google Maps, and

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.450
World Wind.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.700
As I said, it's a grad seminar,
and so students bring

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.270
the material to this course.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.760
So for example, in the first
week during the morning

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.850
session, the students are asked
to look on the Google

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.810
Maps Mania blog for examples of
mashups related to Canada.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.940
100 things that you can do
with Google Maps mashups,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.510
Google Maps Mania, special
features, for example, social

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.340
networking using mashups.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.920
And what they do under a common
user, students create a

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.160
very extensive Google notebook
annotating all of the newest

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.940
things that they have found and
brought to my course, to

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.950
our course, really.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.610
Because they're the ones
bringing the content.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.790
They bring this stuff, we talk
about it for three hours, it

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.550
catches me up very quickly, and
it allows them to learn, I

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.960
think, much faster than if they
were simply listening to

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.000
my lectures about what I think
these technologies can do.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.920
So it's a grad seminar, and
everything's online, using

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.050
lots and lots of Google
technology things.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.030
All of the student work, as I
say, there's hundreds of sites

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.580
now that are explained in Google
notebooks, one for each

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.210
of these three technologies.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.920
All of the students' reports for
the labs and projects that

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.290
they produce are in
Google documents.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.350
The student presentations
themselves are in Google

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.580
documents, so there's no trading
of USB keys at the

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.440
beginning of the class.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.280
They simply upload their
presentation or work on their

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.590
presentation directly in Google
Docs, and we look at

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.360
them together through the
internet connection in the

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.830
department.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.150
The syllabus is at Google Sites
if anyone hearing this

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.040
is interested in looking at
that, or adopting it, or in

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.050
fact, just taking the syllabus
and doing it for a

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.380
class of your own.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.850
You can feel completely
free to do that.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.340
The labs are in Google documents
and all the data is

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.920
available, which is a really
nice thing for teachers who

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.290
are interested in teaching
in a practical way, these

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.840
abilities, these technologies.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.790
It is in French.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.630
It's a French-speaking
university, but Google

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.315
Translate does a great job of
translating my broken French

00:06:53.315 --> 00:06:56.930
and the students' fantastic
French into

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.270
any number of languages.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.540
So as I mentioned, that's a
course that I do, and it

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.130
really is the thing that
underlies this project that

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.320
I'm about to describe to you.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.710
The reason is that the TA for
that course is the same

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.140
Rodolphe Gonzales who had come
to me when he heard that I was

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.310
shopping around the
idea of a course.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.830
He came to me and said,
oh, I know a little

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.740
bit about World Wind.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.440
At that moment, I had
never heard of it.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.830
He said Google Earth, I know
you can do things that are

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.230
more than just looking
at your house.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.800
I thought that was a pretty
thing, so I took

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.080
him on as the TA.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.020
And then soon after that,
I was approached by the

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.260
Sustainable Forest Management
Network, which is funded by

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.780
NSERC, the National Science
and Engineering Research

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.330
Council of Canada, which is
somewhat like the National

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.670
Science Foundation here
in the United States.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.480
So this Sustainable Forest
Management Network is an

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.040
umbrella organization
of forest research.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.040
And what they have done for
the last 15 or 16 years is

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.580
they have created projects,
given money for science

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.930
projects, done on the general
theme of sustainable forest

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.020
management.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.870
And yet, at the end of their
time, at the end of this

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.990
15-year period, decade and a
half, they have, I would say,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.080
very limited access to the data
that has been gathered as

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.460
part of their management
network.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.600
At the beginning of this--
that goes back

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.410
to the early 1990s--

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.020
internet sharing was a
pretty rare thing.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.980
Projects were probably not
even done in PDF, I would

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.590
think, project reports going
back all the way at the

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.650
beginning of that.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.390
And so, there's very fragmentary
evidence of this

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.130
network and the data that this
network had gathered.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.299
So they came to us with four big
questions, and those are

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.200
the four components that I'll
talk to you about here today.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.549
So their first main question
is, where are data samples

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.210
located from all of the work
that we've done on our

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.420
research, and what
are their values?

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.860
Second, the basic question
of who worked with

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.290
whom in this network?

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:56.460
After a 15-year period it's
possible to reconstruct who

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.110
had worked with whom, and
what they had done.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.080
Third, where were projects
located, and

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.610
what were their results?

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.970
And fourth, what journal
articles were created through

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.060
this network?

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.950
So the answer to the first
question forms the title of

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.270
this talk, GeoSearch.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.920
The main question there is where
are samples located, and

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.840
what are their values?

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.400
Our goal is to create a set of
programs, or to really adapt

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.990
the set of programs, that take
advantage of these emerging

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.190
capabilities.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.330
So what you see there on the
upper left is a globe

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.520
representing World Wind, which
is the virtual globe that we

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.990
embedded this data on.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:37.260
Second in line, the gray form
that says By Province is a

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.810
really amazing set of Java
libraries called prefuse,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.460
which is data visualization
techniques developed at the

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.715
University of Berkeley, if I'm
correct, by a PhD student for

00:09:47.715 --> 00:09:48.910
his PhD work.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.080
And the third represents
databases.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.150
So what you can see here is our
GeoSearch application in

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.775
action here.

00:09:57.775 --> 00:09:59.840
You can see just the
basic ability to

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.430
move the globe around.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.840
But I think what is really the
most interesting about this

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.170
particular component is the
ability to move through this

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:17.350
network of information down on
the bottom using this prefuse

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.970
set of libraries.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.010
So you can move around and
select information such as, I

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.390
think in this case, lichen
cover and other forest

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.260
information.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.880
Show the two of them together.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.690
And the two them are displayed
together, these two variables,

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.850
herbaceous cover and lichen
cover, on the globe.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.010
It's possible to move around,
zoom in, and do all the

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.360
various things that you're
used to doing, with the

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.730
addition of this neat feature
of being able to view in the

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.030
third dimension of the globe,
the fourth dimension of time

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.650
as represented in the data.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:54.040
So we elevate the individual
points to an elevation that

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.600
represents the date that
they were collected.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.160
So data from 1992 is lower than
data from 1997, which is

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.610
lower from data in 2008.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.870
You can see the large black
bar in the middle that the

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.800
cursor is moving across there.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.440
And what that is doing, is doing
a selection of data from

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.630
a particular time, that's
a time line.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.050
So as you can see, there's data
at two basic elevations

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.390
shown in the figure there, and
so that's data selected from

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.190
the left side of the
time diagram.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.190
And on the right--

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.270
the eastern part of
Canada, I think--

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.110
is the data from the
other period.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.320
So here's a little bit of a
closer view of what that data

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.490
might look like if you were
to look at it with this

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.640
mocked-up data here.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.240
And this represents the change
in two variables.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.270
In this case, it's dissolved
organic carbon, and dissolved

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.390
inorganic carbon taken from
a carbon simulation model

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:51.400
simulating the development of
carbon in lakes and its

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.550
changing concentration
throughout the year.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.530
And what that represents is the
months of January to June,

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.620
on average, in these two
particular lakes.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.370
So that's the combination of
these three technologies in

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.980
one, built from World Wind Java,
prefuse libraries for

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.420
moving around through the data,
and with the database

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.835
built from PostgreSQL.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.990
So in this first go-around, this
first draft, that's one

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.270
of the main things that Rodolphe
produced as part of

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.340
his master's degree.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.020
And it's, I think, important
to realize that it's pretty

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.880
amazing for a master's project
to have done something that's

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.910
really pretty impressive,
capable of taking in this

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.140
data, or capable, really, of
displaying data that's already

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.520
been taken in.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.450
So data entry for us, at
the beginning, was

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.470
not the main focus.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.885
We were really focused on
visualizing this information,

00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:43.480
and so data entry until just a
few months ago, in fact, just

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.820
a few days ago, was
very difficult.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.870
So even though, theoretically,
we could get data into the

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.860
shared database, it was quite
hard for anyone except a real

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.490
experienced administrator
to get data in.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.830
So what we did was we went back
to a project that I had

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.320
begun when I was a post-doc at
the University of Quebec at

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.610
Montreal to do the same kind
of thing but in, I think, a

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.860
pre-Google Earth period.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.120
This was in 2005.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.190
We looked at trying to find some
way to share information

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:23.400
among the lake researchers in
this inter-university group of

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.475
research in limnology,
limnology being

00:13:25.475 --> 00:13:27.030
the study of lakes.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.310
So we had a large amount
of information.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.530
This is another much smaller
network made of Quebec

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.490
scientists who gather
information about lakes.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.950
And like the people in the
forest network, their data

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.900
sits in individual Excel files
on their computer.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.460
And those computers get old,
the formats change, and the

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.020
data basically sits as
individuals, and rests as

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.650
individuals.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.740
What we had looked to do, and
what we succeeded in beginning

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.740
at least, was to create a
framework for people to upload

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.660
data to the shared database.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.620
At that time, there was no
shared globe ability.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.500
There was simply the ability to
upload data to this common

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.340
database and do a simple yes/no
search with a few

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.760
ranges in order to
extract data.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.400
So this was a data introduction,
and data

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.530
storage, and data
extraction tool.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.140
And that's where it sat for
several years until just a

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.390
month or two ago.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.590
What we did was to take that
and basically graft it onto

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.490
the World Wind-based GeoSearch
application that I told you

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.120
about just a few minutes ago.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.790
And so now we've introduced
the ability to have easy

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:36.680
uploading of data.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.010
You can add sites.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.610
We've changed it from being
lake-focused into being able

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.390
to gather information or accept
information for any

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.130
sort of point-based site,
with the latitude,

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.910
longitude, and site name.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.950
You can also add data.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.590
The system has a pretty
sophisticated parser for

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.670
understanding the different
names that people can call the

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.820
same effective bit of data.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.426
So in Quebec in particular,
where English and French are

00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:02.930
both spoken, I might call
something dissolved organic

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:08.110
carbon, but the French acronym
for that is not DOC but COD.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.920
And so this system allows for
that ability to switch back

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.560
and forth, or to, in effect,
interpret intelligently what

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.200
it is the user is trying input,
by asking a pretty

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.610
smart series of questions, and
building intelligence over

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.440
time, and what data rests
in the database.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.430
In the last few weeks or so, I
guess, we have introduced the

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.490
ability to do a simple search
in Google Maps.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.720
You can see that on the right
side of your screen.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:40.680
And by choosing among the data
sets, we can click on that

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.730
little menu item
that says DOC.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.260
When you do that, a slider comes
up and it allows you to

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.920
move back and forth between the
different values that you

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.950
might want of DOC to pull
out of the database.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.860
So in this case, the user has
slid the sliders left and

00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.290
right to ask for data between
2.8 to 10.2, and when they hit

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.460
Refresh Map, they can see where
the samples that fit

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.350
those criteria were selected
in this data set.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.570
Meanwhile, that data exists in
the three-dimensional browser

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.750
in the virtual globe that
you saw as well.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.500
So that's the first of our
four driving questions.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.300
For the next five minutes or
so, just maybe six minutes,

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.790
I'll tell you about the
following three in pretty

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.520
quick succession of detail.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.990
And so, the second.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.350
Who worked with whom
in this network?

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.150
That's another basic question
that the Sustainable Forest

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.760
Management Network
was interested in

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.570
reporting, or in recording.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.720
And they asked us if
we were capable of

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.060
keeping track of that.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.160
And in fact, we were.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.730
Here you can see a very

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.660
roughly-animated view of the network.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.470
I'll zoom in on that
in just a minute.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.340
And what that shows is, sort
of in a constellation form,

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.930
shows who has worked
with whom.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.640
There are hundreds of
researchers shown on this

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.060
slide that we see there.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.740
And I'll tell you about the
panels that we see on the

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.480
right in detail in
just a minute.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.670
What this allows us to do
is to basically click on

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.910
individuals and see the network
from just their

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:09.450
perspective.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.109
So in this case I've clicked on
this person, David, and we

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.890
can see all of the people
who he has worked with.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.740
Depending on the version of the
software, we can allow it

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.720
to look two levels deep, or
three levels deep in order to

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.079
see who the people worked with,
who he worked with.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:30.480
And we can basically move
through this network, seeing

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.100
the network from the perspective
of individual

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.170
researchers.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.340
And so what you see here on the
right is what this thing

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.725
looks like in action.

00:17:37.725 --> 00:17:41.430
The prefuse library moves people
around, it moves their

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.370
nodes around based on physics
principles, I think, if I

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.490
understand it right.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.610
You can still interact with
the system though as it's

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.090
doing that.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.470
We can move back and forth, we
can click and move between

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.800
individual researchers and see
the network from their

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.450
perspective.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.850
So again, this is the
Sustainable Forest Management

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.055
Network social browser.

00:17:59.055 --> 00:18:01.890
So it allows us to see who these
individuals are, and who

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:02.970
they have worked with.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.280
We also have a feature there on
the left in the middle, you

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.730
can see it's called
a business card.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.850
It's a bit hard to read with
this particular color that we

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.350
have, for people who work,
I think in the

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.030
government in this case.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.860
So you can see the color of the
nodes, and the color of

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.410
this business card represents
where they came from and who

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.080
they work--

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.020
their basic category.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.220
Whether they're from academia,
or non-governmental work, or

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.460
industry, government,
aboriginal, or if we didn't

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.360
have the information, we gave
them, I think, a gray color.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.050
So the point here, though, is
that you can click on the

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.870
business card and learn more
about the researcher.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.500
So when you click on the
business card, what we do is

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.030
we issue a very standard Google
search, searching for

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.820
the name of the researcher who
you clicked on, and their

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.420
university or their
organization.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.890
I think we also enter forest
management as well.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.870
And as any great Google search
does, it gives us a long list

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.240
of links, some of which are
more relevant than others.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.250
In this case, just getting ready
for this talk, I was

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.520
able to learn quite a bit
about this particular

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.640
researcher, Dr. Ed Johnson.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.910
And not only the project that he
had worked on and his main

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.290
homepage, which was the first
list, but also this really

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.630
interesting ecology education
project that

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.560
he works on as well.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.000
So it's possible to learn not
only what they have done in

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.860
this particular forest network,
but more broadly,

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.360
what it is that they've
worked on.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.480
This is, again, Java using the
prefuse library, with a thing

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.810
called a tree ML, tree
Mark-up Language.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.115
And it's basically set up to
say, David works in academia

00:19:32.115 --> 00:19:34.140
and Jane works in academia.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.350
David works with Jane, and
Jane works with Jim.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.840
And from that is produced that
large network that you see.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.370
So that's the second
of these four.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.480
I'll move real quickly
through the last two.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.350
So we also are curious where
projects were located, and

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.810
what are their results.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.150
Well there is a reporting
requirement, and was a

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.650
reporting requirement, in the
Sustainable Forest Management

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.740
for producing project reports.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.270
But those project reports,
they're basically stored on

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:05.890
their server as project
PR-145-2004, and they're

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.570
really pretty hard to get to.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.920
So what we did was to produce
this KML that's suitable for

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.980
looking at in Google Maps that
shows us where the study sites

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.730
of the Sustainable Forest
Management projects were.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.640
And this is a real simple thing
done with about 100

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.850
hours or so of an undergraduate
technician's

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:27.580
time, reading project reports
very, very quickly and trying

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.170
to pull out the relevant
information to

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.570
show them on a map.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.990
When you click on it, we use the
Google Spreadsheet Mapper

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.850
to show in a real
nicely-formatted structure,

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.640
the main information that
we have found in

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.505
those project reports.

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:44.110
So you can see, here's the title
of it, who the authors

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.020
of that project were, a little
excerpt from the beginning.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.870
You can also click on the PDF
of the project report, which

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.060
takes you into the window in the
database that's currently

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.540
managed by the Sustainable
Forest Management Network.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.655
And we can also do a Google
search like you already saw

00:20:58.655 --> 00:21:01.510
for the individual researcher.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.280
So the way that this was done
was actually quite simple.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.140
And I'd encourage other
organizations to do this.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.050
It didn't take very
long at all.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.960
What we did was we went to
the Network's website and

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.970
downloaded 200 or 300
project reports.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.520
And then read those reports,
looking for maps of the study

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.920
sites, or looking for, as you
can see there in the Methods

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.280
section, it says the 8,000
square kilometer area was

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.610
located in Prince Albert
Provincial Park at the

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.420
following latitude
and longitude.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.185
So that's where we located
that project to be.

00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:36.330
We then pasted the executive
summary and some other

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.072
interesting things, pasted all
that stuff into Excel in a

00:21:39.072 --> 00:21:41.490
very carefully-formatted way,
because the goal was to put it

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.550
into the Google Spreadsheet
Mapper.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.150
If you know what that does, then
you know it's just really

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:46.670
pretty amazing.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.470
If you don't know what it does,
what it allows you do is

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.250
to create these
nicely-structured info bullets

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.670
that you see on the left.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.800
So we took them from the Google
Spreadsheet Mapper,

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.320
produced the KML file, stored
that KML file to Google Sites,

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.840
and that KML file is suitable
for introducing into Google

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.390
Maps in simple ways
that you can--

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.430
I guess you could read
the labs for the

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.580
course to do that.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.220
You can also look at in a
typical way in Google Earth.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.350
And also, we're probably going
to embed this on the main data

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.480
server in a few weeks.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.260
So that's how we located where
projects were, which is a big

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.760
advance over where things had
been, and the way things had

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.940
been stored in the past at the
Sustainable Forest Management

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.170
Network data site.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.660
Finally, I'll talk about what
journal articles were created

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.550
through this network.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.800
That's one of the big measures
of the success of a large,

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.590
long-term network like this.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.260
And what we did was we took
a slightly different

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.110
perspective for this.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.430
Again, we scraped through the
information that we could find

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.230
at the network site.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.460
But in this case, we created
a collaborative MyMap.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.880
And I'll tell you more about
that in just a second.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.240
You can see the letters of the
alphabet there floating in the

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.490
bay in the northern
part of Canada and

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.760
that's a false location.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.960
That's just designed for
individual researchers to be

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.800
able to grab their letter, a
letter that represents their

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.410
article, and drag it across
the country to where

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.830
the study site was.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.880
Because we read the articles,
we knew where the sites

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.060
actually had been where these
articles have been done.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.430
But we wanted to introduce this
idea for researchers of

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.930
the ability for them to interact
with this over a long

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.640
period of time.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.890
We currently have it stored
as a public map.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.400
It's been viewed many thousands
of times, which kind

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.310
of surprised me when
I noticed that.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:38.520
But it seems like it's a useful
doorway into this work

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.490
that has been done.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.330
So when you click on it, you get
something similar to what

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.960
you've already seen, with the
addition of the little item

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.240
that says Search for Article
at Google Scholar.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.110
If you click on that, you see
the results of the Google

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.210
Scholar search.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.970
And that gives, of course, not
only the article itself and

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:59.490
access to the article, if that
access is warranted, but also

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:00.640
articles that are related.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.890
So in my case, I was able to
use this to find several

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.230
articles that were really
interesting to me on a couple

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.470
of different topics.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.230
So the way that was done
is quite similar.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.310
We went to the Network website
and looked at this PDF

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.700
bibliography of articles,
which was basically a

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.420
statement of the articles and
their citations of the

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.760
articles that were done over
a five or so year period.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.640
Put that through Google Scholar,
found those, made an

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.950
end node database, read all
of those articles-- again,

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.290
Jean-Francois did an amazing
job of that.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.070
Put them into Excel, took them
through the Spreadsheet

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.490
Mapper, but then imported that
KML into MyMaps that now is

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.960
editable by people who have
the password for this

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.630
particular map.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.990
So authors can move their
points around.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.950
So to summarize, there are four
main things that I've

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:48.650
talked about here.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.850
The first is our approach to
looking at data samples, where

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:56.530
the data samples are located
in this, for me, large, but

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.370
depending on the scale,
medium-size

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.390
network of science research.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.740
Where those samples
are located, and

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.930
what are their values?

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.070
Second, who worked with
whom in this network?

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.650
I think there's a real neat
solution to that, that also

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.070
gives additional value for
being able to find the

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.610
researchers in the network.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:18.030
And third and fourth, these
location-based ways of

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.950
interacting or at least viewing
the database of

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:25.530
project locations, project
reports, and journal articles.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:30.200
So like a lot of projects, there
are a lot of limitations

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.940
to it, I would say.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.190
And several things that we
really hope to do with it in

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.030
the future.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.890
The limitations are substantial,
I would say.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:40.610
It's a first draft of nearly
everything, so the program's

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.730
crashed from time to time.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:42.560
Not the Google Maps part.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.120
But the work that we've done
on the globe, and moving

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.500
around between prefuse and the
globe works pretty well.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.270
But at the moment, it's still
download-only, and so we'd

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.290
like to take that and eventually
make that into an

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.300
applet and store that on a web
page, so that we don't have to

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.560
encourage users to download a
new version every time we

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.010
correct a few bugs.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.370
I would say also, it's
not quite yet

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.050
ready for massive scale-up.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.630
There are some things in the
design that we would like to

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.230
change, and we'll be doing that
in the first few months

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.280
of next year.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.020
So we're interested in partners,
whether it's

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.660
organizational or just
individuals, to try to think

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.980
these things through.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.600
As I said, this is basically one
student's masters project,

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.880
and it's an extremely ambitious
project that I think

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.790
was really successful.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.000
And so for example, we like to
find out how we should best

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.020
make this transfer between the
server and the client to be

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.510
not just downloaded all at
once, but as needed.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.635
I know Google Earth does that
really well with their tiling,

00:26:37.635 --> 00:26:40.720
and so we may try to adopt
something like that as well

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.640
for ourselves.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.970
We're also interested in anyone
who hears or sees this

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.760
and is interested in testing
usability of this system.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.490
This is basically done as a
group of 5 or 10 individuals

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.870
making their best decisions.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.500
And also any creative
ideas on next steps.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.600
So you can see the link to the
websites where you could learn

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.250
more about this if you're
interested.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.650
And just to summarize again, the
idea here is talking about

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.660
this new virtual globe
application for submitting,

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.380
and sharing, and
visualizing our

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.980
point-based ecological data.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.870
Again this is the work mainly
of Rodolphe Gonzales, who we

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.950
co-directed, Lael and I. And
there's a lot of work that is

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.580
buried in the details here by
Gael, and Carolyn, and Benoit,

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.870
and Casey, and Jean-Francois.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.250
So again, thank you,
very much.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:30.520
And I appreciate the time.
