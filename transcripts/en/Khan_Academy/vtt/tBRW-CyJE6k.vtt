00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.370
The value of y is always
3 more than twice x.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:15.470
So we can say that y is
equal to 3 more than twice x.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.120
So it's 3 plus 2x is another way
of saying this first sentence.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.320
So is y a function of x?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.090
So whenever you're
asked whether something

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.090
is a function of something
else, you're really just saying,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.880
look, for any input x, does
it map to exactly one y?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.320
So if we say y is a function
of x, in order for this to be

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.080
a function for any x that
you input into this function,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.670
you must get exactly one y.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.490
So if you input an x you
must get exactly one y value.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.170
If you got two values, then
it's no longer a function.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.460
For any input, you
get exactly one y.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.360
You could have two inputs
that get to the same y,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.390
but you can't have
one input that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.070
results in two
different outputs.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.800
You don't know what the function
is valued at at that input.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.540
Now, here it looks pretty
clear that for any input,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.850
you get exactly one output.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.470
Any input uniquely
determines which y.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.090
It's not like if you
put an x in here,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.929
you're not sure what
y is going to be.

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:18.220
You know what y is going to be.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.970
If x is 0, y is 3.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.090
If x is 1, y is 5.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.230
And so this is definitely
a function of x. y

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.593
is definitely a function of x.
