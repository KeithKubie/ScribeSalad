00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.019
When people learn that JavaScript supports so many different class patterns,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.040
they frequently wonder which one they should be using or

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.590
which one is best and sadly there just isn't an answer to this question.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.570
As a language, JavaScript takes remarkably few stances and tends to

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.430
make the internal features visibly available to the programmer to play with.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.210
So rather than rights and wrongs their really only techniques and options.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.460
What we can do though is discuss the advantages and

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.400
disadvantages of the different techniques to help inform the decisions that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.790
we will make about which patterns to use on a case by case basis.
