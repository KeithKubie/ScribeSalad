00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
&gt;&gt; Sean: What does "Implementation" actually mean?
&gt;&gt; DFB: Well, at its simplest, you could say:

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.360
"It's writing a program to do it".
But, of course,  there's a lot of infrastructure

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.010
behind that. When you're devising a strategy 
a program, to do it one of the first

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.170
things you have to think about is, first
of all, what's the logical progression of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.460
what I'm trying to do in the program? And
secondly what kind of data structures

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.050
arrays, structures, whatever. What
infrastructure is needed to support all

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.219
that data while you're processing it? And
different people can have different ideas

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.760
about what the best implementation is. 
I mean, for example, we've had recently from

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
Alex Pinkney, linked lists. 
&gt;&gt; AJP: And this points to NULL because we're 
browsing NASA and then - read a bit about NASA - 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.940
clicked on the Neil Armstrong article!
&gt;&gt; DFB: I mean, some people are so mad about

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.920
linked lists they'd use them for anything! And
so, yes, I implemented it with linked lists

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.080
because it was the right data structure for
this particular thing. And then once you've

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.880
got the data structure you say: "Ah! but I felt 
that the best algorithm to use for this

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.520
because it's so similar to what he did .... "

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.110
Dijkstra's algorithm, you know, finding
your way from A to B, as it were.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.860
So the algorithm and the data structure.
In fact it was, I think, Niklaus Wirth

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.180
did a book once called 'Algorithms + Data
Structures = Programs'. So it's down

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.670
to saying: "What's your choice of both of
these things? Justify why you did it that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.799
way". And your implementation may differ
from other people's implementations

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.920
because they don't agree with you that 
that's the way to do it.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.020
There's no absolute right and wrong. One's
always amazed that what seems to be 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.290
absolutely the definitive way to do it - very
often it doesn't ...  is never proved

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.729
completely wrong. But there's always some
little tweak that you can put on the end

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.710
and you find this in things like coding
theory, y'know, we thought this was the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.810
best way to handle .....
No, somebody came up and said: "Actually

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.149
no, the basis of what you've done is
right but why not at the tail-end do it

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.019
this way, because that makes no end of difference." 
It's a bit,in a way, like saying Newton

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.519
was not wrong -  he just only told part of
the story and Einstein supplied the

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.410
rest. And that can so often happen in
programming. Very occasionally you do

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.250
get a completely new idea comes along. And
you say: "Hey, we could tear that up and do

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.849
it this way". That's once in a very long time. that is.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.450
&gt;&gt; Sean: Is there the equivalent sometimes of somebody
turning up to a Formula 1 track in a tractor ?!

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.940
Yes it's going to go around the track

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.250
but is it completely unsuitable?" 
&gt;&gt; DFB : To all the wonderful undergrad. students in

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.110
Computer Science out there, forgive me.
Yes, certainly sometimes you

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.410
look at programs that have been handed in 
and they really are

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.170
tractors trying to compete with 
MacLaren Formula 1 cars.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.959
Yeah, they get round, but y'know, in a
very non-optimal way. But sometimes, yes,

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.440
sometimes yeah one is amazed and
delighted by the ingenuity that people

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.100
can show in their choice of algorithms
and data structures. Something really new.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.970
And, I mean, back to the other video I've
done about "Poetry to

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.230
Programming".  A lot of us feel - and somebody
actually said this - was it

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.630
Tony Hoare, or Dijkstra, or Don Knuth ... ? 
It is like writing a poem! If you get your

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.139
implementation, your program, to work and
you think it's beautiful

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:34.870
you get a great sense of satisfaction.
and somebody does ... somebody out there tell

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.200
me who it is?. Somebody does call their
completed programs 'poems'.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.590
As we well know. Yeah! I know the feeling.
Turing was a shocker for wanting to do it even

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.069
though it had been done before. And
finding it all out for himself. Because he

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.489
didn't want the grooves in his mind to be
polluted by knowing how other people

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.410
had done it. Now that's fine, but at the
end, when you've done it, you've got to

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.400
say: "Has anybody done it differently
before?" And you've then got to take stock.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.889
Turing was a bit of a shocker for doing it
his way and not checking whether anybody

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.200
had done it before. If you remember he got his
Fellowship [at King's College Cambridge] with
tackling a problem

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.799
and he didn't realize until he'd done it. Because
he didn't want to look at how the people might

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.859
have done it!
They give him the Fellowship anyway but he

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.570
found it had been done four years earlier.
But actually his way had some nice

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.440
little tweaks in it.  and his tutor thought: 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.930
"That's nice that little extra tweak
you've done there - it's worth it!"

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.970
&gt;&gt; Sean: So, Implementation: sometimes you re-invent
the wheel; sometimes just go your own way?"

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.120
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yes, that's right. Yeah!
