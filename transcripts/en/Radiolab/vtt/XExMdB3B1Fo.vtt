00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.420
I remember Krulwich. I'm Molly Webster. This is radio lab.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.370
And this week Jad is off nestled into his office working on the next episode,

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:11.160
which will play with a lot of the ideas that came up in our,

4
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:15.750
in our last Gary Hart podcast. But like with pop stars in music, meantime,

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.610
we've decided to offer you guys a little Valentine's treat.

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.950
It's gonna be part prose, part musical in a hip hop sort of way, uh,

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.460
with some extremely cool guests. Really well, I promise you. Yes.

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.260
At the end of the show and it all grows out of a tail.

9
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.260
We heard about a very small animal,

10
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:37.500
which begins appropriately with a very small noise.

11
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.640
<v 1>Yeah. So, so in, in days gone by,</v>

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.190
people tended to die at home.

13
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:46.310
This is go back a couple of hundred years before that, our hospitals and so on.

14
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.960
This by the way, is David Gulson.

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.100
I'm a professor of biology at the University of Sussex in the UK and he told

16
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:54.980
this tale to producer lots of NASA. And I said, imagine that,

17
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:58.610
that Tina grandpa's l and it looks like he might die soon.

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.010
I started to know why that's funny. But uh, and so he,

19
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.770
so he'd be lying in bed upstairs and everyone would be, we'd be out of respect,

20
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.380
would be very quiet, you know, there'd be creeping around the highest,

21
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.480
it was a time called the death watch. And when everyone was really quiet,

22
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.430
they'd hear these faint and drumming noises coming from the,

23
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.950
from the timbers of the house.

24
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.960
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

25
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.450
<v 1>I can try and do an impression of the noise that, yeah, we'd love to hear.</v>

26
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:26.900
You may not work very well, but, but bear with me. Yeah.

27
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.403
<v 2>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.310
<v 1>Did you get that? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.870
So five or six identical beats and,

30
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.670
and legend has it,

31
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.900
but that was the devil drumming his fingers impatiently waiting for the soul to

32
00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:47.920
depart the body so that he could claim it.

33
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.200
But turns out actually it's the mating call of a tiny little beetle.

34
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.523
<v 3>Okay.</v>

35
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.950
<v 1>The death watch beetle, that's where it gets its name.</v>

36
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.540
So Dave became a kind of a fan of these Beatles. Oh yeah.

37
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.640
It's the widespread species in your hand. In fact,

38
00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:08.200
he's got a house that's full of it,

39
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.490
ate pretty decrepit as it's slightly falling down the roof leaks and uh,

40
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.180
and whatever. But it's, it's home to a whole host of these little beetles

41
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.323
<v 3>bet.</v>

42
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.820
<v 0>And in the quiet he can hear them.</v>

43
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.070
<v 1>So a while ago he found himself wondering,</v>

44
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:29.540
what's this noise really all about at which you might not think would be a great

45
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.560
mystery. Um, but what he discovered is it's all about

46
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.410
<v 4>love or at least sex.</v>

47
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.190
So today, a story that reminds us how difficult,

48
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.990
lonely, how hard

49
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.810
the meeting game can be.

50
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.240
<v 0>Perfect. Valentine's Day.</v>

51
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.080
So we will begin at the beginning of the life cycle. Yeah.

52
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.270
<v 1>So, so the female beetle lays an egg on that, on, on a, uh, a piece of deadwood.</v>

53
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.730
He would watch them and the moms would just, you know, drop their babies random.

54
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.310
Oh yes, I'm here. Some,

55
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.940
they're usually into a hole in a log or into a wood beam and it hatches into the

56
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:19.450
little tiny white grub. So you might have this little thing, your pitch black,

57
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.120
you know, and its own little tunnel on its own. I need starts chewing.

58
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.800
Uh, I choose the way the wood very, very slowly

59
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.020
and eventually about 10 or 15 years later,

60
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.750
years later, 15 years, yeah.

61
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.330
For a decade or more for things. Um,

62
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.530
and eventually it reaches the magnificent size of about a quarter of an inch,

63
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.750
uh, at which point [inaudible] eight p pite so it turns into a little,

64
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.220
a little Chrysalis and, uh, a few months later, the adult beetle

65
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.453
hatches out of that.

66
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.870
And so finally it crawls out of the log and onto the surface.

67
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.890
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

68
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.690
<v 1>is that the first time they see light? Yeah, Yup. That will be it.</v>

69
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.330
Oh Wow. So they say any of the adults that you ever really see, um,

70
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.740
and they possibly the most boring looking insects you could imagine.

71
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.600
They're about a quarter of an inch long bullet shaped dull brown. Um, they,

72
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.230
they really easily mistaken for mice droppings actually. And the,

73
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.740
the adult only has really one job and that's to mate. So the male below,

74
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.050
he has to find himself a female.

75
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.340
So he's got his work cut out for one thing as an adult. He, he doesn't eat,

76
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.210
he can't feed. So he's going to starve to death in a couple of weeks or so.

77
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.210
On top of that. He's nearly blind. Yeah. Uh,

78
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.360
and that's where this strange drumming noise comes in.

79
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.450
That's their way of finding each other in the, in,

80
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:58.140
in the usually rather dark places where they live. That's your way of saying

81
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.510
<v 6>hello. Hello.</v>

82
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.680
<v 1>Yeah. And they make it by drumming their head. So the male Beatles,</v>

83
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:09.690
he kind of braces himself and then he wax his head five, six times in. Oh,

84
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.540
you say drumming the head. You mean banging the head? Yeah,

85
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:14.220
he's like headbutts the, the, the,

86
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.070
the timber he's sitting on where these kinds of forehead if you like.

87
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.540
So that's what makes the drumming note.

88
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:22.020
He's basically whacking his head against that, against the wood. So

89
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.980
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

90
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.360
<v 1>he comes out of his hole,</v>

91
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.900
<v 7>um,</v>

92
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.960
<v 1>just one does a bat</v>

93
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.890
and does his little drumming noise. Now,

94
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.430
if a human happens to hear him, people these days,

95
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:43.600
they tend to spray their houses with insecticides and that's the end of the

96
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.810
Beatles.

97
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.890
<v 6>Oh. But yeah,</v>

98
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.630
<v 1>let's assume you, yes. Let's assume that he doesn't get fumigate. Okay.</v>

99
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.930
He just keeps wondering about banging his head and he pauses for a second,

100
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.500
kind of listening to see if anyone replies. And there's no, there's no reply.

101
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.563
One design.

102
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.640
Unfortunately, according to David Death,

103
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.330
folks beetles are quite rare these days.

104
00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:13.680
So there is a distinct chance the pull mail will never find a female. Ah,

105
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.560
this just gets more and more depressing. They pretty sorry, I'm laughing.

106
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.310
Um, and can you tell the same story from the, from the female's perspective?

107
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.260
Yes. Yes. She just, she just sort of is.

108
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.970
She just waits in silence for three weeks and if no one comes, she just,

109
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.690
she just started, this kills. Everyone dies. Yeah, she does what?

110
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.970
She wanders around a little bit,

111
00:06:35.971 --> 00:06:40.080
I suppose in the hope that she might encounter a male. But that's, that's,

112
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.920
that is all she does. So that's a tedious life, I'm afraid.

113
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.710
But let's imagine again, for the sake of argument,

114
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.820
that after the 15 years of chewing and no fumigation for them at all,

115
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.870
they lets them think, wow. They get really lucky. He gets a reply,

116
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.090
they find each other,

117
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.830
she makes the noise immediately after she hears the cry of a, of a male.

118
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.313
Yeah. And he gets,

119
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.170
Ben gets very excited cause he may have been wondering about banging his head

120
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:17.150
for four days and this little duet gets going. He starts to run a rind,

121
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.600
banging his head over and over again. Yeah. This is the, this is,

122
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.590
this is his moment. And eventually by a lot of trial and error,

123
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.620
and occasionally they got it wrong and fell off the edge and were never seen

124
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:32.480
again. But more often than not, he would eventually find the female and,

125
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.750
uh, the males will immediately jump on, on top of her.

126
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.480
And he then continues to draw me his head.

127
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:42.560
But this time he's not headbutting the temporaries. He's whacking her, um,

128
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:44.660
which, which I mean each to their own, you know,

129
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:47.510
presumably that works for a female death watch beetle.

130
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.460
But because they're very short sighted,

131
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:53.000
they will often jump on the wrong way round. And, and that's,

132
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:56.930
that's not so good. Um, because the females can actually control,

133
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:01.000
like he can't force them to mate. So he has to persuade her to,

134
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.760
to cooperate or else he's going nowhere and then he can humans tell them it's

135
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:09.740
going well. Well, so you usually, she, she carries on replying.

136
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:12.320
So she, he's banging her in the back of her head and she's,

137
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.820
she is then drumming her head on the wood underneath and that's usually a good

138
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:19.970
sign that you, if she carries on banging her head on the, on the timber,

139
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:22.020
that that means she's probably going to make with them in the,

140
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.660
in within the next minute or two.

141
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.630
But they've says when he has watched this happen,

142
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.870
he's noticed that quite often the females wouldn't make,

143
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.170
even though you know that maybe you've been sitting there for days waiting for a

144
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:34.010
partner to come along.

145
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.590
And then when one finally does and he finally gets to them,

146
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.230
they're not interested. You know, it's not good. They weren't,

147
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.900
they only have three weeks. That is so shocking to me.

148
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.990
This is a very discerning lady that she chooses death over an ugly mate.

149
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.980
Well, I guess she's not actually Ci. She's hoping that she'll get a better mate.

150
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.930
There's another fish in the sea, another efficiency hopefully. But I thought,

151
00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:00.570
well, what's the difference? Why are some males successful in some not?

152
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.870
And it quickly became clear that the heavier the male,

153
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.630
the more likely he was to be successful.

154
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.850
So is there some explanation for why? So actually these things, they,

155
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.850
they produce quite staggering amounts of sperm. It turns like, Whoa,

156
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:16.980
what is standard? What do you mean by staggering?

157
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.960
The average was 13% of his body weight. 13%.

158
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.200
So I mean, what if that were us? Like what would that be like?

159
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.400
We were talking about three or four gallons. So, um, you know,

160
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.270
think about that from Roger's best. Not to think about that too much really, but

161
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.450
it's a slightly disturbing.

162
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.600
So the deep tragedy here would be to be a member of this species and to be born,

163
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.350
scrawny, scrawny. Yeah. I mean, just out of curiosity, I just, how big are you?

164
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.390
Um, I'm moderately skinny, so please love me. I'd be in trouble anyway.

165
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.670
Um, so what I'd,

166
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.670
what I really wanted to know where the females actually just weighing in the

167
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:01.560
males or was it something that was correlated with being a big male, you know,

168
00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:05.370
maybe they were stronger or made a lighter noise or something. And so,

169
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:10.200
so the obvious way to try and find out was to artificially change the weight of

170
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:15.060
the males to make tiny fat suits for the well, exactly. Yeah.

171
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.500
Not Quite, but, um, I wish this worked for people. That would be hilarious,

172
00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:21.600
but I don't think it does. Um,

173
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.750
so we have this stuff called blue tack in the UK.

174
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:27.360
Do you have blue tack over there? I don't know, but it's not like sticky tack,

175
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:28.290
sticky tack. I guess.

176
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:31.410
He used to stick posters on the wall and so Dave went to the store,

177
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.250
bought some of this stuff and then just beat it up into little bits and stuck

178
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:38.670
them on the back of, of males to make them a little bit heavier.

179
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.940
And for the skinny males, it worked an absolute treat.

180
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.680
I do feel slightly mean that, uh,

181
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.220
those poor females obviously were getting a bit shortchanged, but, uh,

182
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.330
hopefully they managed to produce some eggs anyway because in the end they find

183
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:58.500
these beetles, the males and the females, surprisingly charming. And after all,

184
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:01.710
he does live with them. A lot of them, they are still in my house.

185
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:06.210
They're still chewing away at the beans. I, I been, I'm torn, you know,

186
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:09.060
part of me knows that if I don't spray them as some insecticide,

187
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.980
then eventually the roof will start to collapse. But it's gonna take decades.

188
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:18.040
And I kind of quite like having there. So, so for the moment I,

189
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.640
they've been spared and uh, uh,

190
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.240
I can't quite like listening to them tapping away in the springtime.

191
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:29.510
So you're sitting in bed at dawn or dusk and you hear the quiet banging and you

192
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:34.500
think, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, it's funny, isn't it,

193
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:36.990
that people thought this was a sinister noise and actually it's,

194
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.310
it's all about love.

195
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.793
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

196
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.210
<v 0>thank you to Dave Golson who wrote a book all about these bugs,</v>

197
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.120
a buzz in the meadow, the natural history of French farm. Oh wait, this is,

198
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.910
I didn't mention to you that it's a French farm.

199
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:08.080
He has this little place in France that he goes to one month a year and that's

200
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:12.610
where he communes with his beetle friends and has one of the saddest months.

201
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.720
Thank you. I thought this drug is terribly sad.

202
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.280
I found it. It made me think that dating in New York was pretty easy,

203
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.740
right? For people who are feeling, if you're feeling said,

204
00:12:25.741 --> 00:12:29.340
we want to end that problem right away. In the next part of this show,

205
00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:34.450
we're going to revisit this story in such a crazily new way for us.

206
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.310
Um, the guys from Hamilton, the hot Broadway show,

207
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.140
I told some of them this story that you just heard and they have decided to um,

208
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.590
to musicalize the tail and they will do that right after this brief pause.

209
00:12:47.931 --> 00:12:52.550
But Oh, before, while, during the pause, you know how Raunchy this story is?

210
00:12:52.551 --> 00:12:55.520
Well, it only gets more so when it's in the musical towel.

211
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.280
So you might want to ask your, your little ones to, uh,

212
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.560
leave the room around now.

213
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.100
And then you should by all means stay for the after party.

214
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.400
<v 10>This is Melanie calling from Durham, North Carolina.</v>

<v 0>I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Molly Webster. This is act two in which I, you know,</v>

219
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:31.720
when I put together these, any story as you know,

220
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.650
I just wander around and tell it to every single person I know as I'm sure you

221
00:13:35.651 --> 00:13:37.750
do it. All right. So yeah, it could be strangers.

222
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.690
And so I was talking to a friend of mine who's a in the theater named guy named

223
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.340
Tommy Kale. And I'm talking to him and I'm thinking,

224
00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:45.580
I'm wondering what's going on in the minds of these little,

225
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.620
assuming that they have mines, these little animals. Cause it seems so unfair.

226
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.780
15 years issuing and then this. So he said, you know, we could be those beetles.

227
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:57.280
We, who's the we built,

228
00:13:57.281 --> 00:14:01.960
we is an improvisational freestyle group called Freestyle Love Supreme.

229
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.100
And it's now this, I should tell you what the Tommy goes to Lin Manuel Miranda,

230
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.210
who's no joke, who is Hamilton in the hit musical Hamilton. And he writes,

231
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.590
he says, I'll be one of the Beatles. And then they go to Oak Tosh, uh, Ambedkar,

232
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:18.130
who was in a movie called pitch perfect when he played a rapper. And by the way,

233
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:21.210
this is all guys like this is like you have to think of himself as in,

234
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.810
in an Elizabethan Beatles situation. This is Shakespearean watch beetle.

235
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.840
That's right. All the lady Pi's will be played by mail,

236
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.810
but Lynn's going to be the woman and is going to be the man.

237
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.650
So here is the mail beetle being the beetle that he hopes he can be.

238
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.320
<v 11>Hey ladies,</v>

239
00:14:40.321 --> 00:14:44.610
also the way to Zolpha get ready for the beautiful Beto Casanova.

240
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.620
He is I and I am him.

241
00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:50.430
The most masculine Beto by the name of slim net evolution made me small.

242
00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.710
So Walker slipped through the cracks.

243
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:54.380
I'll be the first one to jump on on lady beetles back.

244
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.880
But it's hard out here when I'm not playing the human beings here, Megan,

245
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.050
and they get the sprayer. They think that I'm the devil,

246
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:04.190
so they get a few [inaudible]. They don't understand that I'm only procreate in,

247
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.360
but I'm slimmer, so I'm a winner. I finally see the sun people, shorty.

248
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.020
I know that she the one, so I'm like, Vito, baby doll. Let's get involved.

249
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:14.540
I want to give it to you all right here on this low.

250
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.190
Have you want to do that with my entire life and feels so good to finally find a

251
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.280
wife? Yeah, I get routine. I'm your chosen,

252
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:24.920
but can you remind me which end it goes in?

253
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.920
<v 0>Goes in, goes in. This is hard. Yeah, but right out there for a beetle,</v>

254
00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.560
but for the female played by Lin Miranda. I mean,

255
00:15:31.561 --> 00:15:35.130
she's going to have her own agenda. She needs to find a guy. It has to be.

256
00:15:35.131 --> 00:15:37.110
She hopes it will be the best guy, but I don't know.

257
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.920
<v 4>Sound byte is knocking. Could this be</v>

258
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.450
[inaudible] Ben, is this amazing?

259
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:51.030
Wait in my Mama told me to never said I was did is,

260
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.250
I was terrible.

261
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.910
I'm looking for Hattie with the body for the sperm and deep doubt,

262
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:57.140
a heart of gold.

263
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.790
But when you hear that knocking and it's a sound, sorry,

264
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.640
this is the grass was green there. Was there a heavier of song?

265
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.700
Sound bad snacking. But I am a beetle worth waiting.

266
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.970
I'm going to wait for something. Whoa.

267
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.590
<v 0>The power of the female and the sadness for the guy. But this is</v>

268
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.720
<v 12>Valentine's Day. No, I'm sweating.</v>

269
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.670
Lame Dude. And she's like, Oh my God,

270
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.380
I've waited 15 years for this and I can't do it with you and she has to move on

271
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:37.490
and fall off the table.

272
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.690
<v 0>Okay? Okay. But now you know that professor Goulston is our cupid.</v>

273
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:45.650
Here he is right after effects. Save both of our sad souls. Yes,

274
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.760
with the sticky tackle. Here is the, this is the kind of a lame,

275
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:51.290
validated carbon. I'm thinking about it,

276
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:56.030
but here is our finish to our own Valentine's tail,

277
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.470
little Romeo and Juliet Ish. Actually.

278
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.760
<v 4>Again, I'm going to make you mark at the end of the day.</v>

279
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.930
I'm half blind. Where are you? Fine. Here you are. You're, wait a minute.

280
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.890
<v 11>I bet you will know my life long to put the work in veto, baby dog.</v>

281
00:17:14.891 --> 00:17:16.540
Don't let me die a virgin.

282
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.540
I'm Sur in the love of burn like embers of the one and only love.

283
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.540
Keep banging your head on the timber. I agree. It'd be easier with Tinder,

284
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:27.540
but let me lose

285
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.920
[inaudible] give you some of my beetle juice saw. Loves knocking. Okay.

286
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.140
I know it was playing it cool before, but seriously,

287
00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:38.510
I got no clue what I'm doing. So if you could help me out,

288
00:17:38.511 --> 00:17:42.030
you'd be doing me a real solid. You found your way to me.

289
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.360
Little did she know before I beat it. The doctor helped me achieve

290
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.130
slim, Windsor and

291
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.720
<v 0>dead. Then what a way to go.</v>

292
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.783
