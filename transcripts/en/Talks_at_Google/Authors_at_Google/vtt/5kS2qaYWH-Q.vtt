[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.380
AARON ZEMACH: Everyone please
welcome to Google, Ben Ratliff.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.847
Hi, Ben.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:14.805
BEN RATLIFF: Thank you.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:16.350
AARON ZEMACH: So
just to get started,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.940
I was wondering
if you could talk

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.090
a little bit about your
history with music criticism,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.764
how you got started in
reviewing music in your career.

00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:34.140
BEN RATLIFF: I grew up in
a family of non-musicians.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.680
But for one reason or
another, I was always

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.840
oriented toward listening
closely to music.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.920
I don't know why, but I was.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.990
And it just started
with whatever

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.090
was at hand, whatever
records we had in the house.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.220
I was also a musician,
and I started

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.100
to play along with things,
and that was fun too.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.020
And that was important,
because then I could actually

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.830
enter the music and find
a place to figure out

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.040
how I can actually get
into the space of it, which

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.070
has been a recurring
question for me as a writer.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.510
How can I do it and
how can we all do it?

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.970
And then, at a
certain point somebody

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.600
handed me a jazz record when I
was a teenager, a Miles Davis

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.490
record.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.830
A family friend said, I
think you might like this.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.120
And that started a
long interest in jazz.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.560
I went to a university that
had a great radio station.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.260
And going to the
radio station which

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.220
had a great collection
of-- this was in 1985,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.500
when I started college.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.300
And they had a really big
collection of records,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.190
particularly jazz records.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.230
And that was my first
experience of the internet.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.050
I like to ask people, what
was your first experience

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.460
of the internet before
there was an internet?

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.860
AARON ZEMACH: Oh, sure.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.480
Of the social internet.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.500
BEN RATLIFF: Of the
idea of muchness,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.340
the idea of everythingness,
before there was an internet.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.950
So here was the great matrix.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.340
Here was the great
body of knowledge.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.920
So where do I start?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.720
I just start with what I know.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.370
So I found my way to what I
knew, the records that I knew.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.720
And then I thought, OK,
well what led to this?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.990
I know this one record
by John Coltrane.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.900
What created this record?

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.250
What led to this record?

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.680
And so then you go backwards.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.910
So I learned a lot
about music that way.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.190
And also I was a writer and
thought of myself as a writer.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.800
And so it just sort
of became inevitable

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.930
that I'd be writing about music.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.820
AARON ZEMACH: Uh-huh, great.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.530
So you sort of
talked about the way

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.840
that you're always finding
new ways to listen to music

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.100
and get into music.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.750
And one of the
premises of this book

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.790
is that a lot of the
ways that we typically

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.730
think about listening to
music don't suit us very well

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.090
in this age of the cloud
where we have infinite access

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.910
to all music at all times.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.280
So what are the ways that you
feel people typically listen

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.195
to music, or the framework
that they think about music in?

00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:48.540
BEN RATLIFF: Well,
this is anecdotal.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:58.640
But I do find that in
the 10 years since--

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.170
let's say in the 10
years since Spotify,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.320
and in the greater
amount of time

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.610
since, getting music
easily or for free

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.520
or whatever from the
internet has become

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.430
a normal practice in life.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.800
I find that a lot of people
are faced with a choice.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800
And they might not even
know that it's a choice,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.760
but it is a choice.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.330
And the choice is either
kind of like bottomless--

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.310
I guess like an
infinite shallowness,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.290
or a bottomless comfort zone.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.470
Because by the time you become
a kind of engaged listener,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.310
or somebody who likes
music, you sort of

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.480
have an idea of what
it is that you like.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.360
And what the internet offers
you is the possibility

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.600
of being able to
listen to a larger

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.890
circle of what it is that you
like forever until you die.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.630
And it's not as narrow
as it used to be.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.950
It's much larger.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.040
But it's basically related
to your self-definition

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.960
as a listener.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.560
Or you can do
something else, which

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.450
is to be a little more
active and to think

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:24.710
of all that you have access to.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.210
We have access to--

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.270
it's not everything.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.670
In fact, it's not
everything, not even close.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.430
But there's so much of it that
it can feel like everything.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.550
And so what are we
going to do about it?

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.760
How are we going to
access what we don't know?

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.810
How are we going to walk
toward what we don't know?

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.340
Which to me feels
like the challenge,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.050
I guess, but also the gift.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.560
Because I lived half my
life before the internet,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.010
before the internet
became popularly used,

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.290
I guess I still think
in terms of libraries,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.200
of physical libraries.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.700
That's my metaphor.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.320
It's hard to shake it.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.460
And so often, in
the conversations

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.084
that I often have with
people about music today--

00:06:22.084 --> 00:06:23.750
what do you like,
what do you listen to,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.360
how do you find new music?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.980
The word overwhelmed
comes up often.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.100
And so often that in fact,
it's become a kind of cliche.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.950
People just don't even know
how to express their feeling

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.510
and they reach for
that word, overwhelmed.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.960
So then I think
OK, well so, that's

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.550
funny, because let's say
you walk into a really

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.160
fantastic library, like a great
institutional library, the New

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.650
York Public Library, or
the one up at Columbia,

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.350
or the one down at NYU.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.060
When you go in there,
especially if you

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.410
can sort of get a
sense of the stacks

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.720
and have a sense of how big
it is, is the first thing

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.020
you think oh, overwhelmed,
like I'll never have time

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.040
to read all this shit.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.430
Or do you or do you think
something on the order of, wow?

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.170
It kind of makes me
feel good that there's

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.700
been all this human thought.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:41.030
And I wonder how I can start
from what I know and find

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.600
reasons to get back
into those other rooms,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:50.195
those other shelves, that as of
yet, I have no reason to go to?

00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:51.350
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.420
So I wrote down some
of the examples.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.020
So the book is a
series of essays,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.144
I should say, about some
of these different methods

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:02.000
to try to unlock some
of the aspects of music.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.030
I wrote down examples of
some of the chapters, things

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:12.680
like repetition, slowness,
speed, to sadness or intimacy.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.140
So there's sort of this
wide range of different ways

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.440
that you talk about being
able to listen to music.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.364
When you were thinking
about this book,

00:08:20.364 --> 00:08:22.280
how did you come up with
those different ways?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.770
Are these the ways that you
discovered that you naturally

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.909
listen to music?

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:27.950
Or are there other ways
that didn't get included?

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.720
Where did those
categories come from?

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.250
BEN RATLIFF: Sure.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:37.010
Well, I'll just
tell you quickly why

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.650
this book and the structure
of it and whatever.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.210
I started thinking about
this about five years ago.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.220
I was a music critic
for a newspaper,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.970
for "The New York
Times" for 20 years.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:01.400
And I started thinking about
the music appreciation movement

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.000
in this country, which is
sort of like late 1800s

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.550
to about 1960.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.270
A lot of people sort
of like me, often they

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:16.040
were newspaper writers,
would write books

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:24.530
for the general readership
that were sort of saying, oh,

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.880
so you want to know about music?

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.280
You want to feel you know
something about music?

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.370
Well here's some keys
to figuring it out.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.250
And almost always
these books were

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.860
about Western classical music.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:43.770
And it was about what the
composer wanted you to know.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.660
This is what rhythm is,
this is what harmony

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.170
is, this is what melody is,
and then on and on toward this

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:56.910
is so sonata form, this is
what an oratorio is, whatever.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.560
And there are many
books like this.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.500
And I was thinking, well,
what would that look like now?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.530
What would a book like
that look like now?

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:11.250
First of all, it wouldn't be all
about European classical music,

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.860
because we know now that as
rich as that tradition is,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.360
it's not everything.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.840
It's one of many possible
things that we can listen to.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.670
And also the big
thing that's changed

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.700
is that listeners have
become so much more powerful

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.280
in a way because of our access.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.304
Access is power.

00:10:32.304 --> 00:10:34.470
So I thought, well, it would
be interesting to write

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.960
a book that was much more from
the listener point of view

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.310
rather than from the
composer point of view.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:44.250
So at the same time,
I was listening

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:49.050
to a James Brown record a
lot called "Ain't It Funky."

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:54.930
And there's a seven minute song
on it called "Ain't It Funky."

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.910
And it's really repetitious,
and the repetition of it

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.920
is what's great about it.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.900
And repetition is just such
an interesting subject.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.410
And plenty of people
have written about it.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.840
There are a number of really
good songs called "Repetition."

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.220
And so I thought, OK,
well, this is a great place

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.839
to start a book, writing
about repetition.

00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:26.130
So if you write about James
Brown's kind of repetition,

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.505
then it only makes
sense to write

00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:29.760
but Steve Reich's
kind of repetition

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:36.086
and Chic's kind of
repetition and repetition

00:11:36.086 --> 00:11:39.680
in more top 40 music,
Rihanna or whatever.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.180
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah, I wrote
down one of my favorite examples

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.210
was in like one paragraph,
you talk about Benny Goodman's

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.430
"Sing Sing Sing,"
and also Kesha's

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.730
"We R Who We R" as two
examples as ways to--

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:55.620
BEN RATLIFF: Well, I guess the
stealth argument of the book

00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:01.200
is keep your receptors open.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.844
Listen to everything.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.410
Perhaps it doesn't
work for everybody.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.700
I understand that.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.910
And perhaps that in
fact, for many people,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.240
the idea of listening
to a playlist where

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.420
the musical tradition
in that playlist

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.920
changes radically
every five minutes

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.630
might be annoying or
disturbing for some listeners.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.320
I understand that.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.470
But I guess I have
a baseline idea

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:47.400
that there's a sort of
virtue in listening broadly.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.550
There's a virtue in keeping
your receptors open.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.200
There's a virtue in being
able to move forward

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.620
in the world with what you
know, but be open to things

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:05.040
that you do not recognize,
and listen to it

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.820
and ask the question,
what's my way in?

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:15.000
How can I make use
of this and how can I

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.291
feel that it is also about me?

00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:20.790
AARON ZEMACH: So if you're a
person who's sort of interested

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.112
in gaining that broad-- you want
to broaden your musical atlas--

00:13:24.112 --> 00:13:26.070
I know you don't like
the term genre very much,

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.280
so I'm trying to avoid
that specifically.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.870
Maybe you'll have
to get back to that.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.280
If you want to broaden those
musical qualities that you're

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.437
listening to and you have
access to this seemingly

00:13:42.437 --> 00:13:44.020
infinite music
library, what would you

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.020
recommend as a first
step to start trying

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.020
to broaden from where you are?

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.730
BEN RATLIFF: OK, so here's where
my talk becomes maybe tricky,

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.260
or it might sound evasive.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:03.040
I tried hard not to talk
about platforms in this book.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.720
In other words,
this isn't a book

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:11.530
about how to find all the
music that might inspire

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.630
you or enlarge you or whatever.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:19.360
It's more about suggesting ways
of staying open, suggesting

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:25.390
ways of creating your own
little through lines for music.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:30.520
And I do believe in
happenstance and dumb luck.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.690
Music is sort of coming at
us from everywhere now--

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:44.250
in shops, in waiting rooms,
online, and of course,

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:44.875
in the streets.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.290
Especially if we enter a
neighborhood that we're not

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:58.030
that familiar with,
or if we go to a place

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.030
that we've never been to before,
or a city that we don't know

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.292
that well, whatever,
we can hear music

00:15:03.292 --> 00:15:04.750
that we've never
confronted before.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.040
It's easy.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.400
It can happen all the time.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.160
So then for instance,
there's a chapter

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.760
in here about-- so
repetition is chapter one.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.842
The other chapters
as you said include--

00:15:18.842 --> 00:15:20.300
there's one about
loudness, there's

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.940
one about quietness,
and so forth.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.500
Until by the end
of the book, I'm

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:32.750
talking about categories
that only I have thought of

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.690
and are only particular to me.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.240
And these are just
suggested ways.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.520
The point is I want to
give this to readers

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.929
and they can take it in
a direction they want.

00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:43.720
But there's for instance,
a chapter in here

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.850
about a certain kind of repeat,
the way sometimes a note

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:53.060
is repeated in a piece
of music, stubbornly.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:59.080
Not a structure of repetition,
but just one, a singer

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.330
or an instrumentalist
or whatever,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.390
repeating one note over and
over and over stubbornly

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.510
for an effect.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.880
Rock and roll fans
will recognize

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.310
that in the guitar solo in
"Cinnamon Girl" by Neil Young.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.060
For some reason
and rock and roll,

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.890
it's a big thing when it's done.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.990
"Cinnamon Girl" is known as--

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.840
that's the song where
the guy plays a solo

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.270
and it's just one
note over and over.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.610
Isn't that weird?

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.570
And it is kind of
weird, and it's great.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.050
But in other kinds of
music it's really common,

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.110
it's really routine.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.135
In Afro-Latin music,
it's just normal.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.360
More and more in
hip hop, it's kind

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:53.260
of normal, what people
maybe describe pejoratively

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.800
as monotone rap.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.266
That's a device,
that's an effect.

00:16:59.266 --> 00:17:00.640
And often the
rappers aren't just

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.010
hitting the same exact
note over and over,

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:08.420
but a very general
area around a note.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.760
So the point is, we
can all encounter

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.450
examples of this,
wherever we go,

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.109
and think about
music in that way.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:25.240
And by doing so,
the idea of genre

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.520
sort of goes out the window.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.950
And I find that
freeing, or at least

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.070
it creates a possibility
for knowing about more,

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.390
rather than knowing about less.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.181
AARON ZEMACH: Sure.

00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:41.050
So now that you've sort
of formalized in a sense

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.230
these different
categories in this book,

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.390
do you find that it's affected
the way, when you start

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.650
listening to a new album
or go to a concert,

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.460
is it affecting the way that
you're listening to music?

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.750
BEN RATLIFF: Yeah, sure.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.240
Because as a critic,
I think what I always

00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:00.190
did was I would listen to a
piece of music and think OK,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.720
so what is the essential
thing going on here?

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.520
Such that if you took
that essential bit out,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.800
it just wouldn't be as
special, or the whole thing

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.420
would sort of fall apart.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.150
What is the essential
thing, whether it's

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.540
a certain kind of technique
or a certain kind of mood,

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.180
or a certain kind of
structure or whatever,

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.690
what is that thing that
makes this piece of music

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.460
extraordinary?

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:36.350
And just to give you
an example, right now

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.230
I read "The New York
Times" every morning.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.430
I'm a subscriber and I
read the print version,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.890
because I like the idea that
by scanning across the pages,

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.300
I'm going to encounter something
that I don't know about

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.500
by happenstance.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.040
I like that.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:58.100
And over the past few
months, every time

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.320
I read the paper
when I'm done, I

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.250
want to put my head in a toilet.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.985
I really feel hopeless.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.390
But I've been listening to
a record now these days.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.830
And I realize,
this is the record

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.950
that makes me want to take
my head out of the toilet.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.160
And it's called "Coltrane
Plays the Blues."

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.090
It's a record by John
Coltrane, the jazz saxophonist.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.970
It's not like one of
his most famous records.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.320
It's from 1960, about.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.650
Every track uses the blues
form, blues structure,

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:42.185
but they're original blues, I
think all written by Coltrane.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.010
Why do I like it?

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.860
What is the essential
thing about it?

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:55.440
It's because this record
expresses certainty.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.630
It is completely present.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.170
There are these four people in
a band making music in a room.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.170
And you feel the
dimensions of that room,

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.400
because sometimes Coltrane
moves his saxophone away

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.030
from the microphone and
you feel a sense of space,

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.580
where they're making the music.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.990
You feel a sense of urgency
in what they're doing,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:28.180
and also a sense
of the long game.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.570
There's urgency and wisdom.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.440
Like they're going
to put everything

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.290
they have into this moment
and be fully present,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:48.470
and yet they are able to see
rather far into the future.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.660
And that's how I want
to feel right now.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.939
[CHUCKLES] I want to see beyond
what's going on right now.

00:20:54.939 --> 00:20:56.480
I want to be able
to see beyond that.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.660
And I want to feel urgent
and present and alive.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.360
So that's what I'm
listening for at the moment.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.350
I'm listening for that
feeling specifically

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.460
as I move through life.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.039
That could be chapter number 21.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:15.830
AARON ZEMACH: It feels
like we kind of just

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.740
watched you construct review
for "Coltrane Plays the Blues"

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.494
up here on stage.

00:21:21.494 --> 00:21:23.660
As you were thinking of
writing a piece of criticism

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.850
or a review, is that sort of
the process you go through

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.320
of listening,
finding that thing,

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.955
and translating it to the page?

00:21:32.655 --> 00:21:35.300
BEN RATLIFF: Yes.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.790
I try to find the one
essential thing that

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:46.160
for me, makes something
special, and then really bear

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:55.490
down hard on it and describe
it as well as I can, almost

00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:04.420
in a ritual sense, which sort
of mirrors the ritual going on

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:09.200
in the music and honors it.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:18.170
Yes, and so if I can put
my finger on that one

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.770
essential thing in the music
that makes it powerful,

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:26.480
special, whatever, describe
it well, and really get

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.930
going, then in the best sense,
in the best possible situation,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.000
something of the
essence of that music

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.156
can actually sort of
rise up out of the text.

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:41.510
[LAUGHS] I know it
sounds mystical,

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:48.080
but otherwise you're
just describing music,

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.510
or you're evaluating something,
thumbs up or thumbs down,

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.300
which feels sort
of limited to me.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.620
AARON ZEMACH: Sure.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.200
So we're going to open it up
to questions from the audience

00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.954
in just a minute.

00:22:59.954 --> 00:23:01.870
So if you have a question,
we have microphones

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.560
on either side of the stage.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.320
You can go line up.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.990
Before that, kind of
off of that question,

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:11.130
I'm interested if anyone here in
the audience or watching later

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.420
is interested in starting
a career in music

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.370
journalism or music
criticism, what

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.895
would you recommend to someone
who is just starting out?

00:23:18.895 --> 00:23:23.680
BEN RATLIFF: Well,
there are many more

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:29.200
places to write about music now
than there were when I started,

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.600
say, 25 years ago.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.370
And that's great.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.670
They don't all pay
very well or at all,

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.120
but when you're starting, you
don't need to worry about that.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:52.330
The point is, I think it's
important to know the identity

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.450
and character of these different
publications or websites

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.490
or whatever, try
to figure out some

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:03.900
that you really identify with
that you feel strongly about.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.300
And if you start to
think, I'd really

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.720
like to see my
name there, I would

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.930
be good with that if I
could see my name in there,

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:18.730
I'd be really proud of that,
move toward that place.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.200
It might take
several steps and it

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.970
might take some months or
a year, but move toward it.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:30.712
Start thinking in terms of what
kinds of writing do they use?

00:24:30.712 --> 00:24:32.170
What kinds of
writing can they use?

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.790
What kinds of
writing do they want?

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.140
Start writing that way.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.180
That's how to get involved.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.327
And then from there, you can go
in whatever direction you want.

00:24:43.327 --> 00:24:45.410
AARON ZEMACH: Go straight
to "The New York Times."

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.618
BEN RATLIFF: Straight-- yeah.

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:49.326
AARON ZEMACH: So we have some
questions from the audience.

00:24:49.326 --> 00:24:51.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hi.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.770
So I think it's pretty
obvious that the internet has

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.170
changed the music industry.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.920
But given that you've
been following music

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.378
both before and
after the internet,

00:24:58.378 --> 00:25:00.950
do you think the internet
has changed music itself.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.730
And if so, how?

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.560
BEN RATLIFF: Yeah, I do.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:12.420
I think in a way that punk was
a funny forecast of internet era

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:17.040
music, because the whole
point was to do it cheaply.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.000
And it was like an ethic
of doing it cheaply,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.590
and a value of doing it cheaply.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.180
And now of course, everybody's
making music on their own,

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.470
because we've got the tools.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:36.450
It's very easy to make a
good record in your room.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:45.220
And I suppose there's
the ease of it,

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.270
which means there's a whole
lot more music appearing.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:26:00.260
And also I do think that
there's a certain flattening

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:05.360
of the hierarchy of influences.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:17.730
In the old days, if you were
a certain kind of songwriter

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.740
or musician, there were--

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.470
I'm trying to think
of concrete examples

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.070
so this doesn't
sound so abstract.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:32.910
But for instance, if you were
a jazz musician in the '80s,

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.800
it was very important for you
to know about Coltrane and Miles

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.250
Davis and Charlie Parker,
but probably not so important

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.580
for you to know
about Sidney Bechet

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.430
and what happened
before the '40s,

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:53.460
and not so important for you to
know about free improvisation.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.940
Because that stuff just wasn't
quite as easy to come by.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.010
It wasn't quite as plentiful
and easy to come by.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:06.270
But now the internet made
everything equally accessible.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.480
So that became the big change.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.940
You found greater numbers
of many, many more kinds

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:21.030
of influences on each
individual artist,

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.270
and used in unexpected ways.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:33.030
In the '90s, it still felt
unusual to hear a Timbaland

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:37.230
production and to hear the
startling sounds in it that

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:42.180
came from a totally
different musical tradition.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:46.950
It was still startling
to hear a DJ mix that

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:56.250
might move from current hip
hop to Jamaican dance hall

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:00.360
to some kind of 20th century
classical music, whatever.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:07.380
Now it's almost expected,
it's so easy to do.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.980
So those are some of
the changes, I think.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.320
AUDIENCE: So in your
Coltrane example,

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.810
you talked about Coltrane
walking away from the mic

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.400
and it changes the sound.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:26.860
Do you ever go into a song and
listen to a song or music piece

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.220
from the standpoint of
the recording engineering?

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.750
That changes everything, right?

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.870
We've gone from this
analog technology where

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:37.840
you can get these
warm distorted pieces

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.780
to this digital technology
where that's replicated

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.820
or not quite the same.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.060
So one of the things we've
kind of lost in this transition

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.675
to digital, perhaps, are
really good liner notes.

00:28:49.675 --> 00:28:52.060
And you don't always see who
the recording engineer was,

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:59.220
but you give a musician the same
room and the same instruments,

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.940
but a different
recording engineer.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.640
And it's going to have
a different sound.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.920
So how often do you go
into looking at music

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.472
from the recorded sound?

00:29:09.472 --> 00:29:11.310
BEN RATLIFF: More
and more, actually.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.350
Yeah, it makes a difference.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.120
The engineer/producer,
those roles

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.290
are sometimes
interchangeable, they're

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:27.580
sometimes the same thing.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:32.820
Yeah, it makes a big difference.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:40.030
A piece of recorded music
isn't just a reference.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:49.330
It isn't just a
document of something

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.640
that happened in a certain
time at a certain place.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:59.470
It's evidence of
a physical space.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:07.990
And especially when live
musicians are involved.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.830
But even in electronic
music, a physical space

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.950
can be suggested.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:23.030
And yeah, I'm just
saying yes, yes, yes.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:27.500
But yeah, and the work of
engineers and producers

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.520
has very much to do with this,
I think, of the suggestion

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.057
of music as a physical space.

00:30:36.057 --> 00:30:40.750
AUDIENCE: So in the answer
to your previous question,

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.730
you referenced the punk
movement and doing it cheaply.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:48.440
But more and more people
are working at home now.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.640
And you find many great
musicians are really

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.010
poor engineers.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:59.420
So we've gone from these big
halls, Abbey Road, real world

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.690
studios, to people making
music in their bedrooms.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:08.529
How do you think that has
affected the recorded medium

00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:09.445
that we hear nowadays?

00:31:12.616 --> 00:31:17.440
BEN RATLIFF: I don't think that
it's made us worse listeners.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.820
I have great faith in listeners.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.620
I have great faith
in listeners' ability

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:29.694
to accept music, either
as the simple thing,

00:31:29.694 --> 00:31:31.610
a certain document of
what a musician is doing

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.990
at a certain place and
time, versus something

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.180
bigger, something
that does suggest

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:41.200
something greater, an
environment, a moment

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.300
in history, whatever.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.175
There's so much variation
in what can happen.

00:31:52.907 --> 00:31:53.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.948
BEN RATLIFF: Yeah, thank you.

00:31:58.128 --> 00:31:58.930
AUDIENCE: Hi

00:31:58.930 --> 00:31:59.620
BEN RATLIFF: Hi.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.700
AUDIENCE: I really
loved what you

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.040
were saying about getting
outside of our music comfort

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.330
zone and sort of walking the
streets in new neighborhoods.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:10.960
Yet I feel this undeniable
gravitational pull

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.570
to my headphones at all times.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:17.050
I feel like part of it's that we
sit in an open office culture,

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:19.180
and so just to concentrate.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.830
But I find myself
even sometimes just,

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.149
it's like I reach for it
before I even think twice.

00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:25.690
And I just love to
know your thoughts

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.740
on when headphones are a good
thing, when we should second

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.895
guess our headphones, and just
know your thoughts on that.

00:32:32.895 --> 00:32:35.020
BEN RATLIFF: Yeah, that's
a subject that I've never

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.100
really dealt with in writing
that much, I think because I'm

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:46.000
afraid of leaning toward the
automatic response of take

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.850
your headphones
out of your ears,

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.640
listen to what's
going on around you!

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:58.570
Because that seems manifestly--

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:02.620
it's almost a truism that
taking your headphones out

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.270
of your ears is a good thing.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.700
It increases your
spatial awareness.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.750
It clues you into how
other people are talking.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.390
It makes you more
sensitive to the world

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.400
around you, et cetera.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.870
But I use headphones a lot.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.340
And why is that?

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.920
Because I like the
sustained experience

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.470
of immersion in music.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.500
We all listen to music more,
I think, than we used to.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:45.000
There was a poll two years ago.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.350
I think it was a Nielsen poll.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:51.090
And I think another
polling group or research

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.600
group called Edison something
also did the same kind of poll.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.670
And they both came up with
the same basic answer,

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:58.770
which is that most
Americans listen

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.920
to music for four hours a day.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.160
And that's really a lot.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.310
And I imagine that a lot of that
is probably done on headphones.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:18.780
And yeah, we do live more
individualized lives.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:25.560
We are more in tune with
our particular streams

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.500
of information or culture.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.810
I suppose it's part of
how we're surviving.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:34.710
It could be that.

00:34:38.502 --> 00:34:41.520
AUDIENCE: When you think
about the sort of social

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.980
versus solo as a
platform for listening,

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.360
I haven't read your book yet,
but I absolutely will now.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.780
Is that something that
you discuss and headphones

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.190
playing a role in that solo
versus social experience

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.010
listening to music?

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.400
BEN RATLIFF: It is not
something I discuss in the book,

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.330
and I'd really like to discuss
it at some point in the future.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:07.570
Because it's really interesting.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:11.550
If you think about what
music is for originally,

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.790
like way, way, way
back, it's something

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:20.280
that was done with people.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.880
Either you were making
music with other people,

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:30.990
or it had something to do
with the church, or whatever.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.840
So the experience of
music totally solo,

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:40.290
which is just so
common, is a new thing.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.880
I do it every day.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.980
But I don't talk about
platforms in the book.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:50.040
But I will say that my
current sort of filter,

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.990
the thing that I trust more than
anything else to deliver music

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.110
to me, is not an algorithm
but an internet radio

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:02.810
station called NTS
that's based in London.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:11.550
And to me, it is sort of like
my dream of musical breadth

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:17.970
with very little sense
of a corporate entity

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.850
trying to say we're
this radio station,

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.380
we're the kind of
radio station that

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.330
gives you this, listen to us!

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:25.980
There's very little of that.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.500
There's no commercials,
there's nol nothing.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.310
It's just 24/7 DJs
who really know

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.440
what they're doing,
and presenting

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.390
all kinds of different music.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:40.620
So I listen to that
every morning for an hour

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.560
and I'm good.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.240
But I do that with
headphones, so it's

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:49.470
a very immersive experience.

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.246
That seems to be what I want.

00:36:51.246 --> 00:36:54.162
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:54.162 --> 00:36:55.056
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:55.056 --> 00:36:55.680
BEN RATLIFF: Hi

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.400
AUDIENCE: I got a little
bit late to this talk,

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.358
so I don't know if you
already touched this, so

00:36:59.358 --> 00:37:01.120
apologies if you did.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:07.180
So I find myself listening to
a lot of music from '60s, '70s,

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.840
'80s.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.100
And as you were
saying earlier, when

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:17.650
I look at the album of the year
of like "NME," "Pitchfork,"

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:21.400
any publication,
I get really sad.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.230
I try to give it a go and
it doesn't really work out.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.490
So it just seems
like I'm not really

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:31.150
into music that people are
making these days, or not

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.690
so much.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:41.230
So my question to you is, do
you feel like music distribution

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.850
platforms like Spotify
who will play music,

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:47.888
do feel like that
they devalue music?

00:37:47.888 --> 00:37:49.370
BEN RATLIFF: Interesting.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:53.690
So you're saying that music from
the '60s was better than music

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:55.040
now.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:00.916
And that part of what has led
to that problem is Spotify.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.050
AUDIENCE: A
paradigmatic example is

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:09.800
that for example, the other
day I had never listened to it,

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.600
but I started listening to
an album from Black Sabbath.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.685
BEN RATLIFF: Which one?

00:38:14.685 --> 00:38:16.060
AUDIENCE: I'm
trying to remember.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:16.870
Master--

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:18.245
BEN RATLIFF:
"Master of Reality."

00:38:18.245 --> 00:38:18.829
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.870
"Master of Reality,"
because I got this last song

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.300
and I was like, yeah,
this is really cool stuff.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:29.210
And I could see myself before
music was so easy for me

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.030
to just open
Spotify and hit play

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:35.090
and it was playing for me,
even in the times of Napster,

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:37.980
I would have to actually
go have the effort

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.134
to download the album.

00:38:39.134 --> 00:38:40.550
And it would be
just sitting there

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.924
and I could just
open the folder,

00:38:41.924 --> 00:38:45.080
so I had to go through that.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.650
But what happens now is that
I go, I give it a few plays,

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:50.570
I listen to the record for--

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.790
I don't know, not
even a week, maybe.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.800
And I'm already done with it.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.150
And I just go fast forward.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.140
Whereas before, I think
I would just maybe

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.480
ruminate a little bit more.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.870
BEN RATLIFF: You're
suggesting that it's not even

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:03.845
the music's fault.

00:39:03.845 --> 00:39:06.110
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.700
That's my question,
like do you think

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.770
that the platforms
devalue music?

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.520
Do you think that
because it's so easy

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.660
to reach that artists
will slack off

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.280
or it will be so easy for people
to listen to other artists

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.780
so they would just
not put as much effort

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.570
into making nice melodies?

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.100
BEN RATLIFF: I think
it can de-value,

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.235
that there can be some
devaluing going on, yes.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.310
When I was a
teenager, I would have

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:43.820
to go great distances to find
a certain kind of record.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.030
And the journey that
I took to do it,

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:50.030
whether it was bicycling
or taking a bus

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.090
or going to another
city or asking somebody

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:59.090
to mail me a copy or whatever,
the effort expended seemingly

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:03.890
to me added value to the
music once it finally arrived

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.170
and I put it on the thing.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.440
And that created
more value, sure.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:23.130
A colleague of mine
once said to me,

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:27.540
I think I was telling this
colleague that same exact story

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.500
or whatever.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.710
And he said oh, so
then you'd rather

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:37.320
go get water from a well
every day, like [GRUNTS],

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.230
drag it all the way into your
house maybe several times

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.860
a day?

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:47.010
You'd prefer that than
just turning on the tap?

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:50.010
And no, I wouldn't prefer.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:53.130
I would prefer to
turn on the tap.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.520
I think that as long as
you are aware of how easy

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.120
it is, as long as you really
are aware of how easy it

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.730
is to just press one button
and immediately you've

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:07.950
got Beach House or
whatever, then that helps.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:15.790
But there's another question.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.620
It sounds like you're
saying that music

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.490
from before had more value.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:24.400
AUDIENCE: To me it did.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.290
The other time I
saw a picture where

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:30.580
it had the lyrics from
a Led Zeppelin song

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:35.070
compared to lyrics from I don't
know, a nowadays indie artist,

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.840
I couldn't remember who he was.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:41.080
And the Led Zeppelin ones
were like so ordinated,

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.500
it was so masterfully crafted.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.280
Like Steely Dan, I was
listening to it the other day.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.590
And they were such
good tunes, that you

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.070
could see that they had
been worked and reworked

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.280
and reworked.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.550
And I don't see anyone
doing that nowadays.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.300
I don't know if it's
because it pays less,

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.542
it's not as rewarding.

00:41:56.542 --> 00:41:58.000
I don't know if
it's because people

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.540
are just not into that anymore.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.440
I'm kind of trying
to look for an answer

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.540
to why I like that stuff
before, and it's just nowadays

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.365
nothing really moves me like--

00:42:09.365 --> 00:42:12.205
BEN RATLIFF: I'm not
convinced by that argument.

00:42:12.205 --> 00:42:15.010
I do think that there's
a lot of new music

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:19.780
that is every bit as
exciting as music that

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.570
was made in the '60s and '70s.

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:27.430
Sometimes what is new about
it, is often the question.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:30.700
And sometimes the ways
that it is new are just,

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:34.720
they're smaller ways.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:42.460
But I think that Salon's
record is particularly good.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:46.600
I think the new record by Cass
McCombs is particularly good.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.920
I think that there's
plenty of people making

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:56.050
music that has lots of stuff
going on, lots of thought,

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:57.756
lots of--

00:42:57.756 --> 00:42:59.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:00.760
Maybe then another
question would be,

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.130
why is it not that mainstream?

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.380
But maybe I think someone
else wants to make question,

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.040
so I'll probably cut it here.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.765
But thanks.

00:43:07.765 --> 00:43:10.420
BEN RATLIFF: Sure.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.200
There is another way of
thinking about it too.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.010
There's a writer named Marc
Fisher who died last month.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:25.870
And he was a British
Marxist, sort

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:31.120
of cyberpunk-influenced
academic music obsessive writer.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.490
And he wrote a lot
about music, a lot of it

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.490
on a blog in the
aughts called K-Punk.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:43.540
And his theory was
that we live in a time

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:48.031
where there's no
more originality

00:43:48.031 --> 00:43:49.420
and it's all stopped.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.930
And the reason for that has to
do with, he blamed capitalism.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:01.000
Marc Fisher said
that it's now easier

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.340
to imagine the end of
the world than to imagine

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.940
the end of capitalism.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:20.560
And so he talked about music
with a sense of great loss,

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.495
it's so much harder now to
imagine the future, a future.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.390
I'm not nearly that doctrinaire.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:33.090
And I believe that in the
way we listen to music now,

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.440
we are still
participating in music

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.310
in lots of different ways.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:42.600
Even when we're listening
to something on SoundCloud

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:47.700
you know and somebody will put
a little comment in somewhere

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.730
along the way, and the
comment will be like ooh,

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:55.470
or I love that part right there.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.560
This is part of how we interact.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.960
And also, of course,
going to live performances

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.730
and taking part, participating
in the culture around music.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.480
This is all still going on.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.680
All of this suggests
that music has a future

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.521
and that participation
has a future.

00:45:13.521 --> 00:45:14.625
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:18.990
I'm curious about your
ideas on the validity

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.330
of not liking something.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.840
As a music critic or
just as a consumer,

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.229
what happens when you
just listen to something

00:45:27.229 --> 00:45:28.145
and you don't like it?

00:45:28.145 --> 00:45:32.410
Do you think it's on your
part to try harder to like it?

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.230
Or do you think
maybe at some point

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:36.605
you could just give up and be
like, I just don't like it?

00:45:36.605 --> 00:45:38.430
BEN RATLIFF: Yep,
you can give up.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:40.024
I think you can give up.

00:45:40.024 --> 00:45:46.790
But I think that if
you can be specific

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.520
about what you're
giving up, and maybe

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.280
if you can accept
the possibility

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:58.580
that that particular music
that you decided is no good,

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:03.410
that particular recording,
song, artist, whatever,

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.830
may come from a
tradition that has

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:12.640
things that will be
really meaningful to you,

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.120
that you might like.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.890
I think that's good.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:26.810
I guess what I don't like is,
when people these days say,

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:29.300
I'm the kind of person who--

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.790
like, my blood freezes.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:35.270
I'm the kind of person who just
doesn't like such and such.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:39.410
And usually it's a big
thing, it's a big thought,

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:43.760
it's a big area, it's an entire
tradition of music or whatever.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.370
I just think, ugh.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.340
What a loss, what a loss.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.570
So you don't like this
one techno record.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:56.480
Does that mean
that all techno is

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.520
going to be terrible for you?

00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.390
Probably not.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.300
So maintain curiosity
is all I'm into.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.810
But that's what I'm into.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.237
But there's plenty of
things that I can't stand.

00:47:11.237 --> 00:47:12.189
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:12.189 --> 00:47:13.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was kind of curious

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.310
if you ever had to review
an album that maybe

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.010
everybody likes but you're
just like, I can't stand it.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:22.830
At what point can you just be
like, just hand off to somebody

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:23.330
else?

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:24.350
BEN RATLIFF: Yeah.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.840
Often I was able to hand
it off to somebody else.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.420
And sometimes I had
to go through with it,

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.595
and really felt like an alien.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.510
And I can't think of a
single example of these.

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:48.415
But yeah, I had definitely
had that experience for sure.

00:47:48.415 --> 00:47:49.284
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:49.284 --> 00:47:51.950
AARON ZEMACH: We've got time for
one more question really quick.

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:53.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:58.910
Do you think there
is any wrong way

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.550
to recommend music to people?

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.560
BEN RATLIFF: Do I think
there's a wrong way

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.130
to recommend music to people?

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:09.680
I have kind of a grudge
against algorithms.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:13.580
And here's why.

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:23.660
Algorithms, they will exist.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:27.080
They will continue to
get better and better.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.550
They're not going away.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:32.360
So I feel fine in saying that
I have a grudge against them.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.879
And sometimes
they're useful too,

00:48:33.879 --> 00:48:35.420
because they will
put in front of you

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.900
a song that you've
never heard before.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.090
There's a value to that.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.040
That song is probably
related to things

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.990
you already know,
and is probably

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.780
being put in front of you
so as to make you feel

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.080
comfortable-- comforted, even.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:59.540
And to me, it feels like--

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:03.500
well, what I've learned
from watching stalker movies

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.610
and also from having worked as
a music critic at The New York

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:10.970
Times" and having worked
with music publicists

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:16.820
is that I don't trust
people who come to me

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:21.800
and say, I know you're
going to like this,

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.655
because I know about you and
I'm anticipating your desires.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.310
If they love me as a human
being and they say that,

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.530
there's nothing better.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:42.292
But if they're saying that for
professional or financial gain,

00:49:42.292 --> 00:49:43.625
I don't trust them for a second.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:53.940
I don't know.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:02.280
I guess my advice to people
is to use algorithms,

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.630
but know that they're faulty.

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:06.840
Know that they're limited.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.700
Know that they don't
really know what you're

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.320
going to be thinking tomorrow.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.010
They can't.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.710
They're predicated entirely
on who you were yesterday.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:27.060
To try to imagine new
things, new ways of listening

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.480
that you haven't done
up to this point,

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:37.140
that's imagining a future.

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.850
That's what being able
to imagine a future is.

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:41.415
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:41.415 --> 00:50:43.540
AARON ZEMACH: I wish we
could stick around and talk

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.570
about music all day, but we've
got to wrap up, unfortunately.

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:48.310
We have "Every
Song Ever" for sale

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:50.500
in the back of the
room afterwards.

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.179
And I'd like to thank Ben once
again for coming to Google.

00:50:53.179 --> 00:50:53.720
Thanks a lot.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:58.570
[APPLAUSE]
