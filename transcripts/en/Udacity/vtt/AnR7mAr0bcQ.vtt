00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.900
As Tali said, you don't need a lot
of money to get media attention.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.220
But like other things with startups,
when you spend less money,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.115
you'll have to work harder
yourself to make things happen.

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:11.670
A best practice to get prepared for

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.525
media coverage is to
have your own press kit.

00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:18.150
The press kit holds all of the things
you want to share with the press when

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.365
they cover your story.

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:23.865
You're going to want to make sure
your press kit has quality assets.

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:26.937
This is simply an information
packet about your business or your

00:00:26.937 --> 00:00:30.867
product with images, screenshots, icons,
and other media you want to share.

00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:35.595
You should include general information
about your startup, your product, and

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:36.117
your team.

00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:39.991
You should also include high
resolution files with your logo,

00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:42.330
icons, screenshots of your app, and

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.777
other marketing images such as
people using and enjoying your app.

00:00:46.777 --> 00:00:48.757
The goal here is to make
your product shine.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.660
So include whatever does that.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.591
You could also include
a picture of your team,

00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.250
especially if it's an A+
team you want to brag about.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.400

additional examples of press kits.
