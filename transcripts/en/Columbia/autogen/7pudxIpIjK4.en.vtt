to take interest and we began to see a
 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.830
to take interest and we began to see a
number of rapid changes in the way in

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840
number of rapid changes in the way in
 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.540

think about Harlem all urban

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410

the process of what's known as

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770
the process of what's known as
 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.340
the process of what's known as
gentrification we sometimes see rapid

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350
gentrification we sometimes see rapid
 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.410
gentrification we sometimes see rapid
change in urban neighborhoods but

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420
change in urban neighborhoods but
 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.940
change in urban neighborhoods but
imagining Harlem and its sheer size the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950
imagining Harlem and its sheer size the
 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.699
imagining Harlem and its sheer size the
fact that it covers three city districts

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709
fact that it covers three city districts
 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.310

the fact that it has a few hundred
 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.340
the fact that it has a few hundred
thousand people as residents make it a

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350
thousand people as residents make it a
 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.580
thousand people as residents make it a
very unique kind of place in terms of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590
very unique kind of place in terms of
 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.670
very unique kind of place in terms of
urban change so to imagine the kind of

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680
urban change so to imagine the kind of
 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.290

time and all of these factors create
some interesting dynamics and I also

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.290
some interesting dynamics and I also
 

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.470
some interesting dynamics and I also
think a cultural dimension is very

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.550
important to take into account when we
think about urban change and of course

think about urban change and of course
 

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.890
think about urban change and of course
as you will hear throughout this course

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:13.900

United States not only among
african-americans but in the world and

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360
african-americans but in the world and
 

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.330
african-americans but in the world and
among people of African descent all over

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:24.340
among people of African descent all over
 

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.930
among people of African descent all over
the world it has symbolically been in

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:27.940
the world it has symbolically been in
 

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.830
the world it has symbolically been in
some way shape or form synonymous with

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:30.840
some way shape or form synonymous with
 

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.510
some way shape or form synonymous with
the progress of people of African

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:33.520
the progress of people of African
 

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.820
the progress of people of African
descent with the culture of people of

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:35.830
descent with the culture of people of
 

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.860
descent with the culture of people of
African descent and so there is a

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:37.870
African descent and so there is a
 

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.900
African descent and so there is a
uniqueness about Harlem and is that very

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:39.910
uniqueness about Harlem and is that very
 

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.180
uniqueness about Harlem and is that very
uniqueness which has attracted people to

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:42.190
uniqueness which has attracted people to
 

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.480
uniqueness which has attracted people to
the neighborhood from all over the world

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:44.490
the neighborhood from all over the world
 

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.300
the neighborhood from all over the world
over the years and so part of the

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:48.310
over the years and so part of the
 

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.540
over the years and so part of the
question is the degree to which the

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:51.550
question is the degree to which the
 

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.250
question is the degree to which the
development that's happening in Harlem

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:53.260
development that's happening in Harlem
 

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.880
development that's happening in Harlem
now is actually in some way shape or

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:56.890
now is actually in some way shape or
 

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.640
now is actually in some way shape or
form upholding some of the culture that

00:12:59.640 --> 00:12:59.650
form upholding some of the culture that
 

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.390
form upholding some of the culture that
has existed the reality is that change

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:03.400
has existed the reality is that change
 

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.820
has existed the reality is that change
is going to happen everyone has to be

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:05.830
is going to happen everyone has to be
 

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.730
is going to happen everyone has to be
prepared for change in some shape or

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:08.740
prepared for change in some shape or
 

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.620
prepared for change in some shape or
form and it's important to balance this

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:12.630
form and it's important to balance this
 

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.150
form and it's important to balance this
conversation and say yeah obviously all

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160
conversation and say yeah obviously all
 

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.610

neighborhoods evolve all neighborhoods
change but the question remains in terms

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.410
change but the question remains in terms
 

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.070
change but the question remains in terms
of what kind of change so one of the

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:23.080
of what kind of change so one of the
 

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.290
of what kind of change so one of the
things I sought to find out is the

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:25.300
things I sought to find out is the
 

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.440
things I sought to find out is the
degree to which some longtime residents

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:27.450
degree to which some longtime residents
 

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.310
degree to which some longtime residents
actually experience the

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320
actually experience the
 

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.750
actually experience the
kinds of changes that have been

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760
kinds of changes that have been
 

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.610
kinds of changes that have been
happening in the neighborhood what's

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:33.620
happening in the neighborhood what's
 

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.740
happening in the neighborhood what's
benefiting them what's challenging to

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:35.750
benefiting them what's challenging to
 

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.080
benefiting them what's challenging to
them and what was very interesting is

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.090
them and what was very interesting is
 

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.660
them and what was very interesting is
that there was indeed a very balanced

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:40.670
that there was indeed a very balanced
 

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.120
that there was indeed a very balanced
view and as you can see in listening to

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.130
view and as you can see in listening to
 

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.580

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.090
and even in terms of changing the
demographics of the neighborhood to have

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:43.100
demographics of the neighborhood to have
 

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.610

situations are not necessarily isolated
 

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.410
situations are not necessarily isolated
and that people are in in some way

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:56.420
and that people are in in some way
 

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.420
and that people are in in some way
integrated with those who have greater

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:58.430
integrated with those who have greater
 

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.480
integrated with those who have greater
resources so the kinds of changes that

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:01.490
resources so the kinds of changes that
 

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.120
resources so the kinds of changes that
take place in these kinds of urban

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:04.130
take place in these kinds of urban
 

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.150
take place in these kinds of urban
environments we have a mixing of people

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160
environments we have a mixing of people
 

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.530
environments we have a mixing of people
from different economic and racial

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:08.540
from different economic and racial
 

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.720
from different economic and racial
backgrounds does have its benefits to a

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:10.730
backgrounds does have its benefits to a
 

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.690
backgrounds does have its benefits to a
certain degree but I think there is a

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:13.700
certain degree but I think there is a
 

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.900
certain degree but I think there is a
certain insecurity about where the

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:16.910
certain insecurity about where the
 

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.970
certain insecurity about where the
changes are going I think there is a

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:18.980
changes are going I think there is a
 

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.250
changes are going I think there is a
certain insecurity about what kinds of

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:23.260
certain insecurity about what kinds of
 

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.470
certain insecurity about what kinds of
influence that people can have over the

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480
influence that people can have over the
 

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.150
influence that people can have over the
changes in the neighborhood I thought

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160
changes in the neighborhood I thought
 

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.470
changes in the neighborhood I thought
the first thing that people were going

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480
the first thing that people were going
 

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.010
the first thing that people were going
to say was the the prices going up

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:33.020
to say was the the prices going up
 

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.230
to say was the the prices going up
that's the thing that bothers people the

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240
that's the thing that bothers people the
 

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.380
that's the thing that bothers people the
most and what became very striking to me

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:38.390
most and what became very striking to me
 

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.650
most and what became very striking to me
is that was was very much on people's

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:41.660
is that was was very much on people's
 

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.079
is that was was very much on people's
mind was the issue of part two

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:44.089
mind was the issue of part two
 

00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:47.590
mind was the issue of part two
the patient the degree to which longtime

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600
the patient the degree to which longtime
 

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.829
the patient the degree to which longtime
residents felt they had a say in the

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839
residents felt they had a say in the
 

00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:53.230
residents felt they had a say in the
kinds of changes that have been taking

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240
kinds of changes that have been taking
 

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.420
kinds of changes that have been taking
place in their neighborhood and part of

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:55.430
place in their neighborhood and part of
 

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.889
place in their neighborhood and part of
the irony of some of the changes that

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:56.899
the irony of some of the changes that
 

00:15:56.899 --> 00:15:59.410
the irony of some of the changes that
have taken place in Harlem is that it

00:15:59.410 --> 00:15:59.420
have taken place in Harlem is that it
 

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.509
have taken place in Harlem is that it
was the resident organizing on blocks

00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519
was the resident organizing on blocks
 

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:04.179
was the resident organizing on blocks
that made a lot of the blocks in Harlem

00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:04.189
that made a lot of the blocks in Harlem
 

00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:06.579
that made a lot of the blocks in Harlem
safer and it was some of that resident

00:16:06.579 --> 00:16:06.589
safer and it was some of that resident
 

00:16:06.589 --> 00:16:08.889
safer and it was some of that resident
resident organizing that made those

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:08.899
resident organizing that made those
 

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:11.230
resident organizing that made those
blocks more palatable to people from the

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240
blocks more palatable to people from the
 

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.079
blocks more palatable to people from the
outside and so there is a sense that

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:14.089
outside and so there is a sense that
 

00:16:14.089 --> 00:16:16.749
outside and so there is a sense that
people feel they toughed it out they

very important to look at issues of
 

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.490
very important to look at issues of
choice and I think that while the

choice and I think that while the
 

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.650

thinking among them and I think the
consistency more lies in the very

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:12.290
consistency more lies in the very
 

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.600

affected are in so many different
environments now there was a process

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:09.920
environments now there was a process
 

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.150

this something that is going to pass and
 

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.520
this something that is going to pass and
the real estate values will then go down

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:40.530
the real estate values will then go down
 

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.580

there are some of those buildings that
are not sold out so even now you can see

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020
are not sold out so even now you can see
 

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.190
are not sold out so even now you can see
some of those kinds of changes this is

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200
some of those kinds of changes this is
 

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.860

housing is always cyclical in that sense
and then you have to ask the question

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:19.970
and then you have to ask the question
 

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:24.289
and then you have to ask the question
about the degree to which in certain

00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299
about the degree to which in certain
 

00:29:24.299 --> 00:29:27.710
about the degree to which in certain
markets you don't see the downturns so

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720
markets you don't see the downturns so
 

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.330
markets you don't see the downturns so
if we look at the downturns that are

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340
if we look at the downturns that are
 

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.120

there are certain parts of the country
where you're not seeing a downturn where

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:38.910
where you're not seeing a downturn where
 

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.530
where you're not seeing a downturn where
you're seeing stabilization in terms of

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:41.540
you're seeing stabilization in terms of
 

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.810
you're seeing stabilization in terms of
increases in prizing of housing and one

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820
increases in prizing of housing and one
 

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.460

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:18.500
began to leave and ultimately they were
 

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.760
began to leave and ultimately they were
okay we can allow some of you all to

okay we can allow some of you all to
 

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:23.380
okay we can allow some of you all to
come in but we're going to charge you

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:23.390
come in but we're going to charge you
 

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.960
come in but we're going to charge you
higher rates to come in at that and then

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:25.970
higher rates to come in at that and then
 

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:28.300
higher rates to come in at that and then
ultimately Harlem became black so I

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:28.310
ultimately Harlem became black so I
 

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.040
ultimately Harlem became black so I
don't think there's any guarantee that

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.050
don't think there's any guarantee that
 

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.970
don't think there's any guarantee that
that Geographic

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:30.980
that Geographic
 

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.720
that Geographic
space will always remain black it is a

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:34.730
space will always remain black it is a

prawn is prime real estate there are

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:37.490
prawn is prime real estate there are
 

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.640
prawn is prime real estate there are
significant interests in that particular

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:39.650
significant interests in that particular
 

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:43.960
significant interests in that particular
area so part of the question is the

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:43.970
area so part of the question is the
 

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:46.810
area so part of the question is the
degree to which preservation is a part

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:46.820
degree to which preservation is a part
 

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.690
degree to which preservation is a part
of the agenda in terms of the long-term

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:49.700
of the agenda in terms of the long-term
 

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.470
of the agenda in terms of the long-term
development of Harlem and I think it is

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:26.490
mm-hmm well I have really biased this
 

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.000
mm-hmm well I have really biased this
side of the room so I'm going to take

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.010
side of the room so I'm going to take
 

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:50.750

you how feasible do you think is to to

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760

social and changing it that sounds
previously

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:02.730
 

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:07.140
what factors do you think are going to

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.150
what factors do you think are going to
 

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:14.910
what factors do you think are going to
be required in order to maintain

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920
 

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.390
mm-hmm is it feasible to preserve

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400
mm-hmm is it feasible to preserve
 

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.730

things we love about Harlem well I do
think it's feasible I think it's

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:28.460
think it's feasible I think it's
 

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:32.200
think it's feasible I think it's
definitely feasible I first of all some

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:32.210
definitely feasible I first of all some
 

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.380
definitely feasible I first of all some
of the new establishment that have come

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:35.390
of the new establishment that have come
 

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.830
of the new establishment that have come
into Harlem have not necessarily focused

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:38.840
into Harlem have not necessarily focused
 

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.160

on things other than black culture right

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:42.170
on things other than black culture right
 

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.650
on things other than black culture right
so there has been an interest among

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:44.660

harlem in preserving that culture so I

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880
harlem in preserving that culture so I
 

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.570
harlem in preserving that culture so I
think the continuation of that will be

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:52.580
think the continuation of that will be
 

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.440
think the continuation of that will be
very important I also think an

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:55.450
very important I also think an
 

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.870
very important I also think an
understanding of that value the value as

00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880
understanding of that value the value as
 

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.660
understanding of that value the value as
I just mentioned that can be gained by

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:01.670
I just mentioned that can be gained by
 

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:04.180

preserving that culture especially

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:04.190
preserving that culture especially
 

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.980

generation of tourist dollars the
 

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.620
generation of tourist dollars the
generation of activity can be very

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:14.630
generation of activity can be very
 

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.990
generation of activity can be very
significant there is a lot of cultural

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000
significant there is a lot of cultural
 

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.050

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:11.350
revenue generator a lot of neighborhoods
around the country and world have used
