DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.740
I'm Daniel Sieberg
with I/O Live.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.780
And we are at the
Google+ Sandbox.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.570
And I am joined right now by
Timothy Jordan, who is a

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.340
senior developer advocate, going
to be our virtual tour--

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.285
wait, you're not virtual.

00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:11.750
You're real.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I feel real.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.620
I mean, I just kind of--

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.460
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
you're quite real.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.750
So you're going to be our
real tour guide--

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.239
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:16.670
DANIEL SIEBERG: --here
for the Sandbox.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: So tell
me, first of all,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.260
what's over my shoulder?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.130
Let's start maybe our
right to left--

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Right
over there?

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.140
DANIEL SIEBERG: --the
left to right.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Left
of the screen?

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.100
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
left of the screen.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That
thing over there?

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.340
DANIEL SIEBERG: Exactly.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We've got two
Google+ Hangout booths.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.230
Now, they're showcasing Google+
applications that were

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.650
just recently announced, one by
Goko and the other by the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.410
Art Project.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.810
And we're going to learn more
about both of those.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.850
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We've got
Office Hours right here.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.440
Now, this is where any attendee
at Google I/O can

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.940
just come right up and talk to
a Googler, and get their

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.435
questions answered about
the platform.

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.210
DANIEL SIEBERG: No question
too big or too small?

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.070
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Over here,
we have the lounge area.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.610
Now it's kind of like Office
Hours but a bit more casual.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.990
Go there to hang out and
exchange ideas with your

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.060
fellow developer or Googlers,
if we happen to

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.060
be there doing some--

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.300
DANIEL SIEBERG: I get
that, hangout.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.030
We call it a Hangout
In Real Life--

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.300
DANIEL SIEBERG: Nice.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --or a HIRL.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.810
Right over here, we've
got two demo booths.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.780
One is Google+ History.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.550
And the other is Google+ Events,
both announced here at

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.750
Google I/O, which takes us to
another announcement at that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.570
big old wall showing the tablet
experience on the Nexus

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.200
7 tablet that we
just announced.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.330
And it's really beautiful.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now, what
is this display that's

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.450
going on over here?

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.350
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is one
of my favorite parts.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.100
DANIEL SIEBERG: #io12, right--

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You write--

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.150
DANIEL SIEBERG: --let's
you know about.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --a post
with #io12 on Google+.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.080
And there's a good chance it's
going to be showing on this

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.110
wall at some point during Google
I/O. It's using the

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.150
Google+ API to grab those posts
and do this great visual

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.310
representation here
on the floor.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.870
And I think it's actually a
really cool way that we're

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.570
bridging the conversation
between here at Moscone and

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.360
the rest of the internet that's
also at Google I/O. You

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.550
know we have over 30,000, I
think it is, developers

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.160
joining I/O extended.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.330
So if you're out there, hello.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: I think I saw
your name go up there.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.780
All right, well let's go take a
look at the Hangout booths.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.742
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
let's do that.

00:02:03.742 --> 00:02:05.440
Here we are with Goko.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.110
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yes, and
Alexander from Goko joins us.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.669
ALEXANDER SHEN: Hi,
how's it going?

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.590
DANIEL SIEBERG: So we're looking
at a computer game

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.070
here, as you might
play, of course.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.330
But you've integrated the
Hangouts into the game.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.200
And you're in a Hangout
right now.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.750
Tells us about that.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.370
ALEXANDER SHEN: That's right.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.460
So what Goko is, basically,
we're a games company in a

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.340
development platform.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.130
And what we've done is that
we are helping HTML 5 game

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.850
developers create some really
great games, and offer things

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.080
like multi-player, virtual
economies, things like that.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.510
So what we've done is
we've partnered

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.560
with Rio Grande Games.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.850
And we have Dominion here.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.740
And Dominion's a very popular
deck-building game.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.690
So we have this board game.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.180
We have Google+ Hangouts
on the bottom.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.930
Because this way we can
integrate video chat, and be

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.730
able to play with multiple
players across the country,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.460
and make it feel like we're
at the same table.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.410
But we're not.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.840
And with this game, we just have
some really nice artwork

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.850
from the game company.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.270
And we're just trying to create
this traditional game

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.630
experience in a digital
format.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.660
DANIEL SIEBERG: And the graphics
are beautiful.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.170
But you can also include some
aspects of Hangouts, like

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.060
facial tracking,
into the game.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.480
ALEXANDER SHEN: That's right.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.870
So one of the things we did--
and one of the great offers

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.100
that Google+ Hangouts has-- that
we can use face tracking

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.960
data, and essentially overlay
images from the game.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.230
So if I'm playing my friend
right now, and I decide to

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.460
play the minion card, over on my
head you'll see right here

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.750
I've got the minion head
face tracking me.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.480
It's like, aw, he's played
the minion card.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.170
It's awful.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.750
So this way we know--

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.780
it's just a little more fun.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.370
It makes you actually feel
like not only playing

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.546
Dominion, but you're
kind of in it.

00:03:26.546 --> 00:03:28.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: And when you're
trash talking, you can

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.020
actually see people just
like you would in

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.830
person, too, right?

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.220
ALEXANDER SHEN: Absolutely.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.520
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.010
So if people want to play this,
when is it coming out?

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.180
How will it be integrated?

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.540
ALEXANDER SHEN: So right now you
can actually sign up for

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.600
the beta if you go to
dominion.goko.com.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.040
And you sign up for
the beta there.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.860
Or if you're a developer
interested in the platform,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.800
goko.com, and you can
just sign up.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.120
So all of these games and many
of our services will be

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.670
released later this summer.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.250
DANIEL SIEBERG: And for anyone
who's curious about what that

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.450
development process was like
for Hangouts, can you maybe

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.380
offer some advice or
tips for people?

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.000
ALEXANDER SHEN: Definitely, the
documentation and being

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.890
able to work with the Google
team, it's been a blessing.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.380
And it's very well documented,
and just having the right

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.520
people to take a
look at it all.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.940
And it's really easy to use.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.730
So just in general, just keep
at it and you'll be fine.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.700
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool, I'll let
you guys get back to your game

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.505
here, right?

00:04:13.505 --> 00:04:14.490
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, we
don't want to keep you

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.495
from the play time.

00:04:15.495 --> 00:04:16.700
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yes, exactly.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.370
All right.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.260
Alexander, thank you.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank
you, Alex.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.019
Let's go check out some art.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.372
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK, all
right, good call.

00:04:23.372 --> 00:04:24.585
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey,
Daniel, over here.

00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:25.930
DANIEL SIEBERG: Hey, Timothy, I
lost you there for a second.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.220
It's a big place.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So we're here
with Piotr who is with the Art

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.070
Project, which is a
pretty cool way to

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.930
experience art in a Hangout.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.740
Piotr, can you start
by just telling us

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.020
about the Art Project?

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.240
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: Sure.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.920
The Art Project is a platform
that we provide to museums and

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.570
institutions that want
to put more of their

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.940
art collections online.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.340
We started about a year
ago with 17 museums.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.830
And now we're up to 150
collections in 40 different

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
countries, about 30,000
works of art.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.715
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's
absolutely amazing

00:04:51.715 --> 00:04:52.890
what people can do.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.020
But now, through the magic of
a Hangout, you can do these

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.230
same kind of tours of artwork
with your friends.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.430
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: Yeah, we've
basically brought the Art

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.520
Project experience
inside a Hangout.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.430
You can start a Hangout either
straight from Hangouts or from

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.430
the Art Project.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.160
And whoever you're with can
either start a tour or share

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.950
the works of art that
they're looking at.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.530
And you can interact
that way as well.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.810
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right, so
you're in a Hangout right now?

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.250
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: Yeah.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.090
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK, are
you leading this

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.270
tour or are you following?

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.520
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: No, actually,
a friend of mine, Marzia,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.600
another developer on the Art
Project, is going to be

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.830
leading us through this
particular tour.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.924
So we're just going to wait
until she starts it up.

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:24.710
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.290
MARZIA NICCOLAI: So I'm going to
start a tour here so I can

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.040
show Piotr what happened
to me the other

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.765
day here in San Francisco.

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:31.080
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: So I'm just
joining Marzia's tour.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.960
MARZIA NICCOLAI: Art Project
allows you to search by

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.760
collections, artists,
and artworks.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.540
DANIEL SIEBERG: And this is
exactly what people would see

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.330
if they decided to choose
this within a Hangout?

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.000
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.060
It's just an app that you can
start up here at the top or

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.590
directly from the Art Project.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.352
And now Marzia is just walking
us through the tour that she

00:05:48.352 --> 00:05:49.738
has picked for us.

00:05:49.738 --> 00:05:53.990
MARZIA NICCOLAI: OK, so
I saw this painting.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.830
And it put me in mind of my
favorite story, that of the

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.300
titan Prometheus who brought
fire to the gods.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.380
Here in the Art Project,
we can see what

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.720
happened to him in stages.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.100
The first thing that happened
is Hephaestus, the god of

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.900
engineers, one of my favorite,
bound him to a rock.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.569
So you can see here--

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:14.960
oh, look at that.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.115
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
an unfortunate shot.

00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:18.130
You know, Prometheus just
wanted us to be

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.090
warm, the poor guy.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.641
MARZIA NICCOLAI: That's a--

00:06:20.641 --> 00:06:22.040
DANIEL SIEBERG: Marzia decided
to pick a good one.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.290
MARZIA NICCOLAI: Oh,
I misspelled it.

00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:28.125
Then he's tied to a rock.

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:29.680
And you can see him here.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.400
But the actual interesting thing
is you can see what's

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.000
about to happen to him.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.260
We have the eagle.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.300
And everyone knows that the
punishment for Prometheus

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:47.360
bringing fire to the gods
was him having his liver

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.890
perpetually chopped
out by the eagle.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:50.000
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: You picked
really happy

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.690
ones for us, Marzia.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.870
Thanks.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.920
MARZIA NICCOLAI: So that is
the story of Prometheus.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.290
And I did not realize how
inappropriate it would be

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.500
until I saw the zoom.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.050
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: But the idea is
that you could look at all

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.290
the details of the
works of art.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.330
And someone, an art expert or an
art lover, like Marzia, can

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.850
walk us through all of the
material and show us all the

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.442
details that are the most
interesting to them.

00:07:09.442 --> 00:07:10.720
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You know,
that's really cool.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.910
I think this solves a problem,
being able to see art that you

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.330
wouldn't otherwise be able to
go see in person, and yet

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.870
still do it with your friends.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.680
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: No,
absolutely.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.430
And the opportunities for the
museums and other experts to

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.940
actually be able to reach a wide
audience using Hangouts.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.520
Hangouts On Air, in particular,
the fact that you

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.470
can record and broadcast it to
as many people who won't be

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.760
able to come to the museum or
won't be able to hear the

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.940
curator talk about the work
that they know so well.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.660
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right, so we
should say this integrates

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.200
into Hangouts On Air.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.520
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.630
DANIEL SIEBERG: I mean
this is broadcasting,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.620
being recorded somewhere.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.940
It could be shared elsewhere
beyond just this experience.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.280
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: So it's museum
educators and art lovers

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.160
around the world can go back
to it and find out more.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So one more
quick question for me is how

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.490
is your experience developing
with the Hangout APIs?

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.700
I mean this is really visually
rich, pulling that media in,

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.135
and showing it, and
synchronizing that across the

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:00.510
two screens.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.540
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: I mean the Art
Project only launched about

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.150
two months ago.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.430
So really we've been focusing on
the development of this and

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.480
other new features for the
rest of the Art Project.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.080
So it's really quick and easy to
develop for Hangouts, a few

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.320
synchronization and message
passing things to make sure

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.230
that we could get the screens
to sync up across all of the

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.580
different machines and that the
state would be as light as

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.610
it could be so that it could be
really fast and responsive.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.910
DANIEL SIEBERG: Well, I'm
not an artist at all.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.910
But I can appreciate a great
app when I see one.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:25.890
That is fantastic.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.230
Piotr, thank you so
much for the--

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.680
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: Thanks a lot.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.260
DANIEL SIEBERG: --virtual
tour.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.360
PIOTR ADAMCZYK: Yeah,
of course.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.350
DANIEL SIEBERG: We
appreciate it.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Piotr.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.200
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.370
We got some more stuff to see.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:31.920
We should go.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's do that.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.590
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.929
I'll race you.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:37.559
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, Daniel.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.059
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah?

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.419
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's sneak
up on David Glazer.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:39.679
DANIEL SIEBERG: I know.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:40.140
Here he is.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.589
He doesn't suspect
anything at all.

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:42.409
Hey.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How
you doing there?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.375
DAVID GLAZER: Good,
how are you guys?

00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:46.170
DANIEL SIEBERG: We're
doing great.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We're
doing really well.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.950
Everybody out there, this is
David Glazer, a director of

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.570
engineering here at Google.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.300
DAVID GLAZER: Hi.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.280
DANIEL SIEBERG: So tell us a
little bit about the exciting

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.130
announcements related to
Google+, some of the sort of

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.940
things you're taking away
as developers that are

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.685
interacting with folks
here in the Sandbox.

00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:03.100
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah, I think the
most, to me, personally,

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.140
the most exciting announcement
was there were a

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.035
whole bunch of stats.

00:09:06.035 --> 00:09:09.150
The stat I was happiest about
was one, which is

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.410
we're one year old.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.080
And for us who have been working
on this project for a

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.470
year, that's really the most
amazing thing is that, in the

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.520
12 months since we launched
Google+, so much has happened.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.720
I went to a session today where
someone was talking

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.580
about some of the new features
in the platform.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.950
And they said, this is the first
time we've talked about

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.156
Google+ at I/O. Because it
didn't exist last year at

00:09:31.156 --> 00:09:31.870
Google I/O.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.060
DANIEL SIEBERG: And for
developers, this is such a

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.450
huge opportunity for them to
tap into that, as well, and

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.320
have this kind of conversation
with different developers.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.020
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah, so really
what happened over the last

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.260
year is we built up a base of
users, and usage, and features

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.410
that we then get to build on top
of, and some of the news

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.660
today was how we're doing that,
and then more ways for

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.880
developers to build on top of.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.870
And that's what the rest
of the news was.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.120
So I guess probably the number
I'm the second most excited

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.430
about after one was 250 million,
which is the number

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.050
of users who are now
Google+ users.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.050
And having those 250 million
users means that we have

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.270
things to give them.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.850
And so we launched Events.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.310
I know you've talked to
some other people.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.240
You've seen what's going
on with Google+ Events.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.470
We have a big Event
that everyone here

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.960
is invited to tonight.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.770
That's great.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.520
We now have 250 million users
who can use that, invite their

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.710
friends, and share pictures,
and go into party mode, and

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.630
all of that.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.210
We have ways for these users to
get to Google+ from a lot

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.950
more places.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.150
So we have the new tablet,
which is awesome.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.810
I have five emails from my son
who was watching at home.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.940
He interrupted me every time a
new device was held up saying,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.130
Christmas or July or can
you bring one home?

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.720
So we have all these
new places where

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.550
you can access Google+.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.850
And the app is stunning
on the tablet.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.450
The new UI on the new hardware
is just amazing.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.480
It's hard to test, because I
keep getting lost in it.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.250
I keep saying, oh, I'm supposed
to look for bugs.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.300
And then I read for 15 minutes,
and then, oh, I'm

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.950
supposed to look for bugs.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.440
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
probably a

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.680
good thing and allowed.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.970
DAVID GLAZER: It's a
very good thing.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.530
And then on the developer side,
on the platform side,

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.730
you heard today that we now have
more people using Google+

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.130
from mobile than from desktop.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.160
And as a result, we've been
really beefing up the mobile

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.450
aspects of the platforms.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.130
So we have new capabilities for
mobile developers to make

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.450
it easier for them to build
Google+ capabilities into

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.610
their application.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.220
We announced the Google+
History API today.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.890
It's an early developer
preview.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.560
But it's a great way for
developers to help their users

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.670
save privately what they do in
their app, and then later

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.470
optionally share it, which,
in turn, leads to

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.940
more use of the app.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.370
All of these new capabilities
are being built on top of the

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.920
250 million users in the
first year of stuff.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.260
So it's fun.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.600
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right, well,
you were probably busy

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.090
doing something important.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.760
So we're going to let you
get back to doing that.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.540
TIMOTHY JORDAN: He's
finding bugs.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.320
DAVID GLAZER: I'm pretending
to find bugs.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.490
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you
so much for your time

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.450
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right,
David, we appreciate it.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.400
All right, let's keep
moving here.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.380
All right, Daniel, now we're at
the Google+ History booth

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.590
with Silvano.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.630
Silvano, how are you?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.720
SILVANO LUCIANI: I'm very
party mode today.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.710
So I miss it.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.770
DANIEL SIEBERG: I'm
very excited to

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:07.560
learn more about this.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.620
It sounds really cool.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.620
SILVANO LUCIANI: So yeah, this
is the Google+ History API.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.590
And it's an early developer
preview.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.050
And like Instant Upload, it will
allow users to save their

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.180
online activities in a private
space, and then, if they want,

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.540
they can also share it.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.160
And we launched this early
developer preview, because we

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.960
want the developers out there
to start experimenting with

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.430
this API to bring their
awesome content

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.960
to our Google+ users.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.160
But let me show it to you.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yes,
please do.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.880
SILVANO LUCIANI: And
I will use an API

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.220
starter that we have.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.260
And it's open source.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.730
And it's in our developer
documentation at

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.010
developers.googl
e.com/plus/history.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.470
So the first thing,
you need the user

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.680
to sign in to Google+.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.250
And this is very easy with
our sign in button.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.650
As you can see, this is the
through flow that has gone

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.850
seamlessly.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.040
Now, I can choose one
of the activities.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.860
So let's say I want
to buy something.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.370
I click on the Buy Activity.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.260
That application is showing
me the JSON Exchange,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.420
that it's going on.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.480
And now I will show you, in the
Google+ user interface,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.430
the moment that you've
read them.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.520
And this is your moment.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.020
I bought Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland, which is one of my

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.300
favorite book.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.220
And if I want, I can
also share it.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.440
And if you see, each snippet is
populated by the data that

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.920
you specified using
schema.org markup

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.650
when writing the moment.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.520
And using the sharing model of
Google+, I can decide to make

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.800
this experience public or just
share it with my friend or

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.880
with my avid readers circle.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.711
And there you are.

00:13:37.711 --> 00:13:39.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now, if
developers want to get started

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.140
with a Google+ History API,
what's their first step?

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.460
SILVANO LUCIANI: So they
need to sign in.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.710
And we have a very
easy procedure.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.340
And you can find all the
information that you need at

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.190
developers.googl
e.com/plus/history.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.150
And we just need your
email address.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.680
We will sign up you
to a group.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.250
And then you are up to go, and
start developing, and having

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.280
fun, and send us
your feedback.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:02.800
DANIEL SIEBERG: Great.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.080
Silvano, thank you so
much for this demo.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.640
SILVANO LUCIANI: Thank
you for coming.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.250
DANIEL SIEBERG: We
appreciate it.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.530
All right, we've got
to run off to our

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.680
last appointment here.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.140
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
we're going to

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.370
go talk to the Events--

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.850
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yes.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.280
Let's do it.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.490
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --Events
folks, yes, do that.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.050
Hey, Kavi and Tina.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:16.320
How are you doing?

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.260
DANIEL SIEBERG: What's
going on over here?

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.700
It sounds like Events is what
we're going to be talking

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.630
about right now.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.330
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We've been
watching from home.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.850
And by we, I mean, of course,
everybody watching from home.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.720
And we saw the Events
announcement.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.920
It looks really cool.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.590
And I want a sneak peek at what
you can do with this.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.080
TINA CHEN: Great.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.490
Google+ Events captures the way
people experience events

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.710
in real life.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.260
Because an Event doesn't end
when you RSVP, we wanted to

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.570
help people capture important
moments as they happen, and

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.940
help them share and revisit
those memories afterwards.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.530
DANIEL SIEBERG: So it's kind
of this before, during, and

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.650
after idea, which I love.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.990
So maybe give us a walk
through here.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.040
KAVI HARSHAWAT: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.650
So when you're ready to create
an Event, you can go to

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.460
Google+, and click on the
Events icon at the top.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.230
And you can create all different
types of events,

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.140
everything from picnics
and barbecues to

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.300
weddings and even concerts.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.700
You can create a virtual Event
using Google+ Hangouts, and

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.020
then share them with
whoever you like.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.030
And when you're ready to share
them, you can actually share

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.010
them with circles or
individuals, including people

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.690
who are not yet using Google+.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.350
And after you've created the
Event, the people you invited

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.290
will actually see the Event in
their Google+ stream, in

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.760
email, Google+ notifications,
or even in

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.870
their Google Calendar.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:27.370
DANIEL SIEBERG: So they
really have no

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.930
excuse for missing anything.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.840
TINA CHEN: And during the Event,
you'll be able to turn

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.880
on party mode.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.290
Whenever party mode is on, new
photos you take with your

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.680
Android device will be
instantly shared with

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.590
everybody invited
to the Event.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.730
So that means, even if you
couldn't make the Event,

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.455
you're able to see all the
activity and participate from

00:15:46.455 --> 00:15:49.106
your phone or your desktop.

00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:51.430
KAVI HARSHAWAT: And after the
Event is over, all the photos

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.940
are collected in
a single place.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.750
And you can view the most
popular photos, the ones that

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.560
have been plus oned or commented
the most at the top

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.980
of the page as Event
Highlights.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.980
Photos can also be organized by
photographers or the people

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.150
who are tagged in them, so you
can see all the photos from

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.180
the people you want
to see them from.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:07.860
DANIEL SIEBERG: And when
is this going to

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.650
be available then?

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.650
TINA CHEN: So on desktop
is rolling out today.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.230
So you should see it soon.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.420
If you go and install
the new Android app

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.170
for phone and tablet.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.420
You should just get
that right away.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.010
And it'll be available
in the iOS app store

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.444
pretty soon, too.

00:16:21.444 --> 00:16:21.861
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:22.280
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This
is really cool.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.810
Thank you so much.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:24.200
TINA CHEN: Thank you.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.590
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thanks,
Tina and Kavi.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.140
We appreciate it.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:25.420
TINA CHEN: You guys enjoy it.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.300
DANIEL SIEBERG: And thank you,
Timothy-- yes, we will--

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.170
for being our tour guide here
in the Google+ Sandbox.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.910
We've learned a lot.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.620
We've seen a lot
of cool stuff.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.860
And of course, we hope people
stay engaged with all this

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.610
discussion.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
we really do.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.760
You know, the conversation
doesn't have to stop here.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.200
Please check out our online
documentation.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.500
You can find out more about
everything that we've talked

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.260
about today.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.930
That's
developers.google.com/plus.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.330
Join us in the discussion
forum.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.490
And join us on Google+
as well.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.504
DANIEL SIEBERG: I've got to get
my hands on one of those,

00:16:52.504 --> 00:16:52.683
by the way.

00:16:52.683 --> 00:16:53.855
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, me too.

00:16:53.855 --> 00:16:54.530
All right, thanks, Daniel.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.446
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thanks
so much, Timothy.

00:16:55.446 --> 00:16:55.860
All right.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.590
And stay tuned for
more on I/O Live.
