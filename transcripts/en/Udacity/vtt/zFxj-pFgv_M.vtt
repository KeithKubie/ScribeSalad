00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's use this equation.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Vx = 10, which is the initial x velocity, plus 0, which is the acceleration, time 3.2.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well, that goes to zero, and so we just have an x velocity of 10.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Note that the initial and final x velocities were exactly the same.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That is not a coincidence. That's due to the fact that there's no acceleration in the x direction.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now to find Δx I use this equation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The initial velocity is 10 times the time, which is 3.2, plus ½at².

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Note, again, a is 0, so this goes to 0.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
10  3.2--10 &lt;i&gt;3.2 is 32 m.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The object will land 32 m away from the wall.

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is an amazing ability that you now have.
