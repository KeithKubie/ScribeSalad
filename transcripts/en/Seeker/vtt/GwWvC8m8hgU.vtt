00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.810
You know what hurts?

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.810
Pain.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.700
But why does pain have to hurt so much, and
could we maybe dial it back a bit if the pain

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.950
gets too intense?

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.389
Thanks to a recent study from Stanford University,
we may just be able to control how we experience

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.389
pain.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.619
As much as it hurts, pain is useful in most
cases.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.949
It lets us know that what’s happening is
bad for us or when something is seriously

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:23.949
wrong.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.189
Without it, we would easily injure ourselves
or not realize our bodies aren’t functioning

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.189
as they should.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.050
In fact, there is a rare condition called
Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.860
or CIPA, and people suffering from it can
break bones without even knowing or overheat

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.350
easily, which is especially dangerous when
they’re children.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.330
So pain is a good thing.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.710
Or at least the ability to feel it is.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.880
But there are those on the other extreme of
the spectrum who experience chronic pain.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.080
For them, it mostly serves no purpose other
than discomfort and agony.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.510
Drugs like opioids can dull the pain, but
they can be extremely addictive and impact

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.780
other parts of the brain.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.519
So identifying exactly which neurons control
the discomfort that comes with pain can lead

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.509
to new drugs that allow people to still know
they’re hurting, but without the actual

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.509
hurt.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.400
That’s where a 2019 study published in the
journal Science by researchers at Stanford

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.520
University comes in.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.130
The researchers probed mouse brains for where
pain was felt, and when I say probed I mean

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.130
that literally.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.679
They attached miniature microscopes to the
mice’s heads and observed their brains in

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:26.679
real time!

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.210
While the mouse was just walking around, doing
mouse stuff!

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.649
The scientists’ target was the amygdala,
which in humans is a small almond-shaped area

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.000
associated with processing emotions.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.789
But it’s really dark inside a mouse’s
brain, so to see what was going on, researchers

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.740
introduced a fluorescent protein that lit
up whenever neurons fired.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.670
With microscopes and glow-teins in place,
researchers started poking and prodding the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.520
mice to see what area lit up when they were
in discomfort.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.179
They found about 150 neurons in a region called
the basolateral amygdala that sparked up when

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.389
the mouse was in pain, and glowed more brightly
when the pain was more intense.

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:05.459
But the scientists weren’t looking for neurons
that signaled pain, but the ones that signaled

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.680
it was unpleasant.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.250
To find out if the neurons they’d spotted
were the ones they were looking for, the researchers

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.120
created chemical switches that allowed them
to turn the neurons on and off.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.550
When the researchers switched the neurons
off, the mice could still sense pain and would

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.580
show it by displaying their usual reflex to
withdraw from painful stimuli.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.020
But they didn’t show signs the pain was
unpleasant, like by avoiding the stimuli or

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.080
licking their paws.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.420
Essentially they could still feel pain, they
just didn’t mind so much.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.500
When the researchers switched off the same
neurons in mice with chronic pain, they found

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.540
the mice didn’t mind the light touches that
used to harm anymore.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.430
If neurons that work the same way can be found
in humans, and if these neurons have unique

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.310
receptors, then it might be possible to develop
drugs that target them and turn down their

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.310
activity.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.170
That would be huge news for sufferers of chronic
pain, or even those in intense pain who might

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.400
otherwise be prescribed drugs that are addictive
and imprecise.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.580
It’s probably still a ways off, so in the
meantime do your best not to hurt yourself.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.970
So, would you let scientists attach a microscope
to your brain if it meant making a major breakthrough?
