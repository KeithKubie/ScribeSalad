This UCSD-TV program is presented by University
of California Television.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.939
Like what you learn?

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:18.640

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.630
[Music]

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:48.590
00:52
Good evening, everybody.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:57.380
Uh, welcome to the Joan B. Kroc School of
Peace Studies.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.019
Uh, in this school, uh, we believe that you
don't have very much peace, and it's not very

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.830
sustainable without justice, and we don't
think you have much justice without peace.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.810
So we think the two go together inext--inextricably.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.070
We also believe that studies ought to be combined
with practice, and so our Institute for Peace

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.470
&amp; Justice and our Trans-Border Institute are
very involved in the practice, in various

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.020
places around the world, of peace and justice
issues.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.780
We also believe that peace and justice shouldn't
be an abstraction.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.280
It should be a challenge of public policy.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.600
So we are developing the school as the first
school of public policy devoted to the questions

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.729
of peace and justice.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:50.870
Now... [applause] Uh, this is going to be
an inspiring evening.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.890
First because I'm going to leave the podium
very shortly, [laughter] uh, and secondly

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.740
in Leymah we have someone who has
inspired people throughout the world and we've

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.430
already had the benefit of her twice today
and we appreciate her patience to have her

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.760
for a third time.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.940
Now I've only been dean of this school for
a little over six months, but you learn a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.940
few things.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.550
One of the things you learn very quickly is,
whenever possible, delegate.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.890
And so tonight I am very pleased to delegate,
uh, to Dee Akers, who is known as the woman

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:34.770
peacemaker, uh [applause] and as someone who's
known, uh, Leymah for many years, in fact

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.940
welcomed her here five years ago.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.270
Uh, so Dee is going to engage in a conversation,
uh, with Leymah.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.620
And with that let me exit the stage and thank
you all very much for coming.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.670
We appreciate having you.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.530
Thank you.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.530
[applause]

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.650
Well, good evening and let me add my welcome
to our dean's.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.650
And thank you for joining us here at the Kroc
School of Peace Studies at the University

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.260
of San Diego, for the Joan B. Kroc Institute
for Peace &amp; Justice's Distinguished Lecture,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.900
"Transforming Conflict through Nonviolent
Coalitions," with a truly brave and, above

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.420
all, transparent and honest woman.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.480
Um, it's my privilege and pleasure to share
an evening with the 2011 Nobel Peace Laureate,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.840
Leymah Gbowee, and you, uh, because it takes
all of us, as she often points out.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.610
And our evening is designed to let us step
into her world briefly and the revelations

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.610
there.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.151
This Liberian mom of six, domestic violence
survivor, peace activist, social worker, women's

00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:42.500
rights advocate who speaks truth to power,
who founded a number of organizations including

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.790
most recently the Gbowee Peace Foundation
Africa, and along the way got the Nobel Peace

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.700
Prize — all before she was 40 years old.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.330
[applause] A slightly longer bio is in your
program.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.150
And the book "Mighty Be Our Powers," uh, which
tells intimately her story is available out

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.910
in the rotunda, um and it's really her story
on how this came to pass, but there's also

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.060
some people that would love for you to, uh,
or be thrilled, if you went back and found

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.009
the film, "Pray the Devil Back to Hell."

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.260
Netflix would be happy if you'd rent it and,
uh, Abigail Disney would be glad if you bought

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.330
it.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.980
Um, and we're actually really happy to see
how... in that film... how this happened with

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.560
the diverse community.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.910
And those of you who have met her here before
five years ago saw the film when she joined

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.180
us for a conference that we did called "Crafting
Human Security in an Insecure World."

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.630
Um, there's so much to talk about, but we
want you to have time to do it.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.260
I'm going to ask just a few questions and
we'll have a little bit of discussion up here.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.210
But I want you to know that we were encouraged
and engaged on the promise that she made and

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.050
was living when she came here before.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.680
And, uh, it appears, however, that I have
to say something that I really believe that

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.040
her nonviolent transformation activities are
sometimes not a passive, quiet, nonviolent,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:18.180
[laughter] uh, style but very vocal, direct
and shall we say risky, uh, in which way she,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.750
uh, leads, uh, the way to peace in Liberia
and elsewhere now around the world.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.950
So, welcome, Leymah.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.150
Thank you, Dee.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.080
Thank you so much.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.560
[applause] Well, one thing...we'll start a
little towards the beginning, not the very

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.430
beginning, we only have an hour, um, when
you were 17 years old the Liberian civil war

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.539
had just started.

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:47.740
And you, uh, said that you turned from being
a child into an adult in a matter of hours.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.330
Um, can you give us a feeling for what it
was like, what that—that moment was like,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.440
that journey was like from then on and what
changed?

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.440
Alright.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.910
Thank you and thank you all for coming.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.950
It's truly an honor to be back here, uh, five
years later.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:11.250
I do then, since 2008, I now have a 3-year-old
going on 40, so since I left I've been really

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.250
busy.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:22.770
[laughter] But, um, I grew up in a very sheltered,
not rich community, but very sheltered.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:31.840
Um, where we grew up was the typical, um,
example of "ubuntu" — you know—you are

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.810
because I am; we all exist because of the
other.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.210
Liberia has 16 tribes.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.590
The community we grew up in, maybe 10 of those
tribes lived there.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.770
Everyone practiced their culture, but we were
children of the community.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:54.740
So at 5 o'clock, if you went to the next neighbor's
house, you took your bath there and put on

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.260
someone else's clothes, and they took you
home sleeping.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.140
We would stand on our porch and shout, "What
did you cook today?"

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:11.490
And someone would say, "We cooked rice with
cassava leaves and rice with...Can we share?"

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.139
So those were the kinds of things that we
did.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:21.360
And when lights went off, we sang and danced
our cultural, sang different traditional songs.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.520
Everyone came out so all of the parents were
sitting on their porch.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.960
There was that feeling of you're sheltered.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:34.770
And then we'd go to town to the very plush
high schools, but also sheltered because all

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.240
of the kids in those schools' parents...or
in our school...parents knew each other.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.360
We were still children at 17.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.810
You could go to your dad and say, "I need
this."

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.810
Your mom.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.310
There was guidance.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.990
And then we wake up and we were hearing all
these stories about war.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:57.340
And we wake up one morning, my mother is gone,
my father is gone, and I'm waiting for a few

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.990
hours to go to school.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.190
And then there's shooting.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.850
Real loud shooting.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.560
This old man says, "I—I know this sound.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.610
The rebels have come."

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:13.139
And my sister's three kids are at home, and
my two younger siblings are there.

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:17.550
And I'm the only child of my parents at home
at that moment.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.800
And my niece is running to the door and one
of our relatives is coming with another child

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.330
and she takes her out of the way.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.580
Standing and observing that interaction at
that moment, it was like, "You have to take

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.610
charge."

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.260
So I took all of those kids in, and that night
people were coming and asking me, "What are

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.260
we eating?"

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.339
This is a question I ask people, you know,
and then my aunt was saying to me, "You have

00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:43.789
to take control of your parent's bedroom."

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:48.240
By morning we had over 50 people internally
displaced in our home.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.770
I had to be saying, "Let's cook this, let's
do this, let's do that."

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:57.620
So you wake up at 8 in the morning and you're
a 17-year-old.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:04.340
And by 10 p.m. you're 20-something or 30-something
because you have the burden and the responsibility

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.750
of a whole group of people on your shoulder.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.800
And people are already beginning to tell you,
"Look around and find those important documents

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.130
of your parents to keep.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.660
Do this, do that."

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.070
Those are not things that ordinary 17-year-olds
think about.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:24.380
But in a matter of weeks I mastered all of
it.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.861
One thing that you had with your family, um,
and in your community, uh, was a sense of

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:30.861
faith.

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:33.140
You became a person or you were a person of
faith.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.380
But it seems that you came to know and live
your convictions so much more than simply

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.130
being church dogma.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:45.320
Um, in today's world, institutionalized religions
can seem separate from people and you went

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.730
through, uh, the way they live.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.839
But in your transition and during those times,
from that point on, what was it like for you,

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:55.500
how did you go beyond or include your sense
of faith?

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.810
In who you became.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:04.370
Well, when you live in a world where you see
a lot of injustice happening and people who

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:10.660
profess to be true believers of whichever
religion, or people are committing atrocities

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.430
in the name of all of those religions, you—you
have to come to the place where you understand

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.700
what your faith truly is.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:24.430
And most times when you read different accounts...I
read different accounts in the Bible, I'm

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.230
not just looking at, um, "eye for an eye."

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:33.590
You have to rationalize the meaning of "eye
for an eye" into this world.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.640
And—and one old lady said, "If you practice
eye-for-an-eye now, we're going to have a

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.000
group of damned blind people all over the
world."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.500
[laughter] So you have to think about that,
but for me one thing that I picked from the

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.790
life of Jesus was compassion.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:11:01.060
And there is no way that you can live and
interact with people and don't feel a sense

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.370
of compassion when something has gone wrong
or something is going wrong.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.460
So, over time, different things led me.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.550
I had been writing a little book for so long
and I paused on that book.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:22.180
But my desire is to publish that book and
just give it out for free.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.920
It's a tiny book that I've titled "Giving."

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:34.110
And in that book, it will be... if you read
it you'll get to understand how my faith grew

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.760
so strong.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.710
Because in my life's journey, it hasn't been
just Christians that have reached out to me.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.110
It hasn't been just Muslims.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.230
It's been people of different faiths and they
are reading different things and just trying

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:52.600
to make sense of this world that we all know
that God...or believe that a God created.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.560
If he created this world, how did he intend
for us to live?

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.960
How can you say I'm a person of faith and
you see a child suffering and not offer that

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.480
person food?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.209
How can you be a person of faith and see a
young girl with so much potential and you

00:12:08.209 --> 00:12:12.060
have the resources to send her to school,
and turn a blind eye?

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.320
So you have all of those things in play.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:20.170
But again, I tell people my life journey has
been one that I track.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.350
I'll give you a quick story.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:28.450
My kids and I had been very, very poor, um,
for a long time.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:35.520
And then my sister moved back to Monrovia
from exile, and we lived in a tiny—in a

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.520
tiny apartment.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.540
I think the entire apartment was the size
of this stage.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.209
And I had four kids.

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:46.510
She had one daughter, then I had a brother
I took, and a niece came to live.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:52.980
So in this space...then a girl was thrown
out, we took her in to help her finish high

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.060
school.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:03.160
Every morning we would make food, breakfast
and put it on the porch, and the kids in the

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.790
neighborhood would cross over and come to
eat.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.561
And I would say, "Make way for others to come
and eat."

00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:16.670
And my sister would glare at me and say, "You
are so going to call armed robbers in this

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.529
house tonight," because it was a rough neighborhood.

00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:22.230
And one of the days I took...

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:27.220
I just sat and looked even though we were
poor, there were poor people, people poorer

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.620
than we were.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.620
And so all of these old pairs of shoes under
the bed, and it was getting close to Christmas

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.630
and I said to her, "Mommy, Let's give these
shoes out to the kids in the neighborhood."

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:44.670
So we took everything out and children came,
and not a single pair left over.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:49.610
My niece had made a list...we had made a list,
but I had I think less than a hundred dollars

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.810
for that Christmas.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.410
And that money would not deal with anything.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:59.740
The kids were upset because it's two days
'til Christmas and mama can't seem to be filling

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.290
this list.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.740
I had this friend who was a Catholic priest
who used to just come and sit in my house,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.540
to laugh, he said.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.290
The kids were just crazy because every night
we did a thing called peacebuilding.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:19.230
And every night my son Arthur who is 16 now
was the only culprit, apologizing to everyone,

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.060
"I'm very sorry.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.060
I'm very sorry."

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.290
So if you came to my house for 30 days Arthur
was the one apologizing.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.140
So this man used to come and just sit sometimes
and pray with us.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:35.510
He had gone to England and he came that evening
at 12 midnight.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:40.110
A Catholic priest knocking at the window of
a single woman at 12 midnight?

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:45.540
Of course, I was shocked! [laughter] And I
was like, "What do you want?" and he said,

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.540
"Just open your door."

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.279
"No, no, no, no, why...you should be in London."

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:49.550
He said, "Just open the door.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.570
It's a long story.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.570
I'm tired.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:52.800
My flight came in late.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.800
I want..."

00:14:53.800 --> 00:15:00.180
So he...when I opened the front door, he put
two huge suitcases in my living room.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.800
And then he said, "I'm too sleepy.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.060
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.060
I'll come in."

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.550
So the kids woke up and said, "What's in the
suitcase?" the next morning.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.570
I said, "Well, brother David brought these—these
two suitcases."

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.110
By 12 he came.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:20.240
And then he said when he was leaving England,
there was this woman who came running to the

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.269
priest's house and said, "You are going to
Africa.

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:24.649
It's Christmas.

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:26.230
I have these two suitcases.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:31.540
Go and give it to any single mother."

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.550
He brought those suitcases and said...he used
to call me "Leymuth" that's how they call

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.470
me in the community that's my rough gangster
name.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:46.140
[laughter] So he-he-he brought these...so
he said, "So I brought these two suitcases."

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.450
We sat down and opened up those suitcases.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:58.680
And everything we had on our list was in those
suitcases, including shoes for the kids and

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.760
clothes for the kids.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:06.890
And I turned and looked at my sister, and
she looked back at me.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:14.800
When you've lived a life of lack, and when
God has stepped in mysteriously on many occasions

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:21.110
— and that's just one — and provided in
such an awesome way, sometimes you don't need

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:29.570
the Bible to give you an understanding of
who God is.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:36.700
[applause] I want to stay with that whole
issue of faith just for a little bit longer.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:42.350
When you started working, uh, on the issue
that concerned...with organizing women to

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:49.100
stand up against Charles Taylor...who was
the first...how did it happen that the Muslim,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.649
um, your Muslim associate, the lead woman
from that group, crossed that boundary or

00:16:53.649 --> 00:16:56.470
you crossed it because that wasn't the case
at the time?

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:02.769
Well, when...first of all the Christian Women's
Peace Initiative and...I went to bed.

00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:09.789
I used to live with my computer, my kids were
in exile so I lived in this house all by myself

00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:14.779
and uh...no I did not go on the computer at
that time, I take that back.

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:18.889
But I had a notebook that I wrote everything
in.

00:17:18.889 --> 00:17:25.239
And I remember that night laying next to the
window and having this notebook.

00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:26.769
And I woke up shivering.

00:17:26.769 --> 00:17:33.399
But, in that dream, real dream, "Gather the
women to pray for peace."

00:17:33.399 --> 00:17:37.790
The next morning — my boss was a pastor
— and I went to him and said, BB, I had

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.790
this dream."

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.499
And Vaiba, who's been here, was also one of
my bosses then.

00:17:42.499 --> 00:17:45.690
And this person was saying to me, "Gather
the women."

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.700
So, "Reverend," --that's how we called our
boss -- "since you are a pastor, call the

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.119
women of the church and give them this dream."

00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:56.369
And he looked at me and said, "Leymah, the
dream bearer is always the carrier of the

00:17:56.369 --> 00:17:57.369
dream."

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:59.669
I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no Reverend.

00:17:59.669 --> 00:18:02.520
I am in a relationship and I'm not married
to the man.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.869
Oh, am I fornicating!

00:18:03.869 --> 00:18:06.970
No, Jesus could not be talking to me."

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.169
[laughter] And then he said, "No."

00:18:10.169 --> 00:18:13.620
And so we started the whole Christian Women's
Peace Initiative.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.059
And the first time we went to meet a delegation
of the World Council of Churches, Asatu was

00:18:18.059 --> 00:18:22.840
the Mus—only Muslim woman who stood up and
say she was going to take it back to her Muslim

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840
sisters.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.490
She went and threw the idea at them.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.720
And the first question they asked was, "Who
organized the Christian women?"

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.410
And she said, "Leymah."

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.749
So technically they baptized me a Muslim to
come and organize the Muslim women.

00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:41.450
We started working with them because the first
thing we needed to know what time they were...all

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.500
of those things.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.980
But what happened, very interesting in all
of this faith conversation most times when

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:53.059
I'm having interfaith dialogue with people
I ask, "In this work that we did, who do you

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:55.289
think were the most problematic group?"

00:18:55.289 --> 00:19:04.340
And because of the impression of the-the-the-the-the,
um, myth of Muslim fun--fundamentalism, everyone

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.820
will say instantly, "The Muslim women were
the most difficult."

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.610
No.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:13.559
All those Christian women would come with
scripture references every morning [laughter]

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:18.929
on reasons why we should not interact with
the Muslim women.

00:19:18.929 --> 00:19:23.999
Sometimes it got so bad that we had to take
these women aside and really just talk to

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:25.669
them to apologize.

00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:31.169
And so it got to the place where one group
of Christian women actually left us because

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:34.289
they felt we were not fulfilling the work
of God.

00:19:34.289 --> 00:19:38.399
But the Muslim women were the most easy to
deal with than the Christian women.

00:19:38.399 --> 00:19:39.399
Strangely.

00:19:39.399 --> 00:19:46.340
This... that brings up another question about...when
you think about standing up, I mean you did

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.190
it there, you do it now, you help women around
the world.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.919
You're really interested in this transformation
of conflict.

00:19:52.919 --> 00:19:57.879
Do you think about going alone first to see
what needs to be done, or do you begin organizing

00:19:57.879 --> 00:19:58.879
coalitions?

00:19:58.879 --> 00:20:02.929
Because this is about the coalitions coming
together like these groups first.

00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:04.980
I mean because they're challenging.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.399
One seems like it's going to take a lot more
time, one seems like you're testing the waters.

00:20:08.399 --> 00:20:11.259
What...when you think about going out, what
do you do first?

00:20:11.259 --> 00:20:17.519
I think the first thing to do is identify
not one but several thematic concerns in different

00:20:17.519 --> 00:20:18.879
communities.

00:20:18.879 --> 00:20:23.110
Where people miss the mark is to think that
once you see women you mobilize.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.669
That's not it.

00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:28.409
Or once you see people you mobilize.

00:20:28.409 --> 00:20:32.749
People have to feel connected to something.

00:20:32.749 --> 00:20:40.729
So you look into...say this community...and
maybe rape, um...domestic violence - like

00:20:40.729 --> 00:20:45.899
wife beating, um...wayward children are the
key issues.

00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:51.289
And you have to really go around and kind
of test the waters with...if you're trying

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:55.899
to mobilize parents, to see which is the top
of the list.

00:20:55.899 --> 00:20:58.889
And then you use that as your rallying call.

00:20:58.889 --> 00:21:05.210
So when you go into conflict areas you want
to really start by finding something...even

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:10.299
though...for example, in the Congo DRC, when
we went there two, three years ago, two-and-a-half

00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:13.269
years ago, I knew we still had a lot of work
to do.

00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:18.759
There was no way that what happened in Liberia
would happen in Congo any time soon.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:19.759
Why?

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:25.179
Because everyone sees the conflict from the
lens of their ethnic group or their political

00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:29.590
ideology or, um, some leader.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:36.009
They haven't seen it from the standpoint of,
"Yes, I'm from this party and I'm from this

00:21:36.009 --> 00:21:42.740
ethnic group, but rape is an issue and it's
affecting us as women."

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.320
We went to Bukavu and we sat in that place,
had a very beautiful meeting where the women

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.960
had all of the answers.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.799
And then we said, "OK, if we are to form a
coalition, we need to get one person who will

00:21:53.799 --> 00:21:57.669
become the face of this movement.

00:21:57.669 --> 00:22:02.629
The person would be the voice, and when they're
not around no one can speak, because then

00:22:02.629 --> 00:22:07.149
the message is simple, concise and clear.

00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:10.629
No one is giving, um, mixed messages."

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:14.029
The meeting broke down there.

00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:19.470
In the Ivory Coast in 2004 before their war
got hot we went to a meeting, same thing.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.520
They spoke the same language.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.580
When it came time to fin—find the leader,
the meeting broke down — the reason being,

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:32.340
people still see that leadership within that
women's group from the perspective of the

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:38.049
political group, the ethnic group or the rebel
faction that they support.

00:22:38.049 --> 00:22:43.669
And that's a really interesting point because
it—it creates a vision of how you would

00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:48.390
have to get people to buy in to the whole
idea of these coalitions that you want to

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.390
create.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.409
On the other hand, certainly you're going
to have to find the leaders who are willing,

00:22:53.409 --> 00:22:55.710
who are acceptable beyond that point.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.649
Well—well, one of the things that we didn't
talk about it in "Pray the Devil Back to Hell"

00:22:59.649 --> 00:23:04.450
but which I think was a very important part
of the work that we did in Liberia, was when

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.739
we started something called the Peace Outreach
Project.

00:23:06.739 --> 00:23:10.640
It was something called... we used to call
it the POP.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.129
We trained 20 women from the Christian and
Muslim groups, and those 20 women sat down

00:23:16.129 --> 00:23:17.850
and said, "We want to do something collectively."

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.309
After we had formed the Christian and Muslim
women.

00:23:21.309 --> 00:23:24.929
And the first thing they said they wanted
to tackle was HIV and AIDS.

00:23:24.929 --> 00:23:27.450
In two weeks the problem with the war started.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:32.149
April 2nd actually would be 10 years when
we started the mass action.

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:37.499
So when we—we—we—we decided, "OK, let's
work on the war issue."

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:44.470
But the POP was something that they said,
"We want to be able to go out and tell local

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.419
women that they too have a stake in the peace
process."

00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:53.749
So the Peace Outreach Project was predominantly
a time of awareness and mobilization, a rallying

00:23:53.749 --> 00:23:54.749
call.

00:23:54.749 --> 00:23:57.370
We did that for nine months.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:03.020
After nine months we called the group back
to evaluate the work that we had done.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.390
And we realized that there were issues that
were coming up that was very unhealthy for

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:12.369
the group that we are trying to build—Muslim/Christian
women's rela—uh, relationships.

00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:17.649
So we—we did something—a consultation
that was paid for by Catholic Relief Services.

00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:20.559
The first thing we brought the Christian women
in the room.

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:24.749
And we were looking at peace and nonviolence
from the perspective of the Bible, something

00:24:24.749 --> 00:24:27.609
that they were quite familiar with, very comfortable
with.

00:24:27.609 --> 00:24:31.679
And we talk about...because most times when
you talk to the Christian women, they would

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:37.739
be like, "Oh, my religion tells me to pray,
so I'm not supposed to be out there.

00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:40.169
I'm not supposed to be on the forefront of
protests.

00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:42.159
I'm just supposed to pray."

00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:46.669
So then we went back to the Bible, sat down
and studied women in the Bible.

00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:50.919
And we gave them Deborah, we gave them Esther,
we gave them all of those powerful women and

00:24:50.919 --> 00:24:53.190
said, "Did they just pray?

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.190
No.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.340
Did they take action?

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.340
Yes.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.370
So can you be a Deborah for your country?

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:01.450
Of course!" [laughter] So those were the first
things we did.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.889
Then we went into the Quran and into all of
the different readings that were Islam that

00:25:05.889 --> 00:25:06.889
we could find.

00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:08.779
The next day we brought the Muslim women.

00:25:08.779 --> 00:25:16.849
Both two things we did to demystify all of
the myths and negative perceptions and positives,

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:21.740
stereotypes they had, was to do something
with the Christian women on the day.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:25.399
What is it that you like about the Muslim
women?

00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:27.249
And they made their long list.

00:25:27.249 --> 00:25:29.989
What is it that you do not like about them?

00:25:29.989 --> 00:25:31.429
And they made their long list.

00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:33.080
What do you admire about Islam?

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.919
They made their long list, kept it, next day
worked with the Muslim women.

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:43.599
The third day we brought both groups together
and the room was divided by religion.

00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:49.840
Every group was...what was amazing was that
two women drove in the same car, one a Christian,

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.840
one a Muslim.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.190
As soon as they enter that room everyone was
across the table.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.480
So we—we started by asking them to do the
gallery walk.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.169
Christian women one side Muslim women...and
you could just hear it, "What!

00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:06.149
Did they say this about us as Christians?

00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:07.149
What?

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:08.149
Did they say this?"

00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:09.149
"Oh, that is so nice."

00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:12.730
[laughter] "Oh, oh, no but is a lie.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.730
We are not like this."

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.739
"Oh that is so nice."

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.070
"Well that's not true.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:20.620
Oh..." and then after a while we said we don't
want to talk about it.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.200
We brought two old ladies who had been friends
for over 60-something years.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.049
One a Christian, one a Muslim.

00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:29.470
That was the turning point for us.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:35.259
Because one of the women...the Muslim woman
was as talkative as I am.

00:26:35.259 --> 00:26:39.789
[laughter] And the Christian woman was so
quiet and reserved.

00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:45.580
It was a total contrast from what those women...the
perception that they held.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.749
And then this Muslim woman, in her talking
about their friendship said, "My friend here's

00:26:49.749 --> 00:26:52.080
husband used to abuse her.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.590
And I took money and took her to the courts
and she divorced him."

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.409
Of course the Christian women almost fainted.

00:26:58.409 --> 00:27:03.249
[laughter] A Muslim taking a Christian woman
to divorce her husband?

00:27:03.249 --> 00:27:07.109
"And I made sure she got away with all of
the property."

00:27:07.109 --> 00:27:17.599
But afterward [laughter] someone asked, "How
has your religion influenced your friendship?"

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:21.369
And those two old ladies had a blank look
on their faces.

00:27:21.369 --> 00:27:24.840
"What are you talking about?"

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.749
And then this Muslim woman, who's deceased
now, turned and said, "Marta, when you look

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:32.469
at me do you see a Muslim?"

00:27:32.469 --> 00:27:39.500
And the Christian woman said, "No, I see a
sister, a woman with many children, same problems

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.429
that I have, unfortunately, cheating husbands."

00:27:43.429 --> 00:27:46.099
And they just went on and on and on.

00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:50.899
And they said faith has never ever played
a role.

00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:57.729
Those two women in their communities, because
of the intensity of their friendship, were

00:27:57.729 --> 00:28:00.769
called witches by community members.

00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:07.389
They suffered the worst together, but nothing
ever took their friendship away.

00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:10.409
So that became the rallying call.

00:28:10.409 --> 00:28:15.809
So when you hear in the movie, "Does the bullet
know a Christian from a Muslim?

00:28:15.809 --> 00:28:17.049
Can a bullet pick and choose?"

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:22.399
Cause those women said...the two old ladies
said, "Go in the bathroom, take off your clothes,

00:28:22.399 --> 00:28:24.580
one Muslim woman, one Christian woman.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:30.601
And look at each other and see whether you
see a Muslim on your bodies or you see a Christian

00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:32.169
written on your bodies."

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:38.519
So when you're trying to mobilize, it's so
important that you spend time.

00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:44.480
Today, because of the horrific kind of violence
that we see in communities, people expect

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.960
that movements will just wake up.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.249
It needs to be nurtured like you're building
a garden.

00:28:51.249 --> 00:28:55.309
Take trash out, all of the weeds and all of
the different things and that's what we did

00:28:55.309 --> 00:29:02.010
with those women for over...almost two years
before we launched the mass action.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.559
Very impressive.

00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:14.450
[applause] I've—I am checking the time...I—I
have one more question I really want to ask

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:20.330
because I've been watching and looking at
a number of... statements that you've made

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:26.899
in recent times and I've seen you take to
the podium to confront leaders of Africa and

00:29:26.899 --> 00:29:29.980
the Western world the northern communities.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.520
Um, speak about their role in the continuing
conflicts.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.460
I mean, to take them on and say what role
they're playing.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.600
And I think that—that those moments when
I see you doing that I'm wondering...

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.749
I'm thinking about your work with your women,
companionship, etc.

00:29:45.749 --> 00:29:46.919
But what gives you this power?

00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:52.039
What are you really saying to these people
who are you believe continuing the conflicts

00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:54.559
at some level—who are heads of state, etc.

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:56.330
And does anybody ever listen to you?

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.659
Does anybody respond when you—when you speak
out?

00:29:58.659 --> 00:30:03.969
Well, when you don't get invited to some country
high-level meeting, [laughter] you take it

00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:06.149
that they heard.

00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:09.190
You know, and it's upsetting to them.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:18.429
But the point, um, Dee, is that in this work
that we do we should not be afraid of anyone.

00:30:18.429 --> 00:30:23.700
There shouldn't be an office that we cannot
touch.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.730
There shouldn't be an individual that we cannot
face.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:34.349
And most times when I sit and form my opinion
and do my research and do my analysis about

00:30:34.349 --> 00:30:39.809
certain things, the first thing that comes
to mind is that people expect that you be

00:30:39.809 --> 00:30:42.729
quiet because you're a girl.

00:30:42.729 --> 00:30:45.960
You know, how dare you talk to those male
leaders!

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:53.960
But when Archbishop Tutu says, "I cannot share
a stage with Tony Blair because he's a war

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.230
criminal," he's applauded and I respect him
for that.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.230
You know?

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:03.710
And I think that is what should be.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:10.250
We should be able to say...because Dee, who
do we represent?

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.759
Who is your constituent?

00:31:11.759 --> 00:31:14.109
Who do I represent?

00:31:14.109 --> 00:31:22.099
A vast majority of those women that I say
I speak for may never make it to San Diego.

00:31:22.099 --> 00:31:28.429
And if I'm afraid and ashamed to speak about
their issues, I've failed them and I've failed

00:31:28.429 --> 00:31:30.109
them miserably.

00:31:30.109 --> 00:31:35.950
You know they—they had the misfortune of
putting me on a high-level task force on reproductive

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.399
health and rights beyond 2015.

00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:43.880
And I asked someone, "Do you really think
you want me on this task force?"

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.549
[laughter] Because it's not going to be about
politics.

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:50.570
Like I said this morning, it's not going to
be about statistics.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.960
It's going to be about individuals.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:32:02.570
So how do you live in a country where you
can...women die in the hundreds from maternal-related

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:03.570
issues?

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.729
They're going to give birth and they're dying.

00:32:05.729 --> 00:32:13.759
And then you have the children of some of
the leaders riding the best cars.

00:32:13.759 --> 00:32:21.070
And it's simple things like an ultrasound
machine you can't find in some of the health

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.070
centers.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.619
And I'll say...you know, I'll say it doesn't
take a lot.

00:32:24.619 --> 00:32:30.169
And so when you—you—you say to yourself...most
times I tell myself, if Dr. King was going

00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:34.700
to be afraid, there would be no civil rights
movement in this country.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:41.149
And I don't think, I don't think it's fair
for any of us who God has given a space to

00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:46.460
dominate, to be afraid to speak our minds
— especially if it has to do with people

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.940
who cannot speak for themselves.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:58.200
[applause] I'm going to ask one final question.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.850
In the meantime why don't people head over
to the mikes so we can hear your questions.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:07.739
And that's because I'm sure that we have students
here and I know that a number of people, um,

00:33:07.739 --> 00:33:13.039
have an interest in media and that you've
been interviewed by people in media who are

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:17.989
the alternative news media and, um, found
them somewhat responsive, I think.

00:33:17.989 --> 00:33:23.549
And I think the role of media, as we've talked
about earlier today and in the past, is profound

00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:26.919
and it's essential that we have responsible
media.

00:33:26.919 --> 00:33:33.749
So when you go on someone's show like Jon
Stewart or Stephen Colbert, um, what's the

00:33:33.749 --> 00:33:40.109
sense...I mean, are they in their own way
trying to get the real word out there?

00:33:40.109 --> 00:33:41.109
Are they...um...

00:33:41.109 --> 00:33:42.109
[Gbowee]: I think...

00:33:42.109 --> 00:33:45.919
I—I will speak for both Colbert and Jon
Stewart and I will not speak about some of

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:47.559
the other people that interviewed me.

00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:50.469
[Aker]: I'll only ask you about those two.

00:33:50.469 --> 00:33:55.479
[laughter] [Gbowee]: But those two, especially
Jon Stewart, came into the green room, sat

00:33:55.479 --> 00:33:58.269
with me for almost 30 minutes.

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:02.739
And it wasn't like calming my nerves; because
look at me I didn't need him to calm my nerves.

00:34:02.739 --> 00:34:08.669
[laughter] But it was like genuinely engaging:
"I've read your book.

00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:10.310
I have kids.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.250
I'm concerned about the state of the world."

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.100
And he came to me with a lot of respect.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.140
There was not this white male supremacy thing.

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:27.169
It was like two equals having a conversation:
You have something to say, I'm interested

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:29.159
in listening to it.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:33.260
And I—I've been to many places and it's
not just for North America.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:39.540
Even in Africa you get the vibe when people
are not interested and they just see you as...okay

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:45.640
this is going to be a...I—I tell my kids
with this prize I'm not an ornament.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.700
You know because it's easy for..."oh, we got
this Nobel Laureate to come to this event.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.120
And this Nobel Laureate to come to that event."

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.120
No.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.420
I will be an ornament when I'm 70.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.580
[laughter] [Aker]: Oh shoot.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:05.070
[Gbowee]: At 41 there is work to be done and
you can't afford to but...you...I mean...you...

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:09.540
sometimes you get the sense and with Jon I
really got the sense that first things first,

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.990
he had read my book.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:17.330
It speaks volumes about someone interviewing
you who has read, but beyond reading has gone

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.080
and done different research.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.540
And—and talk about do...I've done this,
I've done that, I've done the other.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:31.120
So and—and...when we had that conversation,
the people in that audience, if they had never

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:38.900
thought about civil wars or women's rights
issues, it brought it to them because he drove

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.500
it home.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:45.500
And we, you know, at one point during the
interview, he said, "Wow, you're being interviewed

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.030
by the most popular—one of the most popular
journalists in America."

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:53.320
And I said, "Well, you...we're in good company
because you are interviewing the most popular

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.200
African woman."

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:04.460
[laughter and applause] Yeah, I couldn't resist
asking the question because I know it's hard

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:10.060
when we talk about media to feel that we're
getting an honest, uh, sense of...from media

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.110
about what's going on in the world and—and
what they have to do.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:19.020
And I think that we really need to take it
more into those kinds of spaces if we want

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:25.410
the world to take women's issues seriously,
because it...those people have followings.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.470
They have people who want to hear them.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.900
They're like little gods to people.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:37.470
So if some of them stand up and say, "Women's
rights is the in thing," some people will

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.560
be listening, others who have never stopped
to think about it.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.560
So when you talk about breaking new ground
and going into different spaces and new places,

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.890
I think those are the kinds of people that
we need to engage with.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:55.820
Find the good men in the media because for
too long and especially for me...one of the

00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:01.590
things I constantly say to myself as I go
to be interviewed or go to some part of the

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:08.910
world, there's so much misconception about
the African woman — saggy breasts, begging

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.610
bowl, many children hanging on them.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:17.420
You know, and sometimes I tell people, that
even if... in Africa a woman has been raped,

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:23.520
the one question you need to ask yourself
, "How is she still caring for 10, 20 children?

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:30.100
How is she still caring even after that horrifying
rape, how is she still standing up with her

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.570
shoulders high and providing for her family?"

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:40.110
You need to move beyond the act of the rape
and look deep into that strength.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:41.870
The strength that is coming out.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:49.490
So most times there...one thing that I would
never ever hope to do is to come out here

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.400
because again, I'm not representing myself.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.860
I'm representing a lot of those women in communities
who you cannot mess with.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:02.080
You know, I was...we went...when the Nobel
women came, we took them to a group of women

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.300
in Totota.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:10.240
The women, when they were introducing themselves
to the Nobel women, and I just sat there smiling,

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:17.670
because these were women I met decades ago
who could not even find their voices.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.340
And this woman stands and says, "I have my
lieutenants.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.220
Where are my lieutenants?"

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.760
And these women stand up.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:31.920
And these are the people who community people
would come to and say, "My daughter got raped

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.740
and the culprit lives in that house."

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.200
Those women walk to that house, arrest the
man, and take him to the police station.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.180
You dare not resist arrest.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:48.050
[laughter and applause] So if you have these
things happen in community, how do you come

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:53.510
off portraying those women you represent as
weak?

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:59.060
As...and then you find...we have a whole new
generation of young women who have formed

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:03.720
their—their voices also, so they are nothing
like weak.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:09.120
And previously when things used to happen,
they would be so shy about talking about it.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:14.681
But we've come...seriously come to the place
where African women are now saying, "If you

00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:18.160
rape me, I have nothing to be ashamed of.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.470
You should be ashamed of yourself!"

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.330
You know, so...we need to constantly portray
that.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.150
Even in this country I constant...

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:33.370
I will alw...I always say, "Women, you have
so much: the platform, the resources."

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:38.810
Um, someone said to me, "You know there was
this thing going and we—I won a million

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:41.290
dollars for my organization."

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:43.200
I said, "Gosh.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:49.790
Give me one million dollars [laughter] and
I know what I will do with it!"

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:55.750
So much resources and then sometimes when
you hear some of the things going on you ask

00:39:55.750 --> 00:40:02.220
yourself, "These women are strong, they're
smart, they're intelligent, but what happened

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.360
to their legs?

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.380
Why can't they stand up?"

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.360
Because you see there is so much that you
have to offer us in Africa.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:18.120
You...people mirror what happens in this part
of the world.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.750
If—if women's rights is not respected here,
and our leaders are wining and dining with

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:28.330
your leaders, they go back and say, "Even
in the... even in the U.S. is not working

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.330
there.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:30.330
Why should we give it to you here?"

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:37.930
Okay, let me shut up, Dee. [laughter and applause]
No, here's a microphone, there's an empty

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:39.560
microphone for Leymah.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:45.910
[Female voice from off stage] I want to ask
you about the horrific violence, not only

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.200
in Liberia, but in so many places in Africa.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.460
Eastern Congo you talked about and other places.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:41:00.230
[clears throat] At the beginning you talked
about this wonderful spirit in Africa of sharing,

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.810
of taking care of each other.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.370
I think you say "ubuntu."

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.600
Is that right?

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.530
And [clears throat] I wonder how we restore
that.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:15.520
What—what were the dark forces that changed
things, that brought this about, and how do

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.360
we reverse it?

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:24.790
You know I don't think the spirit of togetherness
and oneness ever left Africa, or else people

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:29.360
like us wouldn't be on the continent still.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.800
The spirit is still there.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:37.750
What we've seen happen to our world is something
that we cannot explain.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:44.080
When people...I—I—I tell most of the young
men who fought in the war that you are a victim

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:52.780
of, um, trying to live in an urban world,
not fitting, and trying to live in your rural

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.450
community and not fitting there anymore.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:02.690
So mod—modern—modernity or whatever we
want to call it, but it's—it's a sad...

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:09.280
I—I cannot pinpoint what has happened to
the spirit in our communities.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:15.800
What I can say to you is that in some parts
of the community those spirits are still there.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.140
It's the spirit that will cause women to rally
around each other.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.720
It's that same spirit that will get some men
to come around.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:29.910
And most times when I speak to a community
of African men, I say to them the reason why

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:37.080
you all are now demonized is because a lot
of you good men have stepped in the back,

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.800
and the evil ones have taken over your space.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:46.390
And the evil men, the men who perpetrate evil,
are not many.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:54.020
The ones who are the good ones, they're very
many, but somehow they've lost their spines

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.000
and they're not doing enough to protect those
women.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.080
I don't understand what is happening.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:07.850
But when I look at my own dad, who as we grew
up, no woman cried from her husband's house

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:12.970
that he did not walk to and pull that man
out and say, "If you want to fight someone,

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.480
let's fight."

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:23.320
But today you see men, you see boys really
most times they just don't want to get involved.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:30.970
And so how do we get them to be like the women
again, you know, bring back that spirit of

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:31.970
community?

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:37.080
But I also think a lot of the violence that
they too have seen has affected them in ways

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.600
that we are not talking about.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:44.900
And because...I mean the good men now, the
handful of the evil ones have affected them

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:50.360
in ways that... there's something about their
pride that has been wounded.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:55.310
If you could not protect your wife from rape,
who are you in this time of peace to stand

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:58.500
up and say you want to be an advocate for
rape?

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:03.010
And I think it's up to us women and those
of the other men who are doing this work to

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:08.790
really now start saying what happened happened,
and it's time for us to take back our communities.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:09.790
Yeah.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:14.110
[A different female voice from offstage] Thanks
so much for sharing your stories and as I've

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:20.080
been hearing them, um, I've just been thinking
a lot about the grassroots movements and the

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.830
organizing efforts.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:25.910
And wondering in your... because not everyone
is Leymah Gbowee.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.950
Not everybody is going to end up with a Nobel
Prize.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:31.210
So, who are your teammates?

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.120
Who are the people who have walked with you
in this journey?

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:38.560
And what kind of group do you like to surround
yourself with to make a movement sustainable

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.370
and possible and powerful?

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:42.070
Crazy women.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.570
[laughter] Risk-takers.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:50.140
People who are not concerned about anything,
who will do anything, who are not concerned

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:54.310
about, "What do I stand to gain from this?"

00:44:54.310 --> 00:45:00.020
One of the things that, um, I say to people
when we did this work and constantly I never

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.460
claim the glory, to say I—I did this by
myself.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.490
It was group of women.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:10.470
Every time that I try to tell people, "This
one is more powerful than I am; all I did

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.550
was to be the talkative one in the group."

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:21.080
But, the...some of the women...the—the work
that we've done has been a work of sacrifice.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:26.830
And those are the people that you want to...if
you're building a movement, build a movement

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:28.240
around.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:33.530
You don't want to build your movement around
those who are thinking, "Wow, how much money

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:35.720
are we going to get out of this?"

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.680
When we started the—the protests, and when
we did all of the work that we had done in

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:46.250
the past, I tell people I could not keep a
dime in my handbag.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:50.640
Because it wasn't just building a movement,
it was building a community of women.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:56.140
We were building sisterhood to the point that
we all knew each other's problems.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:03.190
Vaiba, who came here to do the Women PeaceMakers
Program, lost her husband in 2006.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:07.210
And that afternoon when he got really sick,
they called me.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:10.670
I went and saw him taking his last breath.

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:15.160
And they asked the women, they took us and
we went so I had to leave with her.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:22.310
When he died, because he was a Muslim, his
family came and immediately said, "You killed

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:23.310
him.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:27.260
So you have to explain to us how he died."

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.410
One phone call, 25 women were in that house.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:33.760
The men said, "We changed our mind.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.540
You didn't do anything to him.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.120
[laughter] He died a natural death."

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:50.270
But I saw us sleep in that tiny house, the
next morning trek to the gravesite, stayed

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:54.030
with her for two weeks.

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:58.460
When they finally were doing their official
mourning, we did the women's mourning, which

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:01.870
is not common in the Muslim faith.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:05.870
We did everything together.

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:10.580
And that was what we did from one community
to the other.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.330
Sometimes as someone gave birth we were all
there.

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.240
So it wasn't just about peace.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:21.450
It was reaffirming ourselves as women, telling
people that we've got your back.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:23.710
The personal is political.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:29.680
There is no way any of us can say, "I'm a
peace activist and I'm doing such a great

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:37.210
job," but the people you work with you don't
interact or engage with them in that way.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:40.790
My sisters tell me if I live in Africa I'm
not going to be rich.

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:47.870
And I don't think I will be rich, because
whatever you own has to be shared.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:52.151
So the kind of people that you'll find me
hanging out with would be those women who

00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:56.780
when one person cries everyone will appear.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:02.750
And when they come together, even when you're
crying, they will do something to wipe that

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:04.730
tears away from your eyes.

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:11.870
When my sister died in 2006, by the time I
landed with the body at the airport, the WIPNET

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:14.200
women were lined up.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:21.200
Some of them were so drunk they didn't know
what they were doing there.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:28.670
[laughter] But that evening when my parents
were grieving, I remember my dad was so sad.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:31.810
Those women decided to put up a fashion show
for him.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:36.620
[laughter] And I just saw him looking like,
"What kind of trouble is this, Leymah?

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.180
Get these women out of this house."

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:44.850
And I said, "No," and you know, just... afterwards
you would not hear crying in that house.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.460
That was the spirit.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:52.810
And that is the spirit of any movement that
will survive.

00:48:52.810 --> 00:49:00.520
[applause] I'll take two more—you and one
more, and then I saw a little pretty girl

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.570
come up there.

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:08.420
Oh sorry, go ahead go ahead oh. [off screen—nervous
male laugh] Standing here as a man.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.560
[nervous male laugh] And we're happy you're
here.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.380
[off screen] Thank you.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:17.870
I'm happy um to be here and I want to thank
you madam for your courage.

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:26.230
You invoked Rev. Martin Luther King, who we
may agree was a prophet and a courageous one.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:32.410
Who was also a man who we understand that
he had some the failings that all men and

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:33.410
women have.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:35.030
But he stood up.

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:41.030
And my question is: we're all sitting here
listening to you and feeling very good about

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:42.440
what you're saying.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.680
It's—it's encouraging to sit here.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:55.310
Would you encourage us to stand up and participate
in civil disobedience in this country now?

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:59.160
And in what way would you encourage us to
do that?

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.060
And that's my question.

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.060
Thank you.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.060
Thank you.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:08.300
I...when the Newtown shooting took place,
um, the Africa columnist for Daily Beast...

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:15.170
I stayed in my room and sent a thing—a rallying
call to the mothers of America, um, to rise

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:18.170
up against gun violence in this country.

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:25.000
Um, I like the way...the trend the debate
is taking, but I think there is a need for,

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.720
um, and this is my naïve African perspective,
but I think there's a need for more grassroots

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:40.390
organizing around the whole issue of gun violence
in this country because after Newtown, what

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:45.240
has happened to that conversation is that
it has gotten very political.

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.820
So it's a Joe Biden issue.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:55.270
But when the shooters go on the rampage, it's
not a Joe Biden's...even though he feels it

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:58.550
and I'm not saying your leaders are not compassionate.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:02.820
But the people who feel it the most are the
community people.

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:09.520
And I think when you talk about civil disobedience
or—or—or protests against certain things,

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:15.170
I think those are the kind of things that
people need to really start standing up to.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:21.520
But if a community feels passionate about
something, and that's how we started the conversation,

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:27.990
a thematic concern, an issue of concern, and
if the community feels like they are not being

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:33.490
heard about that particular issue, I don't
think anyone can...as long as you are not

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:37.200
going to be throwing stones and throwing petrol
bombs at people.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:42.240
I think it's important for people to be able
to express themselves, express the way they

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.800
feel about a particular thing.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:51.810
I am all for protests, peaceful protests,
nonviolent, um, protests and nonviolent engagement

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:55.750
on issues that are dissatisfactory to a...for
a group of people.

00:51:55.750 --> 00:52:01.750
So I think there are many things in this country
that women, men, boys and girls can decide

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:03.800
we're going to stand up to.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:09.480
Um, when we were in Chicago a few days ago,
one of the things that I told them there because

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:15.260
of course, Hafeeza, would make me—Hafeeza,
my assistant there, read all of these briefing

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:21.520
books—about Dee what year she was born,
which school she went to, the dean and everyone

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:25.690
else, but in that briefing book there was
all of these statistics and different things

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:29.160
about Chicago and the strategies of the police.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.450
And when we met with the mayor that's what
he constantly talked about: "Oh, my police

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:34.670
chief is doing well."

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:38.100
And then I said to him, "Sir, with all due
respect, and I'm sure you are doing a great

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.350
job, this is not just a police issue.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:42.820
It is a community issue.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:49.670
You should elicit the support of, uh, elicit
the support of religious leaders, schoolteachers,

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:51.760
parents, community people.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.760
Organize a different group of people so that
this issue starts from the...is—is tackled

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.290
from the grassroots to the top level.

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:04.440
So everyone has a role to play in making communities
straight.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.140
My theory: the world is upside down.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.110
We need many hands to turn it upright.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:11.710
And many strategies.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.710
One last question.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:16.720
[Young girl's voice off screen] Um, I know
what you went through because my parents ran

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.010
away from Somalia when I was a young kid.

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:26.990
And I came with the IRC Peacemakers and I
was wondering, how did you overcame all this?

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:30.540
It—it's something that never goes away.

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:35.920
You know, you see all of this, sometimes you
see all of this strength and you see all of

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:45.730
this um...everything you see, it's easy to
have a flashback.

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:51.950
It's easy to walk into a space and just black
out.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:54.810
It's easy to cry.

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:58.290
It's easy to be upset and angry.

00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:06.580
And because you have all of these emotions
happening every time, what is not easy is

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.380
for you to keep going.

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.700
And for me that's where I find myself.

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:24.840
Um, some days I have this tough thing going
on about me, trying to be the girl, but inside

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:30.660
I'm like Jell-O. You know, it—it's so much
happening.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:37.270
And you—you're just so emotional about things
you see happen.

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:43.800
And once you've gone through it, my dear,
it—it's—it's internal.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.140
And it is not—it's not about where you come
from anymore.

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:53.860
So when I hear the stories of women in Mali,
it's my story.

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:58.300
When I hear the stories of women in Sudan,
it's my story.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:04.590
When I hear the stories of women even here
in the U.S., who...single mothers who have

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:09.220
gone through many different things, refugee
women, it's my story.

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.460
So trust me.

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.540
It never goes away.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:19.640
And one of the things I tell young people,
old people, there is no way we can do this

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:24.810
work that we're doing if we don't believe
there's a high—higher power responsible

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:26.400
for some of the things happening.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:30.690
Now, I'm not saying be a good Christian, be
a good Muslim, be a Judist—uh, a Jewish,

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:32.630
uh, be a Hindu.

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:37.860
What I'm saying is you have to have a kind
of faith to be able to negotiate this world

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:43.760
if you're a peacebuilder or peace activist
or a change agent, because you'll see so many

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.260
things that will make you angry.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:52.490
I— [whistle sound] I always ask this question,
"What similar traits does Hitler and Martin

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:54.280
Luther King have?

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.280
Dee?

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.350
Some of the traits?

00:55:57.350 --> 00:56:05.640
Yes, one characteristics that Hitler and King
has or share or...

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.840
Desmond Tutu and Charles Taylor?"

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.840
[Gbowee]:Trait.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.510
[Aker]: Traits?

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:18.090
[laughs] [Gbowee]: One characteristics or
traits or whatever or one—one thing they

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:19.090
share.

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:24.380
And the mayor of Chicago says, "Well, besides
humanity I don't see anything they share."

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:29.100
I said, "Well, anger."

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.010
Hitler was an angry man.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:32.950
Dr. King was angry.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:34.310
Mandela was angry.

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:35.650
Charles Taylor was angry.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:37.650
I've been angry.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:39.540
Other women are angry.

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:46.000
What distinguish us from the other is how
we put...where we put our anger.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.900
So, pardon me.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.119
I have this thing that I say, I go like this.

00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:52.119
Fluid.

00:56:52.119 --> 00:56:53.560
Has no shape or size.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:58.400
So this is the peace container and this is
the war container.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.940
And anger is not in any of this here.

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.190
And you can decide, "OK, I'm really angry
right now.

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:07.830
But I'm going to pour my anger into the peace
container."

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:12.690
And what you see is someone who is building
peace and doing something positive with their

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:13.690
anger.

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:15.400
Anger is what keeps me going.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:20.119
Anger is something that...it's like the fuel
that I need to do something.

00:57:20.119 --> 00:57:26.870
But I never ever think that I'm going to pour
my anger into a violent container.

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:30.750
And so when you do—when you—when you say,
"Does it ever go away?

00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:33.130
No, no mama, it never goes away.

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:36.150
All you have to do is, where do I pour my
anger?

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:42.440
Where do I pour all of those emotions so that
will make sense to the world, and that will

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.610
leave a—that will leave a legacy?

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:48.990
And most times when you've gone through war,
you've through a situation the question you

00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:54.170
need to ask yourself is, "Do I want to put
this in this violent container and end up

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.540
in the Hague or end up a villain?

00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:03.171
Or do I want to put it in this peace container
and end up leaving a perfect legacy, like

00:58:03.171 --> 00:58:08.440
someone like King or Mandela or Tutu or Mother
Theresa?"

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:14.830
Because all of these people like all of the
people we consider villains had one common

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:17.310
thing, and that thing was anger.

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:22.430
Tonight as you to go home, think about it,
teach your children that anger is neither

00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:30.840
good nor bad, but how you pour your anger
is what your life story end will be.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:54.620
Thank you all very much.

00:58:54.620 --> 00:59:17.690
[applause]
