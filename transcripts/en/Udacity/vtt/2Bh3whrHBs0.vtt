00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.880
It should be obvious now that the value
of a dollar delivered in the future,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.430
even if it comes from the US government
is worth less than a real dollar

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.830
right now.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.280
A real dollar right now is worth $1.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.060
If I promise to give you a dollar in
the future it's not worth as much.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.920
So how should we estimate or

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.620
think about the value of dollars
delivered in the future?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.660
I think we've also agreed that
the United States government,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.950
promising to give you a dollar in
the future, is worth a bit more,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.430
than the promise of Tucker Balch
giving you a dollar in the future.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.520
But having a real dollar in your hand
right now, this one, is worth the most.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.560
Why is that?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.930
You know intuitively why that is.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.698
The deeper reason is there's a chance
that I won't deliver on that guarantee

00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:56.011
whereas we can be pretty
sure that the U.S.

00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:59.080
government will deliver
on that guarantee.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.190
So it amounts to risk.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.769
And it all boils down to interest rate.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.710
We're trying to figure
out the present value,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.110
or PV of a dollar that will
be delivered in the future.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.230
So it's worth some fraction
of this future value.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.830
Present value is worth some
fraction of the future value.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.660
So here's the formula in it's entirety.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.007
Present value is equal to
future value divided by 1 plus

00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:32.290
interest rate raised to the i.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.370
So the i is how far into the future
this payment is going to be delivered.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.430
So for instance, if it's going to be
delivered right now i is equal to 0 this

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.690
whole component becomes 1 and present
value is equal simply to future value.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.332
In other words, if we're going to
pay a $1, present value is worth $1,

00:01:56.332 --> 00:02:00.620
if in the future that future is
going to be 1 year from now.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.180
It's 1 plus the interest rate,
raised to the 1th power.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.880
And that is what the future
value of that dollar is.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.200
So, let's work out an example.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.130
Suppose with the United States
government, because they're so

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.551
trustworthy, you can
negotiate a 1% interest rate.

00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:24.910
Actually, as of today, which is 2015,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.150
this 1 year interest rate is
only one-quarter of a percent.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.168
In order words,
interest rates are very, very low.

00:02:34.168 --> 00:02:40.166
If you work it out, the value of
a $1 bill paid to you in the future,

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:45.244
1 year from now,
at a 1% interest rate is $0.99.

00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:50.473
In other words, today,
it's worthwhile for you to pay $0.99 to

00:02:50.473 --> 00:02:56.070
the US government for the promise that
they'll give you a dollar in a year.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.840
Okay, consider now the Balch Bond.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.830
So it's hard for me to sell you
this asset right now for the same

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.010
price as the US government because
if you had to choose between me and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.330
the US government for a 1% return, why
wouldn't you choose the US government?

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.170
You should go with the US

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.040
government because they're
more trustworthy than I am.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.170
So, how can I attract you?

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.430
Well, I can offer you
a higher interest rate.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.682
Let's say 5%.

00:03:25.682 --> 00:03:29.753
And that works out to
a value of about $0.95.

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:34.488
In other words, in order for
me to attract you to buy my promise for

00:03:34.488 --> 00:03:38.660
$1 in the future,
I could only charge you $0.95.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.630
So let's consider this in a chart form.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.353
So how much is $1 worth if I
promise to give it to you today.

00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:51.158
Well, in that case,
this i is equal to 0, so

00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:57.189
the present value is equal to the future
value of all this divided by 1.

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.153
So in all cases, if the number
of years we're going to wait for

00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:04.760
the delivery of that dollar is 0,
the value is $1.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.890
But what if we talk about promising
you that dollar in the future.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.149
If we look at this for the US bond,
in 1 year we see it's worth $0.99.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.230
If we carry that forward,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.630
it's sort of this exponentially
decreasing value like that.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.410
If you look at the Balch Bond,
which is, of course, not as worthwhile

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.000
as the US government, you see one that
decreases at an even faster rate.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.540
So in other words, at each year in
the future, this $1 is worth less.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.595
In other words, if I promise to give you
$1 in two years, it's worth less than,

00:04:44.595 --> 00:04:47.700
if I promise to give you $1 in a year,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.400
it's worth even less than if I
promise to give you $1 right now,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.850
and these charts are different
depending on what the interest rate is.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.890
In other words, for
the higher interest rate assets,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.750
they decrease further into the future.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.910
In other words, a dollar delivered
in the future is worth less now

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.780
than the lower interest rate assets.
