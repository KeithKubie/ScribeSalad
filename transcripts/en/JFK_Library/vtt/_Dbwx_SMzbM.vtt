00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.170
PRESENTER: Very briefly.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.080
Doug Brinkley is the chair
of humanities and professor

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.823
of history at Rice
University, which you know.

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:08.490
And you'll hear about
why tonight that's

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.020
particularly important.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.410
He is also a CNN
presidential historian,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.530
a contributing editor
to the Vanity Fair,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.040
literally seven honorary
doctorates, and numerous books.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.380
But this is absolutely
my favorite.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.980
And in so many ways, it's
so insightful in so many

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.560
different elements.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.610
While he came from Texas, Fred
came from across the river

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.080
in Cambridge.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.050
Fred is the professor
of international affairs

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.870
at Harvard Kennedy School
and is the author and editor

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.960
of nine books, including
the Pulitzer Prize winner

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.940
Embers of War: The
Fall of an Empire

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.010
and the Making of
American Vietnam.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.690
So that book is amazing.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.913
But speaking of what's
coming up that Fred-- and you

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:52.830
can't tell anyone yet.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.210
This is just our little secret.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.120
But Fred is going to
have a two-volume series,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.820
a definitive book on
John F. Kennedy-- books

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.660
on John F. Kennedy.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.290
So we'll have him
come back for that.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.135
So with that, join me for our--

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:05.510
welcome these two
special people.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:13.040
FREDRIK LOGEVALL: It's
absolutely wonderful

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.350
to see all of you here
and to have this chance

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.290
to share the stage
with Doug Brinkley.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.440
And I think of the fact that
on May 25, 1961, as Doug writes

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.670
about in this marvelous
book, President Kennedy

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.670
issued basically a challenge.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.030
And he didn't live
to see that challenge

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.760
met, that challenge realized.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.840
But eight years later,
some half a billion people,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.660
maybe upwards of
600 million people,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.370
saw that extraordinary
moment when Neil Armstrong

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.610
took those first steps.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.800
I, alas, did not see them.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.200
I was a little guy
about this big.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.820
And I was in Sweden
at the time, where

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.890
it was the middle of the night.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.570
So I don't have
that recollection.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.130
Doug was also a little guy.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.620
I think he's going to talk
about maybe that he did see it.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.020
But it's an
extraordinary moment.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.090
And this book speaks
to how this happened.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.400
And it's an incredible story.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.470
And I'm just thrilled
to have this opportunity

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.570
to be here tonight and to
be part of this endeavor.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.830
And I guess I want
to start, Doug--

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.510
in a sense, I think
it was inevitable

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.000
that you would write this book.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.500
As he lays out in the
early pages of this book,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.720
there is your childhood
in Ohio that, in a sense,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.440
made you the person who
should write this book.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.560
There is the fact
that the president

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.000
gave a very important speech.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.210
We may hear a snippet of
this speech in a little while

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.330
here at an institution
where Doug Brinkley is now

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.140
a distinguished professor,
that is to say Rice University.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.450
And then on I think what
you call a kind of lark,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.370
Doug sought the opportunity to
interview a certain very famous

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.340
figure, got that interview.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.540
Was this book just meant--

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.140
was it foreordained that
you would write this book?

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.140
DOUG BRINKLEY: That's why
he teaches at Harvard,

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.000
because he's right.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.740
It was foreordained.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.800
Because I grew up in Perrysburg,
Ohio, a small town near Toledo.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.080
And Neil Armstrong was
from Wapakoneta, Ohio.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.640
Now these are two cities
you don't often hear about,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.360
Wapakoneta, Perrysburg.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.880
So you can imagine, I was nine
years old, going on nine soon.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.680
And my mom and dad were
really space fanatics.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.320
I started collecting all
of the plates for Apollo

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.080
and little astronaut things.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.900
And I knew about Gemini
at nine years old.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.000
I was a space geek.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.490
Also, Ohio was what we like to
call the mother of presidents.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.440
There were seven US
presidents from there.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.330
So down the road
from my house was

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.150
in Fremont, Ohio,
Rutherford B. Hayes' home.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.880
So presidential history
and space were big for me.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.410
And so I remember
watching it on television.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.329
And it's just seared into my
mind when Neil Armstrong walked

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.540
down the ladder and said,
that's one small step for man,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.720
one giant leap for mankind.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.640
He had wrote that line himself.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.540
He had test marketed it to an
audience of one, his brother.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.200
And his brother
said, no, man, bingo.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.740
Go for it.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.840
It's pretty good.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.330
It's hard to beat the
one line when you really

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.750
try to come up with
something better, and maybe

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.210
if he hadn't said man,
if he said for person

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.210
now in the 21st century.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.990
So I got to then later know
Neil Armstrong a little bit

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.090
because I reached out to him.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.547
I'd written a biography
of Dean Acheson,

00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:58.380
including doing research
here at the Kennedy

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.280
Library about Acheson's role
with JFK and Cuban Missile

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.050
Crisis, book on James
Forrestal, secretary of Navy

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.160
and secretary of defense.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.580
And I had the temerity
to autograph and write

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.520
each of those two,
my first two works.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.070
And I got a PO box
to Neil Armstrong

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.800
and wrote him a
blind letter saying,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.170
I'd be interested
in interviewing you.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.370
I don't have a particular
book project in mind,

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.310
but I grew up in Perrysburg
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.660
And I got back a polite
card from his assistant

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.160
that said, Mr. Armstrong
will read one of your books,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.720
meaning not two.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.590
And he doesn't do interviews.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.280
As you might know, he
was very much media shy.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.710
But we'll keep you in mind, kind
of a polite blow off letter.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.260
I forgot about it until
I got asked by NASA

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.550
to do the oral history interview
for Neil Armstrong, which

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.100
he never did, in 2001.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.020
The date was signed
for a few days

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.950
after 9/11, as it turned out,
in September, late September

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.810
of 2001.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.480
And I watched the
trade towers collapse.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.730
I was positive with all
that death, carnage,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.310
and airports shut that
this interview was

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.350
going to be canceled
because he wasn't

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.830
keen on doing at any rate.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.420
He felt he owed one to
NASA for turning 70.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.270
And lo and behold, a
chief person at NASA

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.380
said, no, he's coming.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.240
Neil Armstrong doesn't
cancel anything.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.280
You must not know him.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.220
He flew his own plane from Ohio.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.020
He flew and landed at Johnson
Manned Space Center, Flight

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.910
Center in Houston and
just walked off, came in,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.230
and we did the interview.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.570
And at that time I
realized that some way

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.430
I was going to do a book that
connected space and Apollo 11,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.910
and as I mentioned,
at Rice University

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.810
where Kennedy gave the famous
September 12, 1962 speech.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.590
So as you said, it all
came together for me

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.640
in the writing of this book.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.000
FREDRIK LOGEVALL: That's
totally fascinating.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.745
And one of the
things that comes out

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:09.870
in the book, which you'll
all see when you read it,

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.270
which you all will, is
that I think it highlights

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.250
the importance of individuals.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.010
Just in class this
morning, I talked

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.400
about structure, and
agency, and history,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.510
and how it is that, obviously,
impersonal forces matter.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.960
But there are also moments
in which individuals make

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.293
a really important difference.

00:07:33.293 --> 00:07:35.210
And what comes through
beautifully in the book

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.550
is the degree to
which, in this case,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.920
individuals matter,
not just the president,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.980
although maybe we'll start
with John F. Kennedy.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.460
He's important in
this story, isn't he?

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.170
I mean, if you think
counterfactually,

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.290
if you remove him
from the story,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.935
maybe this doesn't happen, or it
doesn't happen on the schedule

00:07:55.935 --> 00:07:56.605
that it does.

00:07:56.605 --> 00:07:58.220
DOUG BRINKLEY: Exactly.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.710
Look, John F. Kennedy put
a lot of political capital

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.180
on going to the moon.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.810
I mean, it's pretty radical
when you think about it.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.990
I mean, here he is in early '61.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.450
He's giving his
famous inaugural.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.490
And then he has the Bay of Pigs.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:20.280
And then Yuri Gagarin goes
into space, Soviet cosmonaut.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.915
But Kennedy, to go from--

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.010
April, not sure.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.318
And on May 25 going to a joint
session of Congress, saying,

00:08:29.318 --> 00:08:31.860
we're going to put a man on the
moon by the end of the decade

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.659
and bring him back alive.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.230
People were flabbergasted,
particularly NASA people.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.640
NASA was created in 1958.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.132
And everybody at
NASA of that era

00:08:44.132 --> 00:08:45.590
was like, you got
to be kidding me.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.400
We don't have the technology.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.840
This is crazy.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.330
John F. Kennedy's
father, Joe Kennedy,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.560
called the White House to get
through to an assistant of JFK

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.440
and said, god damn it,
I knew Jack would do

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.390
something reckless like this.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.010
Are you kidding me?

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.680
Because we didn't
have the technology.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.520
And it's a pretty
brazen statement to say,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.010
we're going to do this
by the end of the decade.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.090
And it wasn't clear.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.310
Is it good politics
when you're not

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.550
going to be president when it
would happen in the late 1960s?

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.280
Even if you're a two-termer, it
may not happen on your watch.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.610
So many steps we had
to get to go there.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.650
A big fear of all the
presidents I write about--

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.610
Eisenhower, Kennedy, and
Johnson-- was dead astronauts.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.440
Just because we know this
summer Apollo 11's a success

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.280
and we made it to the moon
doesn't mean they knew it.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.730
And what I found out from this
book about John F. Kennedy, how

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.490
much of a creature of
the World War II era

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.670
he was, where we
did big things--

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.690
FDR, the Manhattan Project,
and Grand Coulee Dam,

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.760
and the WPA bridges
and projects.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.080
And of course, he
wasn't very keen--

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.650
there's no great lineage
with Kennedy and Truman.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.220
And Eisenhower, Kennedy
was a critic of.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.290
So he's going back to
a new deal, but not

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.650
a new deal that's
that big, as FDR's

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.140
grand federal expenditures.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.990
So putting your money
on space and technology

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.420
is a pretty good idea in 1961.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.840
And Time magazine in
1960 chose scientists

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.790
as the men of the year.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.220
And NASA was getting good press.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.410
We needed to beat the Soviets.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.730
But the fact that Kennedy did it
and said we're going to do it,

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.650
it became this
marvelous salesperson

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.480
for going to the moon.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.490
No other politician
can give a speech

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.610
like, we choose to
go to the moon, not--

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.838
this is extraordinary oratory.

00:10:46.838 --> 00:10:48.630
And it wasn't just
about going to the moon.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:53.870
It was about promoting science
education, STEM, in schools,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.100
the history of
exploration, uplifting

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.550
of the American spirit,
beating an adversary

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.380
in a peaceful competition.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.060
Going to the moon
wasn't about war.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.060
It was a peaceful
competition with Russia.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.730
So it all came
together in hindsight.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.230
And that's what we
do as historians.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.020
We could say Kennedy picked
a difficult number going

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.520
to the moon.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.630
And we did it.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.370
And so it's triumphal in a
way, because Pearl Harbor

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.350
is a disaster.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.910
We remember that day.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:25.380
9/11's a disaster, Kennedy
assassination a disaster.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.720
For those big, epic
moments, the Apollo 11,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.760
the walking on the
moon still lives on.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.710
And we all celebrate
the moonshot.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.950
We're all looking for a
new moonshot time we all

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.050
can work on something
grand together

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:46.280
instead of bickering and arguing
with each other all the time.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.997
FREDRIK LOGEVALL:
Why do you think--

00:11:47.997 --> 00:11:49.580
let's pursue this a
little bit further

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.740
in terms of his motivations.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.510
Because something
you said certainly

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.947
jibes with my own research.

00:11:55.947 --> 00:11:58.280
I think that he had come to
believe John F. Kennedy even

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.990
before he became president,
that in the nuclear age war

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.150
is an impossibility,
especially among great powers.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.650
We have to do whatever we can
to avoid that kind of conflict.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.810
Yet, as you also
demonstrate in the book,

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.960
and is very consistent
with my own findings,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.270
he's extremely competitive.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.700
And it's been instilled
in all of the Kennedy kids

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.650
since they were little.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.150
Ted later talked about this.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.440
Bobby talked about this.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.700
Eunice talked about this.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.760
Jack himself mentioned
this, that Joe Kennedy

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.310
Sr. had said to them,
second place is no good.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.765
So there is a sense
of competition

00:12:32.765 --> 00:12:33.640
that I think is here.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.530
And you talk about this.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.880
On the other hand,
war is impossible.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.340
So would it be
fair to say, Doug,

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.650
that a key motivation
here is that here's a way

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:48.180
to win in a very important
geopolitical sense,

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.265
but maybe without
the attendant risks?

00:12:50.265 --> 00:12:52.140
Talk a little bit more
about his motivations.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.390
DOUG BRINKLEY: Perfectly said.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.430
That's why he's the definitive
biographer of John F. Kennedy.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:00.060
That's exactly
it, that he really

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.030
was a peace advocate, John
F. Kennedy in many ways,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.250
and not just because he
did the nuclear test ban

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.020
treaty in his presidency.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.050
But he knew that nuclear
war was not an option.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.050
And it was renewed on him
and the Cuban Missile Crisis,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.630
obviously.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.500
And this idea of going into
another Korean War situation

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.310
of just fighting what will
become Vietnam automatically,

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.860
just going to proxy
war, proxy war.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.390
But yet, he doesn't
want to lose.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.190
And he is an anti-communist.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.730
And once the Soviets
put Sputnik up in 1957,

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.770
Kennedy is running
on the missile gap

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.360
with Russia and the space gap,
and that we've got to be first,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.860
that no use being second.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.990
And it comes part of
that family background.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.530
There's one story you've
probably stumbled upon,

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.540
where Kennedy is playing chess.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.170
And he's about to
get [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.420
And he topples over
the table and says,

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.950
I guess we'll
never know who won.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.510
I say that he
didn't like losing.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.700
And the thought that
we are losing in space

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.480
bugged him as a senator, but
now when the Soviets put up

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.460
the first person ever, human
in space ever on his watch.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.517
And then I still think
there's a pragmatism to him.

00:14:15.517 --> 00:14:17.100
And we talk about
his romantic streak.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.820
But once Alan Shepard
goes up on May 5, '61,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.640
that wasn't a dead astronaut.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.470
That was a space hero.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.200
Alan Shepard came back,
and everybody cheered.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.750
America pulled together.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.460
And Kennedy now is reassured
that manned space was possible.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.570
And greenlit, continual
manned space efforts

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.030
with Mercury program--

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.310
there were the famous
Mercury Seven astronauts.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.220
Only one didn't go up
during Kennedy's presidency,

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.470
Deke Slayton, who never
went up in Mercury.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.100
Kennedy was the first
Mercury mission and the last.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.190
All six of the space
heroes came back alive.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.540
They were successes.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.200
So the astronauts became
Kennedy's space cadets,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.400
the space corps.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.400
And like his PT-109
experience in war,

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.010
where courage and
risk, and you're

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.800
in the middle of battle zone,
and anything can happen,

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.030
he admired these astronauts,
not superficially, not just as

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.220
props, as men.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.500
Kennedy liked the
cut of their jib.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.780
And of course, John
Glenn in particular

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:23.280
becomes nearly an adopted member
of the extended Kennedy family.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.830
I talked to Ethel Kennedy.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.040
And she told me that when
her husband was killed

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.590
in Los Angeles, she had called
John Glenn and to go look

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.470
after her kids at
Hickory Hill in Virginia.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.480
That's how close the
family was to Glenn.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.830
Bobby Kennedy and John Glenn
became almost like brothers.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.220
And so this is a real thing
for Kennedy, the astronaut,

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:53.190
and space age, and also the
romance of the sea, the ocean

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.150
that he had.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.520
He was able to call
space the new ocean

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.680
and understood that
it was going to be

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.820
something special to explore.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.420
FREDRIK LOGEVALL:
On the business

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.550
about the will to win, just
to echo what Doug had said,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.710
when Jackie came into his
life, when they were courting

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.620
and then after
they were married,

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.680
it turns out she's really good--

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.600
she's really good at board
games and at a lot of games.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.200
And he did not like the fact
that she would always or almost

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.090
always win at these games.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.818
So it squares with
what you're saying.

00:16:27.818 --> 00:16:28.610
DOUG BRINKLEY: Yes.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.870
FREDRIK LOGEVALL: One of the
things that you bring out--

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.300
and maybe it's
another motivation

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.530
in the causal hierarchy.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.580
Maybe it doesn't rise as high
as the things you've mentioned,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.560
but there's also a domestic,
political motivation.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:46.940
Or you talk about how
southern senators were

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.350
in a sense, if I remember
correctly, placated by the fact

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:56.560
that a lot of NASA money would
be spent in their states.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.570
There's a certain domestic
politician at work too,

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.310
isn't there?

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.393
DOUG BRINKLEY: Absolutely.

00:17:02.393 --> 00:17:05.369
That's what my biggest takeaway
from doing this research that I

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:10.290
had no idea of, is that the
technological, tech corridors

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.460
that get created.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.359
You know about MIT, and Stark
Draper, and all the computer

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.810
specialization here and
what Massachusetts did.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.619
But this southern strategy
of Kennedy and Lyndon,

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.950
incidentally right after
Alan Shepard went up--

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.140
President Kennedy's
sitting in a limo

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.630
with Minow of communications.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.880
And Vice President
Johnson and Alan Shepard,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.250
they're all in a car
together, limo ride.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.710
And they start to
have a conversation.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.240
And the gist of it was--

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.860
the comment was made by Minow--

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.520
if you know what?

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.000
To Alan Shepard-- if you
didn't come back alive,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Kennedy, the president, would
have blamed you, Lyndon,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.590
for the disaster.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.560
Because Kennedy was
the head of the space

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.020
policy at that juncture.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.030
And then Minow, people laughed.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:09.660
And then the line became, no,
if Alan had died in space,

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.370
Lyndon would be
the next astronaut.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.920
The point being, we always
talk about Jack Kennedy, Lyndon

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.780
Johnson not seeing eye to eye.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.110
They did see eye to eye
on space exploration.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.830
Kennedy and Johnson both
were behind NASA in the '50s.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.100
Both believed in it.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.830
And where Johnson
works with Kennedy

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.350
and James Webb had
a NASA well, is

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.390
they recognized they
barely won South in 1960.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.030
Texas they win by a hair, as
most of you probably know.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.220
What about 1964?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.000
And the reason why the South
in '64 is nerve wracking

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.320
is civil rights, that going on
in the South there was blue dog

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.100
Democrats and still senators.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.870
But this is pre-Lyndon's Civil
Rights Acts of '64 in '65.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.490
But Kennedy is getting
behind civil rights.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.970
So what do you do in Alabama,
or Mississippi, or Florida,

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.090
and where you're not liking the
progressivism of the Kennedy

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:06.870
administration?

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:11.010
One good way is
pork, tech money.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:15.360
And Johnson was able to
finagle getting a lot of money

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.190
into Oklahoma and Texas.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.730
The head of space
appropriations in the Senate

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.820
is Senator Kerr of Oklahoma.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.660
And Kerr is the where
James Webb of NASA

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.930
was working when he got
hired by Kennedy to run NASA.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.200
And in Congress, the head
of space appropriations

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.090
is Albert Thomas.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.950
Guess where Thomas is from?

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.355
Houston, Texas.

00:19:41.355 --> 00:19:44.580
And we can talk all we want
about presidential leadership

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.780
and strategy, politics, but you
need money to go to the moon.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.170
Billions of dollars it would
have cost to go to the moon.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.950
And so they started getting
money, which I really

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.160
think was smart, into San
Antonio, Houston, Huntsville,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.755
Alabama, Pearl River region
of Mississippi, Louisiana

00:20:04.755 --> 00:20:08.850
and border, New Orleans,
Jacksonville, Brevard, North

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.020
Carolina, Hampton, Virginia,
flooding the southern zone

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.470
not just with jobs that comes
with NASA projects and not

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:21.390
just space hardware contracts,
but building tech corridors.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.990
My university, Rice University,
we are the great beneficiaries.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.730
We're a top university now.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.600
We created space science due
to NASA coming down there.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.540
And we're promoting
astronauts all the time.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.500
So the South, those democratic
senators in the South

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.960
said, all right, we'll
keep a little bit muted

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.600
about your civil rights if
I'm getting $150 million

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.980
into this community or that.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.300
And so it was a great
public works project,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.270
building tech corridors
all over the country,

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.090
like Pasadena and Cleveland.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:57.980
Also but a lot went into what
they were calling the Southwest

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.190
or Gulf South, and
in particularly

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.650
Houston, which is
the giant beneficiary

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:08.390
of Kennedy's policy.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.120
FREDRIK LOGEVALL:
You're mentioning here

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.667
that there are other people
who matter in this story.

00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:16.000
They don't matter to the
degree that the president does,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.660
but they matter.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.400
And of course,
Wernher von Braun,

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.570
as we were saying
before we came on stage,

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.360
is just endlessly interesting.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.370
And you bring out
the degree to which

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.980
he is a very significant
figure in this story.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.170
Talk a little bit about him.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.712
DOUG BRINKLEY: Don't
know how many of

00:21:33.712 --> 00:21:36.590
you remember the name
Wernher Von Braun,

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.310
but he was the one who built
the Saturn V Apollo rocket that

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.690
took us to the moon.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.690
He was a rocket
genius extraordinaire,

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.050
and a rocket engineer is
what they were called.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.750
But he was from Germany.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.140
And I kind of compare
Jack Kennedy's upbringing

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.490
and von Braun.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.920
Both came from wealthy families.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.770
Von Braun's came from a
German aristocratic family

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.870
in the Weimer Republic era.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:07.880
But in 1930s when
the rise of Hitler,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.280
some German rocket
scientists fled Nazi Germany.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.890
Von Braun stayed.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.580
He was a big opportunist and
was fanatical about someday

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.090
going to the Moon, and
Mars, and building rockets.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.820
You've got to know
that in World War II,

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.840
we had yet to go into outer
space with a projectile.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.910
We had high altitude
balloons that got up,

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.220
but Von Braun is
the one who creates

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.790
how to go in outer space during
World War II along the Baltic

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.940
and Germany, Hitler's
top secret base.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.610
As we put a lot
of money and hope

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.910
on the Manhattan Project
for atomic weapons,

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.340
Hitler put it into missiles.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:51.260
And von Braun develops
eventually the V-2.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.020
And the V-2 rocket
is the beginning

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.060
of the age of missiles
that we're all living in.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.800
And the V-2, they would
move in on launcher pads.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.230
And they fired it into London.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:08.930
You had 5,000 V-2 missiles that
arc over 210 miles in the air,

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.510
launched from, say, the
Netherlands and London.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.940
And if you go in
London, the word V-2

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.070
still resonates because the
city could have been destroyed.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.410
There was a fear.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.640
Luckily, this was
late '44, early '45.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.400
And the Third Reich
ran out of gas.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.840
Hitler commits suicide.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.350
And the genius rocketeer,
nobody close to him

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:34.010
in missile technology
anywhere in the world,

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.530
gets captured by US Army.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.480
Von Braun-- it's a longer
story than I could do now-- he

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.760
created in the book.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.500
But he forged some documents.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.140
He was in the SS.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.620
And they used slave
labor at the Dora camp,

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.400
a subcamp of Buchenwald.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.400
So there could have been war
crimes against Wernher von

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.510
Braun.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.290
But he decided, I don't want
to be captured by the Russians

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:59.840
and have to work on
my rocketry in Russia.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.630
London, because I bombed the
hell out of Great Britain,

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.910
they may actually do war crimes.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.400
So they sent his
younger brother, Magnus,

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.400
to look for the US
Army and surrender.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.320
And they had hidden
in a mineshaft

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.630
all of their
blueprints for rockets,

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.730
war materials, everything.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.660
They blew open, they
dynamited, then closed the cave

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.457
and basically said
to the United States,

00:24:22.457 --> 00:24:23.540
we'll give you everything.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.590
We'll move to America.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.860
We'll work for you.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.890
Just let us come
there and be American.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.240
And we'll do everything for you.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.700
And the Truman
administration greenlit it

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.280
in a thing called
Operation Paperclip.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.610
And we moved all these Nazi
rocket engineers and scientists

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.510
to Fort Bliss, Texas, which
is right on the Mexico border

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.790
by the White Sands
Proving Ground, which

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.970
is near Roswell, New
Mexico, where Dr. Robert

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.910
Goddard, the great
American rocket scientist,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.570
was conducting his desert
launches of early rockets.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:59.810
And von Braun worked
there from 1945 to 1950.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.180
He was called a
prisoner of peace.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.860
They allowed him to go
marry a German woman,

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.150
but he was always
under surveillance.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.830
And then he moved to
Huntsville, Alabama

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.340
in 1950 to work at the
Army's Redstone Arsenal.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.580
This is where the moon rockets
are built by von Braun.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.730
Kennedy first meets
Wernher Von Braun in 1953

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.010
when they are chosen.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:26.370
Young Senator Kennedy just
won from Massachusetts in '52.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.020
So he's kind of like
a hot, new politician.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.190
And von Braun were the judges
for Time's Person of the Year.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.100
But Henry Luce, who had
written the introduction

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:43.040
to why England slept, Luce got
them together as the judge.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.980
It was a stunt for--

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.750
talked to the media
to promote Time.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.100
And they got along famously.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.520
And in fact, von
Braun later reflected

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.890
that he told his wife, that
guy's going to be president

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.050
someday, about Kennedy.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.910
But more importantly,
he said Kennedy

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.840
kept talking about his brother
being killed in World War II,

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.590
trying to take out
Soviet missiles or parts

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.840
in underground caves in France.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:14.330
And Operation Aphrodite is
where Joseph Kennedy Jr., they

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.060
packed him in a plane with
dynamite and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.800
And it was like a drone.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.840
And it was aiming to
take out the missile

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.770
capacity of these parts,
[INAUDIBLE] weapons of Hitler

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.480
that von Braun had created.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.040
And his brother blew up
in the air and was killed.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.770
So here's Kennedy talking
about how his brother died

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.580
trying to take out
the vengeance parts

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.370
that Von Braun had created.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.340
And yet they were able to
get over any resentment

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.830
and became a team in
developing going to the moon.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.420
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
As you're sensing,

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.150
I think, in this
response, this part

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.615
of the book I found
absolutely riveting.

00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:55.990
And I think you'll
find the same.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:02.650
And even though I teach this
stuff, it's really new, this,

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.430
and there's much here that I
don't know, and the connection

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:11.380
to Joe Kennedy Jr. And what
happens to Joe Kennedy Jr.,

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.430
the explosion is so great over
the channel that there's no--

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:19.840
they don't find any part
of either Joe Kennedy

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.200
Jr. or his co-pilot.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.070
And of course it's right as
you indicate in the book.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.040
It's when, as you say a
moment ago, when this Nazi war

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.707
machine is running out
of gas, and in fact

00:27:32.707 --> 00:27:34.540
the very target that
they were going to hit,

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.082
as I think you point
out in the book,

00:27:36.082 --> 00:27:38.573
turns out to have been
a useless mission--

00:27:38.573 --> 00:27:39.490
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: Yes.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.290
FREDERIK LOGEVALL: --or
a superfluous mission.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:46.760
We thought that we would
play a couple of brief clips.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.920
And so we're going to do that,
a couple of minutes each.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.428
They're probably
self-explanatory,

00:27:52.428 --> 00:27:54.220
but I'll just say a
word or two about them.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:59.220
The first is a short bit from
the speech at Rice University,

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:05.400
September 12, 1962, mere steps
from our distinguished author's

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.188
faculty office.

00:28:07.188 --> 00:28:08.730
Maybe he'll say
something about that.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.560
And the second is
the 21st of November.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.500
So it's a couple months later.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.920
And it's in the cabinet
room in the White House.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.900
And there's several
participants, but the two

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.870
that we will hear
in the second clip--

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.370
let's hope this works--

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.800
is the president.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.010
And we're going to hear
also from Jim Webb.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.770
I'll just say this
about the second clip.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.630
It's about 10 or
12 minutes long,

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.140
if you listen to
the whole thing.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.220
But it's worth it.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.640
So if you're enticed
by these two minutes,

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.030
listen to the rest of it,
because it's worth doing.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.590
So if we could roll
the first of the tapes.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.720
And I wonder if we should--

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.012
is it going to be playing here?

00:28:50.012 --> 00:28:52.096
Should we step out of the way?

00:28:52.096 --> 00:28:52.846
Oh, it's up there.

00:28:52.846 --> 00:28:55.810
OK.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.860
JOHN F KENNEDY: But
why, some say, the moon?

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.740
Why choose this as our goal?

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:06.240
And they may well ask, why
climb the highest mountain?

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.200
Why, 35 years ago,
fly the Atlantic?

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.360
Why does Rice play Texas?

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.360
We choose to go to the moon!

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.180
We choose to go to the
moon in this decade

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.760
and do the other things,
not because they are easy,

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.070
but because they are hard,
because that goal will

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.970
serve to organize and measure
the best of our energies

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.290
and skills.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:35.280
Because that challenge is one
that we're willing to accept,

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.700
one we are unwilling
to postpone, and one we

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.348
intend to win, and
the others too.

00:29:41.348 --> 00:29:43.788
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:47.204 --> 00:29:52.770
But we shall send to the
moon, 240,000 miles away

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.500
from the control
station in Houston,

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.760
a giant rocket more
than 300 feet tall--

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.070
the length of this
football field--

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.820
made of new metal alloys, some
of which have not yet been

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:11.190
invented, capable of standing
heat and stresses several times

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.920
more than have ever
been experienced,

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.210
fitted together with a precision
better than the finest watch,

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.180
carrying all the equipment
needed for propulsion,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.630
guidance, control,
communications, food,

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:29.700
and survival, on an untried
mission to an unknown celestial

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.720
body, and then return
it safely to Earth,

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.890
re-entering the atmosphere at
speeds of over 25,000 miles per

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.640
hour, causing heat about
half that of the temperature

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.600
of the sun--

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.910
almost as hot as
it is here today--

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.020
and do all this, and do
all this and do it right,

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.365
and do it first, before
this decade is out-- then

00:30:52.365 --> 00:30:53.540
we must be bold.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.220
FREDERIK LOGEVALL: The only--

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:05.945 --> 00:31:08.640
The only thing that's
jarring to our ears today

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.807
is that Rice would
not play Texas.

00:31:10.807 --> 00:31:12.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.770
If they did, and Doug
can speak to this,

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.530
I don't think it would be a
pretty result. But at the time,

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.410
they did play each other.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.970
So the second clip,
and I want to say

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.720
before we roll the second
clip, is that in the book,

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.560
this particular meeting
is covered in depth.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.420
It's an absolutely fascinating,
contentious meeting.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.760
It gets more-- in
some ways, I think

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.527
it gets more testy after
we're going to cut it off.

00:31:38.527 --> 00:31:40.860
I just didn't think that we
should roll the whole thing.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.110
We have too short a time.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.490
But read about it
also in the book.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.832
So if we could roll number two.

00:31:47.832 --> 00:31:49.540
JOHN F KENNEDY: Do
you put this program--

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.710
do you think this program
is the top priority

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.833
program of the agency?

00:31:53.833 --> 00:31:55.000
JIM WEBB: No, sir, I do not.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.280
I think it is one of the
top priority programs,

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.200
but I think it's very
important to recognize here

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.700
that as you have found what
you can do with a rocket,

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.430
as you find how you can get out
beyond the Earth's atmosphere

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.430
and into space and
make measurements,

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:12.140
several scientific disciplines
that are very powerful

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.743
have begin to
converge on this area.

00:32:13.743 --> 00:32:15.910
JOHN F KENNEDY: Jim, I think
it is the top priority.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.618
I think we ought to
have that very clear.

00:32:17.618 --> 00:32:20.290
If you-- some of these other
programs can slip six months

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.140
or nine months and nothing
particularly is going to happen

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.430
that's going to make-- but
this is important for political

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.460
reasons, international
political reasons, and for--

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.420
This is, whether we like it
or not, in a sense a race.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.520
If we get second up
to the moon, it's

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.160
nice, but it's like being
second anytime, so that I--

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.050
if we're second by six months,
because we didn't give it

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.785
the kind of priority,
then of course

00:32:44.785 --> 00:32:45.910
that would be very serious.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.577
So I think we have
to take the view this

00:32:47.577 --> 00:32:48.760
is the top priority of it.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.110
It certainly is mine.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.920
JIM WEBB: But the
environment of space

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.990
is where you're going
to operate the Apollo

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:53.070
and where you're going
to do the landing.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:54.430
JOHN F KENNEDY: No, but I
know all these other things

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.130
and the satellite-- the
communications and weather

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:57.730
and all--

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:59.150
they're desirable,
but they can wait.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:32:59.530
JIM WEBB: Oh, no.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:00.488
I'm not putting those--

00:33:00.488 --> 00:33:02.920
I'm talking now about
the scientific program

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.990
to understand the space
environment within which

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.950
you've got to fly Apollo and
make the landing on the moon.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:07.650
SPEAKER 1: That's
part of the problem.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:08.740
JOHN F KENNEDY: Is that saying--
well, no, but wait a minute.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.410
Is that saying that
the lunar program,

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:14.680
to land a man on the moon, is
the top priority of the agency,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.990
is it?

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.260
JEROME WIESNER: And the
science that goes with it.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.680
JIM WEBB: Well,
I-- yes, if you--

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.513
JOHN F KENNEDY: No, but
I mean the science--

00:33:21.513 --> 00:33:23.900
JEROME WIESNER:
That is necessary.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.390
JOHN F KENNEDY: The science--

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.710
going to the moon is the
top priority project.

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:32.310
Now, there are a lot of
related scientific information

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.430
and development that will come
from that, which are important.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.520
But the whole thrust of
the agency, in my opinion,

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.540
is the lunar program.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.772
The rest of it can wait
six or nine months.

00:33:41.772 --> 00:33:43.248
JIM WEBB: Well, the trouble--

00:33:43.248 --> 00:33:45.216
Jerry's holding up his land--

00:33:45.216 --> 00:33:46.590
let me say one thing.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.927
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
So you get a taste.

00:33:50.927 --> 00:33:53.260
I mean, one of the things,
Doug, that I find interesting

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.150
about this last
clip, and I think

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.900
we talked a little bit
about this earlier,

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:02.240
but Webb, Webb is not
shy about interrupting.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.710
He speaks his mind.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.090
Kennedy gives it back to him.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.450
This goes on for
10 or 12 minutes.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.489
It's pretty amazing.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.072
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
It's really amazing.

00:34:10.072 --> 00:34:13.219
Webb is one of the
great technocrats ever.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:16.850
But Bobby Kennedy called
him a blabbermouth,

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:20.040
and some people call him
the Mouth of the South.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.469
And Jack Kennedy had no problem,
as some of you probably know,

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:27.040
with that kind of give and take.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.576
And here's somebody working
for him, lay it on me.

00:34:30.576 --> 00:34:31.409
Here's what I think.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:32.420
What do you think?

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.889
That's what a leader does.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:35.690
You just witnessed
a leader in action

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.330
on both of those
communicating to the public

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.969
and pushing your policy
with your own staff

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:42.320
and challenging it.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.780
Webb gets concerned
that Kennedy,

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.469
if you're going that moon
crazy, that Kennedy is not

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.510
as focused on--

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.400
the big debate, guys,
that really is going on

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.100
in the Kennedy years
is, Eisenhower called

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.320
going to the moon a stunt.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.230
He was anti the Apollo program.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.430
Ike kept calling it a stunt.

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.280
McGeorge Bundy, national
security advisor,

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:09.840
said to John F Kennedy, this
moon, going to the moon thing,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.310
it's a grandstand ploy.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.050
People are going to
perceive it as you

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.470
being grandstanding
about going on the moon.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:23.270
And Kennedy said
to Mac or to Bundy,

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:25.710
you don't run for
president in your 40s

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.670
if you don't have moxie.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.270
Meaning, people were wondering--
you have to remember, guys,

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.330
the technology is not there
for the moon for the president

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:40.940
to be using that much of
his political power on it.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.940
But what Kennedy knew
is that the big word,

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.190
if I had to pick one word
from this book Kennedy likes

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:47.720
is leapfrog.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.730
We've got to
leapfrog the Soviets.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:53.330
If we just go, you put up a
cosmonaut, we do an astronaut,

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:54.260
you do a co--

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.670
we're not going to win.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.430
There'll be maybe
a parity to it.

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:04.580
But going to the moon would be
a big win, because Kennedy found

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.050
out, it was from Von Braun and
others but particularly him,

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.700
they don't have--

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:11.870
it's a starting ground.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.330
It's like go on a race.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:15.950
The Soviets and
developed a satellite.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.860
They put a dog in space early.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.750
The dog couldn't
come back alive.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:24.510
It melted, dehydrated
in the space.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.150
And so there was still
a danger of just putting

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.330
an astronaut in
space, but Kennedy

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.930
knew if we can focus
big and leapfrog it all,

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.990
we would have the success
that we have with Apollo 11,

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.490
and the point that
the American moon

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:41.360
shot is a point of national
pride, that our country did it,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.490
we planted an American
flag on the moon.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.740
And we didn't do it for military
reasons, we did it for peace,

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:47.990
and we did it for all mankind.

00:36:50.725 --> 00:36:53.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:55.428 --> 00:36:57.970
FREDERIK LOGEVALL: It's always
tempting in sessions like this

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:58.680
to--

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:03.900
and I guess I'm going to
bite, to ask to ask an author,

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.560
is there something
that surprised you?

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.750
One or two things that
surprised you in the course

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.855
of doing this?

00:37:09.855 --> 00:37:11.480
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
Yeah, I really didn't

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:17.240
realize how much Kennedy got
personally involved with space.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:22.110
In the sense, in the '50s,
he would make jokes about it.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.410
Well, one thing that you
have to keep in mind, guys,

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:28.970
is that a big part of
my book, everybody's

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:30.160
fighting for the money.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.510
Army wants to put
the rockets up.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.550
Navy wants to put
the rockets up.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.110
Air Force wants to.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.300
Rivalry between the three.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.980
Eisenhower bet on the Navy
building vanguard missiles.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:48.110
So when you see on film clips
of NASA rockets collapsing,

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.660
those were Navy
vanguard rockets.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.740
Kennedy is putting his money on
Von Braun and the army rockets.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.470
Going to the moon was
a big army success.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.990
But one of the ways to
split the rivalry up

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.940
is to trade off astronauts.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.440
Here's a Navy aviator.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.820
Navy.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.260
John Glenn was a Marine.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.540
And the Marines had
no rocket program,

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.790
but we're putting
a marine in space.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.830
So each of those
service branches

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:18.390
got a test pilot up to feel
part of the Apollo project.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:21.740
The other thing
that was interesting

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:25.490
was, these are all white men
in an era of civil rights.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:28.520
And in retrospect,
we should have

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.780
had a woman as one of the
Mercury astronauts or Gemini.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.730
And we should have
been able to put

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.550
an African-American into space.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.340
It wasn't in the mix back then.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:44.960
Edward R Murrow was pushing for
what you call a person of color

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.180
to be one of the
Mercury astronauts,

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:51.530
not just for equity reasons but
to send a message to the world

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.780
that America did that.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.720
But instead, the
NASA decided you

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.780
have to stick with the
trained fighter test

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.090
pilots of the Korean War era.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.480
And those were white men
with engineering degrees

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:10.260
from places like
Purdue and the like.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.990
MIT is where Buzz
Aldrin got his is PhD.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:18.440
And so I write is my book,
with our world today,

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.360
it's very gender
conscious, I did not

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.410
know until I did this book that
there was Mercury 13 women that

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.390
trained to be astronauts.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.780
And they went through all of the
endurance tests in New Mexico

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.550
by Dr. Randy Lovelace.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.680
And they were incredible pilots.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.440
And the doctors,
physicians, thought

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.720
women would be the
perfect astronauts

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.290
because the capsules, if you see
Alan Shepherd's little capsule.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:47.210
So physiologically
smaller, less oxygen,

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.000
he had blood
statistics, endurance.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.910
He had all of the things that
a woman should go into space,

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:56.030
but unfortunately we let the
Soviets beat us in that first.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:00.170
They put the first woman
into space, Russia.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.660
Sally Ride is our first
American female astronaut.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.183
She doesn't go up to 1983
in our space program.

00:40:07.183 --> 00:40:09.350
So I thought that's a missed
opportunity in America,

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.400
to be first in those
glass ceiling-shatterings.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.560
But alas, it didn't
happen that way.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.510
But now I go all over.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:22.170
I just spoke to a woman who was
the first woman spacewalker.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:27.170
And women astronauts
are populated in NASA

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:30.020
and also are working
for new private sector

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.750
companies like Jeff
Bezos's Blue Origin

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:36.130
or with Elon Musk and
Branson and the like.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.920
So it's a very fertile
field for young women here

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.990
with an interest in science,
technology, engineering,

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:46.310
computer science,
those spaces now.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:49.670
Women are all over
NASA right now,

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.770
working on going
into space, and we've

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.252
had many female astronauts.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.070
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
Absolutely fascinating.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.080
One of the things that surprised
me as a reader of the book,

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.580
and I don't know
whether, Doug, this

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:08.120
was also surprising to you, but
Kennedy flirted with the idea--

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:12.410
I guess a question for you
is, how serious this was,

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.860
but he flirted with the
idea of maybe joining forces

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.280
with the Soviets
on this endeavor.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.150
This notwithstanding the
fact, as we discussed earlier,

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:25.310
that he is an extremely
competitive guy, that this

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:29.300
is a Cold War, that he's had
a setback at the Bay of Pigs,

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.060
he needs to recapture momentum.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.338
But he at least toyed with this.

00:41:35.338 --> 00:41:36.880
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
It's a great point,

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.790
and you can read about it
more, because it's complicated.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.620
But Khrushchev and Kennedy
would each taunt each other

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.100
that maybe we should
do things together.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.480
And then it would disintegrate.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.130
Maybe joint space.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:53.860
The best line of these games was
from Nikita Khrushchev's son,

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.630
who is our oral history
eyewitness saying

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.300
that he spoke to
his father about,

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.160
"will you go to the
moon with America?

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.330
Would you be interested?"

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:05.290
He said, "no, we can't do
joint space with Americans."

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.210
And like, "why not Papa?"

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:11.520
And he said, "because they'll
find out what we don't have."

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.340
We forget Khrushchev blustered
his technology a lot.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.940
Putin does that today too.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.240
They bluster it all.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.800
And if we did joint, our
American intelligence officers,

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.100
military people would
get to see how primitive

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.230
some of their technology was.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:33.050
We were overestimating
some of their capabilities.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.410
One of the other beautiful
parts of this competition, which

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:39.540
I actually almost gets shivers
just thinking about it,

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.230
that I didn't know
on your don't know

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:45.700
thing is, when we landed on the
moon, right before they left,

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:50.140
they're about to leave the moon,
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.560
Armstrong said to Buzz,
"did you leave the packet?"

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.850
And Armstrong said, "oh yeah."

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.890
And Armstrong went back on foot.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.830
The last thing they
did, in that packet

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:04.570
were medals to honor the
Soviet cosmonauts who had

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.630
died in their space program.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.170
So in the moon right
now are Soviet medals

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:16.690
by the American site that
NASA decided to honor.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.590
Because without the Soviet
spur, and their cosmonauts,

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.510
and their technological
work, we wouldn't

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.260
have been motivated to do it.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.050
But the fact that
they thought to do

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.740
that I found very impressive.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:34.480
And of course by 1975, when
Gerald Ford's president,

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.830
you have a docking in space with
the Russian and United States.

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:41.050
And it's clearly that
there is no space race.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:44.020
The United States, at least
this phase of it, won.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.300
Nobody's gone back to the moon.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.520
We're talking about going
back to the moon now.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.070
Vice President pence was
in Huntsville, Alabama

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:54.550
last week saying, in four or
five years, we might go back.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.760
Buzz Aldrin thinks we need to
do the moonshot should be a Mars

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.140
shot.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.300
But it's back in
conversation now,

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.120
partially because of
the 50th anniversary.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.790
There's also a group of
people quite credibly,

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.030
and they may be right, who
says the new moonshot has

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:11.680
to be an earth shot.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.820
Climate change.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.680
We've got to do a big
thing on attacking

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.257
climate change together.

00:44:16.257 --> 00:44:17.658
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:17.658 --> 00:44:23.390
And so we'll see how things go,
but the very term "moonshot"

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:29.330
has come to represent collective
American can-doism in the best

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.903
sense any word could convey.

00:44:31.903 --> 00:44:33.320
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
We're going to,

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.250
in a few minutes, don't get
up quite yet for questions,

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:40.250
but we're going to be opening
this up for all of you

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:41.010
in a few minutes.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.470
I want to talk a
little bit, Doug,

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:46.040
before we get to that point
about the end of the story

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.570
as far as JFK is concerned.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:51.770
It's poignant and
powerful in the book,

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:57.550
when you talk about the fact
that the last fateful trip

00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:03.650
to Texas in November of 1963
had a connection to this space

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:04.150
program.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.970
Can you just say a little bit
about what those last days

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.410
were about in this regard?

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:11.050
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: Well, I didn't
fully answer the joint space--

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:13.650
Kennedy went to the UN and
toyed with the idea of Russia

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.520
and the United States
going to the moon,

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.070
and he got a lot of
blowback about it,

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:21.130
but it was just this
constantly telling--

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.860
Kennedy wanted the world to know
we are doing this for peace,

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.970
for science, for exploration,
not to militarize the moon.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:29.470
And of course, it
was a non-starter,

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.050
in the Kennedy years,
US-Soviet going together

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.060
for a lot of reasons.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.990
At the time of his death, he
was on a space tour, basically.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.750
The day before he
was killed in Dallas,

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:44.560
John F Kennedy was in San
Antonio, Texas at the Brooks

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.950
Air Force Base, talking
to the Space Medicine

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.570
Center that just opened.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:51.940
And in promoting
all the applications

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.230
of going to the moon that we
were developing for health

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:58.870
care, including
foldable walkers,

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:04.500
to kidney dialysis machines,
to CAT scans, and MRI.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.500
The spin-off medical technology
of tests to go into space

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.430
have had giant benefits
on our health care sector

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.700
and modern medical miracles.

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.640
At San Antonio, he
invited Gordon Cooper,

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.270
one of the Mercury astronauts,
to come with him to Dallas.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:24.970
And he said, "I need
a space hero up there.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.560
They don't love me
in Dallas as much

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.320
as Houston and San Antonio.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.550
And Cooper got called
off to do a NASA meeting

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.100
and didn't get to be
with Kennedy in Dallas

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.900
in that open convertible.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.210
But from San Antonio,
he then went to Houston,

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.600
and Jackie Kennedy's at
his side for this trip.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.410
And they go speak--

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:48.970
he stays at the Rice Hotel,
and then they just clean up,

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:51.520
and then they go for
an Albert Thomas,

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.000
the head of the congressional
space committee talk.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.810
And Kennedy does a
flub in his oratory,

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:01.180
because he says with
Albert Thomas there,

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:07.270
"and here in Houston, you are
the benefits of the payroll--

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:09.620
I mean payload."

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.220
And he said, "All right, but
you're getting the payroll here

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.890
in Texas too in Houston."

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.040
And then they left
Houston and of course

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.560
went to Dallas-Fort Worth.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.020
One interesting
thing-- he was going

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:27.940
to meet the family in Texas
for the first time of the pilot

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:33.643
that died with Joe Kennedy
Jr. He was from Texas,

00:47:33.643 --> 00:47:34.810
and they were going to meet.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.060
And of course that
never happened.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:40.670
But on his way to the Trade
Mart when he was killed,

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:44.980
he was about to give a hunk
of this big important speech

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.090
about space exploration,
about how many communications

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:50.500
satellites,
meteorological satellites.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.260
He was doubling,
tripling, quadrupling down

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.370
on space at the time
that he was killed.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:58.870
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
One of the things

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:01.180
you do towards the end
of the book that I think

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:06.840
is very powerful, you
suggest, Doug, that the--

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.030
and I'm paraphrasing,
so please correct

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:13.870
if this is not what you intend,
but you suggest that the lunar

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:19.280
program, the moon program,
was not justified primarily

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.730
at least, because of the
tangible benefits that it

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:25.160
brought, although those
were obviously considerable.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.270
But you talk about how it really
spoke to something else, which

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.700
of course has for me, and
I think for all of us,

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.970
contemporary
resonance here today.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:39.930
And that is, you say it
spoke to national purpose,

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:43.140
that Kennedy, I
think you're saying,

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:47.130
he was able to bring this
sense of national purpose,

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:51.540
on some level, bring together
left and right to very

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.710
powerful ends.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:57.870
And I don't know if you have
a further thought on that

00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:01.590
and maybe if we can
still achieve something

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:03.180
like this today?

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.520
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: I hunger
for presidential leadership

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.480
like John F Kennedy.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.750
You watch the "Choose
to go to the moon"

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:18.680
clip that we played a little
bit ago, and it's like my gosh,

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.040
it's so refreshing.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.980
It's almost riveting television
to hear somebody talk to us

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.700
in such a smart
and inspiring way.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.000
We just haven't had
that of that degree.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.820
And then this
bipartisan thing, when

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.260
we'd all do things together?

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:40.540
I mean, this is not a democratic
Kennedy Democrat success,

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.290
going to the moon.

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:42.560
It's American success.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.990
At one point in my
research, I found

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:49.940
that Kennedy had the Mercury
astronauts come in to the Oval

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.280
Office, and he had his
famous rocking chair,

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.140
and he was joking about it.

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.720
"This is my space
capsule" kind of thing.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.490
And then he said to
all those astronauts,

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:01.130
"I hear you're all Republicans."

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.260
And most of them were.

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:06.230
And John Glenn was
an independent,

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.390
who gets recruited
to be a Democrat.

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:12.230
But they all, "Uh-oh,
he just said that."

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:14.180
And then Gus Grissom
said, "We don't

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.340
know what the hell we
are, Mr. President."

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.905
And they all kind of chuckled.

00:50:17.905 --> 00:50:20.030
Kennedy didn't care if they
were Republican or not.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:23.120
It meant zero difference to him.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.020
They were Americans.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.770
He fought in World
War II besides.

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:29.180
He wasn't asking people
on his PT-109 boat

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.500
whether they were
Republican or Democrat.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.425
That didn't matter.

00:50:32.425 --> 00:50:33.800
We were all pitching
in together.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.410
This is an American enterprise.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.390
I miss that in America.

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:42.530
And hopefully, we can
get that back and get out

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:47.330
of this grotesque political
theater we're in right now,

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.720
where everybody's scoring points
on the other side every second

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.808
and all of that.

00:50:52.808 --> 00:50:55.288
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.490
And the government
can be overblown.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.040
One of the great things about
NASA is they budgeted well.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.350
They appropriated
federal spending.

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:07.510
They brought in academia.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:09.640
They brought in private sector.

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:10.680
Companies benefited.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.610
They worked it so it was
a really smart project,

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.240
going to the moon, Apollo.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.190
Not only was it
successful, but as I said,

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:21.383
it had all the
spin-off benefits.

00:51:21.383 --> 00:51:23.050
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
In my own manuscript,

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:25.870
I've been working
lately on the mid-1950s,

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:31.210
and I wrote a pretty extensive
section on his 1956 book

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:36.820
Profiles in Courage, on
which he had important help.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.980
But in terms of the
conception of the book,

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.730
the main arguments, the main
themes, I suggested in my book

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.970
that they are John
F Kennedy's own.

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:49.540
And just to Doug's point, what's
powerful among other things

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.270
in that book,
Profiles in Courage,

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:55.480
is the degree to
which he is speaking

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.850
about the need for
bipartisanship.

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:00.370
And of course he brings in
the examples in that book,

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:03.370
if you know the book, of
senators in American history

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:05.480
who have shown that.

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.590
And I think for
him in that book,

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:12.040
those who show
particular courage are

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.160
those politicians
who will not simply

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.110
respond to what their
constituents need

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:18.980
in their districts
or in their states,

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.830
but who look to the
national interest.

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:23.800
And so I think that is
something he probably

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.002
didn't practice perfectly.

00:52:26.002 --> 00:52:28.150
I'm sure he made his own
mistakes in that area,

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:29.710
but I do think Doug
is correct that that's

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:30.668
something that's there.

00:52:30.668 --> 00:52:34.560
And it has the ring of
truth when, as Doug says,

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.850
he doesn't care if these
astronauts in his presence

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:41.770
are Republicans or Democrats.

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:43.830
Maybe the last question
from me, and then we're

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.258
going to open things up
here, you're going to hear,

00:52:46.258 --> 00:52:48.300
Doug, maybe you're already
hearing the following,

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.110
I suspect.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:54.200
But as you continue to
talk about this book,

00:52:54.200 --> 00:53:01.518
some may say, $25
billion, give or take,

00:53:01.518 --> 00:53:04.290
that could have been
spent on a lot of things

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:05.700
in American society.

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.990
There were needs,
housing, education,

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:12.350
anti-poverty programs.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:15.103
What do you say to that?

00:53:15.103 --> 00:53:16.770
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
It's a great question.

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:20.235
Kennedy was thinking about
doing what Lyndon Johnson called

00:53:20.235 --> 00:53:23.640
the War on Poverty, and
went with technology

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.390
and the moonshot.

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:30.960
And once Kennedy is killed,
one of the dramatic moments

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.090
at the end of my book
is when Jackie Kennedy

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:36.030
comes to see Lyndon and
Ladybird for the first time

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:40.440
after Dallas, and wants to
make sure Kennedy's dream is

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.780
alive of going to the moon
and the space program.

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.970
And Johnson for the
first thing he does

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:48.210
is name Cape Canaveral
the Kennedy Space Center.

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:51.870
And to give Lyndon Johnson
credit, during the '60s,

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:55.380
they very easily could have
gutted Gemini and Apollo.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.020
He had to defend it a
lot, Lyndon Johnson,

00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:03.600
because of his war in Vietnam,
because of Medicaid, Medicare,

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.940
Great Society expenditures.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.100
And it was getting
tough to get the budget

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.150
through on Capitol Hill.

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:13.590
Now, Apollo in the mid-'60s,
due to the Kennedy effect

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:18.360
of getting the budgets
going, had about a 4.4%

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.000
of our taxpayer
dollars per year.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.300
4.4% went to NASA for space
and to go to the moonshot.

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:29.550
Today, NASA is like a 1/3 of 1%.

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:31.770
That's how much it gets cut.

00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:34.410
And so the fact that
it's stayed prioritized--

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:38.070
and the critics of what you said
are from the right and left.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.650
Barry Goldwater did not
like the moonshot Apollo,

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:44.100
because he thought that money
should go into the Air Force.

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:46.240
He was a big Air Force
guy, Barry Goldwater.

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.090
I mean, if you go to
the Air Force Academy,

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:50.260
it's the Barry Goldwater
Visitors Center,

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:56.340
and he was a Brigadier General
in the Air Force and the like.

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.960
Goldwater wasn't keen on it.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.170
Walter Mondale was
totally opposed

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:05.760
to going to this, funding,
keeping this space stuff funded

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.900
on the more liberal
side of the equation.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.590
The point being,
it has its critics.

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:14.520
And the worst thing is
when Apollo 1 disaster

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.410
occurs in 1967.

00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:21.450
The first Apollo blows
up at Cape Canaveral pad.

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:26.670
Grissom dies, and White and
Chaffee, three just on a test.

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:30.390
Not even dying in space or
on launch, just doing a test

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.410
they die.

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.870
And so there became
movement, what are we doing?

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:35.100
We're not ready for the moon.

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.320
We can't even get a lift off.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.380
But there was so much energy
that Kennedy had put into it

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:45.150
and enough public will that
we continued with Apollo

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:49.770
and were able to do that
Apollo 11 on Nixon's watch.

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:52.920
Richard Nixon was
president with Apollo 11.

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:57.420
I found out in my research
that Bill Moyers, speechwriter

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:01.290
for LBJ, whom many of you know,
and Daniel Patrick Moynihan

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:04.410
were lobbying hard to have
the rocket called the John F

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:06.010
Kennedy.

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.770
And I read the memo.

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:10.340
It's at the Nixon Library,
where HR Haldeman,

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:16.280
Nixon's like, "This is an
NBC news stunt to Kennedyize.

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.020
Enough Kennedy.

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:20.290
No, no, absolutely not."

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:23.830
And Nixon never mentioned John
F Kennedy that entire summer,

00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:27.160
never invoked him
in any speeches.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.860
But you know who did
mention John F Kennedy?

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.150
NASA.

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:34.480
Because once we retrieved
Armstrong, Aldrin, and Michael

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.240
Collins, the three
Apollo 11 astronauts,

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.460
the first thing we did when
they were safe on Earth

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.910
is at mission control,
put up Kennedy's pledge

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:47.980
to go to the moon of May 25,
1961, and then underneath it,

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.470
something John F Kennedy
would have loved--

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.710
"task accomplished."

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:58.390
And both the mother and father
were alive, Rose and Joe,

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:00.910
for that day.

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:03.436
Joe Kennedy would
die later in 1969,

00:57:03.436 --> 00:57:05.920
but they were alive
for the moonshot.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.800
Dwight Eisenhower
had died early '69

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.250
and wasn't alive to see
that it wasn't a stunt

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:14.892
but it was an accomplishment.

00:57:14.892 --> 00:57:16.350
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
Marvelous story.

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:20.300
So we want to make it now
possible for you to pose

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.400
a question to our author.

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.840
And you'll see mics.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.760
I already see a gentleman here.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.010
There's one on the
left, one on the right.

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.260
I would ask that
you put a question

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:35.630
mark at the end of the sentence,
and that you keep it brief.

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.490
Yes, sir.

00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:40.190
AUDIENCE: First, thank you
for coming and your students.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:44.520
The first book I read was
The Magic Bus, which I hope

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.990
is still available for
purchase, perhaps here.

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:50.553
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: I have a fan,
A Magic Bus fan right there.

00:57:50.553 --> 00:57:52.720
AUDIENCE: Very good.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:58.650
Being of a certain age, I
remember the moon landing.

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:01.070
And I'm wondering whether
we've ever really recovered

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:03.830
from the assassination.

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:07.040
In my particular case,
I was in basic training

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:12.020
at Fort Polk, Louisiana when
they had the moon landing.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:15.540
I was in the day room,
watching it on television,

00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:17.310
and the door to the
day room was open,

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:20.480
and I could see the moon
reflected in the glass.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:25.450
And meanwhile outside it, one of
the north floor to south floor,

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:29.710
there were two of them, we
were sending troops to Vietnam.

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:33.010
I wonder how Kennedy would
have felt about that.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:36.590
And listening to what
we've heard today,

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:38.800
I wonder how far we
really have come,

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.180
and whether we really
have recovered.

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.673
Question mark.

00:58:42.673 --> 00:58:43.840
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: Thank you.

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.670
Well, what's very
important, and we

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:49.240
have America's foremost
expert on the Vietnam War

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:53.170
history, what is important to
remember is, Apollo 11 took

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:55.570
place during the Vietnam War.

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:57.820
And a lot of the world was
angry at the United States

00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:58.690
for the Vietnam War.

00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:01.870
I mean, France had pulled out
of the integrated Military

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.280
Command at NATO.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.520
Our country was divided
between hawks and doves.

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.210
And so it's kind of odd in '69.

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:12.760
And this summer will also be the
50th anniversary of Woodstock,

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.160
and the counterculture
and the turmoil,

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.510
that this event occurred
at that kind of moment.

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:22.840
Again, I think there was a
residual effect of Apollo

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.730
from World War II.

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:27.580
In many ways, it is the
beginning of modern technology.

00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:30.880
From NASA tech it
goes to Silicon Valley

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:32.305
to digitalization and beyond.

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.960
It was almost like
a World War II

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:42.670
program in the middle
of the Vietnam era.

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:44.560
But I don't know if
our country's ever

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.750
recovered from the Vietnam War.

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:49.900
I mean, it was the
beginning of the division

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.840
and the distrust of
the federal government.

00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:56.740
Kennedy-- pick the
presidents after FDR.

00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:59.180
We know he's big government,
but Lyndon Johnson--

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.710
I mean, Eisenhower did the
interstate highway system.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:05.920
And St. Lawrence Seaway,
Kennedy and the moonshot,

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.950
and Lyndon and government
with Medicaid, Medicare, Great

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:09.880
Society.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.750
Nixon created the
Environmental Protection Agency

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:16.100
and Endangered Species Act.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.260
And you know Jimmy
Carter created FEMA

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.860
and the Department of Energy.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.960
And then Reagan.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.730
The Reagan Revolution
started telling

01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:27.388
people the federal
government's the problem.

01:00:27.388 --> 01:00:29.680
And once you start talking
about the federal government

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.063
being a problem, it builds.

01:00:32.063 --> 01:00:33.730
And I think, incidentally,
Ronald Reagan

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.960
was a very good and
effective two term president.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.470
So I'm not questioning
that, but it

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:41.560
started a feeling
of the deep state

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.110
that you hear about today,
that the federal government's

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:47.270
the bad guy, because that's
who you have to write taxes to.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.450
And nobody wants to pay taxes.

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:53.290
And then we started getting
true stories about why were we

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:56.650
in Vietnam, waste of money,
Kissinger lied to us,

01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:59.260
McNamara lied to us.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.480
People lie, and there
became a distrust

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.170
of the federal government.

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:06.370
And so I don't know.

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:10.540
One of the challenges today
for an Earth shot or a moonshot

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.360
is to have people
believe in government.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.630
And right now, we will
see very low opinion of--

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:21.700
Congress has like a 15% or
20% approval rating at best.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.790
Congress, our representatives.

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:26.260
And in the Kennedy era,
congressmen and senators

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.637
were big deals.

01:01:27.637 --> 01:01:29.470
And they did what was
right for the country.

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:32.800
They weren't so highly partisan.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.000
So I think it's important to
put that 50 year anniversary

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.590
into the context of Vietnam.

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:40.420
So thank you for raising that.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.020
FREDERIK LOGEVALL: I think
it's a very important point.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.870
It seems to me that
what John F Kennedy did,

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:49.920
among other things, I think he
inspired Americans to believe.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.650
And this goes to
Doug's last point.

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:56.650
He inspired Americans to believe
that politics and government

01:01:56.650 --> 01:02:02.130
can respond to society's
moral yearnings,

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:07.080
can respond to the
hopes of Americans.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.850
And I think, as Doug
has pointed out,

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.260
his successors held to that too.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:11.760
I don't mean to
suggest for a moment

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.770
that this is just
John F Kennedy.

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:16.380
He did it perhaps
more than most.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.270
And that's, as I think
you suggested earlier,

01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:19.620
is something that we
need to get back to.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.880
I'll just say a quick point.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.730
If the moonshot is a kind
of high watermark for John F

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:31.130
Kennedy as a leader, Vietnam,
to go to the question,

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:34.770
is certainly a much
more problematic legacy

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:39.430
for the president, as I think
I've said on this very stage.

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:43.660
I do think on the great what
if, in my personal view,

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:47.320
if John F Kennedy survives
the Dallas shooting, I think

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.020
he avoids the kind
of large scale

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:53.920
Americanization of the war that
his successor embarked upon.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.380
But nevertheless, John
F Kennedy expanded

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.650
US involvement very
dramatically during his 1,000

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:02.620
days as president,
certainly complicated

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.320
the mission for Lyndon Johnson.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.390
And that's something that
we have to reckon with.

01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:08.670
Let's go to this side here.

01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:10.420
Please, yes.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.510
AUDIENCE: Going back
to 1961 and the speech,

01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:16.000
I'm wondering about, especially
with you just mentioned

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.010
about Draper sponsoring
some of this event,

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:24.460
how much his confidence
was influenced

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.910
by successes with
the ICBM program

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:31.420
and things like Project Corona,
the spy satellites which

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.460
were reasonably
successful space shots?

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.400
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: Yeah,
let me say something

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:41.050
positive in that,
well, look Kennedy,

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:43.600
his space advisor was from MIT.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.880
Many people in
Massachusetts were angry

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.510
that Kennedy didn't do a manned
Space Center in Massachusetts

01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:51.310
and put more of the money here.

01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:54.833
But it's tough to have done
that to your home state.

01:03:54.833 --> 01:03:57.250
It's hard enough saying we're
going to the moon, let alone

01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:00.400
you're putting the money
back to your home state,

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.470
to be fair to Kennedy on that.

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:05.170
But the Bay State
was putting into it,

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:08.290
because the harbor here would
have been exactly what they

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:11.130
could have used, like they had
Houston with the ship channel

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:12.130
and able to move things.

01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:16.720
So it was a viable
alternative coming here.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.350
But I think the big thing
about the spy satellites

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:23.470
and Corona and all,
Eisenhower wasn't wrong

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:26.950
that when Sputnik went up, Ike
kind of low-keyed it and said,

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.780
hey, we got a lot.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.130
We have U2 planes
being developed.

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:32.650
We have spy satellites.

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:36.580
We don't we don't need to
be jarred by Russia's BS.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.890
We're doing things really
well, and we actually

01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:43.150
are ahead making better
satellites soon to come.

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:46.060
So Eisenhower wasn't
wrong, and Kennedy

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:50.100
was briefed by Allen Dulles
after he got nominated,

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.970
and Lyndon too.

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:55.090
They were briefed after the
Los Angeles convention in 1960

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:57.370
by Allen Dulles and the CIA.

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:59.740
And they showed them all
the papers from these spy

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:05.260
satellites that we were actually
ahead of Russia in satellite

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.270
technology and missiles.

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:10.030
And Kennedy, the big
question is, did Kennedy

01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:11.680
process that,
because he shouldn't

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.240
do that on the campaign trail.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.140
And if you go to the
Kennedy-Nixon debates, which

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.240
I had to go back to,
they're fascinating,

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.020
but I think Kennedy, some
of his best punches at Nixon

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:27.850
was when he was saying that
you spoke to Khrushchev,

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.880
the famous kitchen
debate, when Nixon debated

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:36.730
Khrushchev about who has better
appliances, kitchen appliances.

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:39.570
And Kennedy said, you
had told Khrushchev

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:43.480
that we're beating them in
appliances, kitchen appliances.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:46.630
Well, I'll take my TV
in black and white.

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:49.960
I want to be number
one in rocket thrust.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.320
And then he insinuated
that, in one of the debates

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:57.160
said if Nixon's elected, I
see a Soviet flag planted

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.970
on the moon, not an American
one, in one of the debates.

01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:03.230
But what Kennedy knew
and found out quickly

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:05.230
when he was president,
we were doing pretty well

01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.980
on the tech front.

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:09.460
NASA created in '58,
civilian, but our technology

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.590
and satellites
were coming along,

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:14.020
and he recognized
that really Eisenhower

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:18.100
did a pretty good job of
keeping America defense-ready

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:23.470
and doing R&amp;D on ICBMs and
intermediate range missiles.

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.330
And the Jupiter
missiles you guys

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:27.400
will hear about if you're
a Cuban Missile Crisis

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.600
person, that are on Turkey,
that we put there on Turkey,

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.400
those were the junk missiles
of Wernher Von Braun.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.660
He built them for
defense purposes.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.090
They weren't that effective,
and we put them on the border

01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:42.790
there with Turkey.

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.590
And during the Cuban
Missile Crisis,

01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:46.630
where the United
States of course

01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:49.150
does the deal to eventually
get rid of those,

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:51.950
the Soviets don't build
the launching things there.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.920
So keep in mind
with the moon, it's

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.670
a lot about missile
technology, spy satellites.

01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:01.810
And out of all of this
technology, GPS of today,

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:06.340
global positioning systems is
pioneered by NASA/ I don't like

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:08.950
to say "invent things,"
because I found out in my book,

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:12.400
like everybody says that
Velcro was created by NASA.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.880
I found out it
isn't, nor is Tang.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.320
Velcro was a Swiss
gentleman in World War II

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.560
who would do alpine hikes with
his border collie sheep dog

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.280
or whatever.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.260
And it would get
burrs in its fur,

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.980
and he created Velcro to get
the burrs off the dog's fur.

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:33.610
But what is true is NASA
uses it and applies it

01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:37.630
in the space program, and
now Velcro, it's ubiquitous.

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:40.130
Much of the tech--

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:42.470
radar being created
is important, guys.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:46.400
MIT computer
technology is gigantic.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.990
The computer system
of going the moon

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:52.180
is done right here in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:56.640
A woman, Miss Hamilton,
was the pioneer in it,

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.260
in Stark Draper's laboratory
and the work that they

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.210
did there at MIT is phenomenal.

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:06.320
And the Draper family, a
great American family, and I

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.050
appreciate all that they've
done for the Kennedy Library

01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:13.250
but also for America in general
by funding and pioneering

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:17.510
and hiring the right people
to do the right amount of R&amp;D

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.760
in order to be in space.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.920
So thank you to
the Draper family.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.420
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.013
Let's go to this side, please.

01:08:26.013 --> 01:08:28.468
[COUGHING]

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.680
AUDIENCE: Something you
may not be aware of--

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.450
I guess I'm going to have to
go on with this, pardon me--

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:39.500
is that the US Department
of Transportation's National

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.479
Research Center is in Cambridge.

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:45.460
But that was originally intended
to be a NASA research center,

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:50.479
and when John Volpe,
governor of Massachusetts,

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:54.770
became Secretary, the first
Secretary of Transportation,

01:08:54.770 --> 01:09:00.770
he swung the bucks, the
transportation bucks to here.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:05.060
I was a fledgling
engineer, newly

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:08.479
arrived in Washington, DC, and
watched with rapt attention

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:10.880
when the moon landing happened.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.130
And I was thrilled, and
I've followed the space race

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:16.109
ever since, and I've read
a lot of books about it,

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:18.020
and I'm really looking
forward to this.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.380
My question is, when
John F Kennedy declared

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.939
that we were going
to go to the moon,

01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:26.600
had he consulted with
scientists and engineers,

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.069
so he had some feeling that
this was a doable thing?

01:09:31.069 --> 01:09:35.870
Or did he actually, as you
implied, spring this on NASA?

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:37.939
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
No, great questions.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:40.189
And I did not know that
about transportation.

01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:41.240
Very interesting to me.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.970
Thank you for educating
me about that.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.550
But in my book, I write a
lot and they have them here

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:49.830
at the Kennedy Library, the
memos of '61 going back,

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:53.330
where Kennedy tells Lyndon
Johnson "gimme answers."

01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:54.530
"What can we do?

01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:55.640
I want the leapfrog.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:56.930
Give me big answers."

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:58.070
And it gets spread.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:01.230
All of our experts
start weighing in on it.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.590
Later Kennedy comes
in, he decided

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.660
to go with the very
radical going to the moon,

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.660
but Lyndon Johnson
thought it was doable.

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.550
Wernher Von Braun
thought it was doable.

01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:12.120
Webb thought it was doable.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.520
They're just the big names.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.890
But under them, they
talked to the engineers,

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:18.410
and they didn't
know how, but what

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:20.450
they knew from intelligence
is it would be,

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.930
again, this fair start, that
we didn't think the Soviets--

01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:26.750
And one of the important
things, that the Soviets

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.720
were trying to go to the moon,
some people it's like a myth

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.240
that we weren't
really in a race.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.070
When the Soviet Union
dissolved in 1991,

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:38.480
and when East Germany,
German unification

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.030
occurred and we got
archives over there,

01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:42.662
we now have the Soviet archives.

01:10:42.662 --> 01:10:44.120
They were trying
to get to the moon

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.510
right up until they had
failures in '67, '68.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:49.850
They were right on it.

01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:53.960
They were about ready to put
tortoises on the moon right

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.080
before all this happened,
but they had a major disaster

01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.410
of their own in Kazakhstan.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.310
And that's where a lot
of the Soviet money--

01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:06.560
I'm talking about the Southern
states getting money for space.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.470
In Russia, Kazakhstan
got the money,

01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:11.690
because that was a
way for Khrushchev

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:16.100
to help a region that
needed some economic lift.

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:19.100
And so it's really interesting.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.350
Also your point that you
mentioned you're an engineer,

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:23.750
and it just dawned on
me, I wanted to tell you.

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:28.190
So in my oral history of Neil
Armstrong, he is Mr. Engineer--

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:30.800
Purdue, engineer, engineer.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.070
There's no better example of
an engineer than Armstrong.

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:36.830
And he spent his whole
life, including to me,

01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:40.130
but to everybody that
we don't honor engineers

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:41.750
enough in American history.

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:45.131
So I'm honoring the
engineers tonight.

01:11:45.131 --> 01:11:47.516
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:55.500
But I'm a humanities guy,
and I'm not an engineer.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:00.000
And I tried to get him off
of that engineer mind of his,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.930
and I said, "Mr. Armstrong, did
you go out and just stand up

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:08.760
there and look up at the moon
and see it glowing up there

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.630
and say, 'My goodness, I'm
going to be standing there,

01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:14.610
looking at earth'"?

01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:15.110
"No."

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:21.740
He wasn't messing with me.

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:25.140
His mind just didn't
work that way.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.960
An interesting, though,
little side thing,

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:30.380
do you guys remember the writers
Tom Wolfe, The Right Stuff

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:34.610
book, and Norman Mailer wrote
a book on going to the moon?

01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:37.760
Armstrong thought Mailer's
was pretty interesting,

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.940
only because he was talking in
Mailer's book about the dangers

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.380
of technology.

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.470
And mailer put himself as
the main figure in the book,

01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:47.330
but I did get him to
say that about any

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:48.950
of those kind of
space things, he

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:52.160
thought Mailer raising some of
the problems with technology

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.510
was quite interesting.

01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:57.560
And also, he was
very self-effacing.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:02.150
James Michener had a pseudonym
for a pilot in the Korean War.

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:05.060
He was with Armstrong's ship
out in the Korean War, James

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.410
Michener, the great
writer, and noticed it.

01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:09.320
I don't have time
tonight, but Armstrong

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.330
was an exceptional pilot.

01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:17.510
You can't read about a better
pilot than Neil Armstrong, what

01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:18.680
he could do with planes.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.790
And the reason he went to Purdue
and Gus Grissom went to Purdue.

01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:24.830
And young people here,
this is pretty cool,

01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:27.770
if you go to college,
Purdue was the first one

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.870
to give you-- if
you went there, you

01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:33.990
could take a class in
aviation history about planes

01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:37.880
and earn your pilot's
license in the classes.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.390
So a lot of these guys that
loved airplanes wanted to go

01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:43.557
to Purdue, because they
could get their pilot's--

01:13:43.557 --> 01:13:45.140
I mean, I'm talking
about 18-year-olds

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.640
that want a pilot's license.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.750
It would be part of
their degree program

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:52.450
that when they leave
college they could fly.

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:56.120
And so Purdue produced so
many of our astronauts,

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:00.355
because they have an airport
on the campus for students.

01:14:00.355 --> 01:14:01.730
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
Isn't it nice?

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:07.120
Isn't it nice, ladies and
gentlemen, to have just a,

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.810
shall I say, an
extolling of expertise?

01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:13.258
I mean, it comes
through in this book.

01:14:13.258 --> 01:14:15.300
And in this day and age,
I think at least for me,

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.080
it just resonates.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.820
It's not to say that
experts don't get it wrong.

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.430
As Doug indicated, I've spent
a lot of my career researching

01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:24.620
the Vietnam War, and
there are lots of experts

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:25.920
who got that story wrong.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.320
But nevertheless, John F
Kennedy had a commitment

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.660
to fact-based discourse
right to the end,

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:35.570
and I think it
matters a great deal.

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:37.040
Sir?

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.143
AUDIENCE: So the Third
Reich ran out of gas, huh?

01:14:39.143 --> 01:14:41.060
That's a pretty provocative
way of putting it.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:45.110
But in '67, there was an
International Outer Space

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:46.910
Treaty convened.

01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:49.980
As of this year, 108 countries
have signed on to it,

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.230
including the United States.

01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:53.780
It prevents weapons
of mass destruction

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:56.690
from being deployed in space,
but not conventional weapons.

01:14:56.690 --> 01:14:59.450
And after that, in
'79, there was actually

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:02.750
a moon treaty that was
proposed and written,

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:04.730
and only 10 countries
signed on to that.

01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:06.320
The United States
is not one of them,

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:09.260
but that would prevent any type
of weapons and military bases

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.870
on any celestial bodies,
including the moon.

01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:14.120
Now, the president
has recently proposed

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.760
and has gotten funding
for a new space

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.610
force, not an international
one but a United States one,

01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:22.250
which brings these
questions back to mind.

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:26.150
Do we need a treaty that would
prohibit the militarization

01:15:26.150 --> 01:15:29.690
of space, and including
conventional weapons

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:31.820
as well as any celestial bodies?

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:35.450
Now, you can opine based on your
historical knowledge on what

01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:38.700
JFK might have done and
also look into the future,

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:42.200
but we have to be considering
that these space programs do

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:47.720
contain and are implicitly
designed for militarization

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.490
at some point too, don't we?

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:51.130
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: Yes, we do.

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:53.660
If you don't know,
there are two things

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.150
that the Trump administration
is promoting right now

01:15:56.150 --> 01:15:59.030
and many more, obviously,
but two just quickly.

01:15:59.030 --> 01:16:02.830
Space Force, which I don't
think is a very good idea.

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:04.550
It leads to what
you're suggesting,

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:06.920
militarization of space.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.100
And it's not very practical,
because the Navy doesn't want

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:13.220
a new branch, Army
doesn't, Air Force doesn't.

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:16.880
So I don't think Space Force
is going to get much momentum.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:19.250
Then there's this thought
in the next four or five

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:24.790
years of going to the moon again
and doing the south pole of it,

01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:28.940
and in a way bring in
the private sector,

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:31.760
some of these space groups
that might get contracted out.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.740
That to me is more
promising, as long

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:36.590
as it's done in
the name of peace.

01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:40.520
What we don't want to be
doing is militarizing space.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.780
And while I'm opposed
to the Space Force

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.520
just personally,
not as a historian,

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.400
as a human looking
at this, I'm more

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.540
inclined to see how we could go
back to the moon in a way that

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:54.890
would have a positive effect.

01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:58.710
Maybe even a joint visit to
the moon with other countries.

01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:01.220
But I think that might
be a more fertile ground

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:04.440
for us to explore, and
we do need a treaty.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.392
FREDERIK LOGEVALL: Yes.

01:17:06.392 --> 01:17:07.350
AUDIENCE: Good evening.

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:09.150
I'm a researcher from
Boston University,

01:17:09.150 --> 01:17:11.370
and I'm writing a
paper, and I wanted

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:14.970
to answer the question if,
aside from the competition

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:16.680
and trying to beat
the Soviets, if there

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.360
was a moral compass guiding
America's actions in the Apollo

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.700
space program?

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.075
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
Great question.

01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:30.230
Yeah, only to the degree,
first off, that Kennedy--

01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:31.710
I'll just pick him--

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:36.180
he truly did not want
to militarize space,

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:39.173
even though it is
about militarization.

01:17:39.173 --> 01:17:40.590
In many ways, going
to the moon is

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:43.000
a fig leaf for
rocket development

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.970
and weapons of destruction,
but most of the astronauts, not

01:17:47.970 --> 01:17:51.675
Neil Armstrong who stayed very
engineer-focused, but many,

01:17:51.675 --> 01:17:54.450
I'd maybe not say
most, but maybe most,

01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:56.760
came back not thinking
about the moon.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.260
They thought that
was their mission,

01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:02.610
but seeing Earth, that
blue-green marble floating out

01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:05.820
there, how there are no borders.

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:10.560
Bill Anders, the astronaut's
famous Earth Rise photograph

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.590
that helped trigger the
environmental movement.

01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:15.600
And when we talk
about NASA today,

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.430
the leading people
on climate change

01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:20.630
have come out of NASA, like
James Hansen and others.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:25.050
NASA is doing weather
forecasting, and I mean,

01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:28.220
it's not just we're
shooting rockets up.

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:31.980
NASA's a very interesting
government agency

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:35.500
that needs funding.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.950
And yes, I think
whether it's Whole Earth

01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:41.520
Catalog or the birth of the
Environmental Protection Agency

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.580
and all, it came
out of a moral idea

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.180
that we need to
protect our planet

01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:52.770
and how vulnerable we are and
how lonely it is out there.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:55.680
Meaning, we went to the
moon, and it's lifeless.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.810
Incidentally, we still
don't know really

01:18:57.810 --> 01:18:59.250
how the moon was created.

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:01.550
Some people think
two planets clashed,

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:06.930
and a planet hit into Earth,
and it created this moon.

01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:09.540
But what we did find out from
all that moon rock and moon

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.850
soil of the various
Apollo missions

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:19.010
was the composition of
minerals and the like,

01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:21.763
the deposits we got, were
very much like Earth.

01:19:21.763 --> 01:19:24.180
We thought it would be a little
more different than Earth,

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.847
but there was nothing
that we discovered

01:19:25.847 --> 01:19:27.930
that wasn't
Earth-like, meaning it

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:30.900
is like a direct
connector to our planet.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.660
And remember guys, since
the beginning of time,

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.150
the moon sets the ocean tides.

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:38.370
It's why we have our calendars.

01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:39.930
It's everything.

01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:43.720
And the thought of all these
brilliant Aristotles, Platos,

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.970
Shakespeares staring at the
moon and writing about it,

01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:50.430
and now we were actually
there, is a pretty big thing

01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:52.400
in world history
that we're going

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.650
to be celebrating this summer.

01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:55.108
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
I'm still trying

01:19:55.108 --> 01:19:58.090
to get my mind around you asking
Neil Armstrong that question

01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:00.780
and him saying "no."

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.790
How can you look at that?

01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:06.480
So yes, and let me say it since
we're running close to the end,

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.882
just remember to be concise.

01:20:07.882 --> 01:20:09.090
We'll move over to this side.

01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:09.450
Thank you.

01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:12.075
AUDIENCE: OK, this is a question
I'm glad I have the two of you

01:20:12.075 --> 01:20:17.310
both for this one, because it's
about Kennedy's speech in 1961.

01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:20.460
And that one is when
he says "go to the moon

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.650
and do the other things."

01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:26.970
And I've always wondered what
the other things could be.

01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:29.820
And you guys are the best
people to ask that of right

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.720
now, probably.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.970
So do you find out
anything about what

01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:34.110
the other things could be?

01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:35.777
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
Well one of the things

01:20:35.777 --> 01:20:39.150
that I write about in the book
is, this isn't just the moon,

01:20:39.150 --> 01:20:41.070
although you heard that
argument with Webb.

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:42.840
Kennedy is saying
lunar is number one,

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:47.460
but we were doing probes
of Venus, for example.

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.380
We were doing Mars probes.

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:51.360
I mean, the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.250
out in Caltech in Pasadena has
been pioneering in the Mars

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.970
rovers and the like.

01:20:57.970 --> 01:21:02.250
And so the idea was to study
all of the solar system

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:04.920
with our new
technology, not just

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.660
the moon but all of the others.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:09.080
That's how I would
interpret that.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:12.330
And I write about Mariner
and all of these other--

01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:15.340
you said something
that's very important.

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:17.730
John F Kennedy really
believed in science,

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:20.400
believed in scientists,
believed in space exploration,

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.140
because it enhanced science.

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:26.270
Public discovery is
what Kennedy was about.

01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:29.490
And he was interested
in the ocean also.

01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:33.270
He wanted to deal with
desalinization of ocean water

01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:36.360
to create fresh water for an
arid world and all of this.

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.850
It never caught on
like the moonshot,

01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:42.960
but he had other pet
projects like this.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.830
To have created a freshwater
system out of ocean water,

01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:49.140
like Kennedy was
constantly talking about

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:51.360
would have been a
great initiative.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.310
We're doing it a little
bit in California now,

01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:56.850
but it's so expensive
without federal largesse

01:21:56.850 --> 01:22:00.510
to help that technology along.

01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:02.580
AUDIENCE: Whenever you
talk about or think

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.430
about President
Kennedy's legacy,

01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:08.490
one of the names that always
at least pops up into my mind

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:10.740
is someone you wrote
a definitive biography

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.840
about, Walter Cronkite.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.590
And I was wondering if you
could comment upon the coverage

01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:21.930
that Cronkite gave that evening,
when Armstrong stepped foot

01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:22.560
on the moon.

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.220
Thank you.

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:23.520
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: Great.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.140
I have a photo of Cronkite.

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:29.820
And Cronkite was considered the
eighth astronaut of the Mercury

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:30.780
7.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:36.060
He was a bonanza of PR for NASA,
because Cronkite in World War

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.290
II was the dean of Air Force.

01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:42.780
He was embedded with the
UP, UPI it used to be.

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:44.850
Some people called it
the old United Press

01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:48.240
Services, wire services.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.780
Learned all of the Air
Force pilots, et cetera.

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.300
So aviation, when he
came back after World War

01:22:54.300 --> 01:23:01.435
II in the Korean War period, he
took on a beat nobody wanted--

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:01.935
space.

01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:08.100
And he was grew up in Houston,
Texas, Walter Cronkite.

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.430
And so he got to know
a lot of the early NASA

01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:14.430
people by the late '50s, but
also pilots from World War II,

01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:16.020
and Air Force
people, and all this,

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:17.940
and he had a great Rolodex.

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:22.710
And he is a fanatic
about space, Cronkite.

01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:25.080
And like John F Kennedy,
he loved sailing.

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.180
You'd be amazed at how
many people like sailing

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:30.480
in the ocean that have
become space buffs.

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.590
It's remarkable how many.

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:35.330
But without Cronkite,
that night of Cronkite,

01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:37.290
it was just classic coverage.

01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:40.260
I wrote in my book, out of
all the things Cronkite did,

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:43.980
his hours and hours of
coverage of Apollo 11

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:46.680
was the maestro
moment of his career,

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.020
because he had so well
educated himself and had

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.185
so many contacts, and they
re-created things at CBS.

01:23:52.185 --> 01:23:55.050
It was really a
marvel of television.

01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:56.460
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
Let's do this.

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.250
This may be a mistake, and I
may get in trouble for this.

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.920
Let's do a lightning round.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.930
And so what I'm going
to have the four of you

01:24:03.930 --> 01:24:05.805
do, because then maybe
we can get you all in,

01:24:05.805 --> 01:24:10.320
is to pose a 20
second question each.

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.775
Either Doug can
remember them all,

01:24:11.775 --> 01:24:13.650
because we're going to
take them all at once,

01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:15.700
or I can jot down what they ask.

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.170
But let's start
over here, please.

01:24:17.170 --> 01:24:17.733
Brief.

01:24:17.733 --> 01:24:20.400
AUDIENCE: First of all, I wanted
say that I've been watching you

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.680
on CNN for years,
and I can't believe

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.735
I'm in the same room with you.

01:24:24.735 --> 01:24:27.160
So it's wonderful.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.660
My quick question is, I wasn't
born before the moon landing.

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:35.220
So I mean, but I certainly
know the global and historical

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.480
importance of that.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.720
But recently China
has landed a craft

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:42.240
on the dark side of
the moon, and SpaceX

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:44.340
is talking about going to Mars.

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.430
So I wanted to
basically hear your view

01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:50.773
on the future of space
exploration in our country.

01:24:50.773 --> 01:24:51.690
FREDERIK LOGEVALL: OK.

01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:52.200
Hold that one.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:52.700
Yes, sir.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.492
AUDIENCE: On the question
of an earth shot,

01:24:54.492 --> 01:24:59.650
there are a number of nominees--
climate change, infrastructure,

01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:00.900
health care.

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.450
Is there any that
among those three

01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:07.940
or any other possible
earth shots which

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.910
one would have the best
chance of developing

01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:13.495
a sense of national purpose
that would be bipartisan?

01:25:13.495 --> 01:25:14.870
FREDERIK LOGEVALL:
OK, excellent.

01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:15.843
Yes?

01:25:15.843 --> 01:25:17.510
AUDIENCE: I worked
on the Apollo program

01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:19.820
at MIT under Dr. Draper.

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:20.632
And I was there.

01:25:20.632 --> 01:25:21.840
FREDERIK LOGEVALL: Wonderful.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.780
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.350
AUDIENCE: And I
was there when we

01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:27.995
lost Grissom, White, and
Chaffee in the capsule one fire.

01:25:27.995 --> 01:25:29.870
And I wondered if you
could say a little more

01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:32.300
about the impact of that
on both the schedule

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:35.010
and the motivation.

01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:36.360
FREDERIK LOGEVALL: Finally, yes.

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.670
AUDIENCE: My question is
an earth shot question,

01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:39.690
so to speak.

01:25:39.690 --> 01:25:44.760
Is there any-- do you see any
opportunity for NOAA to become

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.100
as big a--

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:51.882
National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Association--

01:25:51.882 --> 01:25:57.920
to be sort of the leader in
a new American inspiration

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:03.200
and a new political practicality
of distributing resources

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.547
to areas that need
to be developed?

01:26:05.547 --> 01:26:07.130
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
OK, great questions.

01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:09.530
I like the idea of never
letting somebody stand

01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:12.970
at the mic at the end, so we got
everybody in the conversation.

01:26:12.970 --> 01:26:17.900
With the China question, China
is doing a great job right now

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:19.100
in space exploration.

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:23.060
They're putting a lot
of their energy into it.

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:26.100
And they are exploring
the dark side of the moon.

01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:28.090
And if we do a
national thing, it

01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:31.070
may be a space race
with China, let's hope

01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:34.370
it can be done in a way that's
not militarized but in a way

01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:37.370
that it's a friendly
competition.

01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:42.220
Mars is still out there
on everybody's mind.

01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:44.660
NOAA, amazing operation.

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:48.920
In fact, former head of NOAA
was the first woman, Kathryn

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.310
Sullivan, she was
recently head of NOAA,

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:55.000
and she was the first
woman spacewalker.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.970
There's a great
connection to NOAA.

01:26:56.970 --> 01:27:00.200
I would think the
oceans is a moonshot,

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.120
cleaning of the
world's oceans is one

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.620
that I would think everybody
would want to get behind.

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:06.890
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:10.910
And NOAA could take a great lead
in the United States on that.

01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:13.010
That's an amazing--
it's funny, you

01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:18.710
say NOAA and NASA are both
remarkable government agencies.

01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:22.640
And Gus Grissom
and Chaffee, White,

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.140
that was a shocking
event when they all died

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.010
and whether Apollo
could be canceled.

01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:31.850
It led, in fact, to Webb
by '68 got muscled out

01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:33.890
by Lyndon to head NASA.

01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:35.570
Some people blamed him.

01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:37.790
It was inevitable that
it was going to happen.

01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:40.400
They always thought the
deaths would occur in space,

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.290
but here it was on the ground.

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:44.780
But it didn't defund
or derail Apollo,

01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:50.030
but really, for people like Neil
Armstrong, it's not hyperbole.

01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:55.670
He figured he had a 50-50
chance of surviving Apollo 11.

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.440
That's how brave these
Apollo astronauts were.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:03.680
Imagine your family right after,
oh, Apollo 1, all of them die.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:08.870
And now you're having
your loved one go up,

01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:11.120
the wives of those astronauts.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.440
Did I miss one of them?

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.010
One last one?

01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:15.980
FREDERIK LOGEVALL: No, I think
you got them all, including

01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:16.940
the earth shot.

01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:19.270
You get a sense,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:23.240
of why Doug Brinkley
is celebrated,

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.820
why you need to read this book.

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.240
I want to thank all of you
for coming this evening,

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.060
and please join me in thanking
Doug Brinkley for this.

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:33.560
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.260
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: Yes.

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.360
That was great.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.210
Wonderful.
