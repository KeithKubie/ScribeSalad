00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.440
Absolutely gorgeous look at that. Hey guys welcome back today. We have a fun little experiment with kitchen chemistry

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.359
we're taking bottles of stump remover and converting them into

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.250
Crystals of potassium nitrate and if you look up the mSDS these things claim to be 100%

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.559
Potassium nitrate so this stuff should work really well

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.969
Now you might be wondering what the purpose of doing an experiment like this is and it's because a crystal is one of the most

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.480
Pure forms of a substance that you can get and the whole idea is to leach

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.290
Nitrates from the soil and produce very pure potassium nitrate crystals through very natural and very organic process you'll see that in a future video

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.469
Now to get started let's talk about solubility of things in water

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.360
We know a lot of things dissolve in water

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.459
but the question is how much of it will dissolve and what are some of the factors that affect that well first of all the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
Temperature of the water itself can make an extreme difference in the case of potassium nitrate

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.419
It's actually not super soluble in cold water, but once the water approaches boiling. It can suck up a whole bunch of this stuff

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.610
I'll show you what I'm talking about in just a minute

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.570
We just filled up this little bowl with three cups of ice water. It's very cold

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.709
You can actually see some condensation forming on the edges here. So now that it's cold enough

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.419
Let's go ahead and use some measuring cups to measure potassium nitrate into the bowl stir it up and see how much of it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420
We can get to dissolve

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.069
Let's start off with the tablespoon. See if it will take it

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.180
one Tablespoon

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.080
Look at that one tablespoon in quite a difficult time

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.050
So potassium nitrate doesn't really dissolve that well in cold water, but let's see what happens when we turn up the heat

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.869
All right, so I've just got everything transferred into the pot here

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.749
I've added 1/2 a cup of potassium nitrate, and I'm slowly bringing the water up to a boil when the water hits a boil

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.669
I'm going to keep it at that temperature and slowly keep adding potassium nitrate until it stops dissolving and the whole time

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.670
I'll be taking notes on the measurements we use

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.949
All right, I'm gonna go with another 1/2 cup

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.849
All right, that's for one full cup of potassium nitrate

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.429
Look at the Splatters underneath when this solidifies to a metal surface

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.450
It immediately crystallizes back into that white powder all right we've reached boiling hot and spill it over the edges a little bit as well

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.019
whoops

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.729
Here's something else that's interesting watch the spoon as I take it out of the solution it hits the air

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.030
You can see it crystallizes over as the air hits it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.380
That's a good sign that means our solution is becoming supersaturated

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.199
Those are crystals of potassium nitrate you might be wondering if potassium nitrate is poisonous

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.660
And the answer is no at least not in small concentrations

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.539
It just gives it a really interesting taste. It's not very desirable, but it's not Gonna kill you what an interesting phenomenon

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.199
It's actually freezing and melting at the surface where it meets the air currents

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.510
It's mesmerizing

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.420
So here's the update guys we've had our pot simmering on high heat boiling in fact for the last 15 minutes

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.549
And we have added a total of 3 and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.780
3/4 cups of potassium nitrate now granted some of that has spilled out around the edges

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.869
So I'm gonna call it three and a half cups of potassium nitrate in the water

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.530
That's in there now while that doesn't factor off for any other water that's boiled off in the meantime

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.280
I think we're good going along with that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.589
so the next step to making our potassium nitrate crystals is to take a clean glass Bowl like this and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.899
Transfer that solution into it now this bowl is very cold now to expect those crystals to form very quickly

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.388
Maybe a little bit too quickly now when making a crystal we want the solution to cool down as slowly as possible

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.190
So before I make the transfer

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.079
I'm gonna stick some water in this bowl put it in the microwave so that it's brought up the temperature before we transfer the solution

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.610
All right our steaming bowl of water is ready so we can go ahead and dump that out set on the table then take our

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.239
Pot from the stove and pour our clear solution in then let it sit for about an hour

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.690
its steam hot

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.739
Whoo that feels that pretty tight, and we're just gonna let that cool for about an hour

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.739
Look at the way that top looks really interesting

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.690
Look at the mess. I made over here on the stove. That's all the stuff that sprayed out while we're cooking

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.539
This could all be recovered and used again

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.370
Good thing a little warm water will clean that up in a jiffy isn't it because that looks like a royal mess

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.389
Alright guys

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.380
I want to give you a quick update on some things that I've been observing

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.529
As we've been doing these reactions number one for the first batch that we mix in we actually put in so much

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.070
Potassium nitrate it was absolutely insane when we transferred it to the dish

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.720
Immediately we started seeing potassium nitrate settling out of solution on the bottom

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.760
I'm not sure whether or not they're making crystals yet

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.229
But I've put that in the fridge to help it cool down a little bit quicker now while that was cooling just for fun

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.569
I put together another batch where we did another 3 cups of water

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.739
But this time only two cups of potassium nitrate and that is this batch. We're looking at right here

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.950
I preheated the dish the same way so it could cool down slower

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.880
But the thing that was really interesting to me was something that I noticed in the pot the pot

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.700
Cooled down quicker than the dish did and now if we look down inside

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.038
You can see long sharp strands of potassium nitrate crystals, and that is what we're going for

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.589
This dish over here has a little bit more thermal, Mass

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.549
You can see crystals starting to form on the top and eventually they will form on the inside as well

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.669
So we're putting that to the test and seeing what kind of results it produces?

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.789
Quick update guys I ran two different batches the first one

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.980
We did with three and a half cups of nitrate and three cups of water

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.900
And we ended up with something that looks like this. It almost look like a bowl full of cream of wheat or something

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.319
I'm not sure if that's crust over on the top and if we break that away what we'll find on the inside

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.240
But I also made another batch right here

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.060
The same three cups of water, but this time two cups of potassium nitrate so almost half as much nitrate well

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.069
You'll notice that the solution came through a lot more clear and as a cool-down it made these long strands

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.050
Of potassium nitrate crystals which look very very cool, so let's take our first bowl here

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.760
Let's break off that Top crust look down

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.430
See we got inside and transfer off the liquids so we can see what kinds of crystals we get down the bottom what blows me away

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.829
And this has been sitting in the fridge for half an hour, and it's still warm

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.640
relatively speaking

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.759
All right, let's see how thick this layer is

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.419
Almost like a creme brulee. I'm just that top layer really and you want to be delicate because you don't know what's inside yet

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.689
It's actually covered with so much water. Let's go ahead and dump this off and see what we got

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.120
There we go waters off. Oh, wow oh

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.810
Oh That's now better than expected on the inside there look at all those layers of crystals with Shards

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.419
It's almost like Shards of broken glass, but a lot finer

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:54.189
The walls here. It's like half an inch to an inch thick of nitrate but then you get all these crystals in the middle

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.030
It's kind of like a Geode

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.620
actually

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.489
That's spectacular. Is there any more water to come off?

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.570
that is pretty

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.080
You can be relatively sure that that is pure potassium nitrate right there

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.040
It blows me away is how thick these walls are Im going to dig into those later

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.160
But those crystals are beautiful aren't they let's just take a second to appreciate that

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.719
These are so sharp and pointy it looks kind of like the fortress that superman build in the old superman movies

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.009
fantastic

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:27.009
Lil bit Pointy

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:31.179
Look at that little potassium nitrate Crystal

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:37.569
So I'm curious to see our second bowl here this one was a very clear solution and as it cooled down you can see already

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:41.139
There are nice beautiful shards at the bottom. Let's pour this liquid off next

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.830
Oh already on the bottom you can see a really cool, crystalline structure

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.660
look at that Latticing and the reveal

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.840
OH ho ho ho hooo

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.360
That is beautiful

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.060
absolutely

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.120
gorgeous

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.420
Look at that. I think we nailed it

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.460
I think we figured it out two cups of potassium nitrate - three cups of water look at that one

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:18.840
That's just sticking straight out like a long spike

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.879
You know what else is cool is the stuff we had leftover in our pot made crystals at the bottom as well

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:32.939
So even our leftovers you can just leave them in the pot and some of these crystals look how long and beautiful those are

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.809
theoretically we clean this up with ice-cold water and

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.670
Clean up any impurities

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:43.139
but crystals by nature are about as pure form of substances as you can get

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:48.450
So guys the results are in and based on this set of experiments if you want beautiful long strong crystals

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.009
I would suggest three cups of water to two cups of Potassium nitrate or any

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.480
Variation of that recipe the walls on this dish are absolutely coated with nitrate

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.530
So I'm just gonna take a fork and dig into it and see it looks like it's coming from the side here

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.929
This is kind of got a weird texture

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.290
It's kind of squishy but kind of hard to get through at the same time almost like wet salt

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:23.259
Okay, so nothing really happening there. I mean, it's crystals on the inside, but it really is just this

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.870
Potassium nitrate mush on the outside very nice stuff. We could dry that out

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.810
It's very usable, but it's not nearly the crystalline effect

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:37.600
We're going for it, but this here is my pride and joy look at the difference there that is absolutely perfect

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.970
So Im Gonna Reach down in there.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.760
See if i can pull some of those out

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.280
Look at that

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.140
Those are cool looking crystals man

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.730
And these are just our leftovers, and they're some of our nicest crystals and look at that

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.060
So we have done it guys we have made crystals of potassium nitrate and here's how we made it happen

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.839
we started off by filling up a dish with water and adding one tablespoon of potassium nitrate to

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.110
Ice-cold water and found that it didn't really dissolve very well in fact

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.629
We couldn't dissolve more than about one and a half tablespoons

00:10:17.629 --> 00:10:22.248
So he transferred the solution to a pot put it on the stove and let the whole thing come to a boil where we found

00:10:22.249 --> 00:10:28.219
The hot water accepts potassium nitrate a lot more readily than cold water because we were able to add over three and a half cups

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.350
Of our potassium nitrate stump remover

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.099
We poured that solution into a preheated bowl to help it cool down a little more slowly

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.790
But it was so saturate with potassium nitrate that the crystals started coming out of solution

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.300
Almost immediately so we whipped up the second batch the same way

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.209
But rather than using three and a half cups we use two cups of potassium nitrate

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:50.839
And got a really cool reaction that looks like this long thin strands of sharp potassium nitrate crystals that look absolutely gorgeous

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:54.859
But in the mean time guys Thanks for joining me for this experiment today This is fairly safe

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.240
It's something that you can try at home. Go grow yourself some potassium nitrate crystals and let me know in the comments

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.469
How it worked out for you Thanks for joining You for this video I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:07.399
like making snowballs

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:13.189
Nitrate Crystal snowballs. hi everyone. My name is nate, and there's a good chance. I'll be joining the king of random team

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.059
That's right guys

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:16.939
I'm bringing nate on to help with some of the projects and the videos here on the king of random

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:21.289
So he's probably gonna become a familiar face. I just wanted to pop in and introduce myself. See you around
