Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience I heard cause a lot of vitamins in it and some iron. I can't produce anymore man. None. They cut off my balls do to do. I turned him in. Yeah. What did, what caused you to turn them in? What was the final straw? Was this movement downtown La embarrassed at your own gender? Yeah. I went to the me too thing and I cut off my balls and I left him there so I just, I donated them if you like, if people started calling for that, if girls started calling for that, guys would do it. Remove your nuts. There's guys out there that there's a certain, there's a certain kind of guy that would do so many people there. If you called for guys to step out into the middle of the town square and cut their own balls off, at least a couple of guys would show up.

Speaker 1:          00:41          I can name two, two centers we live in. There's a couple of dudes I know that would fucking do it exactly. Just for like Twitter cred. Yeah, just for some street. I just, just for the retweets, some love from feminists. What this is how you are an ally. Boys learn like my fed. Like we were favorite like your favorite shirts. Yeah. Females kickass or what is it? A women kick ass or whatever else. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That whole, the idea of like, uh, of, of virtue signaling overt, overt support for something. It's so seethrough when you're like, I'm here for you girls. It's so seethrough God, it's such a crock of shit. But you can feel that way without yelling at all the time we pull you also like broadcasting like that. Like what? What are you doing? What are you doing? What's the purpose?

Speaker 1:          01:27          Yeah, that's what I like. Why, why are you reaching out? You're supporting, what do you supporting? What is happening here? It's another instance of the echo chamber doing the whole supporting the thing that I don't think people are really, I talk about it on stage about the trend, a trend, the word trans phobic over like I understand the meaning, but I also think it's hyperbolized and in essence of like there are these large groups of people that are against Trans people. I don't believe that whatsoever. But there were definitely are. I think there's small groups of people that get a lot of attention. I don't think there's massive look. The KKK is significantly larger of a group. Then whatever group you want to formulate a trans folk of transphobic nature. I know a lot of people don't even know what that is. Right. I haven't done any statistical research.

Speaker 1:          02:12          The company KKK members are in the United States. There are tens of thousands. Okay. How many people, what do people do? I think a trans people religious that don't believe in trends people or that don't think that they should be able to call themselves a woman. I think Mo, I think most of those people don't care enough to call themselves part of that category. They just disagree. They go, I don't really like it. I don't get it. I think, I think there's more of those than there are people that are like adamantly against trans rights. I think we have to take any consideration what we already said about God's willing to cut their balls off that there are guys like that. Sure. There are some, there are so many people in this country. I guarantee you there's a lot of trans phobic people, a lot. You listen man, if you read the comments, and I don't, and I didn't, but someone told me that the comments and the Eddie Izzard, uh, Instagram posts that I made were horrific.

Speaker 1:          03:01          But don't you think that is an internet fodder? See, that's my thing is I think people like to say shit on the Internet even if they don't believe it, because they know that gets attention. If they go, fuck, this fucking dude looks like a chick that I don't know what they said. Maybe they were just making fun of the way you look so you can, you can assume what fucking people right on the Internet about that issue. They would just go, what's up with this? Fuck. Oh, here. I'll give you an example. I tweeted the other day about the met gala, um, Harry styles. Uh, I tweeted a, uh, he was wearing like a, a lot of men were wearing like dresses at the met gala. This was a whole thing. And I tweeted, um, Tilda Swinton looked fire at the met gala because he looked like Tilda Swinton.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Not because I'm saying like, who's till the swimming? She's a fucking actress who has short hair, right? So, right. That was him. And I said, Tilda Swinton looked fire at the met gala. Who is this gentleman pleaser? He's a pop star. He's like part of, what's it called? One direction. He's part of one direction. What, what is happening with that shirt? That's what he wore to the back. Alice, what'd you say, Jamie? It's a blouse. Shirts versus blossoms. Okay. Here's the thing. If you go into one of those things and you're going to stand in front of all these jackasses with cameras to take pictures of, why not wear a fucking blouse? That's what, that's his point. But I said Tilda Swinton looked fire because when I saw the first image, his face kind of looked like Tilda Swinton. Okay? Of course, I'm making the joke about the joke.

Speaker 1:          04:15          You're a comedian. Well, dude, everyone was like, very funny last night. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone went after me. Everyone was like, oh, of course you fucking, I mean, Hattie, are you a Nazi? Well, they say, here's my problem. They go, um, he, I think he's gay, right? Did He, is he gay, Jamie? No, I think somebody told me they were like alone. They were like, you're, you're, you're may you found in your sexuality. I was like, I can't make fun of people anymore for people. I said, t he looked like Tilda fucking swim. Why are you reading comments? Because I'm not as famous as you stop and think about the amount of people that had their balls by, no, that would just walk into that town square and cut their balls off to the ELA. Now stop and think about those people commenting. Yeah, I know. And you're reading it and allowing it to fuck with your head. Sometimes I feed into it. A lot of times I don't. When do you not? When I'm confident in whatever I posted. Hmm. That's interesting. Right? When I like that joke, I knew it was going to be misinterpreted. Like I knew when I wrote that I go, someone will misinterpret this. Who Care? That's why I still posted it, but I read some shit sometimes if I go, I wonder if that was dumb or if that was cool.
