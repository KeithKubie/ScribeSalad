1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,003
Yeah.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,790
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,490
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,270
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,710
September 10th, 2018. How's it going?

6
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:17,150
How I yeah. Oh, why? Yeah. Um,

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,840
I am back from a whirlwind tour.
I fucking crazy weekend.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,730
I'm actually sitting here a
podcasting in front of the TV,

9
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:27,920
which I know a lot of you don't like.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,560
Simply the fucking Steelers
and browns had a tie.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,250
Wow.
Jesus Christ one that,

12
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:40,840
this exact reason why you don't like it.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,810
This is the exact fucking
reason cause I get distracted.

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,130
I haven't seen a fucking tie since like
they've had over time. I don't really,

15
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,760
I don't recall one,
um,

16
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:56,761
zero zero and one of the Pittsburgh
Steelers and the Cleveland browns.

17
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:02,260
How about that? Um, anyways,
yeah, I'm sitting here.

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,120
I've got the Red Sox game
on in the background.

19
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:08,080
The Houston Astros are trying to become
the second team this season to sweep the

20
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:13,081
red sox while Boston is trying to go
two for two today against the city of

21
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,520
Houston.
All right.

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,720
Now we already done kicked the
shit at you fucking football team.

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,440
Now we're trying with the baseball
team. I'll be honest with you. Uh,

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,000
I thought the Patriots, so it's good for
the first two and a half quarters. Um,

25
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,120
special teams is letting up
more yards than I would like.

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,600
Then you would like bill you
as a what a football coach.

27
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,430
You as a comedian and a shit joke telling
fucking jackass who decided to fucking

28
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:45,060
record a game and fast forward
through the commercials yet. Bill,

29
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,110
what did you see on your
game film? Um, fair enough.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,980
Fair enough. You know, there's
always room for criticism.

31
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,320
Who am I to sit here and
act like I'm above it? Um,

32
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,240
yeah, I thought I was very
impressed with our pass rush.

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,160
I was very impressed with our ability
to, uh, contain, uh, what's his name?

34
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,100
Watson there.
I thought he was going to be a nightmare.

35
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,760
I also thought he might've been a little
gun shy about running because he is

36
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,840
coming back from a knee injury. So I
thought when he ran, when he had to,

37
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:23,610
but I was impressed with him staying
in the pocket. Um, I liked, uh,

38
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,640
the new, uh, left guard. We
got there. I left tackle,

39
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:30,720
I should say taking over for Nate soldier,
soldier, I'll be you say his name.

40
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,490
He was only there for fucking 20 years.
Now he's playing with the giants. Um,

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,930
Brown, whoever that guy was just
keeping all those beasts up front.

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,450
Four of the Texas where they get clowny,

43
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:46,920
they got JJ watts and then they got some
other guy like maniac or something like

44
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:48,480
that.
Like his name is literally like,

45
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,070
it's like psycho or maniac or something
like that. I'm not a nickname.

46
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,950
The name he was born with as a baby.
Oh look at that little cute baby.

47
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:02,830
What's its name? Clarence Maniac.
You want to have a play date? Uh,

48
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:05,500
no I don't.
Why am I fucking head phones?

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,850
Fucking God damn these fucking
cheap ass fucking things.

50
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,950
I swear to God,
I just can't win.

51
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,650
Yeah.

52
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,850
CanNot fucking win. What is going
on now? This is all brand new shit.

53
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,930
I got all brand new shit. Hear people.
Speaking of which, if you want to fucking,

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,750
if you want to, a couple of things I'm
selling. I just bought a new mixer.

55
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,620
Uh,
my old one works fine,

56
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:33,440
but I'm getting back to doing
these uninformed with Joe de Rosa,

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,000
which is going to be up on my patrion
page coming up here in November.

58
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,380
We're going to take some episodes,

59
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:42,080
get a little in the can and that
type of shit and some other stuff.

60
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,390
So I didn't get a mixture where I could
actually have enough microphones for

61
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,400
more than two people.

62
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,030
So I have a mixer with the
chords and all of that shit. Uh,

63
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,910
if you want to start your own podcast,

64
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,140
if you want to open up your little
podcast shop across the street and compete

65
00:03:57,141 --> 00:04:00,650
with me, uh, let me
know. I'll figure it out.

66
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:03,410
Cause I already started Dean
del Ray cell and some shit.

67
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,170
I got a drum kit that I'm selling.
All right,

68
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,480
I'll get all the information. I'll have
it posted on my fucking Twitter site. Um,

69
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm selling this, uh, one of those
sonar, like travel kits. You know,

70
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,740
it's Kinda like the uh, Questlove
one. The, the, what is it? Uh,

71
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,160
whatever that one that he does with
the little fucking 18 inch bass drum.

72
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,990
It's the same thing, but just
sona. Um, and fucking beautiful.

73
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:32,900
I just don't have the room for it anymore.
I got a,

74
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,190
I made a little drum room in my,
uh,

75
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,290
garage so I don't have to have
a studio space for my drum son.

76
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,200
I brought the big boy kid home
and I got that little one,

77
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:47,140
which fucking sounds great by the
way. And I also have the, uh, the,

78
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,310
the fucking pads there where it's silent.
You know what I mean? Where it doesn't,

79
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:57,290
it doesn't, uh, you know, the Mesh ones
or the real ones. I got a tuned up.

80
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,260
Nice. My buddy tuned it
up, I should say, um,

81
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:04,550
after I kind of fucked it up a
little bit, but um, whatever,

82
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,570
that's what it's come down to
people. This is the new me. Okay.

83
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,950
I'm getting rid of Shit and right now
you know what my, my whole fucking day,

84
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:15,650
my headphones out work at right now.
I have no fucking idea if you can,

85
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,780
all I'm doing is just looking
at the fucking mixture.

86
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:20,870
I know that you can hear me. I haven't
been able to, I fucking came home.

87
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:24,110
I went to watch the fucking patriots game.
Uh,

88
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,220
my wife Angel that she is taped the
game for me and then I'm sitting there

89
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:31,850
watching it and it, the thing
just like, it starts fucking up.

90
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,500
Then I got to hit pause. I gotta shut
it off. I've got to turn it back on.

91
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,080
It was doing like one of those
fucking things and it started off.

92
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,050
It was doing it every couple of minutes.
Then once a minute I'll fuck you.

93
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,620
You can't fall ball foul ball.

94
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,740
Is that fair or foul? Five. All right.

95
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,240
Sorry. Um, it's two to one
red socks by the way. Astros'

96
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,540
her up. You just hit one down
by the Pesky Pole. It went foul.

97
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,170
Um,
anyways,

98
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,130
so then it started doing it like every
30 seconds and it was like every eight

99
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:14,180
fucking seconds. And I was loving
watching the game. Tony Romo,

100
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:17,690
I'm calling it right now. Tony Romo.
If he fucking keeps doing this shit,

101
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,910
he's going to be a hall
of fame broadcaster.

102
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,850
I have never learned more shit

103
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,100
about football.
I don't think.

104
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:29,500
Maybe since I'm going back
maybe to like John Madden,

105
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,080
the way the guys breaking down all of
this stuff and there's always been all

106
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:37,600
these coaches and all this
shit tried to do it somehow.

107
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:41,680
The Way Tony Romo does it, it's like
you get it and he does it in real time.

108
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,170
Um, it's fucking amazing.
So I was enjoying that.

109
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,690
So you know how the world works out?
What are you enjoying something? Well,

110
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:53,650
let's fuck up the recording of it.
So that's what ended up happening.

111
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,700
And um,

112
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,830
you know what it's funny about my
fucking headphones is if I sit up and I'm

113
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:04,210
uncomfortable, they work perfect. But
if I lean back and I'm comfortable,

114
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,350
I swear to God, dude, I don't
know what the fuck I think I did.

115
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:11,500
I kill Tesla and another fucking life.
Is that what I did?

116
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,240
And this is my fucking punishment.

117
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,120
Yeah.

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,550
This is literally all brand new shit.

119
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,230
I swear to God.
I don't know what the fuck I did.

120
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:27,940
I kick Edison in the balls
during a previous level.
He's a fucking thief anyways.

121
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:31,190
Right? I, I swear to God,

122
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,550
unbelievable. And this is the shit, right?

123
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,590
My wife never flips out about
shit like this. You know why?

124
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,470
Cause it never happens to her cause
she buys new shit and it works.

125
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,560
My wife will like lose her cell phone
and grand central station and then I'll

126
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:52,850
call it and they'll just be some
guy. Yeah. Yes I have it. No, no.

127
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,170
I'll bring it to you. Right? I lose
my cell phone. That's fucking it.

128
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,760
Over cold case file. No leads, no nothing.

129
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,810
That fucker is gone. All right,
so it's better over here.

130
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,300
Little better over here.
A little better.

131
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,663
Hmm.

132
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,640
Now this fucking thing
is hanging off here.

133
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:14,790
This whole fucking podcast is just gonna
be me bitching about this fucking wire

134
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:19,140
that I just bought. Now it's off.
Now it's off. Now it's on. Oh, I see.

135
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:22,320
What happens when there's a little bit
of weight and it's hanging down or can't

136
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:25,320
handle that can you can't fucking
handle a little bit of fucking weight.

137
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:29,970
Is that what it is? I just figured what
out what it is. Oh, we got a quitter here.

138
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:32,940
Everybody.
We got a little fucking snowflake.

139
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,720
Let's just move the whole
fucking table for you buddy.

140
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,190
Everybody gets a fucking ribbon
on my mixer.

141
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,020
Just fell off the fucking table.
This whole thing,

142
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,920
this is going off the rails here.

143
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,423
Okay.

144
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,920
Why do I try to make my life easier?
It doesn't work out. So I uh,

145
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,160
can

146
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,240
I lean back in the old man,
put his fucking back up against the couch.

147
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,360
Hello, test. Oh, there we go. There
we go. All right, so I'm back.

148
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,140
Why don't you just dem,
what'd you just saw?

149
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,450
That was why my wife is
sick of living with me.

150
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,770
I know everything's a fucking
conspiracy theory with me.

151
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,120
I really wish when those sort of
challenging moments and in the first world

152
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,550
country as a blue eyed white male,

153
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:27,300
that was actually a challenging moment
for me as people are there are like

154
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:31,140
literally swing war torn
fucking countries haven't,

155
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,910
God knows what Don to them,
right?

156
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,770
If there is a god and he's looking
down right now and he hears all this

157
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:40,950
screaming and yelling and shit
about stuff that's going on

158
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,770
and you find out what's this,

159
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,450
what's this poor soul screaming about
right after he slips at the horrors of war

160
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:54,451
and he's going to just see some bald 50
year old fucking moron doing a podcast

161
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,240
by himself yelling
about a microphone cord.

162
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,460
He's just going to look down and
it is a he, by the way. All right.

163
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,730
Fuck all this feminist shit where now
they turn in everything around, you know,

164
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,190
fuck this. You know, there's
gotta be something that has
to still be a guy, right?

165
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,210
Why Not God,

166
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,260
Oh, why do I love being an
asshole? I just, I enjoy it.
I'm sorry. I do. All right.

167
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,660
He's going to be looking down and be like,
Oh, who is that? I made that. All right.

168
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,490
Do me a favor when he passes
yet to give them the, uh,

169
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,860
tell him to take the down escalator.

170
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,380
MMM.
[inaudible]

171
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,310
I don't know where I'm
going to go when I die.

172
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,320
I can't even think about that shit.
I watched that Mr. Rogers, uh,

173
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,180
won't you be my neighbor?
Did you fucking see that?

174
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,920
You guys watch that thing? Whatever
you call it, their documentary.

175
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,010
I have never felt like such a piece of
shit in my life after watching that.

176
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,810
He's definitely fucking Weirdo man.
He's so fucking weird,

177
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,770
you know, says the guy by himself losing
his shit. Talking into a microphone.

178
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,770
I had the nerve to say that
this guy's weird, but um,

179
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,610
I I, yeah, fuck it. Take it easy.

180
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,470
End of the getting gunned down. Um, sorry.

181
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,170
Anyways, I a, I watched that
documentary and uh, Fred Rogers.

182
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,270
Mmm Mike.

183
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,560
I said if this, if, if there is
a god and Christians are right

184
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,630
and God at his son without
having sex with a virgin.

185
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,240
MMM Jesus.

186
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,600
I mean, just, how do you even say
it out loud and still believe it,

187
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,680
man. It's just clearly written by
guys who don't want sloppy seconds,

188
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,190
you know? So then they got to have to
have like that. Like she's a virgin.

189
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,320
No one ever banged her before,
so she doesn't know what good sex is.

190
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:13,880
She doesn't know what a big Dick is.

191
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,590
Now I could feel comfortable to mount
this person. I mean, is that, is that,

192
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,760
was that the underlying theme of
all of that? Huh? Hey, look at that.

193
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:27,300
That's sort of a feminist look at
it, isn't it? I Dunno what it is.

194
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,130
[inaudible] right now.
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,320
My apologies to everybody.

196
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:37,520
South of a fucking Washington
DC Mason Dixon line there.

197
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,630
Do you guys know the first, you
know the Gettysburg address? Yeah,

198
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:45,380
I had no fucking idea where that was in
the first fucking battle of the civil

199
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,630
war. I thought it was like, you know,

200
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,760
somewhere in the sec they
were in big 10 country.

201
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,860
They weren't fucking Pennsylvania. I had
no idea. We never would get that far.

202
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,900
We always start with those fucking
three ships. The Nina, the Pinta,

203
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:07,770
the Santa Maria, they came over.
They somehow, they came over after a

204
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,900
Columbus, right? Columbus
came over to like,

205
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,690
I dunno, like Cuba.
Well The Bahamas, Haiti,

206
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:23,400
he was down around there. Right. And
then the Nina, the Pinta and Santa Maria,

207
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:27,390
they all came over together. Right.
Sort of the first carnival cruise.

208
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,550
It's kind of like that
without, you know, a workout,

209
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:36,020
Roman scurvy and shit like
that. Right. Big Dope buckles.

210
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,380
They must send a credible
neck muscles back then. Huh?

211
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,870
Big fucking hat with that belt on there.

212
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,650
Looking down at your soggy fucking
boots, bringing your head back up. Um,

213
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,920
anyways,
they were all trapped easy.

214
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,000
The coach used to come off slide right
off their fucking nonexistent shoulders.

215
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,231
So anyways,

216
00:13:56,231 --> 00:14:00,070
we would start with that shit and then
we would maybe get to the war of 18, 12

217
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,680
never fucked with the civil war
as far as where I went to school.

218
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:09,280
We never fucked with it. It was just
our country fighting each other. Why,

219
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,990
why would that be of interest to anybody?

220
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,903
You know,

221
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,930
maybe that was just
northern as being cool.

222
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,010
You don't not talking shit after winning.
Ah,

223
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,030
we don't need to teach him that we won.
Right.

224
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,400
But down south they were
always talking about it.

225
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,180
Probably saying that we cheated, you
know, like people hate the Patriots.

226
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,480
Say we under inflated our fucking cannon
balls at whatever the fuck they're

227
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,160
going to say, you know. Um,

228
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,070
anyways, let me a tell me, just sent
me a text at Aaron Rodgers. Get hurt.

229
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,020
Please tell me. I fucking hate
when that happens. Roger is done.

230
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,170
He grabbed that niece so
fast. It's bad. Oh No.

231
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,240
Oh

232
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,830
Jesus Christ.
I fucking hate you.

233
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,570
It's just,
there's nothing worse than that.

234
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,683
You know what I mean?

235
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,071
And I gotta tell you something.

236
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:06,520
If you're a vikings fan or a bears
fan in your psych that that happened,

237
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,830
you're a fucking asshole.
You know,

238
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:12,400
I never rooted for Derek Jeter to get
hurt or any of that shit. You want a,

239
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:16,720
you want to play in when the, when do
you want to beat him with that best? Um,

240
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,680
wow.
Does that change the NFC?

241
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,260
My buddy who actually knows
something about football was,

242
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,810
was picking them to go to the Superbowl.
Well,

243
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:32,380
you know what that reminds me, I remember
that year when the jets were favored,

244
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,840
was like the first game of the season
Test Verde, you know, blew out as Achilles

245
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,153
and uh,

246
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,870
who cried? It wasn't Terrell
Owens. It was uh, the guy from USC.

247
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,790
Oh Jesus Christ.
Just give me the damn ball.

248
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,420
When did wide the wide receiver
position become the diva position.

249
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,130
He used to always be the quarterback.

250
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:04,120
He was the guy always walking around
with the big inflated fucking ego in

251
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:06,700
somewhere in the last like 15,
20 years.

252
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,570
Like all the emotional meltdowns come
from the guys who like catch the balls,

253
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,000
you know,
that was my quarterback.

254
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,080
Okay.

255
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,150
Um,
just give me the Damn Paul.

256
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,090
Oh Jesus Christ. Anyways, um,

257
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,340
so I worked up in Thunder Valley
learned or valley fucking California.

258
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,620
Um, the, the farthest north.
I have been in Sacramento.

259
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,920
All right.
I was a,

260
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,380
I landed in Sacramento was a
30 minute drive and this guy,

261
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,980
fortunately he took like the back roads,
which is really cool.

262
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:52,790
So we went by all these,
these farms and uh,

263
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,340
I actually for the first
time saw an almond tree.

264
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,620
I thought nuts came from the ground,
you know,

265
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,710
cause I always, you know, I was going to
baseball whenever I go to baseball game,

266
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:05,600
they give you the ones that
they feed to the elephants.

267
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,430
Those are like the fucking, you
know, the Budweiser of peanuts.

268
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,660
Almonds is sort of like the blue moon.
You get a little more fucking crafty beer.

269
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:19,610
Kind of snobby. Right? But they're
those, those elephant ones,

270
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:21,230
they always seem like they're dirty.

271
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,710
Take me out to the ball game.

272
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,620
I didn't know that nuts came on trees.

273
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,260
I'm probably making an ass of myself
right now either. They all do.

274
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,090
Well that's the one that does or whatever.

275
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:37,010
But I know there's a lot of you
right now just racing to look up this

276
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:39,290
information so then you
can tell me how dumb I am.

277
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,100
Or maybe you fucking know that.
You know,

278
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,480
you don't know how to grow one.
You don't know where to pick it.

279
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,420
You just know where it
comes from. Right. Um,

280
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,390
so now all of a sudden I'm the biggest
asshole ever is, is that what happened?

281
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,341
No belt.

282
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,530
You're the biggest asshole ever because
you just had a meltdown about a fucking

283
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:02,130
wire. Fair enough. Fair enough.

284
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,080
Jesus Christ,
the Buccaneers in saints 48 to 40.

285
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,080
I got to tell you before
it's all said and done,

286
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,980
I drew Brees is going to throw for
more fucking everything that anybody,

287
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,770
unless Tom Brady keeps playing.

288
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,790
Cause I don't think drew Brees is
doing that. Uh, drew versus time.

289
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,000
Tom Brady versus time like that
shit. Like today, they actually,

290
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,280
they said he was the oldest quarterback
to throw a touchdown in the first game

291
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:37,240
of the year.
Other than George Blanda.

292
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,830
Who is the Gordy fucking how of of
football as far as how long he played and,

293
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,730
and Warren Moon. Who? I didn't know.
I didn't know he played that late.

294
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,020
I know he's spent most of at least
half his career up in the CFL.

295
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,960
Maybe that's why he didn't seem like he
was at old because by the time he came

296
00:18:56,961 --> 00:19:01,860
in the league, it was already
like eight years in the CFL. Um,

297
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,610
anyways, uh, why do I have the
fucking TV on? Why do I give a shit?

298
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,160
Should I hit pause? Let me hit pause.
You know, at the end of the day,

299
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:18,450
I have a job here to do and it's God
damn it is to make people laugh. Well,

300
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:21,150
you know what, it's a new TV and I
don't know how to do it. Is this, do it?

301
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,780
Oh my God, it did it. I hit
the pause button and it paused.

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,020
Fuck that.
I'm hitting play.

303
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,701
I still have that thing.

304
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,160
You remember the old days when you pause
your flat screen and then it's just

305
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:36,630
burned in there? Whatever the
fuck you were looking at. Um,

306
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,660
all right, let me look the other
way. Okay. So I, I watched, uh,

307
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,240
won't you be my neighbor?
And then I also watched a Chappaquiddick

308
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,820
you got to check both. Both those
movies out were incredible and uh,

309
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:53,640
any on me stay on track
here. So we took the, uh,

310
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,370
the back roads up to this casino,
what their thunder bay,

311
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,650
not to bay, sorry. Thunder Valley.

312
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,730
And uh,

313
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,681
you know,

314
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:08,640
every once in awhile I'll actually watch
the news and whenever I watched the

315
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,474
news,

316
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,680
it always puts me into a panic and
makes me feel like I should live in the

317
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:17,070
middle of nowhere next to a
lake with a bunch of guns.

318
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,863
You know?

319
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,610
And I know there's a lot of people in the
cities probably think that stuff. Okay,

320
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,600
well,
here's the deal.

321
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,040
The only way to live in the middle of
nowhere is if you grew up in the middle of

322
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,040
nowhere. Cause then you know
how to live out there. Right.

323
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,070
You came from a family that,

324
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,520
that taught you how to
hunt and all of that shit.

325
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,710
You know what I mean?
I'm too fucking old for that.

326
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,720
I gotta go this snake Pliska
en route and try to stay in,

327
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,200
in a fucking city.

328
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,643
You know,

329
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,990
I think I'm going to join the people
that live underground in the sewers cause

330
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:02,220
it's going to be so fucking hot. You
know the red heads, all us red heads,

331
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,710
we're going to end up under ground and
we're going to be coming up like a bunch

332
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:06,120
of filthy Malakai's.

333
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,620
So you guys better sharpen your fucking
swords or whatever the hell you're going

334
00:21:10,621 --> 00:21:12,540
to have once you run out of bullets.

335
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,810
That's going to be the thing when
you run out of fucking bullets,

336
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,000
then it'll be swords
and just clubs and it's,

337
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,850
it's going to be come fucking Braveheart,
you know?

338
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,490
But not if we were all like Fred Rogers.

339
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,320
He be just sitting there
in the middle of it.

340
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:38,321
It's such a good failing to know you're
alive and when you crawl up Adda that

341
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,530
manhole.
I would appreciate it if you,

342
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,410
what the fuck just happened?

343
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,640
He got all of that one.

344
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,800
How did it go from two other here?
Three run fucking homer.

345
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,220
I don't even know who did it.

346
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,680
Very nice. That's right. Houston.

347
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,710
How does it feel to be owned
chain and people do that shit? Um,

348
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,660
the big story here is that the Houston
Astros are going to take two out of three,

349
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,040
which this is a series.

350
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:26,810
Now this is one of these wants that I
pay attention to because we're going to

351
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:30,610
run into these. Some bitches come October,

352
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,220
so I want to see how we match up my,
granted Chris sale's done in there.

353
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,220
I don't know if price pitched, I don't
even know what the fuck's going on.

354
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,053
So anyways,

355
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,020
we get up there to thunder valley and
it is literally a fucking casino just

356
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,530
surrounded by farmland and the Gig.

357
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,560
It's this giant stage just like
out in the parking lot and ever.

358
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,840
Nobody's covered. Right? If
there was any sort of rain,

359
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,800
I was joking like everybody would
just fucking leave and I would be

360
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:02,050
contractually obligated to do an hour in
front of a bunch of plastic wet folding

361
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:02,770
chairs.

362
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,910
But I gotta tell you it's one of my
favorite gigs I've had in a long time was

363
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:09,550
amazing.
The Sky was beautiful.

364
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,300
The only thing that was weird was
like when motorcycles would go by,

365
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:14,950
I had to like stop doing my act.

366
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:19,240
Like I was literally getting like
heckled by those things that I was joking

367
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:21,760
about. How those people up there,
they probably don't wear helmets.

368
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,733
You know what I mean?

369
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,300
Anytime you have a problem you just
drive off into a bunch of snow peas.

370
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,100
Those things are probably nice
and soft, slow you down. Um,

371
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,130
and then after that I woke up the next
morning at like something ridiculous.

372
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,510
I want to say it was a
4:00 AM

373
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,580
am and then I had to get on a 6:00
AM flight, something like that.

374
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,870
I can't even fucking remember.

375
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,690
Slide is salt lake city and from Salt
Lake City go to Toronto for tiff.

376
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,260
The Toronto International Film Festival
is All freckles is in a movie called the

377
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:05,400
front runner directed by,
uh,

378
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,810
Jason Reitman starring a Hugh Jackman.

379
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,780
And I just,

380
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,643
uh Huh.

381
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,480
I saw it for the first time anyways,
let me tell you the whole fucking story.

382
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:22,390
So I, one of my favorite
things I've seen in an airport

383
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,460
standing in line, right, trying to find
something healthy but you can't really do.

384
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,860
And uh, this guy in front of me,
he orders two bagels and he goes,

385
00:24:35,861 --> 00:24:39,190
can you put butter on it? Can you put,
I just want to bagels with butter on it.

386
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,870
And he's like already on his tip toes,

387
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:43,390
like over the counter and he's tall
enough to see over the counter.

388
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:45,580
So I was like, what? He's
one of these fucking guys,

389
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:48,100
like when you prepare his food,

390
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:52,030
he has all these fucking instructions
and he's on his tip toes watching you do

391
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:53,920
it.
And immediately I'm just like,

392
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:59,070
God bless the fucking woman
or man romantically linked
to this fucking lunatic,

393
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,713
right?

394
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,640
So he's on,
he's on his tip toes at Yankee.

395
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,060
He's on his fucking tip
toes watching this lady.

396
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:14,570
She sticks it in the little fucking
conveyor belt piece of shit,

397
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:17,950
toaster and it comes out.
She's putting into to gaze go.

398
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,480
I could keep put cake with the butter on
it, ma'am. Could you just put the punch?

399
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:23,780
She goes, what? She goes, can can, can
you put the butter on? She goes, yeah.

400
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:26,120
She goes to butters over
there and he goes, no.

401
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,820
I was just hoping that you could put
butter on it while it's still hot so to

402
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:31,170
like melt. Can you do that? Can,

403
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,010
can you just put butter on it while
it's still hot and then close it up.

404
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,310
Can you do that for me? She
just looks at him. He goes, no,

405
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,260
just handed on the bag. Now I
know. I've always made fun of that.

406
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:47,960
I hate those fucking places where all
of a sudden you got to finish making the

407
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:49,940
sandwich like you work there for free,

408
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,380
but just the way she just told the guy
no and he was already annoying me the way

409
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,270
he was up on his fucking tip toes.

410
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,010
Okay.

411
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,360
Like Gee, what? What the fuck
you, you didn't order like a,

412
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm trying to think of something fancy.
You wanted a fucking Bagel.

413
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,740
Okay.

414
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,500
She's going to toast the thing.
She's going to stick it in a bag.

415
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,870
You're gonna pay for it. Then you're
going to go over to the condiments.

416
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,890
Try to find something that wasn't
sneezed on. You know how it's going down.

417
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,850
So I laughed and she looked at me and
gave me like half a smile. She's like,

418
00:26:21,851 --> 00:26:23,410
what do you want? I'm just like, ah,

419
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,420
I'll take one of those ham and
cheese sandwiches. You know,

420
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:26,470
you don't have to do anything to it.

421
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,000
MMM [inaudible]

422
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,930
Oh, it was great watching that guy
gets shut down. I don't know why.

423
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:36,430
It's like you have a see a little spoiled
fucking Brat kid crying, you know,

424
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,840
cause he wants something.

425
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,970
Is there anything better watching a parent
not cave and then the kid doesn't get

426
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,250
it.
I fee I live

427
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,250
for that moment when the kid cries and
cries and cries and then the parents end

428
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:50,610
up just giving it to them.

429
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,010
I was mixed. We just want to
like trip them. Isn't that
stupid? I don't, obviously,

430
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,900
I'm just saying, you know something I
do think about, I'm not proud of it.

431
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,790
We all have our flaws
occasionally. Yes, I see.

432
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,050
I see. I see a kid gets up
to and after crying and uh,

433
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,670
makes you want to triple and it's
stupid because the kid doesn't have the

434
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:21,520
emotional maturity to express himself.

435
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,830
Right?
Yeah.

436
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,170
What else Fred Rogers would have handled
that if he didn't want them to have it.

437
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,160
Why are you crying?

438
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,340
Well, you can't have all, my God,
what a fucking moron. This, this,

439
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,980
I've got blessed it. There's a woman
there, she's wearing a Houston Astros fan.

440
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:45,570
She's wearing like one of those, you know,
they make the number ones finger out.

441
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,510
She's got a giant orange Astros hat.

442
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,120
Like to the point you're blocking
people's view behind you.

443
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,790
Those are the things.

444
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,310
It's because of hats like that and people
like that. That where I'm at games.

445
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:05,340
That's one of the reasons why like things
like flame throwers are not legal to

446
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:10,120
the general public because that's the
kind of thing when you sit there for nine

447
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:14,340
fucking innings. All right. And
that's self centered content.

448
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,100
Won't take the fucking thing off. That's
one of the things, if you had like a, a,

449
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,090
a handheld,
I'm not saying you'd burn her,

450
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:26,980
but you'd like to hat on fire
and God knows what that's
made out of and it might,

451
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:27,670
you know,

452
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,910
touch somebody else's fucking hat and
then they're on fire and you're like,

453
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,290
but no, no, no. I just wanted to set
her on fire. I'm sorry sir. My Bet.

454
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,270
My Bet. Would you like me to
drive you to the burn unit? No.

455
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:42,010
Most of your ear is still attached.

456
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,653
MMM.

457
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:45,311
Anyways,

458
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:50,311
so then I flew up to Canada and I checked
like 9 million times that I had my

459
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:53,010
passport because that's one of
the things I always, you know,

460
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,950
the first half of my career,
you could just go to Canada,

461
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:59,670
like you're going to your friend's house.
He didn't need a passport, you know,

462
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,930
and then after nine,
11,

463
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,723
shit,

464
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,080
don't even say nine 11 but horrific event.

465
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,430
And, uh, ever since then you've hit,

466
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,060
you've got to have your fucking
passport to go everywhere. So, uh,

467
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,150
I checked like fucking 900 times,
make sure I have my passport. Um,

468
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,460
and I went through the customs and
everything and I think I got there at like

469
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:34,940
four o'clock. And then like
the pickup was like at five 15.

470
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,910
So by the time I got through customs and
all of that shit ordered room service

471
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:40,510
and everything,

472
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,510
like I had time to iron my stupid shirt
and then I went over there and I did the

473
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:48,850
whole, uh, you know,

474
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,810
the whole red carpet got
asked great questions.

475
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:56,260
Nobody tried to corner me,
you know, it was a couple of,

476
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:00,310
how would you relate this movie to
what's going on today in the current

477
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:04,530
political climate? You know,
it was fine. There was no way.

478
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,500
What do you think about this guy going
back on stage already knew what I was

479
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:09,910
going to say.
Well what do you think about it?

480
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,260
That's all I am ever do. You asked me
one of those and your career questions,

481
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:21,850
I just throw it right back at you. What
do you think about it? No, I'm asking you.

482
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,520
Well I didn't ask the question.
You're the one who has the question.

483
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,130
You're the one thinking about it. What do
you think about it? I want to hear why,

484
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,350
why you put a quote on it.
What do you think about it there?

485
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:37,410
They have fucking, uh,
Jimmy Olsen. So then we, uh,

486
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,860
I went into the,
uh,

487
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,260
this beautiful theater and sat down and
watched the movie and I gotta tell you,

488
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,790
man, it's pretty fucking incredible.
Uh, Jason Reitman killed it.

489
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,750
Uh, it's called the front
runner and I would not be, I
don't want to Jinx Eddie a,

490
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,830
I'm not going to jinx nothing,
but I would not be surprised.

491
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,950
I'll go real.
I'm going to really

492
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,330
go low here if it performs very well,
that's,

493
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,970
that's as much shit as I'm going
to talk. Um, but it's a phenomenal,

494
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,810
phenomenal movie. And the way
the whole thing was cut together,

495
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:18,730
the way they told the story. And
uh, it's really, really fascinating.

496
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:23,650
It's about the, uh, the Gary Hart story,
which a, for you youngsters out there.

497
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,000
He was a guy running for
president in 1988. And yes,

498
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,270
he was the front runner.
Great Looking Guy.

499
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,190
Guys like them ladies loved them.
Full head of hair,

500
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,880
you know, that's the kind of shit
that gets you elected. Right?

501
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,970
Play the saxophone on our Sineal hall.
Two terms,

502
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:49,360
not one, two terms. Ah, Shit.

503
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:53,290
Did they just hit a fucking home run guy?
That was a monster shot. Five to two.

504
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,690
The Astros'. No, quint numb. You
know why? Cause they're champions.

505
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,970
Um, oh man, that's that fucking guy.

506
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:11,020
What is his name? That's the
guy last year, the world series.

507
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,100
That was incredible. You know the
dude that I was out today, right?

508
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,630
That guy, that guy's worst. Every
time you pay him, you know, outside,

509
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:26,320
like I liked that guy in the infield
for the Texas Rangers. Total winner.

510
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:30,970
The guy who punched that dude in
the face. Um, credible ballplayer,

511
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:32,680
man,

512
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,980
that's going to be ashamed watching the
red sox and Yankees by him away from the

513
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:40,220
Rangers. Although back in the day, the
range of spent all money on a Rod, right?

514
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,260
220 million bucks. So they
got money. That's Texas, man.

515
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,240
You sit in on all that fucking oil.

516
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,700
Why don't you take some of that money,
put it on your team.

517
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,040
Um,
anyways,

518
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,140
so I got there went thank
God every like the, uh,

519
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:02,570
I got there on time and I got
to see movies. Phenomenal.

520
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,770
Everybody in it is so fucking good.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

521
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:10,940
I had my head down whenever he,
my boys put my head down. But uh,

522
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,800
you know,
I watched,

523
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,750
I actually watched most of my scenes and
I wasn't cringing too badly. So I think,

524
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,920
uh, I think I did all right in it. Uh,
but I want to thank everybody for uh,

525
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,170
everyone I worked with and giving
me the opportunity to be in it.

526
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,170
But I think it's going to be a great
one. So guys, could you do me a favor?

527
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,050
I know you're all stream and shit.

528
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,150
I know you got your fucking virtual
reality glasses with your laser disc

529
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,370
players. Whatever the fuck
he kids are doing nowadays.

530
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,650
Could you just go old school,
just go to the movies when it comes up?

531
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,290
Just go see this thing.
Alright.

532
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,280
Do it for me to it for me.

533
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:57,281
So one day I can afford to buy speaker
wires that actually microphone wires that

534
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:01,460
actually work. Okay. It's for
a cost. This is a startup.

535
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:05,570
I think it comes out in
November. Um, go see it.

536
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:09,200
You will not be disappointed there.
That's it. All right. Plowing ahead.

537
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:14,000
All the gay rod, a rods in the fucking box
deck. There's another guy, another guy,

538
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,460
Tony Romo and Alex Rodriguez.
I say,

539
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,710
well they're the two best former athletes
turned broadcasters in a long goddamn

540
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:22,544
time.

541
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,630
It's unreal how in a rod was a player in
the New York media would be asking them

542
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:33,620
all those questions. He could get like
tongue tied. You get them in the booth

543
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,850
and he's just the effortless

544
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,220
fucking effortless. All right. Speaking of
effortless, not effortless, I should say.

545
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,340
I got to do some reads here for the week
and I forgot to turn the God damn line

546
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:48,174
on

547
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:59,690
there. No, you can read. Ah,

548
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,190
Jesus. So anyways, and then
this morning I had a 6:00 AM

549
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,560
6:00 AM flight. What was awesome,
there was nobody in Toronto.

550
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,270
I've gotten some of the worst traffic
other than La and Chicago and some of

551
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:17,480
those other fucking places,
but Toronto is just brutal traffic.

552
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:19,100
And I woke up this morning
and there was nothing,

553
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,940
nobody out there on a Sunday morning.
And uh,

554
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,020
went right through customs,
thing of beauty.

555
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,270
And then I went to go buy some fucking
Cuban cigars there and their prices were

556
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,860
out fucking religious
dude.

557
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:41,510
I was looking at, I was looking at a box
of them. They want to like 560 bucks.

558
00:35:41,511 --> 00:35:43,670
It's like, dude, I can get
these things and I don't,

559
00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:47,090
people in la got these things
not paying all that money.

560
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:51,400
So ended up buying that. These, these
look these little ones about like five.

561
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,200
I even know what the hell you call it
out. Shit. Now they fucking hitting us.

562
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,450
Now they're hitting somebody else.

563
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:01,420
How many outs here to top
of the six and a game?

564
00:36:01,421 --> 00:36:04,540
You guys already know the
results of its five to two.

565
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,920
This has never been good other than the
fact that one time when the guy ran the

566
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:10,030
ball back to win the game,

567
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:13,750
that was the only time this was a good
move to have the fucking game on. Um,

568
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,690
all right, let me read some of the, um,
all right, let me read some of the, uh,

569
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,050
advertising here. Oh my
bookie, everybody, you know,

570
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:25,920
ever since I started this podcast,
people have been asking me for advice.

571
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,850
Ask me what team to bet on.

in the day who I liked,

573
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:35,010

truth is, I don't know who's gonna win,

602
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,330
You know what I realized is that I bought
this, this fucking, uh, microphone,

603
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:28,680
wire, headphones, shit,

604
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,620
all this stuff and it's so heavy
that it was hanging off the table.

605
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,350
That's why everything actually works.
Once again,

606
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,890
I fucking flip out and there it was a
simple solution and there was no reason to

607
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:44,200
have a meltdown. I do
it all the time. Okay,

608
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,800
so now they got fucking two guys on
base. Nobody out. We got a writing,

609
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,390
a lefty warming up in the bullpen.

610
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,740
This is why the Astros won it last year.

611
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,420
You can not put these guys to bed,
can't talk them in.

612
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,730
All right? Policy Genius September is
National Life Insurance awareness month.

613
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,660
Most people aren't aware of that. In
fact, most people aren't aware. They neat.

614
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,000
Well, most people aren't fucking
away. The light turned green,

615
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,300
too busy staring at the God damn phones.
In fact,

616
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:16,060
most people aren't aware they
need life insurance at all.

617
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,320
That's why 40% of people don't have it.
Well,

618
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,920
I mean it's not that they're not aware
which a lot of it is guys and we don't

619
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:28,240
like dealing with our mortality.
Um, but I've, I did it.

620
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,060
I have my affairs in order
and I cannot tell you as,

621
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:36,061
as a husband and a father knowing that
when I Croak everybody that I love in my

622
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:41,620
family is going to be okay.
It's great.

623
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,900
Then you can have like a happy funeral.
You know, people show up in brand new,

624
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,540
uh,
black clothing

625
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,840
anyways, but getting life insurance
doesn't need to be difficult or expensive.

626
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:58,870
Right now prices are the lowest
they've been in 20 years.

627
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,430
Yeah.

628
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,091
Why is that?

629
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:04,810
Is it because people are living longer
and policy genius has made it easier than

630
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:05,710
ever to get covered?

631
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,420
Policy Genius has helped over 4 million
people shopped for insurance and placed

632
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:15,220
over $20 billion in coverage and they
don't just make life insurance easy.

633
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:19,180
They also compare disability insurance,
renter's insurance, and health insurance.

634
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,920
If you care about it,
they cover it.

635
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,760
So if you're looking for a good reason
to buy life insurance, here's three.

636
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,720
It's national life insurance awareness
month. That's not a good reason.

637
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,120
Okay. It could be national ghetto hooker
month doesn't mean you should go do it.

638
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:37,290
Right? So that one's out. Prices are
at a 20 year low. That's a good one.

639
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,030
And policy genius makes it easy
to get the right policy for you.

640
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,000
Wait, they said there was three
reasons. National Life Insurance,

641
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,570
wellness month prices
are at a 20 year low. Oh.

642
00:40:51,571 --> 00:40:54,750
And then harassed is policy genius makes
it easy to get the right policy for you.

646
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,100
O. L. I. S. T. Y. G. E. N. I. U.

647
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,100
S the easiest way to compare and buy
life insurance genius is not an easy word

648
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:18,150
to spell. It's an easy one to fuck up.
Like restaurant. That's an easy one.

649
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,730
Um, anyways, draft kings.

650
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,580
Yeah.

651
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:28,510
Uh, it's week two of the football season
visit. Well, I guess it goes, it's,

652
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:31,320
yeah, cause I'm supposed to
be reading this tomorrow. Um,

653
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,380

654
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:40,010
Bragging rights and huge cast prizes
are up for grabs all season long.

655
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:44,660
At draft kings, the late in one

uh, with one week fantasy draft
kings, you choose when to play.

659
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:02,780

That's so fascinating. Now, you know,

they've got like the Dinero
character handicap. Each team every,

665
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,590
now the salary cap has to be different
for every team, right? Do they do that?

666
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,720
That would be fucking incredible. If they
did that and they, they'd pick the end,

667
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,090
you know, they picked that
perfect fucking number. C,

That's where the skill comes in anyways.

Um,

683
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,520
you know what I really miss?
I miss football cards.

684
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,980
That's how I knew who everybody
was in the league. I fucking

685
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,140
miss those things.

686
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,820
And what happens was all those
fucking baseball cards in the 1950s,

687
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:43,290
all the Mickey male rookie cards and all
of that shit blew up and we're with all

688
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,660
that money.
So by the time I became an adult,

689
00:43:45,661 --> 00:43:48,870
so many adults were collecting cards.
Kids didn't give a shit about it.

690
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,810
And then I try collecting
football cards again and they,

691
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,720
they would like deliberately
make some of them rare.

692
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,900
You couldn't just go out and go buy a
whole set cause that's what people were

693
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:01,650
doing. And then they weren't fucking
worth anything. Let me see tops.

694
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,130
Let me see. They still have
these things. Football card,

695
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,360
Duh. Uh, 2018,

696
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,720
2018.
What do you got here buddy?

697
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,830
Will my internet work? You know
what? I don't even care if it does.

698
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,740
It does or it doesn't. I'm not going
to flip out about it. How about that?

699
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,290
Just relax bill. Just count to 10
slowly one. You know, I got a master,

700
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:36,060
I got a master going for a walk the
other day. I got into with my wife,

701
00:44:36,061 --> 00:44:40,440
right. And, and I, I started to
walk away but I didn't leave,

702
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:42,723
you know.

703
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,130
All right. Sharp tops, football cards,
2018 football cards, release dates.

704
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:55,500
All right, let's see what they got
here. It's such a good feeling.

705
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,740
I used to just sit there and like,

706
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:01,890
I wouldn't study in school and I would
just look at football cards and I would

707
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:02,100
read,

708
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,220
I would look at the picture and I would
just read them over and over and over

709
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:09,210
again. It didn't realize it was like
flashcards. And by the end of it,

710
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:10,770
I knew everybody in the league.

711
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:13,200
I knew where they went to cook
and I would watch it every year.

712
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,520
I get the cards every year and
there was all these guys that I,

713
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:21,400
I already knew shit about and there
was only so many new rookies. And uh,

714
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,300
I remember he's still blow my dad's mind.
I was like,

715
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:30,240
and he went to college and
be, can't stay Louie couches.

716
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:34,000
See as a size 16,
quadruple ees clique.

717
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,790
You like Jesus Christ. How do you know
all of this stuff bill, while dad,

718
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,020
cause I'm not studying

719
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,610
all that effort that I should
have put in to my studies

720
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,270
so I could've gone to a big time
college, you know, and joined a Frat,

721
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,050
walked around, you know, maybe
join the glee club or whatever.

722
00:45:56,051 --> 00:46:00,370
I've had an acapella group,
you know,

723
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:01,930
met some women,

724
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,670
get me two fucking years later.
I just missed out on it.

725
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,170
Um,
when the fuck is this thing gonna load.

726
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,170
All right. You know, I'm just, I'm just
going to start read some questions.

727
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:19,450
Maybe at some point I don't,
I know for the life of me,

728
00:46:19,451 --> 00:46:23,260
I don't know how much money I have to
pay these Internet guys to get something

729
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:24,200
that works. You know, I was three,

730
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,450
I started to talk about this
where a buddy of mine had a,

731
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:29,411
you know,

732
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,890
he solved his internet prom but they
got these things called like mesh or

733
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:37,480
something like that where it ties the
Internet signal from one party house to

734
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:40,930
another.
And that just seems like you were in

735
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,210
the Tsa Line for fucking brain cancer.
Like it's bad enough.

736
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,780
We got all these [inaudible] it can't
be good. I don't know what it is,

737
00:46:49,781 --> 00:46:52,090
but there's something going on you.
We've all done it.

738
00:46:52,091 --> 00:46:55,540
We've all talked on a cell phone long
enough that like the side of your fucking

739
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,140
one side of your head starts
feeling weird. You know what I mean?

740
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,540
They still a bit about that.
So then you talk with the cell phone,

741
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:04,150
the other side of your head sort of
sear it like a fucking tuna steak.

742
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,920
It's just your brain. Alright,
eastern European tour. Hello Bill.

743
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:10,150
I am writing from Croatia.

744
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,780
I like to ask you if you are still
coming to this part of the world.

745
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,720
My part of the world, not
yours. Just kidding. Yes I am.

746
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,210
We're just working it out because a,

747
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,570
the dates came in and I was going to
be gone for too long. I have a kid,

748
00:47:22,571 --> 00:47:25,720
so I'm trying to break it
up into two different tours.

749
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,000
Do a week to 10 days and then come a few
months later and do another week to 10

750
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,890
today. 10 10 days, 10 days, 10 days.
That's what I'm trying to do. Okay.

751
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,890
I promise you it is going to
happen. All right. Outdoor venues.

752
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,410
Uh, why did one this
weekend? So I am ready.

753
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:49,150
I'm ready for this question dear Billy.
Operation Northwoods. Look it up.

754
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:53,140
All right. Oh my internet work,
sir. I would love to look it up.

755
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,570
It's still loading.

756
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,130
Yeah.

757
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,820
All right. Um, thanks for the killer
show. Uh, in the casino parking lot. Oh,

758
00:48:02,821 --> 00:48:05,540
thank you for showing
up. Anyways, he said,

759
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:08,060
I've heard you mentioned a
guy named law head before,

760
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:10,910
but I never knew shit about him.
Fucking hilarious guy. Yeah.

761
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:13,670
J Law had Jay lie. I, come on man,

762
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:18,671
that guy a fucking kills it on the
grill to follow him on Instagram.

763
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,550
You see that guy when that guy
starts cooking, it's fucking crazy.

764
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:24,620
It's like a cooking show.
Uh,

765
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:27,560
how come he's not on Netflix or seesaw?

766
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:31,120
I think it's CSO or whatever
the fuck you guys do anyways.

767
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:35,210
Wondering if the parking lot is up
there in the weirdest outdoor venues.

768
00:48:35,211 --> 00:48:39,650
You've played at a, all right.
Why isn't Jay on Netflix? Well,

769
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:45,290
or CSO went out of business.
What else is there? Hulu,

770
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:48,980
Amazon and all that. Well,
eventually it happens for
everybody. Everybody, you know,

771
00:48:48,981 --> 00:48:52,520
takes people different amount
of time. You know, look,

772
00:48:52,521 --> 00:48:57,521
I started in 1992 and it took me until
either 2005 or 2006 to get on Letterman.

773
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,450
And I went through a couple of bookers,
a couple that it was just like, yeah,

774
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,830
I don't like you or you get a weird,
we get a weird look as one that I got.

775
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:14,710
Well I don't think that was some
the and people, but um, yeah,

776
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,461
you know,
it was hilarious.

777
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:19,180
I remember years later seeing this other
generations of comedians and they were

778
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:22,930
like bitching about the book booking
process and they were like seven years in.

779
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:28,450
It's just like, well wait fucking buck up
buddy. It's going to take you another A.

780
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,303
Yeah.

781
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:31,703
I don't know.

782
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,740
But that's not how it works.
It's not how it works nowadays.

783
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,410
Cause now there's social media cause
now you fucking complaint and then

784
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,750
everybody's afraid to get in trouble
and nobody know. He just goes like, hey,

785
00:49:38,751 --> 00:49:40,400
you don't have, fuck you. Oh Shit.

786
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,073
Wow.

787
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,180
Ah, it's a run. Scored two run score

788
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,210
two runs, go. Oh my God,

789
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:56,190
these fucking Houston Astros
are relentless looking at them.

790
00:49:56,191 --> 00:50:00,390
They're all up there top of the day.
This is impressive.

791
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,400
This is what we've been doing,

792
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:06,480
the teams all year and now they're coming
in giving us the old right there, Fred.

793
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:09,913
Fuck.

794
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,480
I already know what they're saying with
the sound on that ball got up there in

795
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:16,910
the zone. I mean that thing
you want that much lower.

796
00:50:16,911 --> 00:50:20,900
This is like that's right
in his wheelhouse and he
jumped all over it. His eyes,

797
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,660
they opened up like a kid on Christmas.
Ah,

798
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,970
fuck me. Um, anyways,

799
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,200
I love that you guys know that
the result of this Houston chance.

800
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:37,610
So I was talking all that shit like
we're gonna whip y'all fucking cities as

801
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:38,444
today.

802
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,353
MMM.

803
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,390
If there is a sportscar just because
that woman is wearing that giant stupid

804
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:48,800
fucking hat in a, in a
visitor's stadium, you know?

805
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:51,830
I mean just how many times can you
just ask to get your fucking ass kicked

806
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:52,730
before it happens?

807
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,613
MMM.

808
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,320
Anyways, yeah, so people like,
yeah. Then started whining about,

809
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,820
I dunno how long it takes or whatever.
Then I guess it's shortened up.

810
00:51:03,821 --> 00:51:04,930
It's so fucking stupid.

811
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,570
[inaudible] it's particularly hard for me.
It's like,

812
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:18,270
what are you, what are you
seeing out there? Like,

813
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,090
here's the deal.
It might be more difficult for you,

814
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:26,091
but nobody has it easy fucking sitting
there acting like God damn fucking

815
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:28,900
Spielberg sends me a
fucking sandwich every day.

816
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,763
MMM.

817
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,620
Which would be nice if he's
listening every once in a while.

818
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:37,770
Uh,

819
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,080
alright. Outdoor venues. Yes. Um,

820
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:44,730
where's the weirdest venues that I've
played, outdoor venues that I played at.

821
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,350
I used to open up for Wynonna
Judd way back in the day and we,

822
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:54,390
uh, we did a lot of outdoor venues. Um,

823
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,040
you know,
when you're selling that level of tickets,

824
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,100
she basically was selling
so many tickets that they,

825
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:03,860
they didn't have an indoor venue
big enough so that you have,

826
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,450
you have to go outside at some point.
So I opened it up up for her at the,

827
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:10,820
I believe it's the del Mar race track.

828
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,090
I thought I told this story.

829
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,520
So I go down there and it's one of these
deals with it, like, hey, you know,

830
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,230
work clean. This is a country
crowd. These people, uh,

831
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,820
they don't like Carsick, which,
you know, you have to respect.

832
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,570
It's not my crowd. I'm opening for this
person. This is what they've created,

833
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,030
you know, all you young comics out
there to then go up there and, and,

834
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,870
and curse anyways is a, that's not a
Lenny Bruce moment that, that you're,

835
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:45,500
you're acting like a jerk off.
Cause they,

836
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:50,190
they probably told you before they even
got the Gig, you got to work clean.

837
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,040
So if you're not going to work clean,
don't take the Gig,

838
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,490
but don't say you're going to work clean
and then go up there and start talking

839
00:52:56,491 --> 00:53:00,330
about your nuts or far more accurately
these days, you're fucking Twat.

840
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,380
Cause female comics are that
fucking Dick joke comics of today.

841
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,640
Some of the fucking filth that I,
I mean some of the bits it's just like,

842
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:16,790
I remember this bit except there were
Dick and balls and I was standing in a bar

843
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,250
trying to figure out how the fuck
am I going to follow this shit.

844
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,823
MMM.

845
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,770
Anyways, so, uh, I had to clean

846
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,510
it was during the day,

847
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,800
which actually didn't bug me because I
was psyched because I was making money.

848
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:35,310
I always loved like those gigs, like a
lot of times the newness and shit sucked.

849
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:37,920
But what was awesome was when it was over,

850
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:41,550
you had your check and you already make
money and you could maybe double up and

851
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,280
do another Gig or you were like done

852
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:51,090
at like a normal hours. So, um,
but that never happened. You know,

853
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:54,120
you always went out and did more fucking
time. Are we going to do sit at home,

854
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,050
be alone with your thoughts?
So I went down there

855
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,790
and Wynona was always like
really nice to me. Um,

856
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:08,040
and I went down to open up and I
got to work clean. It's outside,

857
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,550
I'm in the sun, I'm a redhead.
I still had my hair back then,

858
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:14,400
so I didn't need a hat and a,

859
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,860
I'm up there and I'm doing my shit.

860
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:22,100
And all of a sudden this lady in the crowd
who I'm going to go out on a limb and

861
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:27,780
say was a lesbian, you know, she had
that haircut, the whole fucking thing.

862
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,520
I know you're not,
you're not supposed to do all you need.

863
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:31,470
At least you're not supposed to
do that with lesbians. You know,

864
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,990
you can do that with other groups of
people. You know. Don't be a Brad,

865
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:40,830
don't be a Chad. You can, you can fucking
do that. But if you go the other way,

866
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,860
all of a sudden you're
an asshole. Uh, but yeah,

867
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:46,680
I mean if I had to put my life savings
on it and the same people that were

868
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:49,770
criticizing me,
if it was a life or death situation,

869
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:54,120
if you had to put money on it, you
would say this was a lesbian. Right.

870
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:58,650
Why is it pertinent to the story? Because
I'm painting a picture. All right?

871
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:03,120
And all you liberal cons out there acting
like you don't have a fucking idea in

872
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:07,620
your head when I say that,
that she was a lesbian.

873
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:10,860
You have no fucking idea what I'm saying.
What if I said it was a frat boy,

874
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:16,480
you got your boom, you got to get that
picture in your head. Right. Um, anyways,

875
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:20,010
so she sit there and I'm on
stage and she shit the whole,

876
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:24,780
like I maybe get three minutes
into my act, we'll fucking outside.

877
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,660
It's brewed and she's just staying
that she starts going, wow.

878
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,093
Wow.

879
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,440
And she's trying to get the rest
of the crowd to do it with her,

880
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,310
which they're not thankfully,
but she's fucking relentless.

881
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:44,880
And I don't know if I did a
joke that she didn't like,

882
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,300
or maybe it was that I had a deck.
I have no fucking idea.

883
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,450
Or maybe I was just an pasty you
maybe she thought I was weird looking.

884
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,360
Well, maybe she was just a comment.
I have no idea what she's doing that.

885
00:55:56,361 --> 00:56:00,260
And I'm sitting there
and I want to go off on her,

886
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,300
but I got to work clean.

887
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,420
So I actually just stopped and I
gathered myself and I said, Hey lady.

888
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:14,800
I was like, what is the problem?
Why are you chanting wine?

889
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,220
Wynonna is, why no, not,
she's going to come out here

890
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,020
at eight 30

891
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,130
no matter what she's coming
out at eight 30. Okay.

892
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:29,020
Do you think I thought all you guys came
out here to see me. I know why I'm here.

893
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,520
I'm dancing monkey boy, but blah
blah blah blah blah. And uh,

894
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:37,930
I got the crowd on my side and then
I made fun of her haircut. I had to,

895
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,980
I had to do it cause I had to make sure
I got all the Trump supporters on my

896
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:45,274
side.

897
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:50,790
I was flailing and then I got him and I
started having getting laughs and that

898
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,130
lady was pissed and she was
still chant. Why? No, no,

899
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:58,500
but now it's drowning or out with
laughs and I was winning. Oh,

900
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:03,520
redhead in the sun with
this pasty freckled back up
against the nonexistent wall

901
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,000
was turning it around

902
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,970
and then out of nowhere the crowd went
from laughing on and know where they just

903
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:12,804
went,

904
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,120
Woo.

905
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,550
All at the same time. And I couldn't
figure what the fuck happened.

906
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:18,620
I thought my fly came down.
I had no idea.

907
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:23,990
And I turned around and behind me was a
way off in the distance was a carnival

908
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,350
and there's some ride where they just
shoot you up in the fucking air, like,

909
00:57:27,351 --> 00:57:28,280
like superman.

910
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:32,270
So I'm standing there fucking finally
getting the crowd and right as this

911
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,850
starting to pay attention to me
in the way in the background.

912
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:39,800
Some guy got shot up in the fucking air
on this ride and then I kind of made fun

913
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:43,160
of that. Oh, not another hit. Ah,

914
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:46,910
another had another run scores
and we got ourselves a tie game

915
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,880
five to five,
just like that,

916
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:03,120
uh, coaches coming out to
the mound. Um, Jesus Christ.

917
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:07,790
Wow. And with deep into our
fucking bullpen already.

918
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,020
This is not looking good guys.

919
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,753
MMM.

920
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,780
Anyways, uh, so yeah,
that was a weird one.

921
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:21,160
I've done also, I've done
college gigs in a, uh,

922
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,550
sort of that area. You know, the
Walker's shame area between dorms.

923
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:31,440
I've done that. And it was also like
sort of a carnival thing set up.

924
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,650
There's always a fucking car. It was
always rides some sort of popcorn machine.

925
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,333
MMM.

926
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,010
I remember a long time ago,
this one was actually inside.

927
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,813
MMM.

928
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:52,020
It was me, Patrice, O'Neil,

929
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:56,010
Robert Kelly, Dane Cook, and Al Del Benny.

930
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:01,580
We all do in this gig.
And it was some,

931
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:04,500
some sort of Jewish thing.

932
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:08,310
I don't remember what was a
function hall and the crowd was,

933
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:12,750
was predominantly Jewish. I don't
know. It couldn't have been fucking,

934
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:16,080
they don't go to church.
Where do they go to temple?

935
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,540
I couldn't have been related to
that or they wouldn't have hired us.

936
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:21,150
I don't know what it was,
but all I know is we were up there

937
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,113
and

938
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:30,350
none of us were in the business long
enough to recognize like we will go,

939
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:32,390
why is this microphone so small?

940
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:35,000
Like you could hold it
with just your two fingers.

941
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,500
I remember our went up there first go,

942
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:39,180
and this is the smallest
microphone I've ever seen.

943
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,080
Then he put it in his mouth and
started humming or whatever,

944
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:44,420
and people laughed and I was like,
oh my God, I got to hold that thing.

945
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:46,970
Now I've got to go up after
him. Right. So we did the whole,

946
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:50,990
we did the whole fucking show.
I remember when Patrice got up there,

947
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:53,840
he was holding it with his
big fucking fat fingers.

948
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:56,060
Just holding this little
thing is three things.

949
00:59:56,061 --> 00:59:59,660
Like he was holding a teacup and a,

950
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:04,010
it wasn't until years later when I did
my first TV Gig that I realized it was a

951
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:06,650
lapel Mike and none of us knew.

952
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:10,190
Just clip it on your shirt and then just
walk around like you're doing the one

953
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:12,070
man show, you know, with
both hands. So we all,

954
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,850
we would like finish our act and there
was a mic stand and we would like drape

955
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:20,660
it over and then the next guy would come
up and just pick it up with his index

956
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:25,390
finger and his thumb. Um, yeah,

957
01:00:25,391 --> 01:00:27,670
I don't know. I gotta be honest
with you. All of those hell gigs,

958
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:30,160
they all just kind of, they kind of
fade away after a while. I can't,

959
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:34,210
I don't remember. I just know I've
had a bunch of shit thrown at me.

960
01:00:34,211 --> 01:00:36,970
I think I just, after a while you
just, you don't want to remember him.

961
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:39,383
MMM.

962
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,300
Yeah. I don't know. I, I've, I've done
some, I've definitely done some weird,

963
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,173
I know I've done,

964
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:51,550
I did one outside up on the
fucking west side highway.

965
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,050
There was like boats and shit

966
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,060
and all these fucking flies and stuff.
Yeah.

967
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,700
These are all starting to come
back to and was hottest shit too.

968
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,480
And I was up there and I had like a long
sleeve button down cause I just worked

969
01:01:07,481 --> 01:01:11,230
like a comedy club so they had like the
air conditioning cranking and then I

970
01:01:11,231 --> 01:01:14,280
went over and did that Gig and I was like
sweating my ass off. Yeah, I've done it.

971
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:15,041
I've done a lot of those.

972
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:19,540
That's kind of par for
the course that happens.

973
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:25,270
Um, that was a fun one though. I opened
for Wynona outside in a, in a, uh,

974
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,380
in a parking lot, parking lot, race track,

975
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:35,290
the occasional theater. I opened up for
an a parking lot in Laughlin, Nevada.

976
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:39,610
Jesus do. Why are you bringing back all
of these memories? All right. A smoothie,

977
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,850
dear bill,
years and years back you said Kevin,

978
01:01:42,851 --> 01:01:47,851
James told you the benefits of having
liquid first in the morning to get your

979
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:51,520
engine going. Kevin James. I don't
know if you get the name right.

980
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:55,630
I've only met him like once
a smoothie, water, et cetera.

981
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,850
Then a few years ago you basically said,

982
01:01:57,851 --> 01:01:59,920
fuck that because you
thought it was too much.

983
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,810
It might have read it was bad for you.
Now you're doing smoothies.

984
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:09,610
Do you think it'll stick this time?
No Pun intended. Go blend yourself.

985
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,230
Uh, well, I didn't know how to make one
healthy back then. You know what I mean?

986
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:14,891
There's a lot of them.

987
01:02:14,891 --> 01:02:18,520
It's just like you do all this stuff and
there's a bunch of sugar and shit that

988
01:02:18,521 --> 01:02:22,590
you're putting in there. Um, now
that I've been using like, um,

989
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,760
unsweetened almond milk,
almond milk, I used to hate it.

990
01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:31,230
Now I'm kind of used to it. Uh,
I got a good one for you. Uh,

991
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:36,030
one cup of almond milk.
I little am miming doing this,

992
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,073
putting this shit in.

993
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:38,840
Uh,

994
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,500
then it's like a teaspoon of cinnamon,
a frozen banana,

995
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:47,620
two tablespoons of almond,
peanut butter.

996
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:50,543
MMM.

997
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:56,430
A tablespoon of Maca powder.
Some ice,

998
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:00,930
a little bit of ice. You blend that
fucker together. It's delicious.

999
01:03:00,931 --> 01:03:04,920
Tastes like a goddamn chocolate shake
and you drink it and you have energy for

1000
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:05,754
hours.

1001
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:07,683
MMM.

1002
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,320
I gotta be,
I gotta be honest with you.

1003
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:15,300
If I actually knew enough about
nutrition and all I could do,

1004
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,740
if all I could do was just that

1005
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:18,550
mmm.

1006
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:21,610
And just do a liquid diet,
I would love to do that.

1007
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,770
I would absolutely love to do that.

1008
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,713
MMM.

1009
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:30,300
There's another one I have that's
like Kale. It says apple juice.

1010
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:31,170
That's the only thing I don't like.

1011
01:03:31,171 --> 01:03:33,660
It's apple juice and just apple
juice has a bunch of sugar in it.

1012
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:37,500
So I went to the like, this is fucking
hilarious. It's is health food store.

1013
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,200
But like,
they don't like gays.

1014
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:46,590
Funniest fucking thing. I was like,
how did those things go together?

1015
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:51,120
It's usually like, hey man, here's some
vitamins. And everybody's like, everybody,

1016
01:03:51,121 --> 01:03:55,980
man, uh, who the fuck would it?
Whoever saw that comment. Um,

1017
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,290
um, so yeah, I would love
to do that. Like, uh, two,

1018
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:05,970
she saw some of the shit that I'm fucking
eating. They'll look at this fucking,

1019
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,830
I Miss Boston.
Just saw a guy,

1020
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:11,910
he had a red sox like knitted cap on
with the Tom Brady Jersey in a glove

1021
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:17,010
sitting right along the third
base line. Fucking hilarious. Um,

1022
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:19,440
I would love to do that.
Um,

1023
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:23,790
I like vegetarian and Vegan meals,
but I also still like steak,

1024
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:25,860
but I know if I combined
like all of that shit,

1025
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:29,790
I can still eat a little bit like
John Wayne and not have a problem.

1026
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:35,970
Um, all right. You disrespected miles
Davis. You can't. All right. What is this?

1027
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:39,630
Hey Bill, in season two,
episode four of F is for family.

1028
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,590
There is an album cover parroting
the miles Davis kind of blue.

1029
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:47,280
In the background of one scene
in the corner of the cover,

1030
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:52,200
there appears to be a label of
blue note records in this case,

1031
01:04:52,201 --> 01:04:54,540
black note records.
Uh,

1032
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:59,400
these two instances of factuality
are factually incorrect.

1033
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:04,590
Dude, how much you fucking
jazz guys, you know,

1034
01:05:04,591 --> 01:05:05,880
back in the fucking day,

1035
01:05:05,881 --> 01:05:10,470
I used to host this show
called the jazz oasis on, on,

1036
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,260
uh,
the fuck was it?

1037
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:19,880
88.9 wers at Emerson College.

1038
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,700
And I used to find,

1039
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:26,750
I didn't know fucking anything about jazz
and I'd asked You fucking assholes to

1040
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:30,170
call in requests and none of
you motherfuckers would call in.

1041
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,950
All you would do is wait for me to play
a record and then all you fucking cunts

1042
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:37,070
would get on the phone and call me and
be like, fuck you play in that four, man.

1043
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:40,680
It ain't jazz. The fuck is that
dude. Ain't Jay's mother fucker.

1044
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:45,560
All you fucking guys can go fuck yourself.
Go sit on your fucking horn. All right.

1045
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:46,640
First of all,

1046
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:53,740
did you enjoy the show?
Did you enjoy the episode?

1047
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:57,540
Listen to this ass. Those are factually
incorrect. Kind of blue was released,

1048
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:01,540
released on Columbia records.
Nobody likes labels,

1049
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:05,590
record labels more than these fucking
jazz people and Miles Davis at the time

1050
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,680
had not recorded for blue note in a
number of years you might want to get your

1051
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:13,030
facts straight.
You believe this shit.

1052
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:16,810
If you want to reference the
greatest jazz record of all time,

1053
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:20,320
it may behoove you to risk respect,

1054
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:25,270
possibly the greatest musician of the
20th century by simply getting some simple

1055
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:28,720
factual information correct on your show.
You're dumb cunt.

1056
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,820
Tony Williams is probably ashamed of
you. Let's be honest. All right, sir.

1057
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:40,020
I'm going to walk you back through
all your bullshit. Okay? First of all,

1058
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:46,650
the reason why it didn't say Bluenote or
Columbia records is because we would've

1059
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:49,660
had, we would've had to
get permission to do that.

1060
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:55,990
That's also the reason why the song kind
of sounded like kind of blue but wasn't

1061
01:06:56,770 --> 01:07:00,730
because we don't have the
fucking budget to use that music.

1062
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,940
All right? That's why, that's
why it looked like that.

1063
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,860
Okay, and then secondly, Tony Williams
didn't play on that record. You dumb. Fuck

1064
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,050
I then for the record, I thought it
was Philly, Joe Jones. I looked it up.

1065
01:07:18,051 --> 01:07:20,180
It was like some Guy
Jimmy carb or something.

1066
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:23,030
I hope I got his fucking name wrong.
Does he can blow another gasket?

1067
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,870
Fuck all you jazz guys. You
stupid cunt. You're not,

1068
01:07:26,871 --> 01:07:28,490
you're not making an animated show.

1069
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:33,320
You have no fucking idea how much money
music costs. That's why we did that.

1070
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:37,580
Okay. We weren't disrespecting
miles Davis. Okay,

1071
01:07:37,581 --> 01:07:41,900
so why don't you take all your words like
behoove stick him in your clarinet and

1072
01:07:41,901 --> 01:07:45,590
shove it up your ass.
You pretentious fucking cunt.

1073
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:50,360
Ah, did that feel good? He didn't even,

1074
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,670
you can get the right
drummer after giving me shit.

1075
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,770
He didn't even get the
right fucking drummer.

1076
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,410
Tony Williams was part of the second grade
quintet. I do know that, but I don't,

1077
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,630
I don't know shit about jazz.

1078
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:07,070
But I do know that the reason why we
did that was because it would, we,

1079
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:08,270
okay.

1080
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:10,910
Columbia records and balloon up probably
wouldn't have given us permission.

1081
01:08:10,911 --> 01:08:11,511
And if they did,

1082
01:08:11,511 --> 01:08:14,930
it would have cost us more money than
it costs to fucking make the whole,

1083
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:19,390
we would've been screwed.
That's why sir. Okay.

1084
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:24,070
So we didn't disrespect them. We
tipped our fucking capital. Um,

1085
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,680
by the way, do you play any
instrument? Are you in a
band? All right. Anger issues.

1086
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:33,360
This could not come at a
better time. Anger issues. Uh,

1087
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,870
I'm gonna have anger issues if we don't
get out of this fucking any. Oh, we did.

1088
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:40,070
We finally got out of the gate.
Um,

1089
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,760
dear Billy red top dear
bill. Bill red top. Okay.

1090
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:46,250
I had anger issues when I was younger.
Oh my God.

1091
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:47,390
Is this going to be a ray of light?

1092
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:51,680
I had a good family but I grew up in a
neighborhood that exposed me to shit I

1093
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:53,510
shouldn't have seen.
Uh,

1094
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:57,920
as a defense I started
reacting to everything with
anger and it carried on into

1095
01:08:57,921 --> 01:08:58,790
my adult life.

1096
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:03,710
Did I write this in a
drunken state and I forgot,

1097
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:04,790
cause this sounds like me.

1098
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:09,290
I've read lots of books and even wrote
a few unpublished ones on the topic

1099
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:13,550
myself. See you actually worked
on it. I commend you for that.

1100
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,100
Yeah.

1101
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,460
I just like try for a few days
and then I just go back to

1102
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,250
what I know anyways. It kept me
from being the happiest I could be.

1103
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:26,160
It didn't ruin my life,
but it's kept me from enjoying things.

1104
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:30,600
I had a bad habit of looking at people
who are happy and finding reasons not to

1105
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:33,730
like them. Oh, I don't do that. I
think I did that in my twenties, but I,

1106
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:38,760
I'm not like that. Uh, even people I was
close to, which may sound strange. Nope,

1107
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,500
I did that a long time ago.
And then I've also had that done to me.

1108
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:47,700
Um,
I remember when I bought my old truck,

1109
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:52,520
68 f 100 short bed. This guy was like,
what'd you get? A truck? Huh? Okay.

1110
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,570
You going to put stuff back there?

1111
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:59,190
Just like annoyed because everybody was
looking at my truck going do that thing

1112
01:09:59,191 --> 01:10:02,790
is so fucking Badass. Nobody has that out
here. This thing's the shit, you know.

1113
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:03,931
Anyways,

1114
01:10:03,931 --> 01:10:08,010
I've been catching up on your podcasts
over the last year and I've heard you go

1115
01:10:08,011 --> 01:10:13,011
from being much very angry to still
pretty being pretty Angalee but certainly

1116
01:10:14,651 --> 01:10:18,040
less angry than before. I'm
glad you've made strides. Well,

1117
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:21,910
not on this podcast because I can tell
you the most important thing I gained

1118
01:10:21,911 --> 01:10:23,140
from reprogramming,

1119
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:28,470
my immediate reaction to everything
from anger to observance is time.

1120
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:35,440
Uh, I'm not smart enough to only read
that sentence once I got to do this again.

1121
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:40,180
Uh, I can tell you the most
important thing I gained
from Ray crow reprogramming,

1122
01:10:40,181 --> 01:10:44,170
my immediate reaction to everything
from anger to observance is time.

1123
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,073
What does that mean?

1124
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,610
You got time back or something or you,

1125
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:56,650
you're enjoying your life more because
you don't have to spend so much of it

1126
01:10:56,651 --> 01:11:00,550
apologizing for what you did an hour
ago. Anyways. It's sneaky though.

1127
01:11:00,551 --> 01:11:04,420
Being angry can waste a whole day and
you can do things while still being

1128
01:11:04,421 --> 01:11:09,250
agitated, but you don't feel like
you're completely unaccomplished. Yeah,

1129
01:11:09,251 --> 01:11:14,070
I don't, I don't stay angry for a whole
day. Uh, I just do like in spurts.

1130
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:16,960
Then it goes all the way up to the top.

1131
01:11:16,961 --> 01:11:18,910
Then it come back down away because
what the Hell is wrong with you?

1132
01:11:18,911 --> 01:11:22,240
I've got your right. Sorry.
You know, I'm just trying to,

1133
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:24,850
that's fucking doing my
work. Uh, you still ran your,

1134
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,880
your errands and did your jobs
and fed your kid, is Cetera,

1135
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:32,080
but you probably ignoring things you
could be doing to advance yourself.

1136
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,390
Uh, you're likely not appreciating
those. Who are we talking about here?

1137
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,300
Is this me? My goodness.
I've stern talking to um,

1138
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,010
or you just a hypothetical you,

1139
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:45,190
but you're probably ignoring things
you could be doing to advance yourself.

1140
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:50,200
You're likely not appreciating those
around you who make your life good because

1141
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,770
you are focused on people who make your
life terrible or projecting things on

1142
01:11:53,771 --> 01:11:56,920
people that aren't there.
Um,

1143
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,730
I don't do any of that
with anybody in my life.

1144
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:05,530
I do that with the people that are
in power. I do that a lot. You know,

1145
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:10,630
like I was all ready to fucking talk
about everybody at best buy this is like

1146
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:13,240
two podcasts in a row and
they've done nothing wrong.

1147
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,370
It's just been me needing to make
a couple adjustments anyways.

1148
01:12:18,371 --> 01:12:23,140
My biggest regret in all my anger years
was snapping at people who are genuinely

1149
01:12:23,141 --> 01:12:25,930
good people who didn't
have that angry gene.

1150
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:30,730
It's like being six foot one, two 15
kicking the hell out of a small kid.

1151
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:35,500
They can't defend themselves because if
they do, they become the mania, Qr, Hor,

1152
01:12:35,501 --> 01:12:39,970
horrible position to put someone in.
Hope you crossed the finish line to zen?

1153
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,150
Um, yeah. I mean, I think I'm,

1154
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:47,920
I'm somewhere in the middle of
angry in Zen, believe it or not,

1155
01:12:47,921 --> 01:12:52,780
as much as I flip out, like
I was, I was a lot worse,

1156
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:55,540
but, uh, I don't wish bad shit on people

1157
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:02,620
and, um, I don't resent anybody. I don't,

1158
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:07,090
I just don't want things.
Things make me freak up.

1159
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,370
Anything tech technology
related makes me flip up or,

1160
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:14,380
you know what's funny is
if I get something old,

1161
01:13:14,381 --> 01:13:18,430
I have all the patients in the world,
you know,

1162
01:13:18,431 --> 01:13:22,200
like if my old truck won't start,
I actually, you know, I mean,

1163
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,480
I'm not going to say I enjoy it,
but I,

1164
01:13:23,481 --> 01:13:26,410
I find that the process of
figuring out what's wrong with it,

1165
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:29,920
enjoyable and then learning,
you know,

1166
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:34,360
as the truck gets fixed, what
that was, why that happened,

1167
01:13:34,361 --> 01:13:38,410
how to prevent it in the future. Uh,
I, uh, I tell you this, you know what,

1168
01:13:38,411 --> 01:13:43,411
playing drums really helped me
getting back into playing drums and,

1169
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:46,693
uh,

1170
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,590
you know, meet and Nia, having a
kid just shit that made me happy,

1171
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,250
uh,

1172
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:58,090
has kinda gotten me to that. But my big
thing is if I could just stop snapping,

1173
01:13:58,091 --> 01:13:59,460
that's kind of what I,
I don't walk like,

1174
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,690
you know what's funny is people
actually think I am like an angry guy,

1175
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:04,270
like a walk around angry.
I don't, I just snap.

1176
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:07,443
MMM.

1177
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:12,610
I'm definitely loud and I'm
definitely fucking crazy. But, uh,

1178
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,150
I dunno, you, I'll let you guys be the,
I don't classify myself as an angry guy.

1179
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:23,650
Um, I signed, I'm talking
about my drinking. Like I
don't think I'm an alcoholic.

1180
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:29,260
I don't think I'm an angry guy. And I also
think that I can admit when I'm wrong,

1181
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:34,720
I'll fucking mess. All right.
Dilemmas, dilemmas, clarification
number one. Uh, Bill,

1182
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:39,700
last week you read my dilemma wrong.
Oh, sorry. Geez. Everybody coming at me.

1183
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:40,991
Uh,

1184
01:14:40,991 --> 01:14:45,991
you have to either score perfectly on
the sats with up to a year of studying or

1185
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:51,550
in one sitting when a game of monopoly.
Oh,

1186
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:55,510
all in one city. That means
bankrupting all the other players.

1187
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,400
Which one to save your life.

1188
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:05,160
MMM. Oh, the fucking sats.

1189
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,560
Absolutely. Those things
are, are, are pretty hard,

1190
01:15:09,561 --> 01:15:12,560
but fucking went in monopoly in
one sitting. I mean, that's just,

1191
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:18,680
I'd rather like sit down and like this
time around really pay attention in math

1192
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,250
class and find out what,
um,

1193
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:26,060
what this math is she is applied to as
opposed to just being regurgitated at me.

1194
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:31,370
Then sitting down and rolling
dice like I'm in a fucking casino,

1195
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,790
you know, I mean, Jesus Christ.
Can you imagine, you know,

1196
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:40,500
your life's on the line and you're moving
a little dog or a shoe around a board.

1197
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:43,170
I think I would much rather
leave it up to my brain.

1198
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,780
Sort of a damned if you do, damned if
you don't come on. Get underneath that.

1199
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,850
All right. You ain't got a
challenge his arm. Okay. Okay

1200
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:01,320
Man on second top of the seventh
one out. Okay. Dear Bill,

1201
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:06,150
dear, dear bill to thought
I have a dilemma for you,

1202
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:12,410
would you rather have to
fight an alligator in a water
tank with a 12 inch blade

1203
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:19,100
or fight an alligator in a room with
a 30 inch aluminum baseball bat?

1204
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:23,620
All right, well we haven't talked
about the size of the alligator.

1205
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:26,110
I'm assuming it's big
enough to kill me obviously.

1206
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,690
Well I remember a long time ago,

1207
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:34,810
I'm a cop told me if you're not going to
get a gun to get a bet because you want

1208
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:37,720
to have distance between
you and the intruder.

1209
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:42,130
So considering the intruder is
a fucking reptile pass ball,

1210
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:43,510
he goes to third.

1211
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:45,463
Yeah.

1212
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:49,020
Fuck. Um, I would uh,

1213
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:51,331
yeah,

1214
01:16:51,331 --> 01:16:56,331
I take the the baseball bat and the weird
thing about an alligator is you got to

1215
01:16:58,491 --> 01:17:02,950
come at them straight on.
Right? Or from behind.

1216
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:04,350
Okay.

1217
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:07,010
Those fucking things. You don't
want to be on the side. They, they,

1218
01:17:07,011 --> 01:17:10,490
they bite from the side.
If you're right in front of him,

1219
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,900
you're all good.
That's why all those,

1220
01:17:12,901 --> 01:17:15,710
those fucking morons that go up
and they stick their, their, their,

1221
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:19,340
their arm and the guy's mouth.
The guy.

1222
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,750
No fucking way.

1223
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:29,390
Holy Shit.
What a fucking play that was,

1224
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,530
dude. Lay down a bunt. That l to bay
guy came in. Who the fuck was that?

1225
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:40,320
Zander Bogart too. Through that
fucking ball. Who? True that ball. Oh,

1226
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:44,530
wasn't who he swung actually. Actually
it wasn't a good throw. He got him

1227
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:52,380
throw was high. He slid wide. Oh No,

1228
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:54,480
they're going to reverse
that ladies and gentlemen.

1229
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:02,450
Ah, you mother fucker. That's going
to be that. He's safe anyways. Yeah,

1230
01:18:02,451 --> 01:18:07,130
I would, I would 30 inch aluminum
bat. Wait. Yeah. Wait a minute.

1231
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,760
That's not that big.
It's only three feet.

1232
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:14,283
MMM.

1233
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:18,480
All right.
This is just is so weird.

1234
01:18:18,481 --> 01:18:21,390
I would attack the top
of his head from behind,

1235
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,850
but I'd start with this feat.

1236
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:27,290
All right.

1237
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:31,600
You know that would actually fucking
kill me to do that to a living thing like

1238
01:18:31,601 --> 01:18:35,080
that. I'd have to fucking slowly chop it
down. I had attacked the fuck things fee,

1239
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,180
although I did see that
one with that fuck on.

1240
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,370
Rogan showed that with that alligator bit,

1241
01:18:39,371 --> 01:18:41,350
the other ones leg and
just did the death row,

1242
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,470
rip the fucking things leg off and
the other one wasn't going like,

1243
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:48,790
so it was just going like,
let's,

1244
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:52,450
it just fucking down a barely bled.

1245
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:58,560
So yeah, I think, I
think you just got to a,

1246
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:04,340
I mean what I really love to do is just
sort of somehow getting on its back,

1247
01:19:04,341 --> 01:19:06,890
rub its belly. Oh, I know when I would do,

1248
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:10,700
I'd take my shirt off
and I'd cover its eyes.

1249
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,400
I've seen those guys do that.

1250
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,200
And then I would take that
fucking bat and I would just,

1251
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:22,140
why am right down on his fucking, you
know, I, I, you know, that would be it.

1252
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:26,300
I would want to kill an alligator.
I am terrified of those things,

1253
01:19:26,301 --> 01:19:31,130
but I don't live in the same world.
It does. But if it was me or him,

1254
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,600
I mean that thing has to go.

1255
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,003
MMM.

1256
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,100
I've eaten alligator though. Night
alligator. When I was in Florida,

1257
01:19:39,101 --> 01:19:42,790
it was fucking gross.
Just too Goddamn Gamey.

1258
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,370
People like guy, you know, it tastes
like chicken. It doesn't, it doesn't.

1259
01:19:48,371 --> 01:19:51,610
Chicken is fucking delicious.

1260
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:57,010
Steers are delicious.
Those are the in pigs are delicious.

1261
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:01,090
Those are the three fucking best
tasting things. Turkeys are good.

1262
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,940
They dry out though.
You know,

1263
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,970
that's what I think. Like if you
get to the upper level of, you know,

1264
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:11,580
if you have a smoker,
if you actually know how to smoke Turkey,

1265
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:16,860
how to fuck did I do an
hour and 20 minutes? I'm all
right. That's the podcast.

1266
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:20,340
I really appreciate people that tried to
help me with my temper because I would

1267
01:20:20,341 --> 01:20:23,700
like, I mean, I, I need to learn to
like how to stop fucking snapping.

1268
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,860
Um, that's the big thing. You
know, I'm not going to lie to you.

1269
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:31,830
I do ramp it up a little bit when I'm on
the podcast just to entertain you guys.

1270
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:35,130
But, uh, that is, that was pretty
legit earlier in this show. All right,

1271
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:39,060
that's the podcast here.
I'll check in on you on, um,

1272
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:42,800
on Thursday.
Go fuck yourselves at a,

1273
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,520
I have a wonderful couple of days.
