00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.880
Although crime in England’s capital was
on the decline in the mid-19th century, thanks

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.180
in part to the relatively recent formation
of the London Metropolitan Police Force in

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.990
1839, fear of crime was a persistent, reoccurring
issue thanks to a few instances of robbery

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.250
and murder, and, of course, the news media.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.550
In particular, the so-called “garrotting”
cases, where someone strangles someone else,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.330
often using their arm or a length of wire,
cord, or cloth, seemed to touch the rawest

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.420
nerve with the people of London, with the
fear of garrotting reaching a fever-pitch

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.100
in the 1860s.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.739
Exactly when enterprising ruffians first realised
that they could increase their odds of successfully

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.219
robbing a person dramatically by placing that
person in a chokehold first isn’t clear,

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.820
since many crimes back in those days often
went unreported due to a general mistrust

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.789
of the police amongst poorer folk.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.690
However, historic letters written by purported
survivors of garrotting sent to various London

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.250
newspapers date back to at least 1850.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.130
A popular theory is that the practise was
first thought up by criminals on convict ships,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.660
where guards would often use roughly applied
chokeholds to quickly knock out an aggressive

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.610
criminal, hopefully without causing any long
lasting injuries.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.800
It’s believed that this coldly efficient
method of putting someone down was picked

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.580
up by criminals who inevitably began using
it in their day-to-day criminal dealings.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.030
The weird thing about garrotting and how widely
it was reported at the time is that it doesn’t

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.670
actually appear to have been all that common;
even during the supposed height of the “garrotting

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.560
panic of 1862”.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.310
So why the panic?

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.890
As it turns out, although garrotting itself
was never a major problem in London, newspapers

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.270
from the era positively loved reporting on
it.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.259
This led to the few isolated cases that did
happen being blown way out of proportion and

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.660
reported on to such an extent that the people
of London were led to believe the streets

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.030
were filled to the brim with roving rabbles
of ruffians armed with lengths of wire.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.000
Newspapers’ coverage of garrotting exploded
in 1862 when an MP called Hugh Pilkington

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.830
was strangled and robbed of his watch on his
way home from the House of Commons.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.880
Pilkington survived, but news of the incident
was widely reported on to such an extent that

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.560
Parliament pushed through the Security from
Violence Act in 1863.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.210
Under the terms of this new act of Parliament,
criminals convicted of any violent theft could

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.720
be punished with “up to 50 lashes” along
with a hefty prison sentence.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.750
Following the attack, the police similarly
became noticeably more heavy-handed, presumably

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.460
in an attempt to reassure the public that
they were “doing something” about the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.460
problem.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.270
London’s streets were flooded with plain
clothes police officers; minor crimes, like

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.440
pickpocketing, that had previously been punished
with a small fine, suddenly became issues

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.440
for the courts.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440
anti-garrot-collar
Anti-garrotting collar

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.890
In an effort to prove that they were stomping
down on garrotting in particular, the police

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.820
also began classifying regular robberies and
even drunken brawls as instances of garrotting,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.160
to fudge their numbers.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.490
This is similar to how in the 1930s they would
often list instances of theft as “lost property”

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.360
to make it appear as though those crimes didn’t
happen as often as they actually did.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.420
By far the most ridiculous by-product of the
panic were the devices invented to dissuaded

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.060
potential garrotters.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.670
Various designs of hulking neck-collars with
large spikes were patented.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.670
A cravat with a blade sewn into the hem (meant
to either cut the attacker’s arm or the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.810
device he was using to strangle you) was also
a thing.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.170
But perhaps the greatest example of the extreme
lengths people went to back then to protect

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.650
themselves from garrotting was invented by
gun maker Henry Ball and patented in 1858-

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.710
the “Anti-Garrotter Belt Pistol”.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.110
This belt-gun was designed to be worn on the
rear.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.670
If someone was trying to strangle you from
behind, you’d discharge the weapon into

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.290
said attacker’s sensitive mid-section.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.700
This not only was a working device, but is
now considered “among the rarest of firearms

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.490
curiosa” with only a handful of specimens
known to exist today.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.330
Beyond potentially taking away the ability
of your attacker to have children, it no doubt

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.380
also left the person firing it with a nice
sized bruise and subsequent lower back pain.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.561
garrot2Although the press continued to discuss
garrotting all throughout the 1860s, actual

00:04:15.561 --> 00:04:21.359
verifiable reports of the crime dried up in
1863 right after a large amount of arrests

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.810
were made in response to the passing of the
previously mentioned Security from Violence

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.810
Act.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.500
As they do so often when a story reaches its
saturation point, eventually the newspapers

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.919
kind of forgot about garrotting and started
reporting on other types of crimes, which

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.960
unfortunately for their sales-rates didn’t
cause the same type of public panic…

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.050
That is until a few murders in a small region
of London’s East End sent the nation into

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:55.080
yet another panic when Jack the Ripper began
his reign of terror in 1888.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:06:34.800
But that’s a story for 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:07:26.900
another day.
