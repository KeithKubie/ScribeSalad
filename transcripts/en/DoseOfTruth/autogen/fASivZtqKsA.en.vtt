00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
city the city won't be destroyed
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.920
city the city won't be destroyed
and that that's not very many in this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
and that that's not very many in this
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.690
and that that's not very many in this
city so there's an interesting idea

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
city so there's an interesting idea
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880
city so there's an interesting idea
there which is that there there doesn't

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
there which is that there there doesn't

have to be that many people in a group

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
have to be that many people in a group
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.290
have to be that many people in a group
who have their act together but zero is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
who have their act together but zero is
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.229
who have their act together but zero is
the wrong number and if it's zero then

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
the wrong number and if it's zero then
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.429
the wrong number and if it's zero then
then we're seriously in trouble and I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
then we're seriously in trouble and I
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.260
then we're seriously in trouble and I
think that goes along with the idea of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
think that goes along with the idea of
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.179
think that goes along with the idea of
the Pareto principle in economics -

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
the Pareto principle in economics -
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.710
the Pareto principle in economics -
which is that it's a small minority of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
which is that it's a small minority of
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.300
which is that it's a small minority of
people who do most of the productive

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
people who do most of the productive
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.690
people who do most of the productive
work in any given domain but so so a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
work in any given domain but so so a
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.480
work in any given domain but so so a
small number of of properly behaving

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
small number of of properly behaving
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.070
small number of of properly behaving
people might have enough of an impact to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
people might have enough of an impact to
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.660
people might have enough of an impact to
keep everything moving and that might

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
keep everything moving and that might
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.700
keep everything moving and that might
also that might actually be true but it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
also that might actually be true but it
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.800
also that might actually be true but it
can't fall below some crucial level and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
can't fall below some crucial level and
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990
can't fall below some crucial level and
I do think that we're in some danger of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
I do think that we're in some danger of
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609
I do think that we're in some danger of
allowing it to fall below some crucial

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
allowing it to fall below some crucial
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.219
allowing it to fall below some crucial
level because our society seems to be at

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
level because our society seems to be at
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.160
level because our society seems to be at
war in some ways against the idea of the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
war in some ways against the idea of the
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.859
war in some ways against the idea of the
individual and individual character per

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
individual and individual character per
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.659
individual and individual character per
