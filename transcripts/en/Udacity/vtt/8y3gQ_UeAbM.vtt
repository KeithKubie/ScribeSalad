00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.828
Well let's see for Melissa's car
343 miles divided by 15 gallons.

00:00:04.828 --> 00:00:09.220
Well 343 divided by 15 is

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.627
22.8666 repeating.

00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:18.275
Okay. Okay. So I'm just going to call
that round up to 23 miles per gallon.

00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:21.035
And for Shanice,
well we could do the same thing.

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:24.075
With 300 divided by 12 is exactly 25.

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:26.945
So she gets 25 miles per gallon.
