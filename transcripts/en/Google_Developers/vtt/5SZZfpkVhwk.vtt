[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:05.920
TIM SNEATH:
Hopefully, you've now

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.960
seen how Flutter is beautiful,
fast, productive, and open.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.960
You've seen how designers and
developers can collaborate

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.210
to build native mobile apps.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.390
You've seen how the ecosystem
extends Flutter with plugins

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.340
from companies like Square.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.570
And you've seen tools like
2Dimensions Flare and Nevercode

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.970
that amplify the
power of Flutter.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.369
But we're not quite done.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.860
Flutter was not conceived as
an SDK for iOS and Android.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.600
Our vision for Flutter
is to be a portable UI

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.890
toolkit that can go wherever
you need to paint pixels.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.670
The Flutter engine is
inherently cross-platform,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.710
and it can be embedded
in all kinds of hardware.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.080
Just last week, we
shared an example

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.430
of porting Flutter to
run on Raspberry Pi,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.130
running directly on
the Broadcom hardware

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.440
rather than using an
intermediary layer

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.620
like Linux or X11.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.950
We believe Flutter is a useful
building block for these kinds

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.960
of embedded scenarios.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.050
And perhaps in the future, we'll
see Flutter powering things

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.415
like automotive displays or
other IoT kinds of devices.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.400
Another very practical
example of how

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.710
we are already
going beyond mobile

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.530
is Flutter Desktop Embedding.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.170
This is an open
source project that

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.822
enables Flutter apps to run
on Mac, Linux, and Windows.

00:01:36.822 --> 00:01:38.780
We've been working on
Flutter Desktop Embedding

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.280
in the open for
a few months now,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.110
and we're pretty happy with
how it's coming on together.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.360
This lets you do
things like take

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.300
your basic starter
application that you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.020
get when you create a Flutter
project and run it on a Mac.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.080
So here's the usual app here,
and you can imagine, you know,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.990
you can [? plus ?] and see
how the number increments.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.290
And in fact, when we were
putting this presentation

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.390
together, we were
thinking, how could we

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.380
make our slides as
beautiful as possible?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.610
So we built the entire
presentation in Flutter.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.610
Everything you've
seen so far has

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.820
been run on the Mac
implementation of Flutter.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.910
The app has been built by
a company called Very Good

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.990
Ventures, who are a New
York-based mobile studio who

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.560
exclusively focus on developing
beautiful Flutter experiences.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.800
We plan to open source
this software soon.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.580
But that's not all.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.600
There is one other
place we'd like

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.110
to go with Flutter that really
demonstrates the groundbreaking

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.710
potential of this technology.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.470
And you know,
before I get there,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.062
I have to take a moment--

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:10.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.160
--to talk about Dart because
as well as being a really

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.750
well-designed language, it's a
versatile platform for Flutter.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.530
Dart doesn't just compile
to native ARM code,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.740
but also compiles to tight,
production-ready JavaScript

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.720
code.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.310
So I want to give you an
early glimpse of something

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.710
we're working on in the labs.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.070
To be clear, this is
a technology preview.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.590
We're not shipping
any code today.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.660
We're calling this Hummingbird.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.670
And it's a port of
Flutter that runs

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.469
on the modern
standards-based web.

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:56.892
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.770
I'm going to show you a little
demo of Hummingbird now.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.310
Here's a simple mobile
app that we've been

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.040
running on an Android tablet.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.779
It's an implementation of
the 15-tile sliding puzzle

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.730
that I suspect we
all know pretty well.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.210
You know, I can move tiles
around and I can auto-play it.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.710
We've done the usual
Flutter things.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.210
We've added a little
bit of styling

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.480
to it to make it look beautiful,
and so on and so forth.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.130
But I'm going to open Chrome
and browse to this page.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.500
And everything
you're seeing here

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.420
is Flutter running on
the desktop web browser.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.890
Everything you're seeing here.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.313
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.810
Everything you're seeing here
is standards-based content.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.350
HTML, DOM, Canvas,
JavaScript-- there's

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.040
no black box here any more
than any other web content.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.130
Importantly, it's
the same Flutter code

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.950
running in this browser
as on the phone.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.690
We haven't had to change the
codes to get it to run here.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.710
We've still got some
optimization work to do,

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.010
but you can see that we're
getting 60 frames per second

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.420
for this scenario across the
current generation of devices.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.580
And because this is the web,
I can even turn it into a PWA

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.674
if I want to thanks to the
great work from the Chrome team.

00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:32.590
So that's Hummingbird.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.864
What do you think?

00:05:33.864 --> 00:05:37.322
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.160
Again, this is early days for
this experimental product.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.140
Our Hummingbird, you might
say, is still learning to fly.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.060
In the meantime, we are
publishing right now

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.790
a blog article that describes
more of the technical details

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.590
behind Hummingbird.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.710
And we'll have a lot more to
share at next year's Google I/O

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.470
conference.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.570
So portable, high
quality UI has been

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.120
the holy grail for front
end developers for decades.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.830
And over the course of
the last hour or so, I

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.340
hope you've seen why we think
Flutter has the potential

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.300
to transform how all
manner of UIs are built.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.840
This is not just
about iOS and Android.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.800
This is about building
beautiful user experiences

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.110
on any platform.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.800
We're excited about our mission,
and we hope you are, too.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.260
So to close, I want
to introduce you

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.990
to someone who's played a
pivotal role in the Flutter

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.460
project.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.310
Eric Seidel is one of the
co-founders of the Flutter

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.590
project and he's going
to end this presentation

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.840
with a few final thoughts.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840
Eric, thank you so much.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.006
ERIC SEIDEL: Thank you, Tim.

00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:58.769
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.260
Couple of my colleagues and
started this project at Google

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.510
over four years ago.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.910
We just wanted to make
development better.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.570
We wanted to make user
experiences better.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.380
And these are themes
that many of us

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.010
had worked on for years as
part of the Chrome project.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.950
But we felt that within
the constraints of the web,

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.450
we couldn't get
there fast enough.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.780
So we started experiments to
see if we could make something

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.650
radically better for both
users and all the teams that

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.210
develop for them.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.130
Those experiments
became Flutter.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.940
So how we got here
was a bit interesting.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.100
It took a little while.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.510
But we felt a radical
approach was required.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.630
If we were going to break
from existing systems

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.340
and build a whole
new way to develop,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.480
we knew that was going
to take a long time.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.960
But we saw this as an
important long-term investment,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.570
not just for my team,
but also for Google.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.930
So as we were starting, we
talked to lots of developers.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.930
We sat down and made many,
many lists of problems

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.390
that we heard and
wanted to solve.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.410
I think it's worth looking back
at at least the four big areas

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.390
that we set out to solve.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:26.041
And you've heard some
about these today.

00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:27.790
So the first was that
we wanted to make it

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.250
easy to build beautiful things.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.720
And because, again, this
was a long-term bet,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.250
Flutter had to make
it easy not just

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.559
to make the most beautiful
things available today,

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.610
but also had to be flexible
enough and powerful enough

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.350
to build the most
beautiful things being

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.475
designed for tomorrow.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.830
The second was that
we wanted to make

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:57.150
it easy to boost consistent,
reliable performance.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.390
We saw developers
struggle with this

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.390
consistently on other
platforms and we

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.610
wanted to make it
easy to deliver

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.910
a really smooth
experience at 60 frames

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.110
a second, 120 frames a
second, 240 frames a second,

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.000
whatever the underlying
device could do.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.150
Third, we really wanted
to improve the developer

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.300
experience.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.659
Develop productivity
has-- you know, again,

00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:25.950
if we're making a long-term
bet, developer productivity

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.780
had to be at least as good as
the best available that day.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.520
And so far, honestly, we've
far exceeded my expectations

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.350
with now sub-second,
stateful hot reload.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.560
And fourth, we needed to build
a thing that could go wherever

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.750
Google needed it to go.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.130
It had to be open.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.600
It had to be extensible.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.630
It had to be flexible to go
to all the places and all

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.240
the devices.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.290
Run on all the
hardware, the software,

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.877
all the crazy things that
Google was building then

00:10:00.877 --> 00:10:01.710
and is building now.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:09.380
We spent many, many months
working with a few brave

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.230
early customers.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.910
And many times in
response to customer

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.670
needs we rewrote large
swaths of the system.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.390
But we always kept our eyes
on these long-term goals.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.220
In the end, it was
a lot of effort.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.060
Still is a lot of effort.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.790
But I think the results
speak for themselves.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.450
The many apps that
we've shipped--

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.150
or that we've seen
shipped, rather--

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.680
the success stories
we've heard continue

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.862
to tell me that we
focused on the right areas

00:10:37.862 --> 00:10:39.070
and are getting good results.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.950
Which brings us all to today.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.990
So this, today, our
announcement of 1.0

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.770
is obviously a major
milestone for the project,

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.670
and for the community, and for
the many teams who have worked

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.780
for years to get us here.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.860
You saw today how Flutter is
already enabling developers

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.760
all over the world to deliver
beautiful apps to hundreds

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.140
of millions of people
throughout the globe.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.040
But this is also
just the beginning.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.630
Flutter is Google's
portable UI toolkit.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.390
It is highly portable and
already works on many form

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.590
factors beyond phones.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.464
You saw it used today on
desktops for our slides.

00:11:24.464 --> 00:11:26.630
You may have seen some of
the many articles floating

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.088
around the internet of people
taking Flutter and running it

00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:32.380
on gigantic things or
little tiny things.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.660
And you even saw today some of
our experiments with running

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.990
Flutter on the web.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.260
So if I look
forward a few years,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.810
I see Flutter running
in a ton more places.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.390
So finally, and really, the
whole reason why I'm up here,

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.488
is to say a big thank you.

00:11:52.488 --> 00:11:55.946
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.020
I want to say personally
thank you to so many

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.440
for working with us for
so long to get here,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.870
particularly those
who tried Flutter.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.670
Some of you bet on
Flutter very early

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.800
on before it even
was called Flutter.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.490
I also want to say thank you for
all the hundreds of suggestions

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.540
and bug reports that this
community receives every month

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.870
from those listening.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.730
And finally, of
course, thank you

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.280
to those tuning in,
whether via one of our,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.910
I think it's over 150
now, viewing parties

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:52.190
around the globe, via
Twitter, via the livestream,

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.317
and of course, to all
of you here in person.

00:12:55.317 --> 00:12:57.150
So thank you for taking
time out of your day

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.620
to celebrate with us.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.100
And fittingly, we're going
to close today's presentation

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.435
not with us, but with you.

00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:06.660
Flutter has always
been and always will

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.250
be a community effort,
built together in the open.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.200
No one company or
one team can reach

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.420
all of the places we
want Flutter to go.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.420
So we close with our hats
off to that community.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.260
The stories like we're about to
show you give us the motivation

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.560
to continue each
day in this mission.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.670
Thank you.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.120
