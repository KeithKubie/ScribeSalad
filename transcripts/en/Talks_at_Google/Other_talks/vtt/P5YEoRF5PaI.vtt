00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:03.440
LISA: Hi, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.940
Welcome.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.125
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.480
Today, we're presenting a
talk by Professor Tom Nazario

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.480
on his recently published book,
"Living on a Dollar a Day."

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.670
Professor Nazario is a
personal friend of mine

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.060
as well as an associate
professor at USF.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.370
He has done a significant
amount of world travel,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.150
looking at the
plight of children.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.930
He has spoken to a number of
agencies including the World

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.830
Health Council.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.760
And he'll tell you more
about all of the things

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.200
that he has done with regards
to the plight of children.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.470
This book was definitely
a labor of love.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.310
He's going to tell
you about the places

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.050
that they went, the
photos that they've taken,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.130
and what we, as a
group and as a society,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.560
can do to start helping with
the plight of the extremely poor

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.490
in the world.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.070
So it's my pleasure to introduce
Professor Nazario to you today.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.934
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.520
TOM NAZARIO: So
thank you for coming.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.515
Let me put this here.

00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:23.072
And thank you, Lisa,
for inviting me.

00:01:23.072 --> 00:01:24.780
Lisa has been, actually,
a friend of ours

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.680
for about five years, and
she donates to my foundation.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.240
So it's always so
important and so nice

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.809
to have friends like Lisa.

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:33.975
Let me mention a few things.

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:37.880
The point is that I
do run a foundation.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.940
I also teach law.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.997
I write several books
every year and get

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:43.580
involved in a lot
of different things.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.580
But this is actually a
recent project of mine.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.420
I run a foundation called
The Forgotten International.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.940
And we run it out
of San Francisco

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.280
and have an office
here in Palo Alto.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.820
And at The Forgotten
International,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.910
we do four things.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.770
We give away mini-grants
to indigenous organizations

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.751
all over the world.

00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:04.250
But largely, in
about seven or eight

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.840
countries is where we
concentrate most of our work.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.187
We give grants to
organizations that are simply

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:12.520
trying to lift people out of
poverty, particularly women

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.480
and children.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.330
And we've been doing
that for, again,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.510
about six or seven years.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.700
Presently, I think,
we fund about 37

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.600
different organizations.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.180
So that money comes
from a list of donors

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.150
that get involved in
our work every year.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.170
And but for them, we wouldn't
be able to do what we do.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.940
Second thing that we do is
that we send young people,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.720
like yourselves, to different
parts of the world where they

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.720
do work for at least
two months a year,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.840
and they work for
indigenous organizations.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.411
They can do-- it's basically
technical assistance

00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:46.910
because a lot of
these organizations

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.540
not only need money, but they
need technical assistance.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.250
So sometimes, you
build a website.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.840
Sometimes, you teach English.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.620
Sometimes, you do
other kinds of things

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.480
at these organizations that
help these organizations get

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.290
from a real rudimentary level
to maybe that next level where

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.270
they can attract
some large funding

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.090
and actually do what's
considerable amount of work.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.290
So but these are kind
of the Mother Teresas

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.370
of the world, the little people
who care and give so much

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.870
of their time, so
much of their love

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.700
to help the poorest of the poor.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.200
Well, we come and help
them do their work.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.880
So that's where we
send our interns.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.890
The next thing we do is we
send supplies around the world.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.350
We send things like clothing.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.260
We send things like shoes,
shirts, school supplies,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.160
computers, medical supplies
to places around the world

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.640
who, frankly, these places
have been forgotten.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.610
They are not the places
that have recently

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.860
been hit by a typhoon.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.890
They're not the places that
have experienced earthquake.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.900
They're just places-- various
kinds of pockets of the world--

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.560
little villages
that have nothing.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.797
They have nothing.

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:53.130
They don't have a decent school.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.610
They don't have a decent toilet.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.570
They don't have any
kind of medical care.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.290
And those are the
places that we go

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.750
to because the places that, in
fact, get hit by the typhoons,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.250
though they need an
extraordinary amount of help,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.080
they get that through
the media, and they

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.621
get millions and
millions of dollars.

00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:11.690
We go to places
that have nothing.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.570
So the last thing
that we do is we

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.710
try to bring some attention
to the world's poor.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.870
Just so you know,
at present, there

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.630
are 1.1 billion people living
on this planet on less than $1

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.480
a day.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.810
That's almost one sixth
of the world's population.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.060
And if you kick that up to $2 a
day, that's 2.3 billion people,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.240
and that's one third of
the world's population.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.990
So our brothers and sisters
out there are extremely poor.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.200
And most of them have
a lot of difficulty

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.549
getting through a simple day.

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:56.090
Those are the kinds
of people that we

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.880
try to help through
The Forgotten.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.891
And we try to bring
attention to how

00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:03.390
they live the struggles they
have, the challenges they have,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.740
the dreams they have
to people around

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.790
the world who actually
have the resources

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.810
and maybe the time to help them.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.140
Why don't we get ready
for the Pierce Brosnan?

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.070
In putting together this
book, one of our funders

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.210
is the actor Pierce Brosnan.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.790
And he decided to do
a little piece for us

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.130
on, basically, this project.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.250
And the fact that we-- well,
about six or seven months

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.020
from now, we'll be
releasing a documentary

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.000
based on the making this book.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.490
And just so you know,
we traveled to these 10

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.570
countries-- some of
the poorest countries

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.110
in the world-- on 4 continents.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.550
We visited thousands
of individuals.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.830
We captured the stories
of about 50 individuals

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.060
and/or their families who
live on less than $1 a day.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.930
And we told their
stories about how

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.100
they get through that day
in photographs and in words.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.450
Now, the photographs
in this book-- and I

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.950
will be signing
books for anyone who

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.901
would like a book outside
in a few minutes--

00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:12.400
but the photographs
in the book were

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.010
taken by a Pulitzer
Prize-winning photographer.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.180
They are absolutely beautiful.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.820
They've already
won several awards.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.350
And they're quite compelling.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.000
In the process of
making this book,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.720
Renee Byer, who's
our photographer,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.580
traveled, as I
said, 10 countries

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.310
and took 15,000
photographs-- 225 of them

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.850
ended up in the book.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.600
So we went through a
large editing process

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.470
to get these pictures in there.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.690
And the stories are told in
and around the photographs.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.450
And so when you
see a photograph,

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.707
the story is told around it.

00:06:44.707 --> 00:06:46.790
And, of course, there's a
lot of stuff in the book

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.760
just about poverty in general.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.600
What are the causes?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.950
What are the fixes?

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.950
What does it mean in
the person's life?

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.585
So let's see this
quick video from Pierce

00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:00.000
on what we discovered
around the world.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.620
So I wanted to spend a
moment talking about some

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.340
of the actual scenes
and the people

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.790
that you saw in that video just
because everybody that you saw

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.790
in that video, there's a
story behind their lives

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.680
that's quite important, quite
compelling, and probably worth

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.860
telling to people
like us who don't have

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.980
an awful lot of experience
with individuals

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.870
who live their kinds of lives.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.390
Let's see if I can
get this to work.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.570
Now, I'm only going to tell
a few stories because I

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.290
want to show a few
other videos today.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.290
But in Bolivia,
we met this woman.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:45.020
And you saw her picture very,
very quickly on that video.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.940
Now, she works in the hills of
a mountainside in the Bolivian

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.060
Alps.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.880
And she is a subsistence farmer.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.910
And by the way, most
of the world's poor--

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.160
about 55% of the poorest
people in the world

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.200
are, in fact,
subsistence farmers.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.850
Most of them are women.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.790
And most of them produce,
well, actually a little bit

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.140
more than half of all the
agriculture in the world

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.670
to feed the world.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.820
So they do a huge
service to the world.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.040
But they work very, very
hard, often on lands

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.550
that they don't own, often
on a sharecropping system,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.360
and nevertheless, live
on almost nothing.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.520
She, of course, doesn't own
the land that she works.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.740
She is 80 years old.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:36.299
She's been working this
land for some 50, 60 years.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.880
And she was very angry at us.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.309
She's very angry
at us because she

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.860
said the Western
world has actually

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.930
destroyed her crop because
we in the Western world

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.770
have produced most
of the warming that's

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.200
taking place in the world.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.050
And as a result, she gets far
less rain, far less water,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.340
far less of anything that
she needs to grow her crop.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.050
And now, her beans
are all dried up.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.500
And her wheat doesn't
mature the way it used to.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.510
As a result, she had
to sell her animals.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.670
And now, she is
totally impoverished.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.040
She had five children,
but they all moved away.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.480
She lives in a house with
no heat, with no phone,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.460
with no electricity.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.970
And in the evening, if
she needs any help at all,

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.920
she has to walk to a
neighbor's house a mile

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.970
away and use one
of their phones.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:33.300
She, in fact, may have
already died-- I don't know.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.317
But look at her hands.

00:09:35.317 --> 00:09:37.525
One of the things that I've
discovered over the years

00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:40.190
in traveling around the
world for the United Nations,

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.330
for Human Rights Watch
is that I've never

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:49.300
found a woman who doesn't
work so, so hard-- never.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.320
Certainly, her hands
are evidence of that.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.450
In Peru.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.240
I wanted to hone in on Peru
because she actually has

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.340
the second most
popular occupation that

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:05.020
the world's poor endeavour
in, and that's recycling.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.900
She recycles every
day with her kids.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.540
And the one on her back is
actually her grandchild.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.560
She had six children;
however, two sons

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.740
were taken away by a father
who abused her brutally.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.660
She remarried.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.810
He abused her.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.870
Now, she lives all
alone with her children.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.930
And this is how she
gets through her day--

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:30.920
walking the streets
of Lima, Peru,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.280
and collecting whatever she can.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.460
She walks those streets
for about 14 hours a day,

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.650
spends a few hours
getting her kids to bed,

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.470
and then brings in whatever
she's been able to find

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.340
to a recycling center--
on the average,

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.950
probably makes somewhere
about $2.10 a day.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.044
That's for a family of six.

00:10:51.044 --> 00:10:52.460
Her children, of
course, help her.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.043
And these children
do not go to school

00:10:54.043 --> 00:10:55.730
nor will they likely
ever go to school.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.660
This is at the end of the day
at the recycling center, turning

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.090
in whatever they've
been able to find.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.160
And this is their life.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.700
That's when she gets paid.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.430
She then takes the kids home.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.720
They live in a one-room
little apartment--

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.230
no kitchen, no nothing.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.650
They eat outdoors, or they
go to borrow some food

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.730
from the neighbor.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.756
But that's where they
sleep-- all of them.

00:11:22.756 --> 00:11:24.130
That's her oldest
daughter, who's

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.580
18, who is now following
in the same cycle.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.520
And this cycle of poverty
is very, very hard

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.570
to break unless you're there and
you give them the kind of help

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.220
that they need.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.584
By the way, we
discovered over the years

00:11:39.584 --> 00:11:41.000
and through the
making of the book

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.900
is that one of the biggest
drivers of poverty,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.899
particularly with regards
to women and children,

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:46.470
is domestic violence.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.770
It's all over the world,
particularly in South America.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.730
But in Libya, we found
these individuals.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.380
In Libya, which is
actually the fourth poorest

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.860
country in the world,
85% of the population

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.940
there lives on
less than $1 a day.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.930
These women come
to this hospital--

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.960
does anyone know
what a fistula is?

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.390
A fistula?

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.780
To repair a fistula that has
taken place in their bodies

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.210
as a result of
childbirth or rape.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.320
A fistula is actually
an opening in the inside

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.930
of an intestinal
organ that connects

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:31.600
one organ to another organ; and
as a result, problems occur.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.880
In their case, and this happens
to about 400,000 women a year,

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.700
they die as a result
of childbirth,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.490
usually from the occurrence of
a fistula that's not repaired

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.060
and gets infected, and they die.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.740
Now, a fistula
occurs sometimes when

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.280
a child is stuck
in the birth canal.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.995
And since they
don't have doctors,

00:12:50.995 --> 00:12:52.620
they don't have access
to medical care,

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.880
usually the child is pulled out.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.620
The child's, then, foot
goes through the sidewall

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.030
of the birth canal.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:05.290
And, of course, that sometimes
goes into the kidneys.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.830
Or sometimes, there's a
break between the birth

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.730
canal and the intestinal organs.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.630
And when that occurs, again,
unless it's fixed right away,

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.340
it's very hard to fix later.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.480
What happens to these women
is they spend half their day

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.910
on the toilet because they
cannot control their urine

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:36.660
or, actually, any kind
of fecal removement.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.790
So they can't control it
because, again, these two

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.560
parts of their
organs are attached,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.400
and they shouldn't be.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.790
And this is the way they live.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.216
Now, the biggest problem
that they have in life

00:13:49.216 --> 00:13:50.840
is not so much that
they live this way,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.770
it's that they're ostracized
by their villages because

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.430
of their smell.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.390
Here, they have
developed these odors

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.369
as a result, again, of
two attached organs.

00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:02.910
They're kicked out
of their villages,

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.050
or they're sent away-- far away.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.820
And they live by themselves.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.770
Their husbands take new
wives, and they're basically

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.510
forgotten.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.260
So unless they get
this medical care,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.940
they can never return
to their village.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.330
They lose their whole lives.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.730
So they come to these
hospitals to get fixed.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.490
And the problem is it's
very, very difficult.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.700
Sometimes, they go through
two or three operations.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.230
These hospitals
need a lot of help.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.190
They don't have expert doctors.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:36.360
And nevertheless, in some
cases, these children are fixed;

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.610
in some cases, they're not.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.300
This little girl
here on the left,

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.120
actually, has a fistula
as a result of rape.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.570
She was raped when
she was six years old.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.250
And as a result of that,
her intestinal organs

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.270
are damaged permanently,
unless they can fix them.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.060
Now, I'm going to talk a
little bit about "Back to Peru"

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.850
a little later.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.860
And again, those are just
3 of 45 or 50 individuals

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.940
we met on our travels
that are suffering

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.640
as a result of poverty.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.130
The stories were
quite compelling.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.963
And one of the actual
questions that I often

00:15:16.963 --> 00:15:20.650
get when I tell some of
these stories is, hey, Tom,

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.600
how can you visit
these people and not

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.422
leave them in a better way?

00:15:25.422 --> 00:15:27.130
And I said, well, the
purpose of the book

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.200
was actually to capture their
lives and tell the world.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.533
And hopefully, the world will
turn around and leave them

00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:32.210
in a better way.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.720
We didn't have the resources.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.400
Nevertheless, we
always left something

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.020
in the way of a gift
with individuals

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.710
that we spend a day
or two with trying

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.510
to capture their stories.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.560
And the woman who's pushing
around these children

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.610
and collecting
these recyclables,

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.640
we left her with $80.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.340
And she fell to her
knees and started

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.970
crying when we gave her $80
because she knew that she could

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.220
stay in her little apartment
for, at least, two months

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.345
and not get evicted out in
the street with her kids

00:15:57.345 --> 00:16:00.300
because she now had $80.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.700
And what's amazing is how
little money can really

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.740
help these individuals.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.920
We'll spend $80 on a bottle of
wine or lunch with our friends.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.900
And for them, it can really
turn their whole life around.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:26.790
Now, I wanted to move
from this to actually talk

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.180
about this documentary
that we're making.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.940
Now, if you go through
the book, there's

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.020
one story that seems to have
captured the eyes, hearts,

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.690
and minds of a lot of people who
have now purchased this book.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.510
And by the way, Amazon sold
out copies of the book.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.430
They had to reorder through
Norton, our publisher.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.460
I think they now have some more.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.697
But it's become a very,
very popular book,

00:16:49.697 --> 00:16:51.655
and it's doing quite well
all over the country.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.800
Nevertheless, the
one story that's

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.370
captured really the hearts
and minds of most of the folks

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.760
that have looked at this
book is about some children

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.311
we found in Ghana, West Africa.

00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:06.310
And I think it's particularly
relevant to people

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.130
who work in the tech industry
because these kids are actually

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:18.000
some of the collateral
damage of the tech industry.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.380
These kids live on an
e-waste dump site in Ghana.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.980
They are forgotten kids.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.040
They have been abandoned.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.180
They live on the streets.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.569
They live under a truck.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.040
They live in these little
shacks, sometimes 10 or 12

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.400
together in order to
protect themselves.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.510
And they have
almost no resources.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.820
And what they do to survive
is they go through e-waste.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.810
They collect it up.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.130
They burn off all
little plastic,

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.120
all of the material that's
surrounding the metal.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.190
And then they try to
collect up the metal that's

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.030
in the e-waste in
order to sell it.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.800
Some of the metals are, of
course, zinc and copper,

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.860
sometimes even gold.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.720
Whatever they can
find, they'll turn in

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.630
and try to survive
on that money.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:02.310
Some little kids only make maybe
$0.10 a day, maybe $0.15 a day.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.430
The bigger kids get some
of the more valuable stuff.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.060
But that's how they survive.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:11.180
I wanted to show you a little
video out of our documentary

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.415
that will be coming out
next year about these kids.

00:18:15.892 --> 00:18:17.350
Well, these are
the kinds of things

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.974
that you see when
you travel the world.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.590
And I've been traveling the
world now for maybe 20 years.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.700
And when I first started
doing this and going off

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.670
to developing
countries, I actually

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.040
had to come home and
sometimes go through therapy

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.900
just because it's so difficult.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.410
And for quite a while,
I worked with the UN

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.270
and had to actually
go to countries

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.594
and do reports on the
treatment of children based

00:18:43.594 --> 00:18:46.010
on the International Convention
on the Rights of the Child

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.510
because, as you
might have gathered,

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.740
I'm actually a lawyer.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.440
I teach at law school.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.120
So it's all been hard,
particularly when

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.540
you see things that
impact on children.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.247
That's probably the hardest.

00:18:59.247 --> 00:19:01.080
And I could tell you
some of horror stories,

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.200
but that's not the
point of today.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.760
And in fact, I've
actually given up

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.176
on telling a lot
of horror stories

00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:09.220
because people got
too bummed out.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.380
And people told me to stop.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.420
But I would like to try to
spend a moment emphasizing

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.520
why poverty and global
poverty is so important.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:26.385
And the first reason
is that poverty kills.

00:19:26.385 --> 00:19:30.800
And in fact, poverty
kills more people

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.710
in this world than
any other thing.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.770
And it actually used to
be worse than it is today.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.120
Things are getting better.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.850
But on any given
day, 18,000 children

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.070
die as a result of
being too poor to live.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.710
They have no medical
care, or they

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.690
can't get to a doctor
in time to be saved.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.230
They get no immunizations.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.550
They die from diseases that
they shouldn't be dying from

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.840
or something else.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.410
Another big killer
is, of course,

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.940
simple hunger and starvation.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.110
However, if we take that to a
higher level and say, OK, well,

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.850
what about adults and kids?

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.090
Another way to look
at this is if we

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.180
look at the poorest countries in
the world, the average lifespan

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.940
of someone in that country
is about 39, 40, 41 years.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.060
If we look at the richest
countries in the world,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.060
the average lifetime is
somewhere between 78 and 81

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.530
years, with Japan being
probably the country

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.590
that's number 1 in lifespan.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.890
So if you happen to be
born in the wrong place

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.560
at the wrong time,
your lifespan is

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.680
going to be about half
the lifespan of people

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.760
who are born in other places.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.490
So the truth of the
matter is that--

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:51.040
and you probably know this--
that it's all just chance.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.935
Our big, big part of
our life is just chance.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.897
But poverty kills,
kills drastically,

00:20:58.897 --> 00:21:01.230
and sometimes, of course,
kills the most innocent people

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.700
on earth.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.720
The second most
important reason is,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.760
as I've mentioned
earlier, the numbers-- one

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.570
sixth under $1 a day,
one third under $2 a day.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.640
The numbers are just phenomenal.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.250
It shouldn't be that way.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.880
It really shouldn't.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.270
And if we look at
those numbers alone,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.640
not only do they scare us
but the other thing that's

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.040
kind of scary, in fact, that
I consider immoral is now,

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.380
not only do we a huge number
of poor people in the world,

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.280
but we actually have a
huge number of rich people.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.910
"Forbes Magazine" comes out
with this report every year

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.830
on the number of
billionaires on the planet.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.580
And their last report
indicated that there

00:21:52.580 --> 00:22:00.120
was 1,645 billionaires on
the planet-- billionaires.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.220
The United States, by the
way, has about one third

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.170
of the world's billionaires.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.830
So we have a
disproportionate number,

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.670
particularly since
we only have about 6%

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.580
of the world's population.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.010
And that's one of the reasons
why most people consider

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.509
the United States one of the
richest countries in the world,

00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:18.950
if not the richest.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.390
So we have this huge
number of billionaires,

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.860
and this huge number
of impoverished people.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.410
And the gap seems to be
getting wider and wider,

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.280
not only throughout the world
but in the United States

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.310
as well.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.800
So if we look at that,
that's kind of immoral

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.100
in and by itself.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.250
And in fact, Oxfam came
out with a report, which

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.602
you may have heard about because
you guys are pretty savvy,

00:22:43.602 --> 00:22:46.380
came out with a report about six
months ago that indicated that.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.380
And they looked at the
same numbers I looked at,

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.510
and actually, we came
to the same conclusion

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.200
that if we take the 85 richest
people on this planet--

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.610
the 85 richest people on the
planet, which should have

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.540
probably fit in this
room-- their wealth

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.930
would equal the wealth
of 3 and 1/2 billion

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.180
of the poorest
people on the planet.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.250
3 and 1/2 billion
people are, basically,

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.850
half the world's population.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:13.590
So 85 people have as much wealth
as half the world's population.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.345
That's how skewed
it is on the top.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.580
So is that immoral?

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.980
Does that make sense?

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.850
One of the richest
people in India

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.580
just built himself a
billion-dollar home.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.782
He's actually 47, 48 years old.

00:23:31.782 --> 00:23:38.916
The home has 27 floors, has
a parking lot for 180 cars,

00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:40.790
has swimming pools,
spas, so on and so forth.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.080
I can go on and on.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.280
Six blocks from
his home, there's

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.870
a gentleman who
lives on the street.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.840
The gentleman is a cobbler.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.040
He fixes shoes when
people wish their shoes

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.210
to be fixed as they walk by.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.520
He has a little brick
stand-- bricks on both sides.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:03.280
He sleeps, eats, does all his
work on the sidewalk in India,

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.240
six blocks from this
billion-dollar home.

00:24:07.657 --> 00:24:08.740
We came and talked to him.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:14.590
And we said, how much money
do you make on a given day?

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.780
And he said a few
rupees-- not much.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.430
And I said, what happens if
you make no money at all.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.030
And he said, well,
I go to sleep here,

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.470
and I pray for a
better day tomorrow.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.050
What if a better day
doesn't come tomorrow,

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.540
what do you do then?

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.600
He says, I go across the
street, and you see that tree?

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.670
I eat the leaves off the tree.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.140
So we have a person here living
in a billion-dollar home,

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:47.640
and a person here eating
leaves off a tree.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.610
Immorality?

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:49.620
Craziness?

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.990
Is this the world
we want to live in?

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.390
Maybe not, maybe not.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.295
Maybe you guys will
do something about it.

00:24:56.295 --> 00:24:59.959
I want to go to the
next video, though.

00:24:59.959 --> 00:25:01.500
And maybe some of
you have seen this.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.670
It's quite a popular video.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.330
It's relatively short, about
4 minutes, maybe 3 and 1/2.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.270
But it also brings this
home to United States.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.570
What about the disparities
that exist right here?

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:12.750
What do they look like?

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.905
So since this video was
produced, it's actually, again,

00:25:20.905 --> 00:25:22.245
has gotten worse.

00:25:22.245 --> 00:25:27.980
The top 1% now own 43% of
America's wealth, not 40%.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.840
But again, many of you
have heard a little bit

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.640
about the inequalities
that exist here and abroad.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.540
Well, I know that I've kept
you already for quite a while,

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:43.210
so let me try to, at least,
say a few quick things,

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.460
and then maybe sign some
books or take some questions.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.640
It depends on what
you want to do.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.810
But let me try to answer a
question that sometimes people

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.660
have asked me.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.800
And they've done it in
kind of tricky ways.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.220
Some people have
said, you know, I

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.220
have this friend who has
an awful lot of wealth,

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.130
but he doesn't seem to care.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:10.250
He'll go out and buy himself an
$8,000 watch or $100,000 car,

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.820
doesn't think twice about
people who have almost nothing.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.220
And he's asked me,
why should we care?

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.040
And if somebody would ask
me, why should we care?

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.120
I actually have
four reasons why we

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.780
should care about
issues like this.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.656
Let me give them
to you real quick.

00:26:27.656 --> 00:26:30.370
And I think I'm going
to go to another video.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:38.600
But the first reason is
because good people care.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.260
If we think about
all of the best

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.820
people in the history
of the world--

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.760
the Ghandis, the Martin Luther
Kings, the Mother Teresas,

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.120
whoever you put on
the best people list--

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.610
they will all end
up on that list

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.280
because they've been
caring individuals

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.920
who care about other
people, who give

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.080
of their time, their
wealth, whatever

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.470
to make the world
a better place.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.524
And we're all, of
course, going to die.

00:27:04.524 --> 00:27:05.940
So at some point,
somebody's going

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.830
to have to write something
on your tombstone.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.840
And wouldn't it be nice if they
wrote something nice about you?

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.685
And the truth is that in order
to be treated as a nice person

00:27:14.685 --> 00:27:16.180
or be thought of
as a nice person,

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.780
you have to give and
care about other people.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.720
You can't get away in life
without giving and caring,

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.840
and think of yourself
as a nice person.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.370
It's no accident that the
Dalai Lama wrote the foreword

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.920
to our book because the
book is about compassion.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.870
And some of the people that
we fund around the world

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.610
are about compassion.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.620
And this is an example
of an individual

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.950
that we help in India.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:49.110
And I think you'll
see right away

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.922
this quality of goodness in him.

00:27:50.922 --> 00:27:52.380
Try to listen to
some of the things

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.790
he says because, frankly, I wish
everybody felt the way he did.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.270
The Joy of Giving.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.057
We actually did a big
fundraiser with the Dalai Lama

00:28:07.057 --> 00:28:09.140
called the Joy of Giving,
where he came and talked

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.890
about the importance
of giving and caring.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.190
Second reason why we
should care is simply

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:25.170
because it's in our own
best interest to care.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.960
The truth of the
matter is if we make

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.180
everyone feel that
society is fair,

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.590
that the distribution of
food, medical services,

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:41.020
and everything else is being
distributed fairly, they're

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.530
much less likely to take from us
and much less likely to create

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.790
revolutions or conflicts
around the world;

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.870
and hence, that benefits
us in the long term.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.770
So it's when we start keeping
those things that we really

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:58.540
don't need, not sharing that
we actually put ourselves

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.330
in jeopardy.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:03.750
So the notion of giving and
caring and sharing with others

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.340
makes an awful lot of sense.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.030
And you all know
this because you all

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.470
have friends that
probably have things

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.270
that they really don't need.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:17.060
I gave a talk like this
once at a law firm.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.420
And this woman came up to
me after the talk and said,

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.890
I want to give you a
donation to your foundation.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.590
And she sat down, and she
wrote me a check for $1,000.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.110
And I said, thank you very much.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.710
It's very generous of you.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.930
And she said, you could do
a lot more with this money

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.350
than I can.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.875
I would only buy another purse.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.989
Another gentleman gave
me $25,000 and said,

00:29:38.989 --> 00:29:40.780
I would only buy another
car, and I already

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.220
have 18 cars in my garage.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:51.074
So what happens when you have
so much more than what you need?

00:29:51.074 --> 00:29:52.240
Does that really make sense?

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.573
Is that going to buy you a
ticket to heaven or someplace

00:29:54.573 --> 00:29:55.570
else?

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.050
I don't think so.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:01.190
So please think about
benefiting other people.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.790
It makes all the
sense in the world.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:09.120
And the third reason why we
should give and care for others

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:14.270
is actually something
that Warren Buffett once

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.330
talked about.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.420
And the truth is that he
said, the truth of the matter

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.840
is that we've all been lucky.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.290
And we are in certain
positions, in certain places,

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.050
largely through the
help of other people,

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:32.700
or because we were lucky
at the time of birth, even.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.030
So if that's really the
reality, much of what we got

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.490
is really a matter of luck.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.610
Bill Clinton interviewed
Warren Buffett shortly

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:50.050
after he gave $30 billion to
the Bill Gates Foundation.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.820
It was the largest
philanthropic gift

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:55.150
ever made by a
single individual.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.840
And President Clinton
asked him, why would you

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.870
do such a thing-- $30 billion?

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.850
And Warren Buffett
said, you know, I

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:11.820
can live very easily on less
than 1% of the money I possess.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.660
All the rest is surplus.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.515
I, frankly, don't need it.

00:31:16.515 --> 00:31:18.890
So please don't make me a hero
because I didn't give away

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:19.690
anything I need.

00:31:22.462 --> 00:31:24.640
If you want us to
talk about heroes,

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.120
then go visit the
teachers or the firemen

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.100
or the policemen in
the world who sometimes

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.080
educate our children
or risk their lives

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.140
for the sake of others,
or an individual who

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.490
may give an evening
out to a friend who

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:39.760
has no friends in
her life or give up

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.202
a dinner or the cost of the
theater to help another person.

00:31:43.202 --> 00:31:44.910
They have really given
up stuff that they

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.010
need and could use
and benefit from.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.486
I've given up nothing I need.

00:31:48.486 --> 00:31:49.860
I've been lucky
enough to be born

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.484
in the right country
at the right time,

00:31:51.484 --> 00:31:56.170
and I made decisions that I've
been unjustly rewarded for.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.959
So please don't make me a hero.

00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:01.500
Now, if all of
America's billionaires

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.840
felt the same way, or
maybe millionaires or maybe

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.604
even people who are middle
class, kind of like us.

00:32:08.604 --> 00:32:10.145
We don't need
thousand-dollar purses.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.542
So I think Warren Buffet
tells a story right there.

00:32:17.542 --> 00:32:20.000
Much of what we have has been
largely an accident of birth.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.820
And the final reason why I
think we should think more

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.820
about giving and
caring is simply

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.880
because, as one of the video
said, it simply feels good.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.930
It simply feels good to give
and care for other people.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.945
My last story,
and it's usually I

00:32:39.945 --> 00:32:41.570
tell this story a
lot because everybody

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:46.730
likes me to tell, at least,
one Dalai Lama story.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.340
I've worked with the Dalai
Lama for probably 15 years.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.920
I met him a long, long time ago.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.840
I've spent time at his home.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:56.150
And I've learned a lot from him.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.460
And on one such occasion
when I was in India,

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.699
I was living up in the Himalayas
not far from where he lives.

00:33:02.699 --> 00:33:04.740
So I came to his town,
and one of his secretaries

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.580
said that the little
professor is here.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.550
That's what he calls
me, "little professor."

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.960
And the Dalai Lama said, oh,
invite him up for the day.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.810
And so I came up
to his home, and he

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.640
was giving audiences that day.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.630
Now, audiences are
meetings with individuals

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.520
who come often from
around the world just

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.060
to spend a little time
with the Dalai Lama.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.950
And so I sat in the
corner of the room,

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.110
and I started listening to
some of these audiences.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:33.690
And at one point, a gentleman
came in with his family--

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.480
with his wife, three kids.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.140
They all came from
Mumbai, India.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.400
They were very, very
well dressed, lot

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:46.520
of jewelry, very good English,
clearly from the upper class.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.580
And they sat and talked to
the Dalai Lama for about 45,

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.380
50 minutes.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.580
And they asked His Holiness
all sorts of questions

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.500
about, how do you
retain your happiness?

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.760
You've had a difficult
life, how do you smile?

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.540
How do you laugh?

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:02.092
What is this thing
called global peace?

00:34:02.092 --> 00:34:03.050
Can we ever achieve it?

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.810
How would we do it?

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.760
What is this thing
called compassion?

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.925
So on and so forth.

00:34:07.925 --> 00:34:09.300
So they asked the
Dalai Lama some

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.070
of the big questions
of the day, which

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.090
often come to the Dalai Lama.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.090
And they sat and talked.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:23.270
And at the end of this
conversation, the gentleman--

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.880
the head of the
family, I guess--

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.340
asked the Dalai Lama if His
Holiness could do him a favor

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.610
before they left.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.889
And he simply asked
the Dalai Lama,

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:38.040
could you bless me and my
family before we leave?

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.120
And I thought the Dalia Lama
was going to say, no problem.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.179
I've seen the Dalai Lama
bless people before.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.304
Sometimes, large
groups of people.

00:34:46.304 --> 00:34:48.179
But this time, the Dalai
Lama said, you know,

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:52.080
I really don't like
to bless people.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.320
We have just sat and
talked about our problems.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.254
My problems are very
similar to your problems.

00:34:57.254 --> 00:34:59.170
Your problems are very
similar to my problems.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.260
We're simply just
two human beings

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.740
trying to get through life
the best way we know how.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.420
It would be silly
for me to bless you.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.690
In fact, you could bless me.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.420
And it kind of indicated
the Dalai Lama's humility,

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.140
which is one of the things
I love most about him.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.210
But then the Dalai
Lama said, however,

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.970
if you wish to feel
blessed, go back to Mumbai

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.130
from which you've
come and help all

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.350
of those people in and
around you who have so little

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:28.682
and suffer so much.

00:35:28.682 --> 00:35:30.140
And in return,
you'll feel blessed.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.230
And that's true.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.170
And that's what I
encourage all of you to do.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.380
So thanks for coming today.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.629
If you want a copy of my
book, I'll sign them outside.

00:35:42.629 --> 00:35:44.780
If you want to help me
and my organization,

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.700
grab one of my cards.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.960
Give me a call sometime.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.750
If you've got an extra million
dollars hanging around,

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:49.350
let me know.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.750
That kind of thing.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:51.500
Thanks for coming.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.850
[APPLAUSE]
