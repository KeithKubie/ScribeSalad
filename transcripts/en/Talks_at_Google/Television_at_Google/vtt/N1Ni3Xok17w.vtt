[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.375
DORINA ARELLANO: Hi.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:13.636
EG DAILY: Hi, everybody.

00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:16.020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.510
DORINA ARELLANO:
Welcome to Google.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.480
EG DAILY: Thanks.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.600
DORINA ARELLANO:
Thanks for being here.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.360
EG DAILY: It's nice to be here.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.650
DORINA ARELLANO: So I wanted
to start with your earlier

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.330
acting career.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.940
You were a part of a few
quite iconic cult hit movies

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.040
that became cult hits later on.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.950
And you know, you
got "Valley Girl"

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.180
and one of my
personal favorites,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.755
"Pee-wee's Big Adventure."

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:42.130
EG DAILY: Dottie.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.740
DORINA ARELLANO: Yes, Dottie.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.610
So I wanted to ask if
you had any fond memories

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.850
from those experiences
that you wanted to share.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.080
And did you expect these movies
to become, you know, this big?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.132
EG DAILY: Good question.

00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:59.340
You know, honestly, every
time I would get a project,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.970
I never knew what was going
to happen with it, never.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.510
Like "Pee-wee's Big Adventure"
was just a casting I went out

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.700
for and then booked it.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.370
And all I remember
was I remember seeing

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.110
them talking about Tim Burton.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.410
And they were saying, oh, Tim's
going to be this big director.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.620
And I remember watching
him thinking, hm.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.936
He's like a mad
scientist genius.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.060
And I remember walking on
the set of "Pee-wee's Big

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.760
Adventure," and there was
all the cool like kitchen,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.170
the cooking things, and the set.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.080
And I remember how
detailed Tim Burton was.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
And I remember thinking, he's
got something really special.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.110
And those are the kind of
things that I take in a lot

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.080
when I'm working, is the
people I'm working with.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.440
And a lot of the projects I
did, they would always say--

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.917
I did this movie with Kevin
Costner called "Fandango,"

00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:48.750
and it was right when
Kevin Costner was just

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.180
starting to break his career.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.400
And they were saying, this
guy's going to blow up.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.260
And I always remember
wondering, like, I

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.350
wonder how they know, like how
they knew that Tim Burton was

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.832
going to blow up and how they
knew that Kevin Costner was

00:02:00.832 --> 00:02:01.540
going to blow up.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.400
But those are the kind of things
I remember on my projects.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.955
Yeah.

00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:07.680
DORINA ARELLANO: That's awesome.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.200
And how did you transition
from that into voice acting?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.840
EG DAILY: Well, I did a lot of
voices when I was a little kid.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.090
You know, I would just like
walk around the playground

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.548
and be like (IN
HIGH VOICE) I don't

00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:21.690
like that very much.
(REGULAR VOICE) You know,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.617
I would just do
these weird voices.

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:25.200
And (DIFFERENT VOICE)
let's go beat up

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.820
Farsheed at the water fountain.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.430
You know, we would do
voices when I was little.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.860
But I didn't think
anything of it,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.160
then I did a play where I
had to be a female wrestler.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.530
In each round of the play,
I was a different age.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.374
And then some guy had heard
me do voices in this play,

00:02:43.374 --> 00:02:45.540
and he was like, you're
really good with your voice.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.123
And I never thought
anything about it,

00:02:47.123 --> 00:02:51.090
but it was just this thing that
I never thought anything about.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.219
And he said, you should
audition for some things.

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.010
And so it was one of
those things that just

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.370
kind of dropped into my life.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.860
And I went out for this
one audition for a cartoon,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.320
and it was to do the voice
for this little character.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.180
And I was like, hm.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.740
That sort of sounds
like the voice

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.040
I've been doing my whole life
since I was a little girl.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.979
And this character had like big
floppy lips and a round head,

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.520
and so I just sort of started
doing (IN TOMMY PICKLES' VOICE)

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.230
oh, you know, Chuckie,
I'm not sure I like that.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.370
(REGULAR VOICE) And then
I auditioned for that,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.710
and then I booked Tommy Pickles.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.835
I don't remember what your
question was originally,

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:23.020
but that's where I landed.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.470
DORINA ARELLANO: No, yeah.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.360
I actually was just
about to ask you about--

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.090
EG DAILY: I read
your mind, yeah.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.060
DORINA ARELLANO: --the
legendary Tommy Pickles.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.550
So I'm assuming some
of you here, like me,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.230
grew up in the '90s and
were Nickelodeon fans.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.360
And I love "Rugrats."

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.050
EG DAILY: Yay.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.740
DORINA ARELLANO: It
was very, very cool.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.160
I hear there is a
reboot coming back.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.090
EG DAILY: Yeah.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.110
There's been a reboot--

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.200
a feature film and, I
think, 26 new episodes,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.560
which should be amazing.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.685
I can't say more than that,
but I'm really excited.

00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:54.893
DORINA ARELLANO: But you're
going to be on it, right?

00:03:54.893 --> 00:03:56.910
EG DAILY: Well, I can't
say more than that.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.860
But I would say that I'm really
excited about it, you know.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.020
"Rugrats" is a family.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.430
It's a family that
we grew up at.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.888
And I always think,
like, everybody

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:09.090
wants to feel cozy and
safe, like especially today.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.990
It's raining.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.720
But everyone wants to
feel a cozy safety,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.480
and I really think like
"Rugrats" brought that family

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.640
thing to people's homes.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.719
And that's why everybody loves
it, because the moms loved it,

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.260
the dads loved it,
the kids loved it,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.801
and now the generations
are loving it

00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:25.410
because it was family.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.180
It was like this cozy
thing, and for them

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.820
to bring back their family,
people are really excited.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.094
Like, I get to be cozy
again in the family.

00:04:33.094 --> 00:04:33.760
Yeah, it's good.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.010
DORINA ARELLANO: Bringing
happiness to lots of people.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.230
So how did you come
up with the voice?

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.121
Did you have some
form of direction

00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:41.370
from the people working on it?

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.228
Did you just kind of
start playing around, or--

00:04:45.228 --> 00:04:48.360
EG DAILY: You know, like
I said, the audition was

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.510
my first audition I'd ever
been on for an animated show.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.369
And I had done
movies my whole life

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:54.910
and I had done
singing my whole life.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.409
So I knew how to
play with my voice,

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.190
but when they showed me this
claymation, I just was like--

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.320
I think that's what my god gift
is, my ability to see a mouth

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.240
and know what sound is going
to come out of that mouth.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.960
And I always tell everyone,
like if I were to put all of you

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.070
guys in a row and then you
were to play me all your guys'

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.974
voices all over the
place, like not in order,

00:05:18.974 --> 00:05:21.140
that I would probably be
able to pick the voice that

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.170
goes with the mouth.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.690
And I think that's
what my weird--

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.760
it's a very strange gift.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.110
Like, it's really strange.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.350
But I think my first
instinct on Tommy Pickles

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.281
when I saw the little claymation
was (IN TOMMY PICKLES' VOICE)

00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:35.530
I'm not sure I really like--
(REGULAR VOICE) you know,

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.870
he was so kind of innocent
and sweet and very much baby.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.370
And that was the
first voice that

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.800
came out of my mouth and
my first voice audition

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.172
ever for a cartoon, and
then I just booked it.

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:47.630
And I didn't know
what I was doing.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.955
It was not in my
wheelhouse to do animation.

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:52.440
DORINA ARELLANO: That's great.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.540
So I saw a video of
you giving voice tips,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.340
like voice acting
tips, and there

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.990
was a really cool thing that she
did for like teeth chattering.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.090
I guess you put like a
pen between your teeth?

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.410
EG DAILY: A pen or a pencil.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.390
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.870
EG DAILY: I wish you
had a pen or pencil.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.536
DORINA ARELLANO: Do
you guys have a pen?

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:13.277
EG DAILY: If anybody
has a pencil--

00:06:13.277 --> 00:06:15.485
DORINA ARELLANO: Do you have
any other tips like that

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:18.239
that you use or that you
think are fun, for people

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:19.280
that want to get into it?

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.909
EG DAILY: Yeah.

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:21.950
Well, first of all, I do
have a voiceover seminar

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.560
that I did for a live audience,
and it's a digital download

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.885
on EGDaily.com.

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:29.010
And I did that because a
lot of people were asking,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.670
do you have any tips and tools
for voiceover, and, you know,

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.690
the basics and stuff.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.412
But there's so many weird tools.

00:06:34.412 --> 00:06:35.870
Like, if you go to
a voice session,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.230
you'll see people do things
like [BLUBBERING SOUND]..

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.152
You know, they pull their
lip out or they mess

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:42.860
with their cheek.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.970
Or you know, SpongeBob
does [CHOPPY VOICE]..

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.390
That's how he gets that sound.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.556
I can't do it that fast,
but he does it really fast.

00:06:50.556 --> 00:06:52.580
[CHOPPY VOICE] There it is.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.080
Anyway, that's SpongeBob.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.324
Don't tell him I
told you the secret.

00:06:56.324 --> 00:06:57.740
And the pencil
teeth chattering is

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.080
you basically just
take a pencil or a pen

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.310
and you put in your teeth
and you just go like this.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.185
And it makes a
[IMITATING CHATTERING TEETH],,

00:07:04.185 --> 00:07:06.920
like a shivering
cold cartoon sound.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.780
I mean, there's a
million tips like that.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.155
There's like, (IN
BRITISH ACCENT)

00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:13.250
if you're doing a British
accent, you talk like this.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.500
And then if you leave your
tongue (IN INDIAN ACCENT)

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.041
on the tip of your mouth, you
start to talk a little bit more

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:19.520
on the Indian side.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.586
It sort of brings out
the Indian inside of--

00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:23.960
(REGULAR VOICE) I'm not doing
very well myself right now,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.530
but there's so many
little tools and tips.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.300
And a lot of the time, it's
playing with your mouth.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.084
You know, to create braces,
you might put your finger

00:07:33.084 --> 00:07:35.500
in your mouth (IN LISPY VOICE)
and sort of talk like this.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.860
So Susie has braces and
she spits all over herself.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.267
(REGULAR VOICE) You know,
so that's a kid with braces,

00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:42.350
and there's a lot of tips.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.359
And it's not very sexy, but
it's what I get paid for.

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:47.900
DORINA ARELLANO: It may not look
sexy, but it sounds awesome.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.494
EG DAILY: I feel sexy.

00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:52.910
DORINA ARELLANO: So I would
like to talk about the t-shirt

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:53.770
that I'm wearing.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.070
EG DAILY: (IN BUTTERCUP'S VOICE)
Yeah, I love your t-shirt,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.660
but I just have one question.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.970
Why is Buttercup on the bottom?

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.440
DORINA ARELLANO: Yes.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.800
We're good here, you guys.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.390
That was great.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.940
I'm very happy now.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.720
So Buttercup was my favorite.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.570
I grew up as a very
feisty teenager,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.800
and I related to this
kindergarten girl.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.160
So out of the three, she was
obviously the feistiest one.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.850
What has it been like to
be part of a show that

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.390
has inspired so many
girls to kind of find

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.460
their power and their voice.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.975
And has she also been kind of an
outlet for stress or rage when

00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:31.475
you're--

00:08:31.475 --> 00:08:34.226
EG DAILY: (IN BUTTERCUP'S
VOICE) Yes, she is.

00:08:34.226 --> 00:08:37.669
(REGULAR VOICE)
Buttercup is like--

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.010
I think of the three, she's
the feistiest, obviously.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:45.760
And I just think there's
nothing cooler than little tiny,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.760
petite little girls
with superpowers,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.250
and superpowers to
save the day or help

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.160
people that are not doing well.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.100
And I love that it takes
away that you have to be huge

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.400
or you have to be super
muscular, you know,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.766
that wanting to make the world
better is The Powerpuff Girls.

00:09:05.766 --> 00:09:07.390
And they're little,
and they're petite,

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.190
and they're little girls,
but they still are all

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.481
about making the planet better.

00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:15.320
So what an incredible message
for everyone right now.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.530
You know, especially
now when things

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.290
have changed so much like with
the MeToo movement and stuff.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.504
I just think it's really
incredible to have.

00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:24.920
And the other thing
I always say I

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.920
love about The Powerpuff Girls
is that they work as a team.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.480
And I really think that--

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.090
I know my life goes better
when I work as a team.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.640
I try not to make a lot of
decisions without my tribe.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.190
And The Powerpuff Girls
are so good because they're

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.240
so different and they
work together as a team.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.360
So I just think the
whole message is just

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.030
awesome-- little, cute girls.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.210
And they're cute,
and they're feisty.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.060
It's awesome.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.280
DORINA ARELLANO:
And the show itself

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.150
is not just funny and great,
but it's very artistic.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.160
You know, you worked
with, obviously,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.322
other great voice actors like
Tara Strong and Tom Kane.

00:09:58.322 --> 00:09:59.780
Like, is there
somebody that you've

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.790
collaborated with in
your career that you're

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.320
like, that was a great memory.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.040
I love that.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.170
And then is there somebody
you're actually hoping

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.479
to work with in the future?

00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:09.770
EG DAILY: I mean, the really
cool thing about animation

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.780
is you'll show up at
a voiceover session

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.710
and you'll work with
like Phyllis Diller.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.700
You know?

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.710
Yeah, Phyllis Diller.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.065
We were just talking
about "Star Wars."

00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:22.190
DORINA ARELLANO: Oh, Mark--

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.180
EG DAILY: Mark Hamill.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.190
Like, you'll walk into
a session and there

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.340
will be like legendary people.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.950
Like Phyllis Diller
was like, ha ha!

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.690
Crazy, but I liked her.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:38.630
And she was probably 90 then,
and just amazingly talented.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.250
So you never know
with voiceover,

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.833
but that's what's so cool about
it is it doesn't have anything

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:46.050
to do with your body or your
age or your face or your hair

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.780
or your color or your race
or your religion or your sex.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.190
And you know, I play a boy.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.820
I play a girl.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.981
I play an old lady.

00:10:51.981 --> 00:10:52.730
I play a teenager.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:59.510
You know, I love the people
that come in and do animation,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.345
and I love the people that
I get to be in animation.

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:05.240
DORINA ARELLANO: And speaking
of just the differences

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.480
between voice acting
and on-camera acting,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.925
are there some
challenges or things

00:11:10.925 --> 00:11:15.070
that you consider fun, more
from like one or the other?

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:15.770
EG DAILY: Yeah.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.570
I think what's cool
about on-camera

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.240
is I'm a character actress,
so I like to really

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.470
like transform my body.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.470
And I get a lot of roles
where I get to change--

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.450
like Sex-Head in "31."

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.830
Did any of you guys see that?

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.038
DORINA ARELLANO: Horror fans?

00:11:30.038 --> 00:11:31.327
EG DAILY: Horror fans in here?

00:11:31.327 --> 00:11:33.410
(IN BUTTERCUP'S VOICE)
What's wrong with you guys?

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.096
(REGULAR VOICE)
I'm just kidding.

00:11:35.096 --> 00:11:36.530
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah,
you work with Rob Zombie

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.738
in a couple of movies, right?

00:11:37.738 --> 00:11:39.450
With "31" and "Devil's Rejects."

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.130
EG DAILY: Yeah.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.290
Well usually, Rob-- the
good thing about Rob Zombie

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.980
is he casts very
specifically and he usually

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.720
knows exactly how he
wants to wardrobe you

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.970
before you show up on the set.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.980
Like he knows my
size and my body,

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.560
so he always puts me in
very particular-- so for me,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.340
I really love transforming
physically for on-camera.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.430
And you know, Dottie
was kind of quirky.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.180
She was quirky.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.010
And then I love--

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.710
the beauty of bad
animation is that it

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.500
has nothing to do with
your body, and you know,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.310
it has nothing.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.260
So you're so much,
even more freer,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.990
because you could be
an inanimate object.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.250
You could be a talking
puppy or a ball,

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.136
or you could be talking
that, whatever this thing is.

00:12:25.136 --> 00:12:26.510
DORINA ARELLANO:
You were Chairry

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.207
in "Pee-wee's Playhouse" too.

00:12:28.207 --> 00:12:29.540
EG DAILY: No, I wasn't actually.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.090
DORINA ARELLANO:
Oh, you weren't.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:30.380
OK.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.530
EG DAILY: No.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.700
I didn't do
"Pee-wee's Playhouse."

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.930
I just did "Pee-wee's
Big Adventure."

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:33.210
DORINA ARELLANO:
Just "Adventure," OK.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.120
EG DAILY: Yeah.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.630
But yeah, so the
difference is just--

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.800
they're both amazing.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.240
One, I get to transform
myself and my body.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.260
The other, I get to use my voice
to transform myself anywhere,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:46.760
you know.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.460
And sometimes I
really like being

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.460
like on a set where I get to
be all dressed differently

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.620
and change myself
up, or sometimes I

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.240
like being in my pajamas
in a recording studio,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.116
and then I can do
whatever I want to.

00:13:00.116 --> 00:13:03.017
DORINA ARELLANO: And you
are not just an actress.

00:13:03.017 --> 00:13:04.100
You're a musician as well.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.391
EG DAILY: Yeah, I'm a musician.

00:13:05.391 --> 00:13:08.390
DORINA ARELLANO: And for
'80s fans especially,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.460
you were part of a
lot of soundtracks.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.790
You did like "Better Off
Dead," "The Breakfast Club,"

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.420
"'Scarface."

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.120
Like, there's so many
things in your resume.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.450
What was that like?

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.000
Did you write those songs?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.500
What was that experience like?

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.419
EG DAILY: Some of
those songs I wrote,

00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:26.710
and some of those songs, they--

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.440
I would be in a studio
working on some soundtrack

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.399
for some movie, and
then some huge producer

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:36.440
on some other big movie
would walk in the studio.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.759
And he'd be like, who's
singing that song?

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:40.550
Who's singing that?

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.940
And I'd be like, it's me.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.830
And then they'd be
like, oh, can you

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.580
co-write with
Harold Faltermeyer,

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.471
the guy who did that, dun dun
dun-dun-dun dun dun, "Axel F"

00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:49.970
theme song?

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.670
So they'd be like, can you work
on a song for our soundtrack?

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.045
So then, the next
thing you know,

00:13:54.045 --> 00:13:55.910
I'd be writing and
singing the theme song

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:56.930
for "Thief of Hearts."

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.020
And that was just a weird thing.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.340
I mean, my thing is I love
music and I love writing music,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.830
and music has like
really run my life.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.502
Like, I just feel
like it changes my--

00:14:09.502 --> 00:14:10.460
it just rocks my world.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.450
Music rocks my world.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.452
Like, it changes everything.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:15.160
Like, I could be
talking to you right now

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.420
and playing this
one kind of music

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.820
and then I see you one way,
playing another kind of music,

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.736
I see you another way.

00:14:19.736 --> 00:14:22.570
So to me, it was always my
deep, deep passion to do music.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.690
And I don't know.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.670
Whenever I did a
movie, I'd be like, oh.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.980
I think I have a
song for this movie.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.372
For "Rugrats," I'd be
like, I have the song.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.580
It's called "Changing Faces."

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.190
And the next thing you know,
I'd get it in that movie.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.020
Music just started to--

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.857
it all just sort of fall on top
of each other-- music and then

00:14:40.857 --> 00:14:42.940
a movie and then an acting
and then a voice thing.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.979
And you know, so like
I never get bored.

00:14:44.979 --> 00:14:46.145
DORINA ARELLANO: Apparently.

00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:47.110
EG DAILY: And I'm a mom too.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.820
DORINA ARELLANO: And
apparently, you do it all too.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.260
EG DAILY: Yeah, I kind of do.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.635
I think I'd be bored if I
didn't keep changing it up.

00:14:52.635 --> 00:14:53.551
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:54.490
That makes sense.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.030
So speaking of music,
you recently wrote a song

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.720
and also made a music video for
this song called "So Pretty."

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.420
So I want to talk about
what I'm kind of hearing is

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.640
called the So Pretty movement.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.740
And it basically,
correct me if I'm wrong,

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.560
but it kind of
talks about how it's

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.480
great to want to look
good on the outside,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.900
but it's more important to
look within and be beautiful

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.890
inside and kind.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.125
And can you talk about that?

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:19.750
EG DAILY: Yeah.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.700
So the So Pretty
movement came because I'm

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.560
a mom of two really beautiful
millennial young women.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.290
And I guess because
my career was always

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.900
based on-- luckily, I
got into voiceover so I

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.630
had some relief from it, but
my whole career was based

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.000
on how I looked and
my size and my weight

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.562
and my face and my skin.

00:15:39.562 --> 00:15:41.770
You know, there was so much
importance on the outside

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.360
that I suffered a lot.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.240
I mean, I went through all those
phases of like eating disorders

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.070
and really battled.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.980
Like, I wanted to be good
on the outside all the time.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.114
And then what happens
is I become a mother,

00:15:53.114 --> 00:15:55.030
and then I have to be
responsible for my kids.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.460
So my girls are like typical
girls, and they'll be like,

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.270
do I look fat?

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.140
Do I look fat?

00:15:59.140 --> 00:15:59.870
Do I look fat?

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.290
And it's like, oh, my
god, because I did that,

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.710
but I had to change it.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.950
I had to change it
up and my practice

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.780
was not to say anything
about their body

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.410
and say, how do you feel?

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.660
You know, how are you feeling?

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.670
And they'd be like, I don't
know but do I look fat?

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.378
And I'm like, no.

00:16:13.378 --> 00:16:14.440
How do you feel?

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.290
And my daughter would start
crying and say, I feel sad.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.740
And so I think what happened
is the "So Pretty" song

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.600
came about as I was
writing a bunch of songs

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.159
for some new things, and I wrote
with these two new writers,

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:26.950
Elliott and Elijah.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.757
And this song came out, and
it was called "So Pretty,"

00:16:29.757 --> 00:16:31.090
and it was all about that thing.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.972
And I felt like it
was so channeled,

00:16:32.972 --> 00:16:34.930
because the song happened
in like-- we wrote it

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.330
from top to bottom in
like 30 minutes, lyrics,

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.750
everything was done.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.560
And when we got done writing
it, I left the session that day,

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.755
and I was like, I have
to release that song.

00:16:43.755 --> 00:16:45.130
And they were
like, well, we were

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.870
going to submit it
for this other artist.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.930
And I was like, I have to
release that song because it

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.730
matters so much to me.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.215
And the song was about--

00:16:53.215 --> 00:16:56.740
you know, especially now
there's the Kardashians,

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.510
and they're
beautiful, and they do

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.760
a lot in the realm
of like fashion,

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.386
and they're very fashion
forward, and you learn a lot.

00:17:03.386 --> 00:17:04.760
But there's also
a lot of things.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.240
There's a lot of
augmentation that goes on,

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.410
and that's dangerous.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.000
And I actually have
friends that have

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.520
done things that are so
dangerous to their bodies

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.640
and their faces that--

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.510
you know, there's one
woman in the video.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.170
You'll see the video.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.836
I won't tell you who
she is, but there's

00:17:18.836 --> 00:17:21.460
one woman that almost
lost her life because she

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.920
had her boobs done so
many times and her body

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.319
lipoed so many times that
she end up getting staph.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:29.897
And then they had to put like
a PICC line into her heart

00:17:29.897 --> 00:17:31.480
so the staph wouldn't
go to her brain.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.813
I mean, it's really scary stuff.

00:17:32.813 --> 00:17:35.920
But to me, I thought it was
really important to make sure

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.640
that if you're
feeling like you have

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.580
to do that much stuff
on your outsides,

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.890
well then you better do that
much stuff on your insides

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.630
to fill yourself up,
because somewhere,

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.010
there's a hole leaking.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.500
And that means like--

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.520
I know for myself too.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.540
I'm going like, oh, my god.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.320
I'm getting so wrinkly.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:53.620
Oh, my god.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.310
My neck is dropping.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.810
Oh, my god.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:55.420
Oh, my god.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.580
And it's like, then I say,
what's really going on here?

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.810
Like, where am I feeling empty?

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.490
Where am I not getting
the attention I need

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:01.510
or the love that I need?

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.890
So that's what "So
Pretty" is all about.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.680
It's all about going deeper.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.380
You know, fixing the
outsides is a bottomless pit.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.510
For men and women,
it's a bottomless pit.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.100
You can work on
yourself like crazy,

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.420
but the work has to
start from the inside,

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.370
and you have to love
yourself on the inside.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.550
And you have to ask
yourself, do I like myself?

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.050
Am I being a kind person?

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.815
Am I being an evolving person?

00:18:22.815 --> 00:18:24.940
And so that's what the So
Pretty movement is about,

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.094
and the song is basically that.

00:18:27.094 --> 00:18:28.510
And there's a lot
of versions I've

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.180
been releasing like on
Instagram, some B-track

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.600
versions, short
clips of where I did

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.120
some even funny versions
and some campy versions

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.140
of the same message.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.890
So check those out as well.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.620
But this is the
"So Pretty" video.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:41.790
Did you want to--

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.060
DORINA ARELLANO:
That's super cool.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.750
No, I saw it.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:44.249
Yeah, no.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.040
It's great.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.160
And we'll watch it here
before audience questions.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.290
So thank you for doing
something like that.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.300
That's very important
and very cool.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.470
And you also are very much
involved in animal activism.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.340
So I want to talk about that
because animals are awesome.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.340
And so, do you have
any organizations

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.160
that you think people should
be aware of or support,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.310
or how can people help?

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.220
EG DAILY: Well,
there's a million,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.814
and that's why I like
to use my voice for--

00:19:13.814 --> 00:19:15.230
that's one of the
biggest places I

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.021
like to use my voice,
other than animation,

00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:19.530
but to speak for the
ones that can't speak.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.040
So there's like Last
Chance for Animals.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.650
They do the most
incredible animal activism

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:25.760
work you will ever see.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.590
I mean, Chris
DeRose, who runs it,

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.310
has been shot saving animals
from cruel and horrible animal

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.790
abuse all over the world in
different spectrums of animal

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.510
abuse.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.968
So that's one of the main ones
that I do a lot of work for.

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:40.730
And there's also smaller ones
like Tobie's Small Dog Rescue.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.842
If you go to Instagram, look
up Tobie's Small Dog Rescue.

00:19:43.842 --> 00:19:45.300
And that just
happens to be a woman

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:50.090
I met who just has this huge
heart, and goes to shelters

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:54.170
and rescues a lot of little
dogs that the owners just

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.470
didn't take care of.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.890
And they were dying
of something or they

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.590
were suffering from something,
and they basically just say,

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.950
we don't want it anymore.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.270
And the dogs are in the pound
like, where's my family?

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.910
You know, they're so sad
and it's so sad to me.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.390
But this one woman, Tee from
Tobie's Small Dog Rescue,

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.280
goes and pulls them
from these shelters.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.620
And they're a mess,
and then what I do

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.255
is I foster some of these.

00:20:17.255 --> 00:20:19.790
A lot of these little
dogs, I bring home.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.380
And some of them
are so-- like, one

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.440
was thrown out of a car
window, a moving car window.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.700
Tiny dog, on its head.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.230
And somebody saw it and
thought the dog was dead,

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.137
and then rescued it.

00:20:29.137 --> 00:20:31.220
And then the dog was like
falling over for a while

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.780
because it had head trauma.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.470
And then I take that dog, and
I just hold it on my chest

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.300
and love it until
it feels safe again.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.620
And it takes them a
long time sometimes.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.750
So there's so many things.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.210
There's so many things you
could do, little or small,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.030
for animals.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.700
Yeah.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.210
DORINA ARELLANO:
That was so great.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.685
So I wanted to play
a little game--

00:20:48.685 --> 00:20:49.230
EG DAILY: OK.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.820
I like games.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.370
DORINA ARELLANO: --because
you're very talented.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.050
So I wanted to come
up with some questions

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.500
that you could answer in
your legendary voices.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.450
EG DAILY: Awesome, OK.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:06.870
I'm going to take this off by
I feel nervous a little bit.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:07.700
OK.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.923
DORINA ARELLANO: What are
some of your favorite movies?

00:21:10.923 --> 00:21:14.220
EG DAILY: (IN TOMMY PICKLES'
VOICE) Let me see here.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.720
I really like "Babe"
even though I'm not

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.590
doing Babe's voice right now.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.600
And I don't just like it
because I did the voice of Babe.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.940
(REGULAR VOICE) I also liked
(IN HIGHER VOICE) "Happy Feet."

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:32.750
(REGULAR VOICE) As
far as on-camera,

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.959
(IN BUTTERCUP'S VOICE) I
really like "This is 40."

00:21:34.959 --> 00:21:37.000
You know the movie, "This
is 40." (REGULAR VOICE)

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.041
Is that what it's called?

00:21:38.041 --> 00:21:40.330
(IN BUTTERCUP'S
VOICE) Going on 40?

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.215
I really like that movie
because it was really accurate.

00:21:44.215 --> 00:21:45.105
(REGULAR VOICE) Yeah.

00:21:45.105 --> 00:21:47.020
DORINA ARELLANO:
That was so good.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.110
What do you Google the most?

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.212
EG DAILY: Animal rescue videos.

00:21:53.212 --> 00:21:54.170
People think I'm crazy.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.500
I'm always like
[IMITATING CRYING],, you know,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.620
watching these videos, crying
because they're so remarkable.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.150
These dogs are so forgiving.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.710
So that's my main thing I
think I watch, animal videos.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:07.030
And then I watch
autobiographies because I

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.520
like learning about
people's journeys,

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.140
especially people
that have had like--

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.473
most of the time, if anybody's
got a really cool career,

00:22:13.473 --> 00:22:14.830
they've had some rough times.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.055
Because usually,
you go through life,

00:22:17.055 --> 00:22:18.430
and you have these
journeys where

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.200
you have like all kinds
of stuff happen to you,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.658
and then you're able to be a
messenger for such cool stuff.

00:22:22.658 --> 00:22:26.220
So I like messages and
I like learning them

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.840
and I like teaching them
and I like videos with them.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.720
DORINA ARELLANO: OK, cool.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.530
I got another game
question for you.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.580
EG DAILY: Google is
the bomb, by the way.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.205
Right? (IN HIGHER
VOICE) I love Google!

00:22:41.635 --> 00:22:44.560
DORINA ARELLANO: Can you answer
as Buttercup, what music do you

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.462
listen to?

00:22:45.462 --> 00:22:47.420
EG DAILY: (IN BUTTERCUP'S
VOICE) Well, I really

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.500
like bands like Coldplay.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.950
Adam Levine does
some good songs.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.390
Let me think here.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.480
What's your favorites?

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.930
DORINA ARELLANO: My favorite?

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.430
Oh, that's a lot.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.830
Everything from the
Beatles to Mozart

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.970
to Billie Ellish, everyone.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.134
EG DAILY: Billie Ellish.

00:23:08.134 --> 00:23:09.050
I really like her too.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:09.230
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.770
She's really cool.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.270
You guys, Buttercup is
talking to me right now.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.685
I'm kind of freaking out.

00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:13.810
EG DAILY: Don't freak out.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:14.692
Just calm down.

00:23:14.692 --> 00:23:17.150
DORINA ARELLANO: In a good way,
freaking out in a good way.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.150
EG DAILY: I mean, there's really
just so many different kinds

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.580
of artists I like.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.270
I actually like
Justin Bieber too.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.500
I like some of his songs too.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.500
DORINA ARELLANO: Buttercup's
into Justin Bieber.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.530
EG DAILY: Even
though he's a brat.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.930
He's kind of a brat like me.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:30.430
Yeah.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.824
Is he really married?

00:23:34.824 --> 00:23:35.990
DORINA ARELLANO: I think so.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.150
That's what the Instagrams say.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:37.900
EG DAILY: Dang it!

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.130
No, I'm just kidding.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.030
DORINA ARELLANO: So,
EG, what would you

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.441
be doing if you weren't
an actress or musician?

00:23:44.441 --> 00:23:48.896
EG DAILY: I think I'd be a
veterinarian or a paramedic.

00:23:48.896 --> 00:23:49.395
Yeah.

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:51.870
DORINA ARELLANO: Trying to help
people and animals as well.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:52.110
EG DAILY: I think so.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.990
I just have a thing.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.970
I just have a thing
about healing people.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.685
That would be my superpower
if I was a real superhero

00:23:59.685 --> 00:24:00.690
with a superpower.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.149
That would be my superpower
I'd want, is the power to heal.

00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:04.190
DORINA ARELLANO: To heal?

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.140
That's a good one.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.810
And then we're going to open
the floor to audience questions,

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.000
so please think
of some good ones.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.530
AUDIENCE: I am curious.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.210
You know, throughout your
experience in entertainment,

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.270
in this industry, was there
either a mistake you made

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:22.610
or a really
challenging event that

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.590
might have occurred to you
that you're so glad happened?

00:24:27.929 --> 00:24:29.470
EG DAILY: I mean,
there were a couple

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.030
of those times in
my career where

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.770
I felt like I made
a bad decision,

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.260
where like I turned
down something

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.730
that, once I turned
it down, afterward,

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.830
I was like, oh, my god.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.510
What did I do that for?

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.780
And I battled myself for
years on certain decisions.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.670
Like if I had made
this better decision,

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.800
then I would have
been there probably.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.050
But I really think
that everything really

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.680
does happen the way
it's supposed to,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.990
and I think because I've
really applied myself

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.690
to learning that everything
happens for a reason,

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.240
like everything.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:06.560
And then there was a time where
I went through a lot of anxiety

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.820
and had like a midlife crisis
of like severe anxiety.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.320
And I didn't know what that was.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.150
I was like, what is anxiety?

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.610
Like, I thought something
was really wrong.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:17.837
I was like, I'm--

00:25:17.837 --> 00:25:18.670
can I say fucked up?

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:19.480
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.980
EG DAILY: I thought
I was fucked up.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.370
I was like, am I ever
going to be normal.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.310
I literally was like, what
is happening to my body?

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.030
And then at the moment,
I was just like,

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.720
I don't know how people survive
feeling that kind of anxiety

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.870
in their body.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.530
And I did a lot of
learning about it.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.300
I studied a lot and I went in.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.540
And it was a scary time.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.900
People were like,
what's wrong with you?

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.760
You're not yourself.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.340
And I'm like, I'm not myself.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.100
I don't know who this
person is, but it's not me.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.700
You know, and then that
time period actually

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.260
forced me to do the kind of
work that changed my life,

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.400
and the kind of work that
made me have so much more

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.950
compassion for
everybody that is going

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.550
through any kind of thing,
and the kind of work that

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.850
made me have a lot more
humility and more gratitude

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:08.490
for everything.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.720
So I would say that's a
really great question.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.490
And I think that if people
are going through a dark time,

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.140
that's a really incredible time.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.870
And know that, around
the bend, is some magic.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.680
And I think when you're
feeling that dark,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.794
it just means that you have to--

00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:29.210
when you're in a
real darkness, it

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.440
forces you to take certain steps
to find back to a lit-up path

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.550
again.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.980
And that just means you're
going to do a little more work.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.770
And it's pretty
incredible what happens

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:40.950
on the other side of that.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.410
So I would say yeah.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.160
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.265
Thank you.

00:26:44.265 --> 00:26:45.890
DORINA ARELLANO:
Thank you for sharing.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:46.990
Next question.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.300
AUDIENCE: Did you say that
when you auditioned for Tommy

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.989
Pickles that it was claymation?

00:26:51.989 --> 00:26:53.030
Did I hear you correctly?

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:53.655
EG DAILY: Yeah.

00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:55.190
They actually showed
me a claymation

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.290
of Tommy Pickles when I
first auditioned for it.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.040
AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:58.831
That's fascinating.

00:26:58.831 --> 00:27:02.774
So "Rugrats," like in the
pilot, it was claymation?

00:27:02.774 --> 00:27:04.190
How did they make
that transition?

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.210
EG DAILY: No.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.660
I think they actually did a
claymation for the animators

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.720
so they could see the real
full spectrum of the character.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.270
But to be honest
about Tommy Pickles

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.422
was I actually wasn't
the first Tommy Pickles.

00:27:16.422 --> 00:27:17.880
I don't know if
anybody knows that,

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.260
but they actually had
cast someone else.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.535
They had done a whole
season worth of the show

00:27:22.535 --> 00:27:24.410
before they aired it,
and then they, I guess,

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.240
wanted to change the voice.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.530
So I came in afterward
and had to re-dub all

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.170
of the episodes they had done.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.880
But I think the
claymation was just

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.678
a way to show what the
character looked in three--

00:27:38.678 --> 00:27:41.780
you know, in the palm of
your hand and not just

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.743
a two-dimensional or you know--

00:27:43.743 --> 00:27:44.510
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.200
Very cool.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.200
DORINA ARELLANO: Over here.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.294
EG DAILY: I get so nervous
when you throw that thing.

00:27:52.294 --> 00:27:55.180
AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
is there any voice

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.400
that you've done that
you found especially

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.370
difficult to do or to keep up?

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:01.780
EG DAILY: Yes.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.030
One was the voice of--

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.887
you know the live action,
the "Little Rascals" feature?

00:28:06.887 --> 00:28:07.970
DORINA ARELLANO: Oh, yeah.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:08.260
EG DAILY: Yeah.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.180
So they did the live
action, and then the boy

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.495
that did that voice, they
needed it to be scratchier.

00:28:12.495 --> 00:28:14.870
So he was like (IN SCRATCHY
VOICE) what the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.661
(REGULAR VOICE) You
know, they wanted this.

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:19.180
And I was like, OK, here
goes, which was really

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.800
ripping for your throat.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.840
But it was only little batches
of Froggy in that movie,

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.034
but I did that and that
was a tough voice to do.

00:28:27.034 --> 00:28:28.450
And also, there
was a movie called

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.030
"Lorenzo's Oil"
that was, I think,

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.842
Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte?

00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:36.050
Susan Sarandon, and I can't
remember the other actor.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.620
But it was a really
cool movie, live action,

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.350
about a boy who was ill.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:45.490
And then as he started
to deteriorate,

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.170
he couldn't do the
acting it required

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.670
because he was so little.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.260
So then they
brought me in, which

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.140
happened to be the same director
I did "Babe 1" and "Babe

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.780
2" and "Happy Feet"
for, George Miller,

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.404
who did all the Mad Max movies.

00:28:56.404 --> 00:28:57.820
And so they brought
me in on that.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.069
That was the first one I
worked on with George Miller.

00:29:00.069 --> 00:29:04.570
And that movie, they had to
lie me in a giant soundstage.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.670
There was a giant
screen back here.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.630
And they lied me on the ground
and they put a mic over me

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:11.470
while I lied down.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.770
And the director
would be on his knees,

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.130
and be like pressing on
my ribs and my chest.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.915
Or I'd be standing
in front of him

00:29:19.915 --> 00:29:21.790
and he'd be like squeezing
my ribs like that,

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:22.690
and that was tough too.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.382
So I'd have to be like
[DEMONSTRATING STRUGGLING

00:29:24.382 --> 00:29:24.900
VOICE].

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.050
It was like that.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.950
And that is how fancy
and sexy you can be.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:31.450
Yeah.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:32.366
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:29:32.366 --> 00:29:34.780
Going off of that
question, actually,

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:39.264
have you ever actually like lost
your voice just from working?

00:29:39.264 --> 00:29:41.110
EG DAILY: I have a
really strong voice,

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.440
I think, from doing
so much singing.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.330
But there were times where--

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:47.380
it's pretty rare.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.830
I mean, I usually can push
myself right through it.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.380
So let's say I'm
here, and I actually

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.480
am getting over a little cold.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.890
But, and then (IN HIGHER VOICE)
if I need to go right here,

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.227
I just kind of push it over it.

00:29:57.227 --> 00:29:58.810
I sort of push it
right over the cold.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.270
You put sort of
energy behind it so

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.978
that I'm able to like,
(IN ELDERLY VOICE)

00:30:06.978 --> 00:30:09.560
if I want to talk like an old
lady who says, honey, why don't

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.210
you come over some time?

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.240
You know, I just kind of
push past the voice a little

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.280
bit into another place.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.760
There's been a few times
where I had some kind of cold.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.960
It's very rare that I can't push
past it, where I lost my voice

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.999
and I like had to
push the session back.

00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:28.040
But yeah, not that often.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.010
DORINA ARELLANO: That's awesome.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.800
I just love how you can
just transition immediately

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.670
into any voices.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.105
It's very, very incredible.

00:30:33.105 --> 00:30:33.896
EG DAILY: It's fun.

00:30:33.896 --> 00:30:36.830
It's fun especially when there
are telemarketers calling you.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:37.504
It really is.

00:30:37.504 --> 00:30:39.170
And then you're like
(IN CHILDISH VOICE)

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.025
my mom's not here right now.

00:30:41.025 --> 00:30:42.770
Can she call you later?

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.440
Can we have your number,
and we'll call you

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.205
at your dinnertime too?

00:30:47.205 --> 00:30:49.265
And they're like
[IMITATING PANIC]

00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:51.780
DORINA ARELLANO: Can I hire
you to do that for [INAUDIBLE]??

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.076
EG DAILY: Absolutely.

00:30:53.076 --> 00:30:58.214
DORINA ARELLANO: Next
question back there.

00:30:58.214 --> 00:31:00.230
AUDIENCE: All right,
another "Rugrats" question.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.860
You spoke fondly of the
show because a lot of it

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.585
was about family and
everyone can relate to it.

00:31:07.585 --> 00:31:08.960
So it was funny
and fun to watch,

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.334
but like a lot of good shows,
there's so much more to it.

00:31:11.334 --> 00:31:15.240
There's a lot of lessons,
especially for kid viewers.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.980
So it was about friendship,
forgiveness, disappointment,

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.850
everything.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:24.140
Was there any episode or moment
in the show that you remember

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.010
being particularly proud of?

00:31:28.602 --> 00:31:31.675
EG DAILY: I think, overall,
with "Rugrats," I loved them--

00:31:31.675 --> 00:31:33.300
I mean, I learned a
lot from "Rugrats."

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.042
I loved them teaching us about--

00:31:35.042 --> 00:31:36.750
you know, when they
did like the Passover

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:40.140
episodes and the different
religious holidays

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.650
and really embracing all that.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.790
And I think it was,
in general, I just

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.160
loved that they brought up
all kinds of subject matter--

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.140
single parenting,
and the feelings

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.750
that a child goes through
where they only have one

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.420
parent, and the loss of that.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:58.500
And for me, I just really liked
where they got a little deep.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.910
And I kind of like deep.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:01.540
I like deep sometimes.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.810
But I think those were the ones.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.840
I mean, particularly, if I were
to really look at episodes,

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.616
I really love the naked episode
where Tommy talks about being--

00:32:09.616 --> 00:32:11.490
(IN TOMMY PICKLES' VOICE)
I like being nakey!

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.940
(REGULAR VOICE)
You know, I mean,

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:17.640
who doesn't like being nakey,
and just the feelings of just

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.240
that--

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:18.940
you know.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.790
I think I really
like that episode.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.970
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:23.671
Thank you.

00:32:23.671 --> 00:32:26.722
DORINA ARELLANO: Over there.

00:32:26.722 --> 00:32:28.740
AUDIENCE: So I want
to start off by saying

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.555
thank you for being one of
the voices of my childhood.

00:32:30.555 --> 00:32:30.725
EG DAILY: Yeah.

00:32:30.725 --> 00:32:31.350
You're welcome.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.870
AUDIENCE: I very
much appreciate it.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.000
But I have a question about
your creative process.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.382
So when you are trying
to voice a character

00:32:38.382 --> 00:32:39.840
like a human
character, you say you

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.710
can match someone's
mouth with the voice they

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.060
should be making.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.760
But when someone says,
OK, we brought you here

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.120
to be the voice of this
talking bridge, what

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.770
goes through your
mind to say, this

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:56.010
is exactly how this bridge
is supposed to sound?

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.260
EG DAILY: That's
a great question.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.100
Well, I would look at the
bridge, and I would see,

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.520
is it a girthy bridge?

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.305
Is it a stone bridge?

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.297
Is it rickety?

00:33:12.297 --> 00:33:14.630
I mean, I would literally
just look at all those things.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.379
(IN DEEP VOICE) So if
was a girthy bridge,

00:33:16.379 --> 00:33:17.975
I would bring in some depth.

00:33:17.975 --> 00:33:21.214
(REGULAR VOICE) You know,
if it's an old bridge,

00:33:21.214 --> 00:33:23.630
(IN ELDERLY VOICE) I might
bring in a little older bridge.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.460
(REGULAR VOICE) You
know, I literally

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.120
would just look at the
materials that the bridge is,

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:34.306
and then just base it on that.

00:33:34.306 --> 00:33:35.180
You know what I mean?

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:38.720
It works.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.479
I don't know how it
works, but it works.

00:33:40.479 --> 00:33:42.770
And usually, the first voice
that comes out of my mouth

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:43.820
is usually the right one.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.270
Sometimes they might say,
OK, now do that voice, but--

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.640
like for "Rugrats,"
when they did "Rugrats,"

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.270
and then they did
"All Growed Up,"

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.070
it was (IN TOMMY PICKLES' VOICE)
Tommy Pickles talks right here.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.260
(REGULAR VOICE) And
then they'd say,

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.540
now we're going to
do Tommy Pickles

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.956
all growed up, a
little bit older.

00:33:57.956 --> 00:34:00.689
So then you just have to imagine
like dialing it up on a radio.

00:34:00.689 --> 00:34:03.230
Like, (IN TOMMY PICKLES' VOICE)
Tommy Pickles talk like this,

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.925
and then they want him
to be a little bit older,

00:34:04.925 --> 00:34:06.830
so then I keep his
voice a little cracky,

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.565
but he's sort of
like a teen boy.

00:34:08.565 --> 00:34:09.440
You know what I mean?

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:09.940
So there.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:10.940
That's how you do it.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.199
It's weird, but it works.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.292
EG DAILY: You're welcome.

00:34:14.292 --> 00:34:15.710
DORINA ARELLANO: So good.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.960
And going off of his question
too, I wanted to ask,

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.449
for just on-camera
acting, assuming

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.840
you use some of the
same voice skills

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.558
that you developed
because-- you know,

00:34:24.558 --> 00:34:28.940
if you have like Candy from
"Devil's Rejects" as opposed

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.240
to like a Dottie from Pee-wee.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:30.739
Right?

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:34.810
Like, they were all
very different voices.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.656
Do you use the same
techniques as well?

00:34:36.656 --> 00:34:38.239
EG DAILY: Kind of,
yeah, a little bit.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:41.600
Like Rob Zombie on "31," which
is the most recent one where

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.659
I have the blue hair, you
know, he actually said to me,

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.239
I want to do something different
with this character's voice.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:50.630
And I really love that
because normally directors

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:51.230
don't do that.

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.120
But Rob's a singer, you know.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:59.020
And so I really love
that I got to make

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.260
this character a little bit
like a cartoon come to life.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.660
Like she was wearing blue and
I had these little bloomers on.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.070
My wardrobe came on a hanger.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.620
Clipped to the hanger was
a little plastic baggy,

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:16.150
and in the plastic baggy
was two pieces of duct tape,

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.476
like two little Xs of duct
tape, and then a little--

00:35:19.476 --> 00:35:20.530
it's so crazy.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:24.970
Anyway, everything about
that character was--

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:29.259
she was little and she was
feisty, but she was not like--

00:35:29.259 --> 00:35:29.800
I don't know.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.300
There was just
something about that.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.120
And he said, I want you to have
a particular kind of voice.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.670
And I just said, this is
a great opportunity for me

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.390
to merge what I do.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.990
And that's why Sex-Head
was (IN SEX-HEAD'S VOICE)

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:42.230
see you later, Popeye.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.920
I'm going to go get
me some spinach.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.970
I don't talk as sweet
as that, but she did.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:51.487
DORINA ARELLANO: I
mean, it felt like I

00:35:51.487 --> 00:35:52.570
was watching a comic book.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:53.110
EG DAILY: Yeah, I love that.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.040
That was what was
so fun about it.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.340
DORINA ARELLANO: It was so cool.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.480
EG DAILY: I'd like
to do more movies

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.820
like that, where I get to be
a comic book character come

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.319
to life.

00:35:58.319 --> 00:36:00.310
Because it's so
limitless, like what

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:04.360
you can do with wardrobe and
makeup and hair, and you know,

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.570
it's incredible.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.180
And then change your voice up.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.349
I'd like to be like a
small little Gremlin thing

00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:11.140
where I'm just like
(IN LOW SCRATCHY VOICE)

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.975
I don't really like
that very-- you know.

00:36:13.975 --> 00:36:15.250
It's just limitless.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.330
DORINA ARELLANO:
Gremlins 3, maybe they

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:17.000
should get you on there.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.666
EG DAILY: Right?

00:36:17.666 --> 00:36:20.130
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.210
EG, where can people find you?

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:25.390
EG DAILY: You guys can find
me on Instagram and Twitter

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:29.150
at RealEGDaily, because
there's some fake ones.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:33.150
So make sure it says "real"
before my name, EG Daily,

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.540
like daily news.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.960
And then I'm also on Facebook.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.770
I have a fan Facebook and a
regular, so try to find those.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.410
And then I also have
EGDaily.com where

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:42.820
it has everything on there.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.090
I mean, you can get all
my handles on there,

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:46.960
the correct ones.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.745
And I think my Instagram
feed's on there.

00:36:49.745 --> 00:36:50.620
So it's all on there.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.100
And then my YouTube page has a
lot of music videos and things

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.870
that I put out there on YouTube.

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:58.750
So EG Daily on EG
Daily's YouTube page.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:02.050
But keeping it
real, RealEGDaily.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.730
That's me, yeah.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.010
And I try to answer-- like,
people will message me.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.590
And you know, like if you
guys have any questions

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.560
or you have a real passion
or desire to connect with me,

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.040
I really try to follow, when
I feel that from people,

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.300
to make myself accessible.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.060
Because I've met some of the
most incredible people that--

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:25.314
one of my best
friends was a stalker,

00:37:25.314 --> 00:37:26.980
and she turned out
to be my best friend.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.380
She literally followed me at
these concerts I was doing.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.052
And she scared me
at first, and she

00:37:31.052 --> 00:37:33.010
would be like, I took
all these pictures of you

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:33.700
and here's a book.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.480
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.440
She's a stalker.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.370
But then over time--

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.126
DORINA ARELLANO: It
wasn't me, you guys.

00:37:38.126 --> 00:37:39.876
EG DAILY: I was wondering
if that was you.

00:37:39.876 --> 00:37:42.400
No, she was Spanish.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.210
Anyway, she ended up like--

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:47.740
she just kept
connecting to me and I

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.860
felt her incredible
desire to be connected.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.834
And over time, she ended
up being my assistant,

00:37:54.834 --> 00:37:55.750
my personal assistant.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:57.541
And then she became
one of my best friends,

00:37:57.541 --> 00:38:00.640
and I was just her maid
of honor at her wedding

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.056
to her girlfriend in Hawaii.

00:38:02.056 --> 00:38:02.680
It was amazing.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.110
DORINA ARELLANO: What
an incredible story.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:04.985
EG DAILY: Incredible.

00:38:04.985 --> 00:38:07.810
So I try to keep myself
open for magical connections

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:08.410
with people.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.755
And you know, you never know.

00:38:09.755 --> 00:38:10.630
DORINA ARELLANO: See?

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.515
So the story is be kind, right?

00:38:12.515 --> 00:38:13.390
That works sometimes.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.000
EG DAILY: Be kind and
follow your desire.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.920
If you want to meet
someone, make it happen.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:23.840
People like me will allow you
to come over and hang out.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.724
Well, I don't know
about that, but maybe.

00:38:26.724 --> 00:38:28.390
DORINA ARELLANO: Well,
thank you so much

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:32.050
for such an inspiring career,
and thank you for basically,

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:35.942
like Matt said, being the
voice of our childhood,

00:38:35.942 --> 00:38:37.150
and thank you for being here.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.690
And please come back.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.720
EG DAILY: I'm really
happy I got to be here.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.850
Thank you, guys, so much.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.200
