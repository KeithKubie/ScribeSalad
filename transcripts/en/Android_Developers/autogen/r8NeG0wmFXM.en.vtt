good morning everyone and welcome to

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930
good morning everyone and welcome to
 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.410
good morning everyone and welcome to
this talk about color so how many of you

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420
this talk about color so how many of you
 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.200
this talk about color so how many of you
think they understand color raise your

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
think they understand color raise your
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.700
think they understand color raise your
hand nobody ok I guess that's why you're

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
hand nobody ok I guess that's why you're
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.640
hand nobody ok I guess that's why you're
here so I gave a similar talk last year

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650
here so I gave a similar talk last year
 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.859
here so I gave a similar talk last year
at the end of 360 and there was a lot of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
at the end of 360 and there was a lot of
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.960
at the end of 360 and there was a lot of
math in a lot of equations and a lot of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
math in a lot of equations and a lot of
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.849
math in a lot of equations and a lot of
worried developers asked me if there's

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859
worried developers asked me if there's
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.230
worried developers asked me if there's
going to be math in this presentation

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
going to be math in this presentation
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.570
going to be math in this presentation
there's going to be no mass no equations

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
there's going to be no mass no equations
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.380
there's going to be no mass no equations
instead there's going to be physics so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
instead there's going to be physics so
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.450
instead there's going to be physics so
let's talk about color the first

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
let's talk about color the first
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.010
let's talk about color the first
question we have to ask ourselves is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
question we have to ask ourselves is
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.959
question we have to ask ourselves is
what is color it sounds like you know a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
what is color it sounds like you know a
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.130
what is color it sounds like you know a
deep question the answer is not so deep

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140
deep question the answer is not so deep
 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.630
deep question the answer is not so deep
so here's the definition that applies to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
so here's the definition that applies to
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.150
so here's the definition that applies to
most of us as human beings on that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
most of us as human beings on that
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.770
most of us as human beings on that
developers were just regular people so

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780
developers were just regular people so
 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.680
developers were just regular people so
it's a visual visual perception that can

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
it's a visual visual perception that can
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930
it's a visual visual perception that can
be described by a hue brightness and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
be described by a hue brightness and
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819
be described by a hue brightness and
colorfulness sometimes colorfulness is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
colorfulness sometimes colorfulness is
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.000
colorfulness sometimes colorfulness is
also called saturation and if you've

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
also called saturation and if you've
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.990
also called saturation and if you've
ever used the HLS HSL or HSV colors in

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
ever used the HLS HSL or HSV colors in
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.520
ever used the HLS HSL or HSV colors in
the Android API you might be familiar

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530
the Android API you might be familiar
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.650
the Android API you might be familiar
with that kind of definition what's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
with that kind of definition what's
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149
with that kind of definition what's
really important to understand is that

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
really important to understand is that
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.649
really important to understand is that
color is just the perception of our

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
color is just the perception of our
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719
color is just the perception of our
brain it's not the real thing

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
brain it's not the real thing
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.539
brain it's not the real thing
and we're going to see why that is so

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
and we're going to see why that is so
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460
and we're going to see why that is so
obviously we see colors with our eyes

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
obviously we see colors with our eyes
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710
obviously we see colors with our eyes
and if any of you does lexy color

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
and if any of you does lexy color
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.330
and if any of you does lexy color
through another mean I would love to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
through another mean I would love to
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.080
through another mean I would love to
talk to you and to understand how we

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
talk to you and to understand how we
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480
talk to you and to understand how we
perceive color we first have to go back

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
perceive color we first have to go back
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.859
perceive color we first have to go back
22 high school or college and and try to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
22 high school or college and and try to
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870
22 high school or college and and try to
understand what light is made of so I'm

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
understand what light is made of so I'm
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.219
understand what light is made of so I'm
sure most of you know that light is made

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
sure most of you know that light is made
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770
sure most of you know that light is made
of photons but there's a duality to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
of photons but there's a duality to
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.719
of photons but there's a duality to
light it can be a wave or a particle and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
light it can be a wave or a particle and
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.130
light it can be a wave or a particle and
we're going to look at the wave nature

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
we're going to look at the wave nature
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.069
we're going to look at the wave nature
of light first so light is an

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
of light first so light is an
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.350
of light first so light is an
electromagnetic wave and our eyes are

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
electromagnetic wave and our eyes are
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.980
electromagnetic wave and our eyes are
just receptors for those electromagnetic

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
just receptors for those electromagnetic
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.280
just receptors for those electromagnetic
waves so here's the electromagnetic

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
waves so here's the electromagnetic
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.100
waves so here's the electromagnetic
spectrum is not it's not to scale and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
spectrum is not it's not to scale and
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.350
spectrum is not it's not to scale and
from the shortest wavelength to the left

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
from the shortest wavelength to the left
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.030
from the shortest wavelength to the left
to the longest wavelength to the right

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
to the longest wavelength to the right
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.399
to the longest wavelength to the right
we have in order the gamma rays the X

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
we have in order the gamma rays the X
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.060
we have in order the gamma rays the X
rays the ultraviolet the visible

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
rays the ultraviolet the visible
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.649
rays the ultraviolet the visible
spectrum they're tiny little bit in the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
spectrum they're tiny little bit in the
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.990
spectrum they're tiny little bit in the
middle full of colors then we have the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
middle full of colors then we have the
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.900
middle full of colors then we have the
microwaves and sorry the infrared the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
microwaves and sorry the infrared the
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.449
microwaves and sorry the infrared the
microwaves and then the radio waves the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
microwaves and then the radio waves the
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.580
microwaves and then the radio waves the
part that interests us that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
part that interests us that
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.170
part that interests us that
that deadly bit in the middle so that's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
that deadly bit in the middle so that's
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.059
that deadly bit in the middle so that's
what we call the visible spectrum it

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069
what we call the visible spectrum it
 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.970
what we call the visible spectrum it
goes from about 400 nanometers to 700

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980
goes from about 400 nanometers to 700
 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.070
goes from about 400 nanometers to 700
nanometers and all of us

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080
nanometers and all of us
 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.960
nanometers and all of us
these are the only wavelengths that we

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
these are the only wavelengths that we
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.309
these are the only wavelengths that we
can see why does this matter our eyes

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319
can see why does this matter our eyes
 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.720
can see why does this matter our eyes
against it are receptors that are

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730
against it are receptors that are
 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.400
against it are receptors that are
actually made of millions of small

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
actually made of millions of small
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.960
actually made of millions of small
receptors called cones

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
receptors called cones
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.809
receptors called cones
most of us almost everybody has three

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819
most of us almost everybody has three
 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.000
most of us almost everybody has three
types of cones that can detect different

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010
types of cones that can detect different
 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.920
types of cones that can detect different
parts of that spectrum so you see the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
parts of that spectrum so you see the
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.449
parts of that spectrum so you see the
spectrum here at the bottom these are

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
spectrum here at the bottom these are
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.979
spectrum here at the bottom these are
all the wavelengths of colors that we

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989
all the wavelengths of colors that we
 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.770
all the wavelengths of colors that we
can see and this diagram shows in three

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
can see and this diagram shows in three
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.960
can see and this diagram shows in three
different colors the the sensitivity of

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
different colors the the sensitivity of
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.300
different colors the the sensitivity of
each type of cone that we have in our

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
each type of cone that we have in our
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.720
each type of cone that we have in our
eyes

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
eyes
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.490
eyes
they're called short medium and long

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
they're called short medium and long
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.350
they're called short medium and long
sometimes they are called blue green and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
sometimes they are called blue green and
 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.110
sometimes they are called blue green and
red it's not technically accurate to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
red it's not technically accurate to
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.630
red it's not technically accurate to
call them red green and blue since

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640
call them red green and blue since
 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.280
call them red green and blue since
that's what I call them shorten them in

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
that's what I call them shorten them in
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.619
that's what I call them shorten them in
all and they'll call that way because

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629
all and they'll call that way because
 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.410
all and they'll call that way because
the short ones help us see in the blue

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420
the short ones help us see in the blue
 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.750
the short ones help us see in the blue
wavelengths so ultra violet violet and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760
wavelengths so ultra violet violet and
 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.030
wavelengths so ultra violet violet and
blues then we have the medium ones that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
blues then we have the medium ones that
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.940
blues then we have the medium ones that
help us see the greenish colors and the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
help us see the greenish colors and the
 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.039
help us see the greenish colors and the
long ones that help us see green orange

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049
long ones that help us see green orange
 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.629
long ones that help us see green orange
yellow and a little bit of red and you

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639
yellow and a little bit of red and you
 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.610
yellow and a little bit of red and you
can see there's a lot of overlap between

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
can see there's a lot of overlap between
 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.009
can see there's a lot of overlap between
the the medium and the long wave the

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019
the the medium and the long wave the
 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.740
the the medium and the long wave the
longer receptors so now what is light so

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
longer receptors so now what is light so
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.720
longer receptors so now what is light so
light is a distribution of several

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730
light is a distribution of several
 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.849
light is a distribution of several
wavelengths so this is the what we call

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859
wavelengths so this is the what we call
 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.160
wavelengths so this is the what we call
the spectral power distribution

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170
the spectral power distribution
 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.780
the spectral power distribution
distribution of a light bulb so the kind

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790
distribution of a light bulb so the kind
 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.190
distribution of a light bulb so the kind
of light bulbs that you know you can

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200
of light bulbs that you know you can
 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.660
of light bulbs that you know you can
find in any house

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670
find in any house
 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.699
find in any house
it's an orange light bulb and you can

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709
it's an orange light bulb and you can
 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.740
it's an orange light bulb and you can
see the amount of energy it outputs in

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750
see the amount of energy it outputs in
 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.909
see the amount of energy it outputs in
different parts of the visible spectrum

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919
different parts of the visible spectrum
 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.949
different parts of the visible spectrum
you can see here that this type of light

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959
you can see here that this type of light
 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.039
you can see here that this type of light
bulb I will put most of its energy in

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049
bulb I will put most of its energy in
 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.839
bulb I will put most of its energy in
the red and orange part of the spectrum

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849
the red and orange part of the spectrum
 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.129
the red and orange part of the spectrum
and that's why we perceive it that way

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139
and that's why we perceive it that way
 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.349
and that's why we perceive it that way
but what happens when the lights from

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359
but what happens when the lights from
 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.159
but what happens when the lights from
that level hits our eyes so we saw that

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169
that level hits our eyes so we saw that
 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.539
that level hits our eyes so we saw that
we have those receptors that different

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
we have those receptors that different
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.099
we have those receptors that different
sensitivities so different part of the

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109
sensitivities so different part of the
 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.949
sensitivities so different part of the
of the spectrum so we just multiply the

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959
of the spectrum so we just multiply the
 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.050
of the spectrum so we just multiply the
distribution of the incoming light with

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060
distribution of the incoming light with
 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.120
distribution of the incoming light with
these with the sensitivity of our

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130
these with the sensitivity of our
 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.479
these with the sensitivity of our
different cones and the result is what

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489
different cones and the result is what
 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.479
different cones and the result is what
we perceive so when we multiply both we

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489
we perceive so when we multiply both we
 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.129
we perceive so when we multiply both we
get this so when you look at one of

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139
get this so when you look at one of
 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.839
get this so when you look at one of
those light bulbs you see almost nothing

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849
those light bulbs you see almost nothing
 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.219
those light bulbs you see almost nothing
in the blues you see a little bit of

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229
in the blues you see a little bit of
 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.409
in the blues you see a little bit of
green and more orange and red and then

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419
green and more orange and red and then
 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.719
green and more orange and red and then
our brain will interpret that as an

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729
our brain will interpret that as an
 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.580
our brain will interpret that as an
orange color the way we actually

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590
orange color the way we actually
 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.510
orange color the way we actually
interpret the result of this cone

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520
interpret the result of this cone
 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.879
interpret the result of this cone
so it is a little complicated and we

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889
so it is a little complicated and we
 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.830
so it is a little complicated and we
know last time to go into the details

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840
know last time to go into the details
 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.559
know last time to go into the details
here you can go look on Wikipedia how it

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569
here you can go look on Wikipedia how it
 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.010
here you can go look on Wikipedia how it
works if you are interested so here's

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020
works if you are interested so here's
 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.770
works if you are interested so here's
what happens exactly when we look at the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780
what happens exactly when we look at the
 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.499
what happens exactly when we look at the
light source so the light is emitted by

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509
light source so the light is emitted by
 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.420
light source so the light is emitted by
the LA sorry the this wavelengths

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430
the LA sorry the this wavelengths
 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.980
the LA sorry the this wavelengths
emitted by the light source it hits our

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990
emitted by the light source it hits our
 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.540
emitted by the light source it hits our
eyes multiplied by the current as well

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550
eyes multiplied by the current as well
 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.339
eyes multiplied by the current as well
through verses but most of the time

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349
through verses but most of the time
 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.600
through verses but most of the time
you're not looking directly at the light

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610
you're not looking directly at the light
 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.279
you're not looking directly at the light
you're looking at different objects that

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289
you're looking at different objects that
 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.350
you're looking at different objects that
surround us and how do those objects get

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360
surround us and how do those objects get
 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.050
surround us and how do those objects get
their color from so every object also

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060
their color from so every object also
 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.700
their color from so every object also
has what's called a spectral power

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710
has what's called a spectral power
 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.730
has what's called a spectral power
distribution it's a description of the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740
distribution it's a description of the
 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.770
distribution it's a description of the
wavelengths that the object can reflect

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780
wavelengths that the object can reflect
 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.719
wavelengths that the object can reflect
we call that the reflectance so some of

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729
we call that the reflectance so some of
 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.700
we call that the reflectance so some of
the wavelengths will be absorbed so for

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710
the wavelengths will be absorbed so for
 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.649
the wavelengths will be absorbed so for
instance a black object absorbs almost

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659
instance a black object absorbs almost
 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:12.480
instance a black object absorbs almost
everything that's incoming and a white

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490
everything that's incoming and a white
 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.399
everything that's incoming and a white
object will reflect pretty much all the

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409
object will reflect pretty much all the
 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.420
object will reflect pretty much all the
wavelengths so we also multiply to

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430
wavelengths so we also multiply to
 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.770
wavelengths so we also multiply to
perceive the color of an object what

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780
perceive the color of an object what
 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.210
perceive the color of an object what
happens that we have light coming down

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220
happens that we have light coming down
 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.279
happens that we have light coming down
sees of an object some of it is

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289
sees of an object some of it is
 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.110
sees of an object some of it is
reflected so we just multiply the two

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120
reflected so we just multiply the two
 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.899
reflected so we just multiply the two
distributions then it hits our eyes and

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909
distributions then it hits our eyes and
 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.899
distributions then it hits our eyes and
we get the the final perceive color

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909
we get the the final perceive color
 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.540
we get the the final perceive color
what's very interesting here is that any

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550
what's very interesting here is that any
 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.649
what's very interesting here is that any
combination because it's a

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659
combination because it's a
 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.110
combination because it's a
multiplication any combination of light

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120
multiplication any combination of light
 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.709
multiplication any combination of light
and reflectance can yield to the same

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719
and reflectance can yield to the same
 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.540
and reflectance can yield to the same
perceived color in our brain so

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550
perceived color in our brain so
 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.100
perceived color in our brain so
basically for example is that if you

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110
basically for example is that if you
 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.170
basically for example is that if you
have an orange object lead by white

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180
have an orange object lead by white
 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.450
have an orange object lead by white
light you can ask it orange but if you

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460
light you can ask it orange but if you
 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.219
light you can ask it orange but if you
have a white object lead by an orange

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229
have a white object lead by an orange
 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.930
have a white object lead by an orange
light you're also going to see it orange

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940
light you're also going to see it orange
 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.939
light you're also going to see it orange
and our brain does a lot of

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949
and our brain does a lot of
 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.950
and our brain does a lot of
post-processing really to help us

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960
post-processing really to help us
 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.629
post-processing really to help us
understand what is the color of the

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639
understand what is the color of the
 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:58.589
understand what is the color of the
light what is the color of the object

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599
light what is the color of the object
 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.300
light what is the color of the object
and you know a few years ago there was

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310
and you know a few years ago there was
 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.029
and you know a few years ago there was
this famous example of the press some

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039
this famous example of the press some
 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.499
this famous example of the press some
people were saying it's in black and

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509
people were saying it's in black and
 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.270
people were saying it's in black and
blue some people were saying it in gold

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280
blue some people were saying it in gold
 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.370
blue some people were saying it in gold
and something else and that's exactly

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380
and something else and that's exactly
 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.010
and something else and that's exactly
what's happening is that some of us were

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020
what's happening is that some of us were
 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.689
what's happening is that some of us were
interpreting the result differently and

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699
interpreting the result differently and
 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.689
interpreting the result differently and
nobody was wrong it's just without the

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699
nobody was wrong it's just without the
 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.230
nobody was wrong it's just without the
context you can't really know for sure

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240
context you can't really know for sure
 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.879
context you can't really know for sure
so yeah that we can swap the colors the

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889
so yeah that we can swap the colors the
 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.080
so yeah that we can swap the colors the
distribution of the light source and the

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090
distribution of the light source and the
 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.249
distribution of the light source and the
object and you're going to see the same

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:23.259
object and you're going to see the same
 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:26.370
object and you're going to see the same
result so that's Lee that leads us to

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380
result so that's Lee that leads us to
 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.930
result so that's Lee that leads us to
something called the chromaticity

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940
something called the chromaticity
 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.040
something called the chromaticity

French French commissioner partly and it
represents all the colors that

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870
represents all the colors that
 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.470
represents all the colors that
we can perceive as human beings so on

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480
we can perceive as human beings so on
 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.340
we can perceive as human beings so on
that horseshoe shape the outside edge is

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350
that horseshoe shape the outside edge is
 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.190
that horseshoe shape the outside edge is
called the spectral locus it represents

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200
called the spectral locus it represents
 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.110
called the spectral locus it represents
all the pure colors the pure spectral

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120
all the pure colors the pure spectral
 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.300
all the pure colors the pure spectral
color so that that spectrum of colors

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310

doesn't many others what's interesting
 

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.170
doesn't many others what's interesting
is that the color model defines how many

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:02.180
is that the color model defines how many
 

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.870
is that the color model defines how many
numbers we need to define a color so

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880
numbers we need to define a color so
 

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.060

you're used to RGB to three colors it

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.070
you're used to RGB to three colors it
 

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.370
you're used to RGB to three colors it
has three values but CMYK requires four

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:09.380
has three values but CMYK requires four
 

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.230
has three values but CMYK requires four
values for instance so the one that

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240
values for instance so the one that
 

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.150
values for instance so the one that
we're interested in today is the RGB

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160
we're interested in today is the RGB
 

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.910
we're interested in today is the RGB
color model it is a triplet of values

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920

familiar with the hexadecimal notation
 

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.550
familiar with the hexadecimal notation
so there are many ways of representing

a lot on Android when you want to pass a
color directly to one of our API s so

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:33.590
color directly to one of our API s so
 

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.160
color directly to one of our API s so
this is a pinkish color so this is the

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.170
this is a pinkish color so this is the
 

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.010
this is a pinkish color so this is the
same color represented as a triplet of

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:39.020
same color represented as a triplet of
 

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.580

something we use a lot on Android when

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:45.350
something we use a lot on Android when
 

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.870
something we use a lot on Android when
you set the color on the paint or when

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880
you set the color on the paint or when
 

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.970
you set the color on the paint or when
use the color that's ready to expect the

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:48.980
use the color that's ready to expect the
 

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.110
use the color that's ready to expect the
right component of a color and this is

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120
right component of a color and this is
 

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.490
right component of a color and this is
another notation this is actually the

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:54.500
another notation this is actually the
 

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.310
another notation this is actually the
one I prefer this release floats so the

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320
one I prefer this release floats so the
 

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.280
one I prefer this release floats so the
values are between 0 and 1 and it's

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:00.290
values are between 0 and 1 and it's
 

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.780

you can use it to represent HDR colors

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:04.490
you can use it to represent HDR colors
 

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.490
you can use it to represent HDR colors
and we'll see that Android actually

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500
and we'll see that Android actually
 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.430
and we'll see that Android actually

reproduce so the big question is once we

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:16.370
reproduce so the big question is once we
 

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.180
reproduce so the big question is once we
have those numbers what colors do they

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:19.190
have those numbers what colors do they
 

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.560
have those numbers what colors do they
actually represent so I told you this is

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:20.570
actually represent so I told you this is
 

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.540
actually represent so I told you this is
a pink but you've seen that spectrum of

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:22.550
a pink but you've seen that spectrum of
 

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.100
a pink but you've seen that spectrum of
cars done many many many things is

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.110
cars done many many many things is
 

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.930
cars done many many many things is
actually an infinity of things so which

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:25.940
actually an infinity of things so which
 

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.030
actually an infinity of things so which
one of those things does this represent

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040
one of those things does this represent
 

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.460
one of those things does this represent
so to reproduce colors are all of our

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:30.470
so to reproduce colors are all of our
 

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.610
so to reproduce colors are all of our
displays use additive lights so we use

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:33.620
displays use additive lights so we use
 

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.200
displays use additive lights so we use
red green and blue and our TVs are

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.210
red green and blue and our TVs are
 

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.300
red green and blue and our TVs are
phones our computers are all charged

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:40.310

monitors and it just mix those different

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:42.380
monitors and it just mix those different
 

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.040
monitors and it just mix those different
lights so the numbers that you just saw

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.050
lights so the numbers that you just saw
 

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.840
lights so the numbers that you just saw
the RGB triplets it might sound obvious

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:46.850
the RGB triplets it might sound obvious
 

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.630
the RGB triplets it might sound obvious
but they're an intensity for each one of

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:49.640
but they're an intensity for each one of
 

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.520
but they're an intensity for each one of
those lights so let's say we pick 3

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:51.530
those lights so let's say we pick 3
 

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.410
those lights so let's say we pick 3
lights we pick your green light or red

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:53.420

entire visible spectrum so and there's
 

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:19.569
entire visible spectrum so and there's
and that triangle is what we call a

color spaces we could create the point
 

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.749
color spaces we could create the point
we have that with a triangle with just

00:11:34.749 --> 00:11:34.759
we have that with a triangle with just
 

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:35.439
we have that with a triangle with just
three lights

we cannot encompass all the visible

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:37.850
we cannot encompass all the visible
 

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.999
we cannot encompass all the visible
spectrum we have to choose a smaller

know of that can capture or or recreate

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:51.709
know of that can capture or or recreate
 

00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:55.949

the problem is that if we wanted to

00:11:57.879 --> 00:11:57.889
the problem is that if we wanted to
 

00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:59.949
the problem is that if we wanted to
create a color space with RGB that that

00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959
create a color space with RGB that that
 

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:01.749
create a color space with RGB that that
contains all the visible colors we'd

00:12:01.749 --> 00:12:01.759
contains all the visible colors we'd
 

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:03.790
contains all the visible colors we'd
have to create lights that are in the

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800
have to create lights that are in the
 

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.400
have to create lights that are in the
imaginary space so light that we cannot

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:06.410
imaginary space so light that we cannot
 

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.629
imaginary space so light that we cannot
perceive because we've seen that our

00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639
perceive because we've seen that our
 

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:09.249

eyes cannot receive outside of that

00:12:09.249 --> 00:12:09.259
eyes cannot receive outside of that
 

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:12.040
eyes cannot receive outside of that
foster shape the color space is Audion

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.050
foster shape the color space is Audion
 

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.210
foster shape the color space is Audion
more complicated than that

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:13.220
more complicated than that
 

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.419
more complicated than that
so color space is actually defined by

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:16.429
so color space is actually defined by
 

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:19.179
so color space is actually defined by
three components the first ones are

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:19.189
three components the first ones are
 

00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:21.369
three components the first ones are
called the primaries there are three of

00:12:21.369 --> 00:12:21.379
called the primaries there are three of
 

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:24.280
called the primaries there are three of
them then we need a white point and then

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:24.290
them then we need a white point and then
 

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.540
them then we need a white point and then
we need something called transfer

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:25.550
we need something called transfer
 

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.429
we need something called transfer
functions so this might look like a

00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:30.439
functions so this might look like a
 

00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:32.739
functions so this might look like a
complicated diagram but what I did is I

00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:32.749
complicated diagram but what I did is I
 

00:12:32.749 --> 00:12:35.199
complicated diagram but what I did is I
put the visible spectrum or on the left

00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:35.209
put the visible spectrum or on the left
 

00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:37.600
put the visible spectrum or on the left
and I've overlaid three triangles that

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:37.610
and I've overlaid three triangles that
 

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.879
and I've overlaid three triangles that
represent three common color spaces that

00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:39.889
represent three common color spaces that
 

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:43.269
represent three common color spaces that
are used in for still images so the

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279
are used in for still images so the
 

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:44.889
are used in for still images so the
smallest one you see in the middle the

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:44.899
smallest one you see in the middle the
 

00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:47.199
smallest one you see in the middle the
blue triangle is the one we call srgb

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:47.209
blue triangle is the one we call srgb
 

00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:48.220
blue triangle is the one we call srgb
I'm sure you've heard that term before

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:48.230
I'm sure you've heard that term before
 

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.249
I'm sure you've heard that term before
so it's R to B stands for standard RGB

00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:51.259
so it's R to B stands for standard RGB
 

00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:53.949
so it's R to B stands for standard RGB

it's the orange triangle because it's

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:12.529
it's the orange triangle because it's
 

00:13:12.529 --> 00:13:15.429
it's the orange triangle because it's
bigger than the sRGB color space we say

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:15.439
bigger than the sRGB color space we say
 

00:13:15.439 --> 00:13:17.679
bigger than the sRGB color space we say
that it's a wide color space or it's a

works in prophoto RGB and it won't be

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760
works in prophoto RGB and it won't be
 

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.400
works in prophoto RGB and it won't be
able to recreate all the colors that

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:51.410
able to recreate all the colors that
 

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.930
able to recreate all the colors that
it's working with on screen but the idea

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:52.940
it's working with on screen but the idea
 

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.610
it's working with on screen but the idea
is to have as much precision as possible

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:54.620
is to have as much precision as possible
 

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.930
is to have as much precision as possible
so you can ignore this kind of color

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:55.940
so you can ignore this kind of color
 

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.020
so you can ignore this kind of color

applications so I said a color space has

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:01.850
applications so I said a color space has
 

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.150
applications so I said a color space has
three primaries and the primaries really

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160
three primaries and the primaries really
 

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.670
three primaries and the primaries really
are the coordinate of each one of the

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680
are the coordinate of each one of the
 

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.040
are the coordinate of each one of the
three vertices of a triangle in that

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:09.050
three vertices of a triangle in that
 

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.870

so it's two different rights for us let

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:34.670
so it's two different rights for us let
 

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.160
so it's two different rights for us let
me study for computers we'll take a look

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:36.170
me study for computers we'll take a look
 

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.690
me study for computers we'll take a look
at that and then we also need a white

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:37.700
at that and then we also need a white
 

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.370
at that and then we also need a white
point and the white points the same idea

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:39.380
point and the white points the same idea
 

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.760
point and the white points the same idea
it gives us the coordinates of white in

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:42.770
it gives us the coordinates of white in
 

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.190
it gives us the coordinates of white in
that in in that color space and we'll

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:45.200
that in in that color space and we'll
 

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.570
that in in that color space and we'll
get back to that so I also mentioned

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:49.580
get back to that so I also mentioned
 

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.580
get back to that so I also mentioned

heard about them under the name Agana so

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:57.620
heard about them under the name Agana so
 

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.700
heard about them under the name Agana so
if you heard about gamma correction

00:14:59.700 --> 00:14:59.710
if you heard about gamma correction
 

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.200
if you heard about gamma correction
that's actually transfer functions so I

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:02.210
that's actually transfer functions so I
 

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.060
that's actually transfer functions so I
gave a talk last year about transfer

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:04.070
gave a talk last year about transfer
 

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.140
gave a talk last year about transfer
functions I don't have time to talk

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:05.150
functions I don't have time to talk
 

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.870
functions I don't have time to talk
about them today I'm going to give gonna

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:07.880
about them today I'm going to give gonna
 

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.220
about them today I'm going to give gonna
show you a link at the end of the talk

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:09.230
show you a link at the end of the talk
 

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.180
show you a link at the end of the talk
if you're interested you should

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:10.190
if you're interested you should
 

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.940
if you're interested you should
definitely go look at the talk there's a

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:12.950
definitely go look at the talk there's a
 

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:13.900
definitely go look at the talk there's a
lot of things that you should learn

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:13.910
lot of things that you should learn
 

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.850
lot of things that you should learn
about transfer functions that can impact

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:15.860
about transfer functions that can impact
 

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.150
about transfer functions that can impact
your applications so I've been talking

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160
your applications so I've been talking
 

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.770
your applications so I've been talking
about current spaces but why do we care

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:20.780
about current spaces but why do we care
 

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.120
about current spaces but why do we care
so much about color spaces so the

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.130
so much about color spaces so the
 

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.830
so much about color spaces so the
problem is that every device out there

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:23.840
problem is that every device out there
 

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.710
problem is that every device out there
has every different color space so for

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720
has every different color space so for
 

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.940
has every different color space so for
instance you can have a phone that has

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:27.950
instance you can have a phone that has
 

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.650
instance you can have a phone that has
an LCD screen is going to be close to

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:29.660
an LCD screen is going to be close to
 

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.740
an LCD screen is going to be close to
srgb you have a

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:30.750
srgb you have a
 

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.690
srgb you have a
phone that has an OLED screen it's going

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:32.700
phone that has an OLED screen it's going
 

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.880
phone that has an OLED screen it's going
to be closer to p3 to a color space

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:34.890
to be closer to p3 to a color space
 

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.670
to be closer to p3 to a color space
called p3 or to the other the RGB color

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680
called p3 or to the other the RGB color
 

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.470
called p3 or to the other the RGB color
space that we just saw and something for

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480
space that we just saw and something for
 

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.910
space that we just saw and something for
your laptop for your computer for your

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920
your laptop for your computer for your
 

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.760
your laptop for your computer for your
TV and things get even worse because

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:43.770
TV and things get even worse because
 

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.860
TV and things get even worse because
even if you have two phones they're the

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:45.870
even if you have two phones they're the
 

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.810
even if you have two phones they're the
same model that's the same manufacturer

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:47.820
same model that's the same manufacturer
 

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.270
same model that's the same manufacturer
they are both supposed to be lets say p3

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:50.280
they are both supposed to be lets say p3
 

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.340
they are both supposed to be lets say p3
there are variations in the

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:52.350
there are variations in the
 

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.500
there are variations in the
manufacturing process so they won't be

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:54.510
manufacturing process so they won't be
 

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.570
manufacturing process so they won't be
the exact same p3 so the colors won't be

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:56.580
the exact same p3 so the colors won't be
 

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.570
the exact same p3 so the colors won't be
exactly the same on those two devices

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:58.580
exactly the same on those two devices
 

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.560
exactly the same on those two devices
and I'll show you an example of what

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:00.570
and I'll show you an example of what
 

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.630
and I'll show you an example of what
happens so let's imagine that we have

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:02.640
happens so let's imagine that we have
 

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.150
happens so let's imagine that we have
content that we created for srgb so it's

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160
content that we created for srgb so it's
 

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.550
content that we created for srgb so it's
in this RGB color space we designed it

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560
in this RGB color space we designed it
 

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.650
in this RGB color space we designed it
at home on a computer that shows srgb

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660
at home on a computer that shows srgb
 

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.570
at home on a computer that shows srgb
colors that's the white triangle you see

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:11.580
colors that's the white triangle you see
 

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.660
colors that's the white triangle you see
and then if we take that content as it

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:14.670
and then if we take that content as it
 

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.790
and then if we take that content as it
is we don't do anything to it and we

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800
is we don't do anything to it and we
 

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.460
is we don't do anything to it and we
just show it on the display that's Adobe

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:19.470
just show it on the display that's Adobe
 

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.500
just show it on the display that's Adobe
RGB what we're going to do is we're

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:21.510
RGB what we're going to do is we're
 

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.970
RGB what we're going to do is we're
going to just take those RGB triplet

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980
going to just take those RGB triplet
 

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.400
going to just take those RGB triplet
those values we had and reinterpret them

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:25.410
those values we had and reinterpret them
 

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.440
those values we had and reinterpret them
in the different color space so suddenly

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:27.450
in the different color space so suddenly
 

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.020
in the different color space so suddenly
you're green that you had in this RGB

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.030
you're green that you had in this RGB
 

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.360
you're green that you had in this RGB
like that green equals 1 is going to be

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:32.370
like that green equals 1 is going to be
 

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.590
like that green equals 1 is going to be
a different grain it's going to look

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600
a different grain it's going to look
 

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.930
a different grain it's going to look
completely different to your user who's

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940
completely different to your user who's
 

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.980
completely different to your user who's
using another way out of the screen so

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:39.990
using another way out of the screen so
 

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.410
using another way out of the screen so
here are concrete examples this is a

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420
here are concrete examples this is a
 

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.990
here are concrete examples this is a

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.630
look like because those trains have a
current state I have no idea what it is

00:16:59.630 --> 00:16:59.640
current state I have no idea what it is
 

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.079
current state I have no idea what it is
but it's definitely not srgb and what

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:03.089
but it's definitely not srgb and what
 

00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:04.340
but it's definitely not srgb and what
this is really wrong but what matters

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:04.350
this is really wrong but what matters
 

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.590
this is really wrong but what matters
the difference between the next photos

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600
the difference between the next photos
 

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.230
the difference between the next photos
so let's say that this is proper subsidy

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240
so let's say that this is proper subsidy
 

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.850
so let's say that this is proper subsidy
this is how I wanted you to see the

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860
this is how I wanted you to see the
 

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.010
this is how I wanted you to see the
picture now if I display the picture as

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020
picture now if I display the picture as
 

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.319
picture now if I display the picture as
is on a different screen let's say DCI

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:15.329
is on a different screen let's say DCI
 

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.780
is on a different screen let's say DCI
p3 it's going to look like this which I

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:17.790
p3 it's going to look like this which I
 

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.640
p3 it's going to look like this which I
go back and forth you can see there's a

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:19.650
go back and forth you can see there's a
 

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:20.750
go back and forth you can see there's a
difference in contrast some of the

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760
difference in contrast some of the
 

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.329
difference in contrast some of the
Khorasan be a bit more saturated so

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339
Khorasan be a bit more saturated so
 

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.429
Khorasan be a bit more saturated so
already my photo does not look like the

00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439
already my photo does not look like the
 

00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:27.710
already my photo does not look like the
way I intended then if I displayed on a

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720
way I intended then if I displayed on a
 

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.290
way I intended then if I displayed on a
prophoto RGB display your searching

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:30.300
prophoto RGB display your searching
 

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.420
prophoto RGB display your searching
existed it would look like this

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:32.430
existed it would look like this
 

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.270
existed it would look like this
so super saturated really garish I don't

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280
so super saturated really garish I don't
 

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.200
so super saturated really garish I don't
know about you I really don't like this

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:36.210
know about you I really don't like this
 

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.360
know about you I really don't like this
picture and those are only when we have

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:38.370
picture and those are only when we have
 

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.919
picture and those are only when we have
that happens when you only effect the

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:39.929
that happens when you only effect the
 

00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:41.570
that happens when you only effect the
primaries but you can have similar

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580
primaries but you can have similar
 

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.900
primaries but you can have similar
issues when you effect

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:42.910
issues when you effect
 

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.180
issues when you effect
your white points so the next slide here

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:45.190
your white points so the next slide here
 

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.000
your white points so the next slide here
that is the same srgb photo so we kept

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.010
that is the same srgb photo so we kept
 

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.830
that is the same srgb photo so we kept
the primaries but I changed the white

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840
the primaries but I changed the white
 

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.450
the primaries but I changed the white
point to something that's blueish and

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:51.460
point to something that's blueish and
 

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.190
point to something that's blueish and
certainly my photo well you know it's

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200
certainly my photo well you know it's
 

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.690
certainly my photo well you know it's
other water so I can kind of make sense

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:54.700
other water so I can kind of make sense
 

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.490
other water so I can kind of make sense
to be blue but it is not the way I

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:56.500
to be blue but it is not the way I
 

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.630
to be blue but it is not the way I
wanted it to look like

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640
wanted it to look like
 

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.000
wanted it to look like
so again if you take multiple Android

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.010
so again if you take multiple Android
 

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.320
so again if you take multiple Android
devices for instance and you put them

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:01.330
devices for instance and you put them
 

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.060
devices for instance and you put them
side-by-side chances are that some

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.070
side-by-side chances are that some
 

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.860
side-by-side chances are that some
screens will appear yellow to use some

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:04.870
screens will appear yellow to use some
 

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.690
screens will appear yellow to use some
screens will appear blue to your green

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:06.700
screens will appear blue to your green
 

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.580
screens will appear blue to your green
and that's because of the white points

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:08.590
and that's because of the white points
 

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.780
and that's because of the white points
we have different white points across

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:09.790
we have different white points across
 

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.580
we have different white points across
multiple displays and once again the

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:11.590
multiple displays and once again the
 

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.380
multiple displays and once again the
same model of device from the same

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:13.390
same model of device from the same
 

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.870
same model of device from the same
manufacturer there are going to be a

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880
manufacturer there are going to be a
 

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.840
manufacturer there are going to be a
white point variations so when this

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:18.850
white point variations so when this
 

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.270
white point variations so when this
happens we said that colors are

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280
happens we said that colors are
 

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.430
happens we said that colors are
unmanaged this is what Android has been

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440
unmanaged this is what Android has been
 

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.030
unmanaged this is what Android has been
doing since Android 1.0 and I hate it

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.040
doing since Android 1.0 and I hate it
 

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.610
doing since Android 1.0 and I hate it
absolutely hate it it's horrible you

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:29.620
absolutely hate it it's horrible you
 

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.740
absolutely hate it it's horrible you
know your designers will spend hours and

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:31.750
know your designers will spend hours and
 

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.660
know your designers will spend hours and
hours like slaving away on the computer

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:33.670
hours like slaving away on the computer
 

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.700
hours like slaving away on the computer
like creating a beautiful UI then you

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:35.710
like creating a beautiful UI then you
 

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.920
like creating a beautiful UI then you
test it on the phone and it's completely

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:37.930
test it on the phone and it's completely
 

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.390
test it on the phone and it's completely
different and you test it on another

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400
different and you test it on another
 

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.920
different and you test it on another
phone and it looks completely different

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:40.930
phone and it looks completely different
 

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.920
phone and it looks completely different
again so you might be thinking how can

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:43.930
again so you might be thinking how can
 

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.200
again so you might be thinking how can
we have our design look exactly the way

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.210
we have our design look exactly the way
 

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.450
we have our design look exactly the way
we want so the solution is something

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:48.460
we want so the solution is something
 

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.270
we want so the solution is something
called color management and it's a new

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280
called color management and it's a new
 

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.180
called color management and it's a new
to Android oh so the idea is that every

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:54.190
to Android oh so the idea is that every
 

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.670
to Android oh so the idea is that every
color that we want to display needs to

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:56.680
color that we want to display needs to
 

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.950
color that we want to display needs to
be associated with a color space we need

00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960
be associated with a color space we need
 

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.170
be associated with a color space we need
to know what was the original intent of

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.180
to know what was the original intent of
 

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.230
to know what was the original intent of
the design so we need that information

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240
the design so we need that information
 

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.060
the design so we need that information
then through the magic of a lot of math

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.070
then through the magic of a lot of math
 

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.280
then through the magic of a lot of math
and matrices it's actually a lot more

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.290
and matrices it's actually a lot more
 

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.840
and matrices it's actually a lot more
complicated than just the matrix but

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:09.850
complicated than just the matrix but
 

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.120
complicated than just the matrix but
that's most of it we're going to do a

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.130
that's most of it we're going to do a
 

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.340
that's most of it we're going to do a
controlled conversion to the destination

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:14.350
controlled conversion to the destination
 

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.690
controlled conversion to the destination
color space so what we're going to do is

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:15.700
color space so what we're going to do is
 

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.820
color space so what we're going to do is
that when we manufacture a device we're

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:17.830
that when we manufacture a device we're
 

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.170
that when we manufacture a device we're
going to use special devices that will

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:19.180
going to use special devices that will
 

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.960
going to use special devices that will
measure the capabilities of the display

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:21.970
measure the capabilities of the display
 

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.280
measure the capabilities of the display
we're going to measure the primaries and

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:23.290
we're going to measure the primaries and
 

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.540
we're going to measure the primaries and
the white point of the device we're

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:24.550
the white point of the device we're
 

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.130
the white point of the device we're
going to create the destination color

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:26.140
going to create the destination color
 

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.920
going to create the destination color
space and then we can convert your

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:28.930
space and then we can convert your
 

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.260
space and then we can convert your
original content through the destination

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:31.270
original content through the destination
 

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.780
original content through the destination
color space and preserve the same colors

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:33.790
color space and preserve the same colors
 

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.300
color space and preserve the same colors
that you wanted to have so this is

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:36.310
that you wanted to have so this is
 

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.590
that you wanted to have so this is
something we're introducing in Android

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600
something we're introducing in Android
 

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.660
something we're introducing in Android
oh and there are two parts of it there's

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:39.670
oh and there are two parts of it there's
 

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.010
oh and there are two parts of it there's
first color management

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.020
first color management
 

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.720
first color management
proper and then there's something called

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:42.730
proper and then there's something called
 

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:44.430
proper and then there's something called
the white color gamut rendering it when

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440
the white color gamut rendering it when
 

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.860
the white color gamut rendering it when
I take a look at those but first before

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:46.870
I take a look at those but first before
 

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.930
I take a look at those but first before
you need to worry about Android you need

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:48.940
you need to worry about Android you need
 

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.970
you need to worry about Android you need
to make sure that you or your designers

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:50.980
to make sure that you or your designers
 

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.970
to make sure that you or your designers
are

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:51.980
are
 

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.980
are
using color spaces properly in your

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:53.990
using color spaces properly in your
 

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.690
using color spaces properly in your
design application and there are two

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:55.700
design application and there are two
 

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.550
design application and there are two
things you can do with pictures you can

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:57.560
things you can do with pictures you can
 

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.920
things you can do with pictures you can
assign a color space or you can convert

00:19:59.920 --> 00:19:59.930
assign a color space or you can convert
 

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.690
assign a color space or you can convert
to color space so I'm going to switch to

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:01.700
to color space so I'm going to switch to
 

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:07.660
to color space so I'm going to switch to
a demo but first I just want to show you

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:07.670
a demo but first I just want to show you
 

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.790
a demo but first I just want to show you
earlier I said that color spaces the

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:09.800
earlier I said that color spaces the
 

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.440
earlier I said that color spaces the
disco mattes is the diagram we had the

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:11.450
disco mattes is the diagram we had the
 

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.750
disco mattes is the diagram we had the
horseshoe shape it's a slice of the

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760
horseshoe shape it's a slice of the
 

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:19.300
horseshoe shape it's a slice of the
color space and so are the the game

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:19.310
color space and so are the the game
 

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.780
color space and so are the the game
mixes triangles so this is srgb in 3d

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:22.790
mixes triangles so this is srgb in 3d
 

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.490
mixes triangles so this is srgb in 3d
and it's interesting because I mentioned

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:24.500
and it's interesting because I mentioned
 

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.990
and it's interesting because I mentioned
that our eyes see more in the darks and

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000
that our eyes see more in the darks and
 

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.400
that our eyes see more in the darks and
you can see that in that diagram the

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:27.410
you can see that in that diagram the
 

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.940
you can see that in that diagram the
brighter the colors the less the less

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:29.950
brighter the colors the less the less
 

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:36.040
brighter the colors the less the less
the fewer use we can pursue all right so

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.050
the fewer use we can pursue all right so
 

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.470
the fewer use we can pursue all right so
for the demo so I'm using a tool called

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480
for the demo so I'm using a tool called
 

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.130
for the demo so I'm using a tool called
affinity photo and this is a picture I

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:42.140
affinity photo and this is a picture I
 

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.200
affinity photo and this is a picture I
took same process in all two kitchen

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:44.210
took same process in all two kitchen
 

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.630
took same process in all two kitchen
either the RGB I was using wall files

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640
either the RGB I was using wall files
 

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.850
either the RGB I was using wall files
from my camera from my DSLR

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:48.860
from my camera from my DSLR
 

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.070
from my camera from my DSLR
I use prefer to RGB to do my work in

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080
I use prefer to RGB to do my work in
 

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.320
I use prefer to RGB to do my work in
Lightroom and I created an sRGB version

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:53.330
Lightroom and I created an sRGB version
 

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.810
Lightroom and I created an sRGB version
of the picture and if we zoom in pretty

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:55.820
of the picture and if we zoom in pretty
 

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.530

somewhere will show you the color space

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:00.980
somewhere will show you the color space
 

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.310
somewhere will show you the color space
of your image so here we know it's in

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320
of your image so here we know it's in
 

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.800
of your image so here we know it's in
this RGB image I'm on a calibrated

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:05.810
this RGB image I'm on a calibrated
 

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.800
this RGB image I'm on a calibrated
display looks fine and I can said you

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:08.810
display looks fine and I can said you
 

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.530
display looks fine and I can said you
can assign a color space often called an

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:11.540
can assign a color space often called an
 

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.570
can assign a color space often called an
ICC profile or you can convert so if you

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:13.580
ICC profile or you can convert so if you
 

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.120
ICC profile or you can convert so if you
assign what you're saying is you're just

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.130
assign what you're saying is you're just
 

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.620
assign what you're saying is you're just
saying keep the colors the way they are

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:17.630
saying keep the colors the way they are
 

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.170
saying keep the colors the way they are
keep the same values I just want to move

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:20.180
keep the same values I just want to move
 

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.360
keep the same values I just want to move
them to a different color space so let's

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:22.370
them to a different color space so let's
 

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.000
them to a different color space so let's
say we move to the Profoto color space

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.010
say we move to the Profoto color space
 

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.610
say we move to the Profoto color space
and now it looks like this this is

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:27.620
and now it looks like this this is
 

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.380
and now it looks like this this is
exactly what Android does this is not

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:29.390
exactly what Android does this is not
 

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.700
exactly what Android does this is not
the right way of doing it sometimes

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:30.710
the right way of doing it sometimes
 

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.500
the right way of doing it sometimes
that's what you want because you know

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:32.510
that's what you want because you know
 

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.970
that's what you want because you know
what you're doing but very often it's

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:33.980
what you're doing but very often it's
 

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.260
what you're doing but very often it's
not going to be which one so instead

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:35.270
not going to be which one so instead
 

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.460
not going to be which one so instead
what you want to do is to convert ICC

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:39.470
what you want to do is to convert ICC
 

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.110
what you want to do is to convert ICC
profile sometimes called map it's

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120
profile sometimes called map it's
 

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.240
profile sometimes called map it's
sometimes called match so we pick

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:43.250
sometimes called match so we pick
 

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.060
sometimes called match so we pick
Profoto and when I click you'll see no

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.070
Profoto and when I click you'll see no
 

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.830
Profoto and when I click you'll see no
difference and this is what we wanted

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840
difference and this is what we wanted
 

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.690
difference and this is what we wanted
but what happens that every single RGB

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:49.700
but what happens that every single RGB
 

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.420
but what happens that every single RGB
value has changed it just looks the same

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:52.430
value has changed it just looks the same
 

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.980
value has changed it just looks the same
we just have different values stored

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:53.990
we just have different values stored
 

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.520
we just have different values stored
inside the image and to give you an idea

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:57.530
inside the image and to give you an idea
 

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.020
inside the image and to give you an idea
what happens to your Android design so

00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.030
what happens to your Android design so

find edge color what happens on that

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760
find edge color what happens on that
 

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:30.029

pixel 2016 is this so I hope you can see

00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039
pixel 2016 is this so I hope you can see
 

00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:32.070
pixel 2016 is this so I hope you can see
the difference if you look at the right

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080
the difference if you look at the right
 

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.659
the difference if you look at the right
icons at the bottom you can see that

00:22:33.659 --> 00:22:33.669
icons at the bottom you can see that

everything becomes more saturated so

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:35.860
everything becomes more saturated so

everything becomes more saturated so
that's what you designed and that's what

that's what you designed and that's what
you see on an actual phone right so when

you see on an actual phone right so when
 

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.659
you see on an actual phone right so when
you don't know what the color space is

00:22:45.659 --> 00:22:45.669
you don't know what the color space is
 

00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:48.149
you don't know what the color space is
just assume it is RGB the only

00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159
just assume it is RGB the only
 

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:49.529
just assume it is RGB the only
assumption you can make and this is why

00:22:49.529 --> 00:22:49.539
assumption you can make and this is why

when I was working on the slides

00:23:42.389 --> 00:23:42.399
when I was working on the slides
 

00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:45.269
when I was working on the slides
I picked colors for the slides and I was

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279
I picked colors for the slides and I was
 

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.860
I picked colors for the slides and I was
creating diagrams into a different tool

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:46.870
creating diagrams into a different tool
 

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.440
creating diagrams into a different tool
and I tried to match the colors and I

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:49.450
and I tried to match the colors and I
 

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.440
and I tried to match the colors and I
forgot that hi to change the the to srgb

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:52.450
forgot that hi to change the the to srgb
 

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.880

in the speakers we took me five minutes

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:53.890
in the speakers we took me five minutes
 

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.680
in the speakers we took me five minutes
to understand why my colors were

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:55.690
to understand why my colors were
 

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:57.120
to understand why my colors were
different so even when you know that

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.130
different so even when you know that

the srgb mode so here what we're going

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:31.580
the srgb mode so here what we're going
 

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.670
the srgb mode so here what we're going
to do is apply color correction we're

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:33.680
to do is apply color correction we're
 

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.650
to do is apply color correction we're
going to apply color management to the

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:35.660
going to apply color management to the
 

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.960
going to apply color management to the
to the display to make sure that all the

to the display to make sure that all the
 

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.150
to the display to make sure that all the
colors are interpreted and reproduced as

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:40.160
colors are interpreted and reproduced as

lot of people complain that the colors

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.150
lot of people complain that the colors
 

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.600
lot of people complain that the colors
look washed out that they actually more

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:46.610
look washed out that they actually more
 

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.600
look washed out that they actually more
accurate it just matter habits all right

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:49.610
accurate it just matter habits all right
 

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.290
accurate it just matter habits all right
so now some code so on Android what

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:53.300
so now some code so on Android what
 

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.970
so now some code so on Android what
you've been using so far is what we call

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:54.980
you've been using so far is what we call
 

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.100
you've been using so far is what we call
the color int just an inch it contains

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.110
the color int just an inch it contains
 

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.610
the color int just an inch it contains
alpha red green and blue and the only

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:00.620
alpha red green and blue and the only
 

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.020
alpha red green and blue and the only
assumption we can make because we don't

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:02.030
assumption we can make because we don't
 

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.400
assumption we can make because we don't
know what color space you're using is

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:03.410
know what color space you're using is
 

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:07.780
know what color space you're using is
that it's srgb so it's pretty simple now

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:07.790
that it's srgb so it's pretty simple now
 

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:11.440
that it's srgb so it's pretty simple now
in all when producing a crazy new API we

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:11.450
in all when producing a crazy new API we
 

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.930
in all when producing a crazy new API we
let that color class for 10 years but

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:13.940
let that color class for 10 years but
 

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.910
let that color class for 10 years but
the only aesthetic methods now you can

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:15.920
the only aesthetic methods now you can
 

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.220
the only aesthetic methods now you can
create instances of the car class you

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:18.230
create instances of the car class you
 

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.500
create instances of the car class you
can actually use color as the way it was

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:20.510
can actually use color as the way it was
 

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.300
can actually use color as the way it was
meant to be so you just call value of

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.310
meant to be so you just call value of
 

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.640
meant to be so you just call value of
you give your RGB values and that's

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:24.650
you give your RGB values and that's
 

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.110
you give your RGB values and that's
going to give you an instance of the

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120
going to give you an instance of the
 

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.300
going to give you an instance of the
color class in srgb because note I

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:28.310
color class in srgb because note I
 

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.190
color class in srgb because note I
didn't specify the color space so my

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.200
didn't specify the color space so my
 

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.310
didn't specify the color space so my
assumption is it is RGB you can also

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320
assumption is it is RGB you can also
 

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.130
assumption is it is RGB you can also
specify the color space so here we also

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:36.140
specify the color space so here we also
 

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.710
specify the color space so here we also
call that U of we passed the Alpha so

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720
call that U of we passed the Alpha so
 

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.930
call that U of we passed the Alpha so
the other is RGB a when it floats and

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:40.940
the other is RGB a when it floats and
 

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.090
the other is RGB a when it floats and
then we say that we want that color to

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:43.100
then we say that we want that color to
 

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.490
then we say that we want that color to
be in the Adobe RGB space what this

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:45.500
be in the Adobe RGB space what this
 

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.160
be in the Adobe RGB space what this
allows us to do is work with colors so

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:48.170
allows us to do is work with colors so
 

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.840
allows us to do is work with colors so
we can convert them from one color space

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:49.850
we can convert them from one color space
 

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.460
we can convert them from one color space
to the other so as this other be able to

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:51.470
to the other so as this other be able to
 

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.830
to the other so as this other be able to
be color and if I called converts I can

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840
be color and if I called converts I can
 

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:59.600
be color and if I called converts I can
convert it to display p3 for instance

00:25:59.600 --> 00:25:59.610
 
 

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.919
 
someone's happy something else we

00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:03.929
someone's happy something else we
 

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:05.750
someone's happy something else we
introducing so color ins are really

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760
introducing so color ins are really
 

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.039
introducing so color ins are really
useful because they are easy to

00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:07.049
useful because they are easy to
 

00:26:07.049 --> 00:26:08.780
useful because they are easy to
manipulate this small they're easy to

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:08.790
manipulate this small they're easy to
 

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.260
manipulate this small they're easy to
store and color objects they're the

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:12.270
store and color objects they're the
 

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.150
store and color objects they're the
color class is very generic it can

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:14.160
color class is very generic it can
 

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.830
color class is very generic it can
represent colors it is a floater

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840
represent colors it is a floater
 

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.510
represent colors it is a floater
arrangement it as a reference to color

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520
arrangement it as a reference to color
 

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.039
arrangement it as a reference to color
space so they can be pretty heavy object

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:19.049
space so they can be pretty heavy object
 

00:26:19.049 --> 00:26:20.419
space so they can be pretty heavy object
so now we have something we call the

00:26:20.419 --> 00:26:20.429
so now we have something we call the
 

00:26:20.429 --> 00:26:22.640
so now we have something we call the
color long the same idea is the color

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:22.650
color long the same idea is the color
 

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.380
color long the same idea is the color
int will use a primitive type to store

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:24.390
int will use a primitive type to store
 

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.320
int will use a primitive type to store
color which we also store the correct

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:27.330
color which we also store the correct
 

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.660
color which we also store the correct
space for that color so it's similar to

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:29.670
space for that color so it's similar to
 

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.610
space for that color so it's similar to
value as you just called pack instead

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620
value as you just called pack instead
 

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.950
value as you just called pack instead
and you get along and here's the format

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960
and you get along and here's the format
 

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.100
and you get along and here's the format
of the long so we have 16 bits for the

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:37.110
of the long so we have 16 bits for the
 

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.020
of the long so we have 16 bits for the
red channel 16 bits for the green

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.030
red channel 16 bits for the green
 

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.180
red channel 16 bits for the green
Channel 16 bits for the blue Channel we

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.190
Channel 16 bits for the blue Channel we
 

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:42.620
Channel 16 bits for the blue Channel we
have tended for the Alpha Channel and

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:42.630
have tended for the Alpha Channel and
 

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.680
have tended for the Alpha Channel and
then we have 6 bits that identify one of

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:45.690
then we have 6 bits that identify one of
 

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.560
then we have 6 bits that identify one of
the built-in color spaces and those

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:48.570
the built-in color spaces and those
 

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.049
the built-in color spaces and those
16-bit values they use something called

00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059
16-bit values they use something called
 

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:54.080
16-bit values they use something called
half floats so there floats that use

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.090
half floats so there floats that use
 

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.360
half floats so there floats that use
only 16 bits instead of 32 bits so

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:56.370
only 16 bits instead of 32 bits so
 

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.070
only 16 bits instead of 32 bits so
there's a new API called Android that

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080
there's a new API called Android that
 

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.289
there's a new API called Android that
you don't have that lead to manipulate

00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299
you don't have that lead to manipulate
 

00:27:00.299 --> 00:27:03.560

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.030
to decode all the pixels in the image so
it's really quick gives you an idea of

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:32.040
it's really quick gives you an idea of
 

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.950
it's really quick gives you an idea of
how big the image going to be over the

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960
how big the image going to be over the
 

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.650
how big the image going to be over the
years we've kind of abused this field so

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:36.660
years we've kind of abused this field so
 

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.700
years we've kind of abused this field so
now it's going to tell you the

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:37.710
now it's going to tell you the
 

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.920
now it's going to tell you the
configuration of the bitmap you know is

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:39.930
configuration of the bitmap you know is
 

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.170
configuration of the bitmap you know is
it a RGB a today is the RTD five six

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:42.180
it a RGB a today is the RTD five six
 

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.360
it a RGB a today is the RTD five six
I'll and now it also tells you what the

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:44.370
I'll and now it also tells you what the
 

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.490
I'll and now it also tells you what the
color space is so if you want to know

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500
color space is so if you want to know
 

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.440
color space is so if you want to know
the color space of a bitmap ahead of

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:48.450
the color space of a bitmap ahead of
 

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.840
the color space of a bitmap ahead of
time you have to ask us to give you just

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:50.850
time you have to ask us to give you just
 

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.760
time you have to ask us to give you just
the balance to the dimensions so you

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:52.770
the balance to the dimensions so you
 

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.760
the balance to the dimensions so you
could you're you call your decode method

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:55.770
could you're you call your decode method
 

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.170
could you're you call your decode method
on this map factorial you place your

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:57.180
on this map factorial you place your
 

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.450
on this map factorial you place your
options and then we have this field

00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460
options and then we have this field
 

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.250
options and then we have this field
called out color space that tells you

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260
called out color space that tells you
 

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.960
called out color space that tells you
what is the cost piece of the bitmap so

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:02.970
what is the cost piece of the bitmap so
 

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.150
what is the cost piece of the bitmap so
if you want to make sure that the bitmap

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:05.160
if you want to make sure that the bitmap
 

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.500
if you want to make sure that the bitmap
is in the right color space before

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:06.510
is in the right color space before
 

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.810
is in the right color space before
loading it you can do this and if it's

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820
loading it you can do this and if it's
 

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.510
loading it you can do this and if it's
not in the right color space you can use

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520
not in the right color space you can use
 

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.970
not in the right color space you can use
this other API options called in

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980
this other API options called in
 

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.310
this other API options called in
preferred color space where you can tell

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320
preferred color space where you can tell
 

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.810
preferred color space where you can tell
us what you want the color spaces the

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820
us what you want the color spaces the
 

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.230
us what you want the color spaces the
decoded bitmap to be so in this example

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240
decoded bitmap to be so in this example
 

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.670
decoded bitmap to be so in this example
for instance let's say we create the

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:22.680
for instance let's say we create the
 

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.110
for instance let's say we create the
color space at the bitmap we saw that

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120
color space at the bitmap we saw that
 

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.570
color space at the bitmap we saw that
was Adobe RGB I don't want Adobe RGB I

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580
was Adobe RGB I don't want Adobe RGB I
 

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.460
was Adobe RGB I don't want Adobe RGB I
want srgb so I can use in preferred

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:28.470
want srgb so I can use in preferred
 

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.590
want srgb so I can use in preferred
color space to force the system to to

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600
color space to force the system to to
 

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.060
color space to force the system to to
convert it that load time then you can

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:32.070
convert it that load time then you can
 

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.630
convert it that load time then you can
just call the code we also introducing

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640
just call the code we also introducing
 

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.360
just call the code we also introducing
in Android also 16-bit bitmaps

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:38.370
in Android also 16-bit bitmaps
 

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.340
in Android also 16-bit bitmaps
so there are bitmaps that use 16 bits

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:40.350
so there are bitmaps that use 16 bits
 

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.130
so there are bitmaps that use 16 bits
per channel and those bitmaps are always

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140
per channel and those bitmaps are always
 

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.050
per channel and those bitmaps are always
always in the color space called linear

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:45.060
always in the color space called linear
 

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.390
always in the color space called linear
extended srgb we're going to take a look

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:47.400
extended srgb we're going to take a look
 

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.220
extended srgb we're going to take a look
at other what it is so when you have a

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:49.230
at other what it is so when you have a
 

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.740
at other what it is so when you have a
16-bit bitmap don't try to convert the

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:51.750
16-bit bitmap don't try to convert the
 

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.360
16-bit bitmap don't try to convert the
color space we're not gonna let you at

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:53.370
color space we're not gonna let you at
 

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.390
color space we're not gonna let you at
least for now this is how you create a

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:56.400
least for now this is how you create a
 

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.830
least for now this is how you create a
wide gamut bitmap you just create

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840
wide gamut bitmap you just create
 

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.900
wide gamut bitmap you just create
concrete did not specify the width the

00:31:59.900 --> 00:31:59.910
concrete did not specify the width the
 

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.660
concrete did not specify the width the
height the configuration the boolean

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:02.670
height the configuration the boolean
 

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.610
height the configuration the boolean
tells us whether there's alpha in the

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620
tells us whether there's alpha in the
 

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.960
tells us whether there's alpha in the
bitmap and then you just give us a call

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:05.970
bitmap and then you just give us a call
 

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.800
bitmap and then you just give us a call
space so pretty simple bitmap as API

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:09.810
space so pretty simple bitmap as API
 

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.080
space so pretty simple bitmap as API
that lets you read and write pixels

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.090
that lets you read and write pixels
 

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.780
that lets you read and write pixels
inside the bitmap so because get pixel

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:14.790
inside the bitmap so because get pixel
 

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:18.350
inside the bitmap so because get pixel
and set pixel use current they have to

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360
and set pixel use current they have to
 

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.600
and set pixel use current they have to
use srgb so when you call get pixel on a

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:20.610
use srgb so when you call get pixel on a
 

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:22.820
use srgb so when you call get pixel on a
bitmap that is not a sort of view we're

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:22.830
bitmap that is not a sort of view we're
 

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.870
bitmap that is not a sort of view we're
going to do a conversion for you

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880
going to do a conversion for you
 

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.850
going to do a conversion for you
something when you call set pixel we

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860
something when you call set pixel we
 

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.260
something when you call set pixel we
expect this RGB so you have to do

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:27.270
expect this RGB so you have to do
 

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:31.790
expect this RGB so you have to do
conversion yourself now if you use this

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:31.800
conversion yourself now if you use this
 

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.920
conversion yourself now if you use this
other API called copy these pixels to

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:33.930
other API called copy these pixels to
 

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.200
other API called copy these pixels to
buffer it gives you access to the raw

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:36.210
buffer it gives you access to the raw
 

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.270
buffer it gives you access to the raw
data of the business so that data is

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:38.280
data of the business so that data is
 

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.770
data of the business so that data is
going to be in the native color space of

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:39.780
going to be in the native color space of
 

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.330
going to be in the native color space of
the business

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:40.340
the business
 

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.970
the business
left completely untouched you have to be

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:42.980
left completely untouched you have to be
 

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.470
left completely untouched you have to be
a little bit careful because of that new

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480
a little bit careful because of that new
 

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.410
a little bit careful because of that new
configuration for 16-bit bitmaps so if

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:47.420
configuration for 16-bit bitmaps so if
 

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.810
configuration for 16-bit bitmaps so if
you do the succeeded TNG the data into

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:49.820
you do the succeeded TNG the data into
 

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.460
you do the succeeded TNG the data into
that button that byte buffer is going to

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:51.470
that button that byte buffer is going to
 

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.170
that button that byte buffer is going to
be half float it's not going to be the

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:53.180
be half float it's not going to be the
 

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.390
be half float it's not going to be the
score inch and that's why you might want

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:55.400
score inch and that's why you might want
 

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.560
score inch and that's why you might want
to take a look at Android the

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:56.570
to take a look at Android the
 

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.810
to take a look at Android the
three-tailed at half all right

00:32:58.810 --> 00:32:58.820
three-tailed at half all right
 

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.640
three-tailed at half all right
so now what happens when you draw

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:00.650
so now what happens when you draw
 

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.910
so now what happens when you draw
bitmaps on the screen so until now what

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:03.920
bitmaps on the screen so until now what
 

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.410
bitmaps on the screen so until now what
we are doing is we take a bitmap we

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:05.420
we are doing is we take a bitmap we
 

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.000
we are doing is we take a bitmap we
assume it's srgb we send it to the

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.010
assume it's srgb we send it to the
 

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.470
assume it's srgb we send it to the
screen and if the screen is that this

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480
screen and if the screen is that this
 

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.330
screen and if the screen is that this
RGB too bad the colors are going to be

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:10.340
RGB too bad the colors are going to be
 

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.330
RGB too bad the colors are going to be
completely wrong this is still what we

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:13.340
completely wrong this is still what we
 

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.090
completely wrong this is still what we
do a by default on on Android oh now if

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:16.100
do a by default on on Android oh now if
 

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.890
do a by default on on Android oh now if
you have a bitmap that we know is not as

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:17.900
you have a bitmap that we know is not as
 

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.110
you have a bitmap that we know is not as
RGB it has a color space associated with

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120
RGB it has a color space associated with
 

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.000
RGB it has a color space associated with
it we're going to do an sRGB conversion

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.010
it we're going to do an sRGB conversion
 

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.010
it we're going to do an sRGB conversion
on your behalf in the rendering pipeline

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:24.020
on your behalf in the rendering pipeline
 

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.080
on your behalf in the rendering pipeline
it can be a little bit expensive so you

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:26.090
it can be a little bit expensive so you
 

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.880
it can be a little bit expensive so you
should avoid it as much as you can if

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:27.890
should avoid it as much as you can if
 

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.640
should avoid it as much as you can if
you don't need knowledge RGB bitmaps but

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:30.650
you don't need knowledge RGB bitmaps but
 

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.050
you don't need knowledge RGB bitmaps but
at least the colors are going to be

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:32.060
at least the colors are going to be
 

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.910
at least the colors are going to be
correct on the display now if you render

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:36.920
correct on the display now if you render
 

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.850
correct on the display now if you render
a bitmap into another bitmap so if you

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:39.860
a bitmap into another bitmap so if you
 

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.560
a bitmap into another bitmap so if you
create a bitmap to create the canvas and

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:41.570
create a bitmap to create the canvas and
 

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:42.610
create a bitmap to create the canvas and
then you call draw a bitmap on that

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:42.620
then you call draw a bitmap on that
 

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.710
then you call draw a bitmap on that
canvas we're going to do we're gonna

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720
canvas we're going to do we're gonna
 

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.390
canvas we're going to do we're gonna
convert from whatever the colors the

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:46.400
convert from whatever the colors the
 

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.130
convert from whatever the colors the
source card space is whatever the

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:48.140
source card space is whatever the
 

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.170
source card space is whatever the
destination card space is so if you want

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:50.180
destination card space is so if you want
 

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.270
destination card space is so if you want
to convert a bitmap from one color space

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:52.280
to convert a bitmap from one color space
 

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.150
to convert a bitmap from one color space
to another not at load time this is the

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:55.160
to another not at load time this is the
 

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.350
to another not at load time this is the
way you do it you just create the

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360
way you do it you just create the
 

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.390
way you do it you just create the
destination bitmap you create the canvas

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:58.400
destination bitmap you create the canvas
 

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.760
destination bitmap you create the canvas
and you just draw so pretty simple so we

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:03.770
and you just draw so pretty simple so we
 

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.770
and you just draw so pretty simple so we
make all those assumptions about srgb

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:05.780
make all those assumptions about srgb
 

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.140
make all those assumptions about srgb
but like I said earlier if you remember

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:08.150
but like I said earlier if you remember
 

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.910
but like I said earlier if you remember
I said that already displays on our

00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:09.920
I said that already displays on our
 

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.130
I said that already displays on our
phones have white gamut they can show

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:12.140
phones have white gamut they can show
 

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.620
phones have white gamut they can show
more colors than it's hard to be that

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:14.630
more colors than it's hard to be that
 

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.780
more colors than it's hard to be that
the problem is is that if we take your

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:16.790
the problem is is that if we take your
 

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.760
the problem is is that if we take your
ice RGB content and we don't stretch it

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:18.770
ice RGB content and we don't stretch it
 

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.500
ice RGB content and we don't stretch it
to the entire gamut of the display

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:20.510
to the entire gamut of the display
 

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.270

big color space is way bigger than the
 

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.110
big color space is way bigger than the
visible spectrum much much bigger and

some of the values are negative and some
 

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.550
some of the values are negative and some
of the values are greater than one they

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560
of the values are greater than one they
 

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.740
of the values are greater than one they
go all the way through 7.5 and what's

go all the way through 7.5 and what's
 

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.090
go all the way through 7.5 and what's
interesting about that color space that

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:02.100
interesting about that color space that
 

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.220
interesting about that color space that
all the values between 0 &amp; 1 match

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:04.230
all the values between 0 &amp; 1 match
 

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.860
all the values between 0 &amp; 1 match
exactly this RGB color space so what

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:06.870
exactly this RGB color space so what
 

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.510
exactly this RGB color space so what
enables us to do is we can take your

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520
enables us to do is we can take your
 

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.550
enables us to do is we can take your
existing content all urs RGB content

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560
existing content all urs RGB content
 

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.810

basically everything you have in your

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820
basically everything you have in your
 

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.970
basically everything you have in your
app today and we can draw a direct Li we

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980
app today and we can draw a direct Li we
 

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.070
app today and we can draw a direct Li we
don't need to do any conversion because

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:16.080
don't need to do any conversion because
 

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.320
don't need to do any conversion because
it's an animagus RGB so what we do is we

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.330
it's an animagus RGB so what we do is we
 

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.540
it's an animagus RGB so what we do is we
only the pedal cost of a conversion when

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:20.550
only the pedal cost of a conversion when
 

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.820
only the pedal cost of a conversion when
we are drawing non srgb content so we

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:22.830
we are drawing non srgb content so we
 

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.770
we are drawing non srgb content so we
have you know the expenses that we need

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780
have you know the expenses that we need
 

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.630
have you know the expenses that we need
16 bit per channel because we need a lot

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640
16 bit per channel because we need a lot
 

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.760
16 bit per channel because we need a lot
of precision and range to be able to

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:28.770
of precision and range to be able to
 

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.780
of precision and range to be able to
encode as the RGB space but it's much

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:32.790
encode as the RGB space but it's much
 

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.730
encode as the RGB space but it's much
better for it's much simpler you just

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740
better for it's much simpler you just
 

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.250
better for it's much simpler you just
have one attribute in your application

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:36.260
have one attribute in your application
 

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.290
have one attribute in your application
interestingly because we use 16-bit per

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300
interestingly because we use 16-bit per
 

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.600
interestingly because we use 16-bit per
channel because of extend this RGB we

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:41.610
channel because of extend this RGB we
 

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:44.000
channel because of extend this RGB we
can or we will be able to maybe in the

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.010
can or we will be able to maybe in the
 

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.210
can or we will be able to maybe in the
future to render in HD I'll directly so

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220
future to render in HD I'll directly so
 

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.780
future to render in HD I'll directly so
we could have HD RS user interfaces we

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:50.790
we could have HD RS user interfaces we
 

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.490
we could have HD RS user interfaces we
also have a new resource qualifier

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500
also have a new resource qualifier
 

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.010
also have a new resource qualifier
called wide CG for wide color gamut so

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020
called wide CG for wide color gamut so
 

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.530
called wide CG for wide color gamut so
you can create layouts or strings or

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540
you can create layouts or strings or
