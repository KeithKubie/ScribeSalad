I'm Matt FX, Music
Supervisor of Broad City

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.546
and this is our music
recap for episode eight

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.149 align:start size:88% position:13%
 of season 1,
 Destination Wedding.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.551 align:start position:0%
 It's actually a really really
 cool episode to talk about

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:23.156 align:start position:0%
 because almost all the music
 in this episode is RJD2.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.258 align:start size:88% position:13%
Our episode begins with
a bespoke RJD2 beat

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.127 align:start position:0%
 that immediately grips us into
 the hurried wedding quest.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.297 align:start position:0%
 The motif was made
 specifically for the episode

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.598 size:88% position:44%
 (RJD2 beat)

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.067
- I thought we were all wearing

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.802 size:88% position:44%
  our old catering
  uniforms together.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:36.703
- Nobody said that dude,

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.371 align:start size:88% position:13%
you're supposed to
return it when you quit.

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.073
 - Oh please.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.174 align:start position:0%
 - Yeah Illana we're not
 caterers at Darcy's wedding,

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:41.808
 we're guests.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:42.709
- I know Morgan, thanks.

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:44.844
 - Wanted to point out
 another dope RJ cut

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.779 size:84% position:42%
  that you actually
  can find online.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.815
 The track actually replaced
 our theme song for this week,

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.817
 it's called 1976 and it's off

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819
his record Since We Last Spoke.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.855
 It's a really cool Italian Job
 sorta feel that lends itself

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:59.225
perfectly to the rushed
feeling of this episode.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:02.128
("1976" by RJD2)

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:08.901
 - Uhh Illana,

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:12.071 align:start position:0%
  why is there to 2:10 train
  to Bridgeport anywhere?

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:13.706 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I don't know, I'm
 not a conductor!

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.708
- And that was our music
recap for episode eight,

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.143
 Destination Wedding.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.545 size:88% position:44%
 Thank you so much
 to Ramble, aka RJD2

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:20.780
 for letting us work with him

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.515
 and use some of the
 music on the episode.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.517 align:start position:0%
 Really really loved all the
 stuff he contributed and

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.219
