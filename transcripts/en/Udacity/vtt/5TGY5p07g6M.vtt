Now imagine that this yellow sheet of

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.640
paper is the Python Standard Library. Imagine that

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.070
this is what we got when we downloaded Python. Inside Python is a file named

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.150
webbrowser. And inside webbrowser is a function

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.470
called open. Now this is the function that

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.088
allowed us to play the YouTube video.

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:25.780
Much like webbrowser, there is another file or

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.920
module inside the Python Standard Library. It's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.300
called time, and time has several functions

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.980
defined inside of it. Two of them are, ctime which gives you the current time,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.490
and sleep, which suspends program animation for

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.610
a little bit. Now here's a thought, how

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.060
does function sleep actually suspends or pauses

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.750
program flow for a given number of seconds?

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.360
We don't really know how it does that behind

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.180
the scenes. In much the same way, how does

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.832
function open, opens up a webbrowser to play a

00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:02.080
YouTube video for us? We don't quite know how it

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.040
does that behind the scenes also. That detail is

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.540
hidden from us, and this hiding of detail in programming

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.020
is called abstraction. Now this idea of abstraction is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.020
a really powerful one in programming, because it allows us

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.790
to focus on the program that we actually want to write which

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.980
is the take a break program, and it empowers us to use

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.260
these functions simply by reading their

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.840
documentation. So let's read some documentation

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.300
now and see if these functions actually exist in the Python Standard Library.
