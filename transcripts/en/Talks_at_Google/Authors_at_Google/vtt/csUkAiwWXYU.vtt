[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:08.300
BOB LANGERT: One of the things
I often heard in my outreach

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.310
to the outside
world is, I didn't

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.930
know McDonald's did this stuff.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.420
Like, you work on corporate
social responsibility

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.130
at McDonald's.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.480
So I was very motivated to
kind of reveal the story.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.110
I also thought probably the
sweet spot for my audience

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.080
is the business community
and the NGO community.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.150
Because companies
today are wrestling

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.420
with this idea of how to
serve society and make

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.780
a profit at the same time.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.670
And it's not easy.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.100
The battle to do good--

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.712
It's a battle.

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:39.170
Everything in
business is a battle.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.180
But certainly doing good
takes a lot of effort.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.930
I thought by writing the book
and sharing the stories of all

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.090
these things that went
over the last 30 years--

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.710
and let's face it, McDonald's
was the hot rod issue

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.660
for so many things--

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.120
how we reacted,
who we worked with,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.465
how we solved problems,
how we did not succeed--

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:02.090
I thought all these things would
be worthwhile for the business

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.010
leaders today, and the
NGO leaders today that

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.020
are trying to make a difference.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.910
DAVID LANGERT: So early on in
the book in the introduction,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.610
you talk about
how the prevailing

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.880
wisdom among businesses was
the only responsibility company

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.070
had was to be profitable.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.267
But you challenged this
notion early and often

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:19.100
throughout the book.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.130
So why is corporate
social responsibility

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.310
and sustainability important
for business like McDonald's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.163
and Google as well?

00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:28.580
BOB LANGERT: I
think that's what's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.340
really interesting about the
journey of all the companies

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.370
over the last three decades,
really, is that you can't just

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.970
make money anymore.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.880
You know, before 10,
20, 30 years ago,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.660
companies were more
punished for not doing good.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.040
I mean, think of Nike, and
sweatshops, or Shell, some

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.940
of the instances that they had.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.030
But really, companies
today are seeing

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.420
that by responding
to societal issues,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.360
they're bringing value
to their business.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.870
For McDonald's, the data--
we created our own framework

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.070
for the future, which was 2014.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.790
The headline was,
"We're going to grow

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.920
our business by making
a positive difference

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.997
in the world."

00:02:07.997 --> 00:02:10.039
And I think that's the
evolution that we've seen,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.530
is that societal
issues don't have

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.180
to be a drag on the business.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.680
They don't have to be a risk.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.940
They don't have to be
something to be afraid of.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.720
It's actually what people want.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.900
And consumers want to engage
with companies that care.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.740
And it's the companies
that can figure out

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.380
the right formula of doing
what's good for society, what's

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.020
good for the company,
that are going

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.990
to be the leaders
of tomorrow's world.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.010
Again, it took us a while to
figure that out at McDonald's.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.758
Most of our work at McDonald's,
admittedly, was probably

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.050
very reactive at the beginning.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.835
When we were attacked on
waste or animal welfare,

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:44.960
we were like at McDonald's,
hey, we're good people.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.460
We're a good company.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.880
Why are you picking on us?

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.450
And we still did
something about it.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.390
But it came from more
of a defensive posture.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.110
So what's really changed--

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.130
I think the opportunity today
is that companies should not

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.000
be afraid of this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.860
They should look at this
as like climb the hill.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.960
The more responsible we are in
a smart way, taking smart risks,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.780
we can gain more
customers, more sales.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.340
We can save money.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.608
Better for our brand.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.650
Our people want to work
for a company that cares.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.363
I mean, the business case
for this is absolutely solid.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.780
DAVID LANGERT: You
referenced some

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.608
of the battles and some of
the attacks that came on you--

00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:21.400
came on McDonald's.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.380
And you had to deal with
a number of critics--

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.860
PETA, Greenpeace, the
movie "Supersize Me,"

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.480
the book "Fast Food Nation."

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.300
So what do you learn about
dealing with this wide range

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.582
of critics and activists?

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.790
BOB LANGERT: Sometimes I
think the subtitle of my job

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.950
was how to deal with
the critics and how

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.320
to deal with the people
that maybe didn't like us.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.520
The best thing I learned is that
really, they're not the enemy.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.688
Almost all these groups that
have an interest in companies,

00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:50.730
they might come at you
from a negative viewpoint.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.400
They might start a campaign.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.670
But the reality is they're as
passionate about what they're

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.393
trying to solve
in the world as we

00:03:58.393 --> 00:03:59.810
are in a company
trying to do what

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.935
we're doing in the company.

00:04:00.935 --> 00:04:04.580
So if you start with this idea
that these outside groups--

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.280
I always had the idea that
I'm going to assume innocence,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.890
that the people coming have had
the innocence of saying, hey,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.030
we want you to change.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.350
They might come at us in
a way that we don't like,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.329
but that maybe we
should listen and learn.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.540
To me, the best
example is something--

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.040
I mean, I grew up on the South
Side of Chicago, as you know.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.738
[LAUGHS]

00:04:22.738 --> 00:04:23.780
DAVID LANGERT: Of course.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.470
BOB LANGERT: And for me to have
an impact on the Amazon rain

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.888
forest in Brazil
in my life, I was

00:04:28.888 --> 00:04:30.180
like, how did this ever happen?

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.240
But real short story.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.070
Greenpeace attacked us.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.200
I think it was 2005.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.400
And it was for too much
soy farming in Brazil

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.920
causing deforestation
in the Amazon.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.820
Soy is exported to Europe.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.730
So a bunch of Greenpeace
people showed up

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.360
in our restaurants dressed up
as chickens and campaigning

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.660
against us.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.188
And so when--

00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:54.480
I just love that picture there.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.770
Can you imagine having breakfast
at McDonald's like that?

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.200
And I was very
proud of our company

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.710
and happy that I was part of the
team that said to Greenpeace,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.120
after we looked at the issue--

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.490
we shocked the living
daylights out of Greenpeace

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.700
by calling them-- and said,
hey, Greenpeace, we actually

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.330
agree with you.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.000
We don't agree
with your demands.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.958
We're not going to change
soy farming overnight

00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:17.640
at McDonald's.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.598
We're not into farming.

00:05:18.598 --> 00:05:22.650
But if we work together,
we can get other retailers

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.090
asking for the same thing.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.070
Cargill is one of our
biggest suppliers.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.410
They're deep into Brazil,
one of the biggest soy

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.000
traders in the world.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.210
If we work together,
Greenpeace, how about it?

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.420
And to Greenpeace's credit,
instead of campaigning,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.350
we shook hands.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.520
We met in rooms for
a couple of weeks.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.460
We gathered 15 other retailers.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.230
Cargill agreed to help us.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.430
In three months' time, from
the time the campaign started,

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.565
this moratorium was put in
place to save the Amazon.

00:05:50.565 --> 00:05:51.370
DAVID LANGERT: Wow.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.860
BOB LANGERT: So I
think most people

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.850
look at-- oh, Greenpeace.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.142
They're bad, they're the enemy.

00:05:55.142 --> 00:05:55.940
No.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.590
And matter of fact, we
took a trip for nine days

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.850
through the Amazon.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.808
And I don't think you
could tell the difference

00:06:01.808 --> 00:06:03.897
between the McDonald's
people on the trip

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:04.980
and the Greenpeace people.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.640
So it's amazing how much we
have in common with people

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.020
that come to us versus what we
have that's maybe not uncommon.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.520
DAVID LANGERT: The organizations
weren't the only folks that

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.780
helped you on this journey.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.010
One character that really
jumped out in the book

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.960
is Temple Grandin.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.210
BOB LANGERT: Did you like her?

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.780
DAVID LANGERT: Oh, I loved it.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.030
Do you mind elaborating
on her and why

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.550
she was so important when you
were working with animals?

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.360
BOB LANGERT: Well,
you know, if you

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.220
had asked me the most
fascinating person

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.490
I ever worked with, it
would be Dr. Temple Grandin.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.630
First of all, she's a
renowned animal scientist.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.650
She's probably the most renowned
and respected animal scientist

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.700
in the world.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.960
But she's also autistic.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.330
And it makes for a very
special personality.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.420
So my boss gave me the job in--

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.343
I think it was like 1998.

00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:48.510
He goes, Bob, you've got
to create an animal welfare

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.000
program for our suppliers.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.700
I didn't know anything
about animals.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.340
And so I needed to find somebody
that knew about animals.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.150
And Dr. Temple Grandin, I heard,
was the best that there is.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.330
So met her.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.680
She had this idea of creating
an audit system with our meat

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.322
suppliers.

00:07:05.322 --> 00:07:06.780
And I always remember
the first day

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.520
we went into the
first meat supplier.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.050
It's called Lopez Foods.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.850
It's in Oklahoma City.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.300
And we go in there.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.720
I thought I was going
in with Cher or somebody

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.592
like that, because Dr. Temple
Grandin was a rock star.

00:07:18.592 --> 00:07:20.550
There was people coming
out of the woodwork who

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.840
wanted to meet her.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.280
Because she's so highly
respected by everybody.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.130
She's respected by
the animal activists.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.170
She's respected by industry.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.680
So all I did was
channel her ideas.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.360
I matched her up
with our suppliers.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.600
And lo and behold, it
wasn't all that easy.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.040
But over the course of
three to five years,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.510
we implemented leading edge
animal welfare guidelines

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.140
and audit procedures for all
the suppliers from McDonald's.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.293
But best yet, you
know, the magic

00:07:48.293 --> 00:07:49.710
of working for
McDonald's and what

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.140
gave me a lot of satisfaction
is when we did things

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.330
for McDonald's,
they ended up being

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.810
adopted by everybody in the
industry throughout the world.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.710
So now animal welfare is almost
standard operating procedure,

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.010
based on working with
Dr. Temple Grandin.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.030
So everybody should watch
the movie "Temple Grandin."

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.960
It's an HBO movie--

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.930
Claire Danes.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.275
You'll love her yourself, if
you don't know her by now.

00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:15.900
DAVID LANGERT: McDonald's did a
lot of these great initiatives.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.730
But it seems
throughout the book,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.390
they had a struggle to
communicate these efforts

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.770
that they're doing.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.150
And it seems to be a common
issue with other companies.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.380
And I can even say
Google, sometimes,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.470
has issues communicating
our efforts as well.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.230
So how does a company
communicate their efforts

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.909
in a way that actually works?

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.159
BOB LANGERT: One of the main
complaints I got from all

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.419
the people that worked for
McDonald's-- because McDonald's

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.877
people would know
what we're doing.

00:08:41.877 --> 00:08:43.855
We always thought
we were much better

00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:46.230
at being a responsible company
than how we were portrayed

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.010
in the outside world.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.843
So everybody would come
to me and say, well,

00:08:48.843 --> 00:08:51.060
why don't we share more
with what we're doing?

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.185
I don't know.

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:54.450
I think there's
two reasons for why

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.670
there's a lack of good
communication going on.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.300
One is it is very hard to talk
about the good things you're

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.150
doing.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.532
Whenever you open yourself up to
touting something you're doing,

00:09:04.532 --> 00:09:06.990
there's always something about
your company or organization

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.550
that they can kind of pick on.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.300
So I had a boss
for several years

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.440
that said, hey, the strategy
was to get caught doing good,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.660
so not being proactive.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.330
I think the other thing is
companies get under attack.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.490
And like I said before,
a lot of companies.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.620
The natural reaction is to
say the critics are wrong,

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.620
the media-- why are you
asking me that question?

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.650
And you just kind
of get defensive.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.550
I think the solution
on it is one,

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.300
I just think the more
that I see even today

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.480
CEOs talking to the public,
it's like corporate speak.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.180
It's not something a human
being would actually say.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:52.000
So I think one, really work hard
at honest human communication,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.387
as if I'm talking to
my nephew versus trying

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:57.210
to talk to the world.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.130
And then I would say
being open and honest.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.400
And a lot of companies,
they're afraid to do that,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.330
because when you do
that, you have to say,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.767
here's what we do well.

00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:09.350
And you also have
to say, well, here's

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.530
where we are not doing well.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.830
And I think companies
need to get over that.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.200
Because consumers just want
to see companies trying.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.010
They want to see a commitment.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.910
They don't mind a
lack of progress,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.670
as long as you're trying
hard, and being open about it,

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.860
and making steps along the way.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.080
DAVID LANGERT: And this
all leads into the values

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.943
that a company has.

00:10:30.943 --> 00:10:32.360
And there's a
chapter in your book

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.050
where you discuss the challenges
that McDonald's had rolling out

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.900
their company values, given
the complexities of it,

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.800
the different organizations
within the company

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.820
and having global values
when different regions behave

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.340
differently.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.857
Can you elaborate on that a bit?

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.440
BOB LANGERT: One of my favorite
things that I ended up getting

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.130
involved with-- our CEO at the
time-- this is around 2007--

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.980
Jim Skinner, one
of our great CEOs--

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.050
he really thought as a
legacy for the company,

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.130
he could actually more formalize
the values of the company.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.930
So he created these seven values
that you see here right now.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.305
And we ended up being a team
that tried to integrate it

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:13.430
into the business globally.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.960
And we worked on this
for about five years.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.412
To be honest with you, it didn't
go as far as I wanted it to go.

00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:22.370
For instance, if you take
a look at the values,

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.328
I always thought they
had a little bit too much

00:11:24.328 --> 00:11:26.015
formal corporate speak.

00:11:26.015 --> 00:11:27.890
First one says we give
back to our community.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.030
So that's what we developed
at the corporate level.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.870
I really like what
Australia did.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.560
We were trying to
make it relevant

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.260
in the different markets.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.290
And so Australia said--

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.540
DAVID LANGERT: Translation--
we look after the locals.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.010
We grow our business profitably.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.770
And translation is, sure,
we're here to make dollars,

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:48.770
but that's what keeps
85,000 of us in a job.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.550
BOB LANGERT: When Jim Skinner
retired and a new CEO came in,

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.220
our values that were
being worked on-- it

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.810
sort of fizzled away.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.880
So in some sense,
they didn't last.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.740
Although I'm sure if
we talked to the people

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.410
at McDonald's today,
there's values.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.680
And I see it on their website.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.237
But they're not the same values.

00:12:06.237 --> 00:12:07.070
DAVID LANGERT: Yeah.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.487
BOB LANGERT: So
you kind of wonder

00:12:08.487 --> 00:12:09.630
sometimes how they shift.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.400
So my advice is I think
values are important.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.430
I think there should just
be three or four of them.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.050
I think top management
should always

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.127
be referencing the values of
the company any time they can.

00:12:22.127 --> 00:12:23.960
I think the people that
work for the company

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.580
should be measured
in some degree

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.190
by how they live those values.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.180
And that would be, to
me, the ideal world.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.870
And there's no better
way to be a sustainable

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.300
company than having
people that live

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.400
the values that are the vision.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.220
And I'm not quite sure
what the Google values are,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.680
but how your journey is going.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.830
But that would be my advice for
you as you go on your journey.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:50.290
DAVID LANGERT: Our values
are on the three respects.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.030
Let's talk a bit about the
internal battles you've faced.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.950
Because it wasn't
always external

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.710
where you ran into issues.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.840
Specifically, you were
given an assignment

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.860
to create a bold plan for
sustainability in 2020.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.750
Can you talk about that process?

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.850
BOB LANGERT: Yeah.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.060
Our number two guy ended up
being our CEO, Don Thompson.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.520
He gave me this
assignment in about 2010

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.800
to work on a team to develop a
really bold framework for what

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.600
we stand for.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.930
I started working on all
these efforts back in 1988.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.600
So it took how many years?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.270
22 years to finally
get to a point

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.180
where the company is saying,
this needs to be strategic.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.220
And he asked me to
come up with a way

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.200
to have bold goals
for the future.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.640
So our team worked on it
for quite a long time.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.380
And I came into the senior
management team, the top 20

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.120
people in the company.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.410
And they were not seeing a whole
lot of good about the framework

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.480
as I was describing it to them.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.100
And they kind of
got uncomfortable.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.050
Again, this is around the
beginning of 2010, 2011.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.440
They go, can we really
have 100% of all

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.260
of our food and packaging
be certifiably sustainable

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.730
by 2020?

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.520
We had a goal for 100%
sustainable fish, and coffee,

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.680
and palm oil, things like that.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.710
And we had just opened
up Vietnam, for example.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.390
They're like, are we going to
be able to do this in Vietnam?

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:19.560
And anyway, there's a whole
lot of risk adverseness

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.090
in the room.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.400
And I was asked to go back to
the team and make it less bold.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.190
And so I was very
downtrodden leaving the room.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.330
But I talked to my team--

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.310
the team that we--

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.100
and the team told me, go
back in and go at it again.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.780
We didn't want to
change a thing.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.340
And so I went back in.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.318
I used this chart here.

00:14:39.318 --> 00:14:41.360
And I thought I got to
approach this differently.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.500
Because how could a company be
asking our team to be doing--

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.190
They wanted us to be a
leader on sustainability.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.910
But then they told me in that
meeting they wanted no risk.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.500
So I went back and said, hey,
what do you want us to be?

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.290
And it just really opened up
the conversation to a point

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.210
where they approved the goals.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.270
So it worked.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.130
I'm very happy.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.240
But since then,
since I've retired,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.538
it's amazing what
McDonald's is doing.

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:08.830
They've already developed
even bigger and better goals.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.315
So they're very proud of that.

00:15:11.315 --> 00:15:13.690
DAVID LANGERT: And I think
that leads into one thing that

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.360
became clear is with
the size and scale

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.210
that McDonald's has
through these efforts,

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.160
you can really drive
transformative change.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.520
And you referenced a little
bit earlier the Amazon efforts.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.520
Not only changing
the organization

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.280
to McDonald's but the industry
and the world at large.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.580
Can you share a couple
of other examples?

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.370
BOB LANGERT: Being a leader of
sustainability in a company,

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.815
it sounds really fascinating
and interesting, which it is.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.440
And you've got a lot
of responsibility.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.880
But the bottom line is I'm not
really responsible for anything

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.050
either.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.740
Because I'm not a
head of supply chain.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.870
I'm not a head of operations.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.120
I'm not the head of marketing.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.330
So a lot of my role is to
work with partners and leaders

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.160
to identify what's
good for the company

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.730
that they will want to promote.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.890
Probably the thing that
I'm really most proud of

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.440
is our company, this
framework that we developed--

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:12.160
one of our specific goals was to
start buying sustainable beef.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.100
And you talk about where the
sweet spot is for McDonald's

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.390
and how it could be good for the
business and good for society.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.780
We call that shared value,
bringing both values at once.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.700
And we had a team
of people come in--

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.700
NGOs from the outside world and
chief sustainability officers

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.100
from Coca-Cola, Unilever.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.620
They came into our top
management meeting.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.690
I was given a half day
to convince our team

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.260
that this is what we should do.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.950
So I thought the best way to do
it is bring these outsiders in.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.170
We asked these eight leaders
from the outside world,

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.310
what should McDonald's do?

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.620
If you were CEO for one day
and had to make one decision,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.630
what would you do?

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.540
They all said, you
should work on beef.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.950
Make beef more sustainable.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.630
Your brand is beef.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.570
Beef has environmental
health impacts.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.670
For McDonald's global
footprint-- you know,

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.300
the carbon footprint for
McDonald's-- it's 75% in supply

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.819
chain, and it's mostly
coming from livestock.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.319
So I was amazed that
our company agreed

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:14.050
to set a goal for starting to
buy it when we didn't even know

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.390
what the definition of it was.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:21.140
And you said we have a lot
of influence and power.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.980
We do, and we don't.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.940
I often ask, how
much beef do we buy?

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.315
And I'll ask
different audiences.

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:31.660
And a lot of audiences will
say, hey, you must buy 10%, 20%,

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.040
50% of the beef in the world.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.858
Well, we buy 2% of the
beef, which, by the way,

00:17:35.858 --> 00:17:36.400
is still big.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.330
DAVID LANGERT: Yep.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.163
BOB LANGERT: But we can
not snap our fingers

00:17:39.163 --> 00:17:41.890
and change the way beef
ranchers produce cows

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.670
and how they process them.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.520
So what we learned
over the years is

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.675
that rather than kind of mandate
all this stuff, we collaborate.

00:17:49.675 --> 00:17:53.050
And with beef, we used
our convening power

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.320
to create a global roundtable
for sustainable beef.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.080
And so what we did is we
brought in the World Wildlife

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.130
Fund, an NGO.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.607
We brought in Walmart.

00:18:01.607 --> 00:18:03.190
We brought in the
biggest beef company

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:07.390
in the world called JBS and
dozens of other stakeholders

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.000
to define sustainable beef.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.110
And it's proceeding
at a really good clip.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.680
McDonald's Canada, as
we speak, is selling

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.318
sustainable, certified beef.

00:18:19.318 --> 00:18:20.110
DAVID LANGERT: Wow.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.170
BOB LANGERT: So glad
to see that happening.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.410
And it is transformative
when you realize that you can

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.780
actually work on things
that change things beyond

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.860
McDonald's.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.863
DAVID LANGERT: You also
mentioned that trip

00:18:30.863 --> 00:18:31.446
to the Amazon.

00:18:31.446 --> 00:18:33.130
This is you there.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.650
BOB LANGERT: If I had to say
what my favorite adventure was,

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.660
that was definitely
going through the Amazon.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:44.470
And I really-- to see up close
how people live in the Amazon--

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.630
I think too many
people in companies,

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.673
they don't go out and see
what really is happening.

00:18:49.673 --> 00:18:51.340
So I think it's really,
really important

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.920
to go out and see
what's happening

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.220
with the forest and the Amazon,
go see how tomatoes are picked

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.260
in southern Florida,
go see how animals

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.340
are treated in facilities.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.950
So that was really
a big part of what

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.720
I felt very strongly about.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.470
DAVID LANGERT: At the
end of each chapter,

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.400
you have these Hard Knock
Nuggets, these learnings,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.400
teachings that you end with.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.230
You mentioned
earlier that you had

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.390
no real authority in your role.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.910
So you were really
relying on your ability

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.340
to influence others.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.090
Can you share some of
your tips on how you

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.410
were able to accomplish that?

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.350
BOB LANGERT: Yeah,
I think people

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.187
that work on corporate
social responsibility

00:19:31.187 --> 00:19:32.770
and sustainability--
sometimes I think

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:37.420
we should be having a
title, maybe influencing

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.310
manager, influencing director,
or officer of influence.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.910
Because I think that's a chief
skill that you have to have.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.780
And maybe it's my next book
But in terms of how you do it--

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.560
I mean, there's books written
about how you influence others.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.280
All I can tell you that what
I think worked for me is it

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.950
starts with developing
really good relationships.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.460
You develop trust.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.430
So people need to trust you.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.670
They need to trust
you as a human being,

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.850
and also trust that whatever
you're saying and doing

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.110
is the truth.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.560
You're going to deliver.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.190
So it starts with trust.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.550
I think it also
starts influencing--

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.490
I'm not sure they
teach this a whole lot.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.220
Basically, you've got to
be a great communicator.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.840
And I remember Jim Cantalupo.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.880
He was one of our great
CEOs at McDonald's.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.280
He turned around the
business in 2001.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.320
I asked him after two years of
turning it around, I said, Jim,

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.800
like, what did you learn
that surprised you?

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.650
He goes, I can't believe
that 99% of the job

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.460
is communicating.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.453
And so that always stuck with
me But I think being persuasive.

00:20:47.453 --> 00:20:48.870
And I remember
reading this book--

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.760
and I recommend it
to your watchers

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.393
here-- it's called "Made
to Stick" by Chip Heath.

00:20:53.393 --> 00:20:54.310
I just read that book.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.120
And I go, so many
people on sustainability

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.130
that are pushing things.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.270
They put forth
facts and figures.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.420
And they kind of
think how they think,

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.940
and they're pushing
something to somebody else.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.960
I always thought the best
way is to think how you think

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.160
and to put things into a
way that I can convince you.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.660
You need the facts and figures.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.330
But it's more the
story and more maybe

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.242
the emotional side that you
also need to communicate.

00:21:22.242 --> 00:21:23.700
DAVID LANGERT: So
at this point, we

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.790
can open it up to our audience
questions, if anyone has some.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.140
So before coming to
McDonald's, what did you do?

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.363
What was your background between
the South Side and McDonald's?

00:21:32.363 --> 00:21:34.780
BOB LANGERT: I grew up on the
South Side of Chicago first.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.120
And I think I'm so lucky to
do the work I ended up doing.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.240
Because I always say I'm
a product of the 1960s.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.200
And I have an older
brother, four years older.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.250
You know him well.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.720
He's your father.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.373
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:50.373 --> 00:21:51.540
And he actually led the way.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.330
We used to tape record.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:58.200
I mean, this is back
in 1964, 1966, 1968.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.590
We used to record all the
songs, and play tapes,

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.560
and make a top 10 list.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.510
But I just remember I loved
the music of the '60s,

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.520
that revolutionary take.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.110
You know, the Bob Dylan, the
Neil Young, the Crosby, Stills,

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.260
Nash and Young, Jimi Hendrix,
and this whole explosion

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.010
of peace, and
justice, anti-Vietnam.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:21.030
To be honest with you, I
feel like that's who I was.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.310
I was an activist at heart.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.260
But hey, I went to college.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.080
I got married.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.967
I had kids.

00:22:26.967 --> 00:22:28.800
There weren't jobs like
this when I came out

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.410
of school in 1978
to try to do good

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.640
in society and the company.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.330
So OK, that was kind
of a hidden side of me.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:41.040
And to answer your question more
specifically, believe or not,

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.170
I was in charge of truck
drivers and getting

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.440
food and packaging delivered
to the McDonald's restaurants.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.715
And so back in '88--

00:22:47.715 --> 00:22:50.720
1988 and 1989, McDonald's
is under attack.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.788
Well, we're a symbol of
a disposable society.

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:54.330
There's too much
waste being produced

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.330
by all of our packaging.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.460
Remember it as polyst--

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.440
well, you're too young.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.640
For older people, remember
the polystyrene foam clamshell

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.890
that people hated.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.020
So for the first time
ever, McDonald's was

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.190
a despised, evil company.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.030
And there was nobody
working on the environments.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.430
And for some reason,
they plucked me out

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.500
and said, hey, Bob,
you're in charge of saving

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.880
the polystyrene clamshell.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.500
We tried to recycle it.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.020
I got rid of CFCs in packaging.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.400
And that was my beginning.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.560
And that's when I
realized how lucky I

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.510
was to get something
that maybe was

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.490
inside me waiting to come out.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.990
And I got to do it
through business.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.490
DAVID LANGERT: It's
somewhat ironic.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.310
Because your goal was
to save the clamshell.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.100
And--

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.596
BOB LANGERT: I didn't succeed.

00:23:38.596 --> 00:23:41.445
DAVID LANGERT: [LAUGHS] But it
opened your eyes to other ways

00:23:41.445 --> 00:23:42.070
that it keeps--

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.528
BOB LANGERT: We
couldn't save that.

00:23:43.528 --> 00:23:46.120
Because people couldn't see
the value in that polystyrene

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:46.620
clamshell.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.078
We spent millions of
dollars trying to save it.

00:23:49.078 --> 00:23:49.870
I'm glad we didn't.

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.620
It was such an obstacle
in the way of our image.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.330
DAVID LANGERT: Yeah.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.830
BOB LANGERT: And
really, we ended up

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.410
working on this project with
the Environmental Defense Fund.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.180
And just to tell that
story real shortly.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.370
We were the first
company to work

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.860
with a famous environmental
group, the Environmental

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.260
Defense Fund, back in 1990.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.990
Today, corporations
and NGOs work together.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.390
But that was like the first
big one that happened.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:16.470
And we worked for six months,
and we reduced about 42 things

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.563
to reduce, reuse, recycle
within McDonald's.

00:24:18.563 --> 00:24:19.230
And we measured.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.420
During the decade
of the '90s, we

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.760
reduced 300 million
pounds of waste.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.340
And we got a White House award.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.850
I was actually in the Rose
Garden getting an award.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.340
Whereas two years earlier,
we were in the doghouse.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.000
So we came a long way.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.250
DAVID LANGERT: That's awesome.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.917
BOB LANGERT: So I cut
my teeth that way.

00:24:36.917 --> 00:24:39.480
It's really good to cut your
teeth early on with such

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.390
a win-win-win thing.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.630
And that's how I see it
should be for companies today.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.340
This battle to do good--

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.160
it should be less
a battle and more

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.787
of an opportunity
for businesses.

00:24:52.787 --> 00:24:54.870
DAVID LANGERT: I think one
thing that became clear

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.870
as you're working
with these critics

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.370
is I think was easy for you to
work on environmental issues

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.590
because it was a
passion point of yours.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.070
But there are times when
specifically on the animal

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.000
side, you admittedly didn't
know much about animal treatment

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.870
and even disagreed with
viewpoints like you're not

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.740
a vegan, you eat meat.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.120
And so how were you able to
bridge that gap when you're

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.130
coming from a different
viewpoint of someone

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.510
you're working
with that's really

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.290
challenging you to be better?

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.540
BOB LANGERT: Well, I always
try to find common ground.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.385
So I can find common ground
with those people that

00:25:31.385 --> 00:25:32.760
are involved with
the environment

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.843
and protecting the planet.

00:25:33.843 --> 00:25:37.140
I can find people that are
for social justice and better

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.350
conditions for people working.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.330
And I'm all for good
animal treatment.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:47.950
But the issue here was animal
rights versus animal welfare.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.988
And there's a real
big difference there.

00:25:49.988 --> 00:25:51.780
So yeah, I had a hard
time wrapping my head

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.280
around the animal
rights people that

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.327
wanted animals to be at a
similar level as human beings.

00:25:58.327 --> 00:25:59.910
But I didn't have
to wrestle too hard.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.870
Because the bottom line
is animal welfare--

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:04.950
a little bit different.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.050
I spoke about Dr.
Temple Grandin.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.075
We would do all of our
work to protect animals.

00:26:09.075 --> 00:26:10.950
There was nobody more
passionate about making

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.520
sure they didn't suffer pain,
and suffering, and abuse.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.020
But at the end of
the day, you know,

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.200
we'd have dinner at a
steakhouse that night

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.060
versus looking at
the animals like they

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.600
don't belong in
the system at all.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.970
And I respect people
that are vegetarians.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.120
But that's not what
McDonald's is about.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.800
And so I think
there's common ground

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.410
to be found, even in these
thorny issues that you

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:33.910
refer to.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.535
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:26:35.535 --> 00:26:37.670
I'm just curious to hear
if it's challenging,

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.190
with so many franchisees
around the world--

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.420
how you keep your corporate
social responsibility goals

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.920
the same at a corporate level
and then also at the franchise

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.003
level, if that's been
challenging or something you

00:26:48.003 --> 00:26:49.400
guys have had to focus on.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.610
BOB LANGERT: Yeah,
McDonald's is owned by 5,000

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.300
independent owner/operators.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.470
And I think today it's
getting closer to 95%

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.390
of the whole system is run by
independent business people.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.900
So by definition, you
can't force anything

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.830
down their throats.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.052
And even the great
owner/operators

00:27:06.052 --> 00:27:07.760
of McDonald's, the
reason they're so good

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.290
is they're entrepreneurial.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.980
They don't necessarily
like to be told what to do.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.940
And that's part of our success.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.960
So it is a challenge.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.790
So how do you work with that?

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.970
The way I work with
it is number one,

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:27.230
you've got to get something
going that people get behind.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.170
And what I'm really
happy, even since I left,

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.120
McDonald's has
made sustainability

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.270
almost part of their brand.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.460
They call it now scale for good.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.440
Our owner/operators
are on the front lines.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.770
They hear all these
complaints and people

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.070
want us to be a better company.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.403
And we think we're good already.

00:27:42.403 --> 00:27:46.550
So in general, the programs
that I was working on

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.680
and they're working on today--

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.430
they welcome that.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.640
The owner/operators want
to pressure relief of not

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.970
being perceived as a bad guy.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:28:00.340
And plus, you've got a set of
goals that are actually doable

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.400
and they can relate to.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.420
So McDonald's is setting goals,
back then and even today,

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.680
to reduce waste, recycle more,
to have recyclable packaging,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.820
and supply chain.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.180
So many of these things--

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.802
about half the things you
do in a restaurant in terms

00:28:17.802 --> 00:28:19.010
of how you train your people.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.140
But so much is done in
supply chain, for example.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.340
I mean, the biggest impact from
McDonald's is in supply chain.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.872
And the owner/operators
trust McDonald's

00:28:26.872 --> 00:28:28.080
to do the right things there.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.600
And I spoke about a
lot of the examples.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.020
So I think the franchise
system is a strength.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.788
But it does make it a
little bit more difficult.

00:28:35.788 --> 00:28:37.580
AUDIENCE: First a
comment, then a question.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.690
Bob, thanks for coming.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.150
I wanted to compliment
you on your choice

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.980
of cover art for the book.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.260
I think you really nailed it.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.300
I know you were considering
a number of options.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.010
Great job.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.990
As far as the question--

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.150
clearly, your
influence has impacted

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.120
McDonald's in a massively
positive way over the years.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.940
I was just curious.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.880
Not everything in
corporations is roses.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.833
So biggest challenge,
or biggest regret,

00:29:01.833 --> 00:29:04.250
or biggest thing you worked
on that you were hoping to get

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.380
done that couldn't--
just didn't take--

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.630
BOB LANGERT: The list is long.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.130
I don't know.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:14.480
I think at a macro level, what
probably disappointed-- like,

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.100
if I was frustrated
about my work

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.350
at McDonald's, it would
be probably the decision

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.130
making process.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.470
It just got worse and
worse as we got bigger.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.140
Sometimes I felt I had
to go to 30, 40 people

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.570
to say yes to something.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:33.200
I had to go to another 20 or 30
that could-- one no knocks it

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.550
out of the box.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:39.530
So I think we became
too bureaucratic.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.470
When I retire, the new
CEO, Steve Easterbrook,

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.260
was going to shake that
all up and get decision

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.310
making more streamlined.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.168
I haven't lived the last four
years to know what that's like.

00:29:49.168 --> 00:29:50.960
But from what I read,
I think they're doing

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.550
a much better job of that.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.210
I think another thing
that frustrates me--

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.030
if I had to relive the
McDonald's history--

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.570
like, I thought about this
when I was reading the book--

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.660
we didn't come up with
our strategic framework

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.680
that I spoke about until 2014.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.220
These issues started to
percolate in 1988 and 1990.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.230
So you can say that
we were awfully

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.570
late to join the bandwagon.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.740
I wish we would have
developed our framework 10,

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.210
15 years earlier.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:19.630
But it's never too late.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.610
And that's my message
to the broader audience

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:23.720
today and all companies.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.400
Just don't be sitting
back afraid of this.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.810
Get going on it now and
develop your strategy.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.620
Companies should develop
what they stand for.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.730
They shouldn't be sitting
back waiting for criticism

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:38.930
to come in.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:42.200
Develop your own goals,
what you want to stand for.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.475
Do it, communicate, and
keep that process going.

00:30:46.475 --> 00:30:48.350
AUDIENCE: What is your
experience with people

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.515
who view sustainability
altruistically versus necessary

00:30:51.515 --> 00:30:52.760
for PR?

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.790
BOB LANGERT: Well, I think--

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.170
if I understand
your question, it's

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.480
looking at sustainability
through an altruistic lens

00:30:59.480 --> 00:30:59.990
versus--

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.170
AUDIENCE: People who maybe
view it as something that is

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.330
in their hearts the right
thing to do versus, yeah,

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.677
we have to do it because it
looks poorly if we don't.

00:31:07.677 --> 00:31:09.510
BOB LANGERT: That's an
interesting question.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.080
Because you know, that's part
of the journey that we were on.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.663
I worked for a company
that the reason

00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:16.400
that we did a lot of this
stuff before in history

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.920
is that our company really
wanted to do the right thing.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.190
I would go into meetings
at McDonald's-- this is

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.180
in the '90s and 2000s--

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.380
tough issues.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.940
All the questions
I was being asked

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.190
were, what's the
right thing to do?

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.770
And what the cost of
it would be talked

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.260
about a little bit later.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:38.990
But feeling good about it
isn't good enough in a company.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:43.230
And back in the old days, it
used to be just philanthropy.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.130
So I really think at a higher
level than feeling good

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.460
about it is a company should
be looking at it as actually

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.880
good for their business.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.020
It should be like
more mercenary.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.870
I mean, David, you
talked about used

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.540
to be that the only goal of
business was to make a profit.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.690
But I think profit and
purpose go together.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.320
And the better
companies are going

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.440
to see that sooner versus later.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.300
And you should do
it for both reasons.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.430
You should do it because
it's in your heart.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.880
I think most people that work
for companies want to do good,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.210
and you should unleash
that in your organization.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:19.430
But the best way to unleash
it is you actually--

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.350
it comes from the C-Suite.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.190
You have people working for it.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.250
I'll give you an example
of how integrated this

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.110
is into McDonald's today.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.390
During most of my
time at McDonald's--

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:32.390
30 years or so working on it--

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.340
I was a staff of one many years.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.020
Sometimes I had
one or two people

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.970
working for me along the way.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.680
It got to be a little
bit more and more.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.670
But since we
established a framework,

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:45.710
they've got over 40 people with
sustainability in their job

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.990
description around the
world, which really tells you

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.690
that it's integrated, not
as a nice thing to do,

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.455
but more as a way to
grow the business.

00:32:53.455 --> 00:32:54.830
AUDIENCE: What's
the single thing

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:58.202
we can encourage consumers to
do within this category to make

00:32:58.202 --> 00:33:01.070
a difference on sustainability?

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.560
BOB LANGERT: We never
solved the riddle in my time

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.330
there in terms of getting the
consumer directly involved.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.550
But I think that's changing.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:15.920
Because what's changing is the
brand, the power of the brand.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.810
One of the things that we were
trying to solve at McDonald's

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:22.700
is McDonald's brand health.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.870
Back when Jim Skinner was
CEO, back in about 2008, 2009,

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.240
we had a very discouraging
trend at McDonald's.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.860
Our business was
growing like this.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.280
These are the charts that
we've thrown up on the walls.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.510
And our brand health
was going like this.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:41.600
So we learned through
studying brand health.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.570
For instance, we had 42
indicators for brand health.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.180
About 21 of them were long term.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.390
And almost every one of those
21 were related to some aspect

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.420
of sustainability-- how
you treat your people,

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.462
how you treat the environment,
your supply chain,

00:33:54.462 --> 00:33:55.520
are you ethical--

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.830
questions like that.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.710
And so what we learned is that
consumers around the world

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.100
really cared about these issues.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.180
Now, do they want to pay more?

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.010
Probably not.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.139
But in terms of the
brand reputation,

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.040
they want a company to do that.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.230
And we also learned--

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.170
part of the reason that we got a
strategy going at McDonald's is

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.530
that our researchers said
that for every one percentage

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.190
increase in brand health, we
would get 2% increase in sales.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.810
But it takes three to five
years to achieve that.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.540
So it takes kind of
a long term effort.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.739
So I think you're seeing more of
that now through companies like

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:31.320
McDonald's.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.105
I've noticed more
visibility of this.

00:34:35.105 --> 00:34:36.980
Because I think companies
like McDonald's are

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.909
seeing that it does
impact their brand.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.739
They've got to put
money behind it

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:43.110
so that consumers can see it.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.110
DAVID LANGERT: In the
book, you talk about the--

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.500
or even here today-- you talked
about the aversion to risk.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.830
And some of that stems
from a missed target.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.070
So what advice would you give
if you fall short of the goals

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.170
that you set for yourself,
and how would you

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:58.597
handle that situation?

00:34:58.597 --> 00:35:00.680
BOB LANGERT: I think that's
one of the things that

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.355
stops companies from
doing a bold goal.

00:35:03.355 --> 00:35:04.730
Like, what if we
don't get there?

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:05.690
Are we going to end up in jail?

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.398
We had people at
McDonald's that thought,

00:35:07.398 --> 00:35:09.230
oh, if we don't
achieve this goal,

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.885
I'm really going
to get in trouble.

00:35:10.885 --> 00:35:13.010
And there is a certain
element to that, believe me.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.750
I mean, when you put
a goal out there,

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.600
you've got to give it a
sincere effort to get there.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.570
One of the things that hurt
my efforts at McDonald's was

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:21.600
early on--

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.690
this was about 2000-- we
made this announcement

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:27.130
to get out of trans fatty
acids in our cooking oil.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:29.680
And we said we'd do it in
about three years' time.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.730
And we failed to
meet that deadline.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.940
And we ended up getting
a lawsuit of some sort

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.460
and settling for
$10 million or so.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.830
We ended up getting rid of
the TFAs in our cooking oil,

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.930
but it took a couple
of years later.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.810
And it always left a
stain on the company.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:48.920
We were like, well, why set
a goal when somebody could

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.500
come around and go after us?

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.210
But I think to
answer your question

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:58.790
more directly, what you need to
do is be very open and honest.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.950
And what we've learned
and other companies

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.880
have learned-- if you set a
recycling goal, and it's 50%,

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.660
and all you do is
achieve at 40%,

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.030
keep ongoing communication.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:13.380
Here's what we're doing, and
here's where we're failing.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.620
Here's where we
need some more help.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.900
Just being more open
and honest about

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.230
it is a way to share the
experience with consumers.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.900
And I think the
critics and NGOs--

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.610
they encourage companies.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.550
They'd rather see you
try and maybe fail

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.848
a little bit along the way
versus not even try at all.

00:36:31.848 --> 00:36:33.390
DAVID LANGERT: Last
question I'll ask

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:37.320
is what excites you about
corporate social responsibility

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.700
and sustainability today?

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.283
BOB LANGERT: Well,
what really excites

00:36:40.283 --> 00:36:43.260
me is how I see the younger
people getting involved.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.210
I mean, I'm just so impressed.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.280
For instance, I'm impressed
with the team at McDonald's,

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.510
the people that are there.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.910
There's a few more of them,
as I mentioned before.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.200
But they're-- at the age that I
was at, they're smarter than I

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.120
am.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.263
They're go-getters.

00:37:00.263 --> 00:37:01.680
They know how to
work with people.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.640
And I speak a lot at different
colleges and universities.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.140
There's so many
people now that when

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.780
they go through
MBA schools, they

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.870
want to make a difference in the
organizations that they join.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.360
And now they have
an outlet for that.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.690
And so seeing, I
would say, the CEOs

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:22.470
of my generation in
terms of how they really

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:23.610
looked at sustainability--

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.240
I would say, in general, I
give them a flunking grade.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.990
More of them looked at it as a
problem versus an opportunity.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:35.580
Whereas I see the younger
executives coming up today--

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.950
I have a lot of hope.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.170
I mean, who's leading
the charge in the--

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:46.090
so take carbon footprint
and climate change.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:47.410
We hear a lot about that.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.050
But who's leading the charge?

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.400
It's not governments.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.880
But you've got companies
every day making commitments,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.530
McDonald's included.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.780
And I think that's where
leadership is going to come.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.360
And it's going to come stronger
with the next generation

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.208
of leaders.

00:38:01.208 --> 00:38:02.250
DAVID LANGERT: Excellent.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.630
Well, thanks for
joining us, Bob.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.042
And thanks,
everyone, for coming.

00:38:05.042 --> 00:38:06.000
BOB LANGERT: Thank you.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.650
[APPLAUSE]
