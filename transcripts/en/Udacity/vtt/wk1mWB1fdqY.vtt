00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.110
Okay, so we've now seen an abstract example of

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.420
decision trees. So let's make certain that we understand

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.270
it with a concrete example. So, to your right

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.780
is a specific decision tree that looks at some of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.010
the features that we talked about. Whether you are

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.280
occupied or not, whether the restaurant is occupied or not

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.364
what type of restaurant it is. Your choices are

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:25.250
pizza, Thai, or other. And whether the people inside look

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.300
happy or not. The possible outputs are again binary

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.180
either you don't go or you do go, into

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.610
the restaurant. On your left is a table which

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.210
has six of the features that we've talked about. Whether

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.060
the restaurant is occupied or not, the type of

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.990
restaurant, whether it's raining outside or not, whether your hungry

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.970
or not. Whether you're on a hot and whether

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.310
the people inside look happy, and some values for each

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.300
of those. And what we would like for you to do is to

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.320
tell us what the output of this decision tree would be in each case.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.970
&gt;&gt; Alright, so the decision tree here is a, it's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.250
a classifier, but we had another name. Oh, it's a concept.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.610
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.810
&gt;&gt; Alright, and each row of this is a different time that

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.970
we're stopping at a restaurant, and the, the little values there summarize what

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.740
is true about this particular situation. And, and you're saying we need

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.740
to then trace through this decision tree and figure out what class is,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.200
okay yeah, that's what you said. Okay, I'm

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.670
ready. Alright, perfect. Okay, that's the quiz, go.
