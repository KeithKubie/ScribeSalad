RICHARD JULIAN: It's a
tremendous impact, actually,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.950
that I'm seeing
through Khan Academy.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.690
The most impact I see
are for those kids

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.820
who really need the challenge.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.150
And I also see the spark in
the kids who've struggled,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.110
who, in a whole
group math lesson,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.630
can appear to be lost and
then shy and then try to hide.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.690
And now they can hide behind
their computer screen,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.010
so to speak, and continue
to work at their own pace.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.468
COURTNEY CADWELL:
A lot of students

00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:40.230
are very cognizant of where they
are in relation to their peers.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.640
Some of them won't
want to appear smarter.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.410
Some won't want
to appear slower.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.590
Those students will
hesitate to ask questions.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.580
They just want to be
right there in the middle.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.150
Teaching to the middle
only does the middle good.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.740
And it seems like you're leaving
out 2/3 of the class that way.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.990
And so there has to be
a better way to do it.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.760
KAMI THORDARSON:
The Khan Academy

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.865
offers an assessment
piece that's incredible.

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:03.890
It's so right there
and immediate.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.960
It's a quick picture of
where students are at,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.030
where they are having issues,
where their struggles are.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690
COURTNEY CADWELL: So I know
who I need to visit with,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.400
and where I can
help them, where I

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.375
can come alongside, and
remediate and support.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.000
KAMI THORDARSON: They
love those "aha!"

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.583
moments where they
can be the teacher.

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.260
And they can tell
me about something

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.065
that they think I
don't know how to do.

00:01:22.065 --> 00:01:24.250
RICHARD JULIAN: My students
select weekly goals

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.310
for themselves, based
on their own data.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.690
So I have them looking
at their own data now.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.210
COURTNEY CADWELL:
In a graphic way,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.200
they're able to visualize,
in a very concrete way,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.452
their progress.

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:36.410
Usually you just move
through a math classroom.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.230
It's like, OK, we
finished this chapter.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.500
We finished that book.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.160
But the kids don't
really see everything

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.250
that they've accomplished.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.094
And this lets them see it,
and it makes it real for them.

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:47.760
RICHARD JULIAN: And
then, at that point,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.060
I was excited for my kids,
because I saw that, again,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.880
as being a tool for them that
ultimately would help them

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.660
become responsible for their
own learning, and deciding hey,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.940
this is where I need work.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.930
COURTNEY CADWELL: The
kids are enjoying it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.330
because it's very
engaging for them.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.998
I'm enjoying it because my
kids do, my students do.

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:08.039
KAMI THORDARSON: Kids go
home excited about math,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.400
and that's what parents see.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.670
They see that kids are
talking about math.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.630
They're discussing
what they did in class.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.620
They're showing them
something on the computer

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.995
that they just
learned how to do.

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:19.536
COURTNEY CADWELL: Parents know
their kids better than anyone.

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:21.472
So they can encounter
a Khan Academy problem

00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:23.430
if they're working through
it with their child.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.680
They can say, hey, remember
when we were at the beach?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.290
And we did this, and this
is what was involved.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.380
And so they can really help
me tie these new concepts

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.570
to previous learning if they
get involved with their kids,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.230
with the Khan Academy, at home.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.070
RICHARD JULIAN:
Math, I always found

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.420
after teaching for 21
years, kids love it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.350
or kids don't love it.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.900
And now I think I've
got 27 kids in my class

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.920
who could, at some point during
the day say, hey, I love math.
