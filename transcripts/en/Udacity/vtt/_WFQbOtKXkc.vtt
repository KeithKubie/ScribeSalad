00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.580
Hedge funds are among the most
computationally demanding environments

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.910
I know of.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.420
They have infrastructure
requirements like huge databases,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.251
significant network connectivity,
low latency and

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:18.203
high bandwidth connectivity,
real-time processing, and so on.

00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:22.853
I want to show you as an example,
the typical kinds of computing

00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:27.520
that goes on inside a hedge fund
to motivate you for this class.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.119
In other words, this isn't exactly
the way all hedge funds work, but

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.740
this is just to give you a taste for
how many hedge funds work.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.430
And you'll see, I think,
that computing and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.230
computational capabilities
are core here.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.720
So we're going to work
backwards from the market

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.150
back towards the sort of back
office of the hedge fund.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.390
The way things work are we have
certain portfolio that is which stocks

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.640
we have and whether we're in positive or
negative positions with regard to them.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.530
The trading algorithm here is central.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.690
It's interacting with the market,
observing the live portfolio.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.634
And what it's trying to do is
to get this live portfolio

00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:20.280
to match some target portfolio.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.390
So somewhere further back
inside the hedge fund

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.750
we've decided what this target
portfolio ought to look like.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.760
In other words,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.510
how many shares of Apple, how many
shares of Delta Airlines we should have,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.720
and so on, and this trading
algorithm is trying to get us there.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.550
So it's comparing target with live.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.400
And then to move this portfolio towards
that target, it's issuing orders.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.560
So it sends order like buy 200
shares of Apple to the market.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.210
Those orders get executed or not,
and that updates the live portfolio.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.550
Now one reason this kind of
trading algorithm is important

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.710
is you don't want to
execute everything at once.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.760
In other words,
suppose we wanted to take a very,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.620
very large position in Apple.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.196
If we were just to send an order, hey,
buy me 10 million shares of Apple,

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:20.065
that would affect us detrimentally
in the sense that the price for

00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:22.207
Apple would probably rise.

00:02:22.207 --> 00:02:24.840
And we would not get a good execution.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.450
So this training algorithm takes those
sorts of things into consideration as

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.070
it moves our live portfolio to be
more close to the target portfolio.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.930
In fact, sometimes it takes days
to enter a particular position.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.270
So this doesn't necessarily
happen all at once.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.269
And there's many, many different
types of trading algorithms that have

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.980
been invented to solve these problems.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.190
Now let's step one step back into
the computing of the hedgefund, and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.416
look at how we arrive at
this target portfolio.

00:02:55.416 --> 00:03:00.292
Here's that target portfolio,
and here is some of the data and

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:05.268
computing that could go into
computing that target portfolio.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:10.795
So from somewhere, machine learning
perhaps, we have a forecast

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:16.134
of what stock prices are going to
be at some time into the future.

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:21.440
And that can of course drive what our
target portfolio ought to be for today.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.687
In other words, if we're forecasting
that BAC is going to go up,

00:03:26.687 --> 00:03:31.541
this might represent that we
think it's going to go up 5%.

00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:35.560
We might want to increase
our holdings in that.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.560
If we think that Apple, for instance,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.520
is going to go down,
we might want to decrease our holdings.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.209
So this forecast informs this algorithm
called a Portfolio Optimizer.

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.036
That works to balance the risks and
rewards for

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:57.485
a balanced portfolio that
considers volatility and

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:02.707
correlation between different stocks and
so on.

00:04:02.707 --> 00:04:06.825
We're going to talk a lot about
portfolio optimization later in this

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:08.140
course.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.607
Some other considerations that go into
Portfolio Optimizer are historical data,

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:16.351
open, high, low, close, and volume.

00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:21.606
We can look at that historical data to
inform how stocks are correlated or

00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:24.104
uncorrelated to one another, and

00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:28.870
also of critical importance
is our current portfolio.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.750
It may be the case that if we're
holding something, we don't

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.750
want to exit it immediately because
we'd be penalized by rapidly selling it.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.690
So this optimizer takes all
this information into account

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.270
to get to the target portfolio

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.500
that our trading algorithm is
working to drive us towards.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.770
Now one more stop along our road here at
the computing infrastructure of a hedge

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.420
fund is to look at how do we come
up with this N-day forecast.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.860
By N, N might be five days or
ten days or whatever.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.010
So here's this N-day forecast, and we've
got some kind of forecasting algorithm.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.470
This is very often in
the form of a model, in fact,

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.630
a machine learning based model.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.670
And creating these sorts of forecasting
algorithms using machine learning

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.390
is the focus of the last mini-course
in this group of mini-courses.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.260
Anyhow, how do we get to this forecast?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.980
Well, we've usually got some
sort of proprietary information,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.380
again, historical data, and

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.080
our forecaster crunches all that data
to build a model and create a forecast.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.800
So, bringing it all together,
that's the computing in a hedge fund.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.820
And we've also spent some time
talking about what might motivate you

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.400
as a hedge fund manager.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.630
That's it for this lesson.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.830
I'll talk to you again soon.
