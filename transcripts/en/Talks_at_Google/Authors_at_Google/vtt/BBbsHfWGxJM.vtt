[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.960
SPEAKER 1: Welcome,
everyone, to Talks at Google.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.580
Today, it's my pleasure to
introduce John McConnell.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.650
John McConnell served
more than 10 years

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.530
on the White House staff
as a senior speechwriter

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.760
for President George W. Bush
and Vice President Dick Cheney.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.090
He was part of the three-person
team responsible for all

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.890
of the 43rd president's
major addresses,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.880
including the speech to the
joint session of Congress

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.290
after September 11 and four
State of the Union messages.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.990
John is a former resident
fellow at Harvard's Institute

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.530
of Politics in the John F.
Kennedy School of Government.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.290
He is a trustee
of Wayland Academy

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.990
and serves as Chairman of
the Selection Committee

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.510
for the annual Gerald
R. Ford Journalism

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.670
Prize for Distinguished
Reporting on the Presidency.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.380
A lifelong political
enthusiast, John

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.960
was a page in the
United States Senate

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.650
under the sponsorship of
Senator William Proxmire.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.840
He grew up in
Bayfield, Wisconsin,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.080
and is a graduate of Wayland
Academy, Carleton College,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.940
and Yale Law School.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.482
So it's great to
have you here, John.

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:11.564
JOHN MCCONNELL: Thank you.

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:12.280
Glad to be here.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.350
SPEAKER 1: Maybe you
can start telling us

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.060
a little bit about
your background

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.790
and how you started
working for the president.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.440
JOHN MCCONNELL: Sure.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.010
The best way to go to work for
a president as a speechwriter

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.560
is to go to work for a
governor as a speechwriter,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.960
and make sure that that
governor gets elected president.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.970
It's as simple as that.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.420
I was very fortunate to go to
work for George W. Bush down

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.670
in Austin, Texas, right at the
beginning of the year 2000,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.420
right as his
presidential campaign was

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.190
getting into full gear.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.190
He had two speechwriters
on the team there

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.400
already, Mike Gerson
and Matthew Scully.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.860
And I had known both
of them previously,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.900
and we joined together
as the speechwriting team

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.630
there at the beginning of 2000.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.080
Saw through the entire campaign
of the closest election

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.280
in American history, the
historic recount in Florida,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.699
and then the short presidential
transition between Clinton

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:09.479
and Bush.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.420
Pretty much half the normal
length because of the--

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.060
because of all the
litigation in the recount.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.580
And then started at the White
House on January 20, 2001.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.400
And in my case, stayed
until the last day.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.660
Mike and Matthew both
moved on sometime prior

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.680
to the conclusion.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.470
But I stayed the full time.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.530
Prior to that, I had
worked at the White House

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.540
for a couple of years
for Vice President Dan

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.630
Quayle in the early '90s.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.010
And that was really my first
speechwriting experience.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.890
And then in the
interim, I had worked

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.160
for former Vice President
Quayle after he left office

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.220
for several years.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.710
And I also wrote speeches for
Bob Dole in the 1996 campaign.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.590
Traveled around the country
with Bob Dole for the last six

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.150
months of the losing campaign
against President Clinton

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.790
in '96.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.604
So 2000 was the first winning
campaign I'd ever been on.

00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:10.020
SPEAKER 1: And
from your intro, we

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.720
saw that you served both as
speechwriter to the president

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.100
and the vice president.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.660
Is that something that's common?

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.390
JOHN MCCONNELL: It's
not, as far as I know.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.600
And I was told that
there had never been,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.350
in the history of the
White House, someone

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.410
whose title was speechwriter
to the president and vice

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.070
president.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.070
I was a special
assistant, and later,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.080
a deputy assistant
to the president,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.280
but also an assistant
to the vice president.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.660
So I had an official
title in both offices.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.190
And the story there
was that I just

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.580
got to know Dick Cheney
during the 2000 campaign,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.590
and my colleague
Matthew Scully and I

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.440
had done some speeches for
him, including his acceptance

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.460
speech.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.500
And at the time
of the transition,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.990
he said he would like me to
be his principal speechwriter.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.420
And I said, well, I
will gladly do that.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.860
Got along very well with him.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.060
I said, but of course,
I'm going to keep

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.150
writing for the president.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.066
And he said, oh, yeah.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.770
There's going to be
a complete seamless--

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.160
seamless arrangement between the
president and vice president,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.590
not just in speechwriting
but in other fields as well.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.950
So I don't think they
have done it that way.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.709
I don't think Obama and
Biden did it that way.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.954
I doubt that Trump and
Pence do it that way.

00:04:22.954 --> 00:04:24.870
There's such great
difference between the two.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.370
But I honestly don't know.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.070
But that, as I say, was to
my knowledge the first time.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.820
So I was always able, during
that whole eight years--

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.540
and nine if you include
the 2000 campaign--

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.620
to really be involved in
both presidential and vice

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.760
presidential speeches
at all times, which

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.110
was fun, interesting.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.300
Kept me very busy.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.420
But also, just found myself
working for not just one,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.596
but two people that
I really liked.

00:04:54.596 --> 00:04:56.970
SPEAKER 1: So what does a
speechwriter at the White House

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.840
actually do?

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.370
Maybe you can walk us
through your day-to-day.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.590
JOHN MCCONNELL: Yeah.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.770
It's a little bit hard
to plan your life.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.774
I learned that
early on when you're

00:05:06.774 --> 00:05:08.190
a speechwriter at
the White House.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.347
Or actually I should say,
it's not hard to plan.

00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:11.430
You can plan all you want.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.240
[LAUGH]

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.880
It's easy.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.470
Just sit down.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.095
Here's my week.

00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:15.390
It's planned.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.230
No problem.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.280
And problem is, your plan
doesn't survive past lunchtime

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.990
on Monday.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.460
Something's going to come up.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.960
Some new event is
going to come up

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.020
that requires a response
from the president or vice

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.070
president or both.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.800
Some planned event will
be changed or dropped

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.580
from the schedule.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.460
Something will be moved up on
the schedule, what have you.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.416
So really, I mean, the
typical day, if there is one,

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:47.490
it's just making sure you're on
top of whatever speechwriting

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.530
assignments you
have at the time.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.600
And usually, there's
pretty strict deadlines,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.345
of course, on what
you're working on,

00:05:57.345 --> 00:06:00.210
and pretty short time frames.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.960
Writing a speech for the
president, in our experience

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.770
with George W. Bush, in general,
it was usually four to 10 days

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.020
to work on a speech.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.380
The president gives
500 speeches a year,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.820
so there's a lot going on.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.450
And when the three of us,
Mike, Matthew, and myself

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.680
moved up from Austin, we kept
doing what we did in Austin.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.590
But also Mike, who was
the chief speechwriter,

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.670
hired several other
writers to just fill

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:36.420
in the gaps in the remaining
amount of work that there was.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.300
We still had editorial
responsibilities

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.080
for everything and
frontline responsibility

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.720
for all of the major addresses.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.280
But we did have a larger team.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.600
It was smaller than the
team that we replaced,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.930
but still a good-sized team.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.770
Six, seven writers at the
most, for president and vice

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.880
president.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.700
A couple of researchers,
a couple of fact checkers.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.680
So the speechwriting--
an event gets

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.060
put on the president's schedule.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.250
OK, it's a major policy address.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.600
He's going to be speaking
to the American Legion,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.860
or he's going to be speaking
to the Chicago Economic Club,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.546
or he's going to be speaking to
the Los Angeles World Affairs

00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:25.900
Council or the Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, Chamber of Commerce,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.955
or a Republican Party
dinner in Kentucky.

00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:34.565
Just an endless, endless-- or a
town hall in Manhattan, Kansas.

00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:36.670
There's just an
endless array of things

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.360
that the president
is going to do.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.050
And so you get the assignment.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.300
A writer is put on it.

00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:51.400
If the core team was working
on it, we wrote together with--

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.800
literally at the same
computer, at the same screen,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.325
with one keyboard in the same
room, starting with nothing,

00:07:57.325 --> 00:07:59.916
and would work on
it on that basis.

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:02.040
The other writers on the
team didn't work that way.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.620
They would do their draft and
then send it into Mike Gerson.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.410
And then we would sit
down and go through it

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.607
and make sure it
had unity of voice

00:08:11.607 --> 00:08:13.690
with the president's prior
speeches and the way he

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.410
liked things.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.480
The policy people whose
main area of responsibility

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.700
was involved in the
speech, they would give us

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.665
the information that we needed.

00:08:26.665 --> 00:08:27.790
I mean, they would say, OK.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.331
The president's
giving a major speech

00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:30.934
on social security policy.

00:08:30.934 --> 00:08:33.559
We didn't have to think of what
the social security policy was.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.760
Good thing, because we were
not experts in anything,

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.549
although my colleagues
were pretty sharp.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.470
But we would get
the general policy,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.200
and it was then our job to put
it in the president's voice

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.820
and to put it in a reasonably
economical and persuasive

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.370
speech that wasn't too
long, wasn't too detailed,

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.010
but also wasn't too simple.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.610
All of the basic rules you want
to follow as speechwriters.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.800
And then we would have
researchers kind of look

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.740
into background.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.770
Where is the president speaking?

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.980
Is there something
about the place

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.050
that he is speaking that
will be of interest?

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.630
Now there will be some basics
that he's going to want

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.600
to know-- who he should
thank and acknowledge,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.530
say something about
the place that--

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.470
the city he's in, what have you.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:26.500
And then I believe we were the
first White House speechwriting

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.410
office that had this.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.570
We had a fact-checking
division within speechwriting.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.410
And they were so good that
other people in the White House

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.490
started using them.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.270
And Mike Gerson
had to say, look.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.360
This is not the White
House fact-checking office.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.910
This is the White House
speechwriting department's

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.130
fact-checking division.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.280
But they were very good,
and they kept us out

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.050
of a lot of trouble.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.850
Because you know,
when you're just--

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.082
when you're churning
through these speeches,

00:09:54.082 --> 00:09:55.540
I mean, you're
doing your very best

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.810
to be faithful to not just
the information that you have,

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.430
but the historical
references you

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.370
might be making
from your memory.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:08.740
But the fact checkers would
always run these things down.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.080
And then when the
draft was ready,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.760
sometimes during the
fact-checking process,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.040
it would be circulated
to the chief of staff

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.160
and then the department heads,
the senior White House staff.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.040
And there would be a
cover page attached

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.790
to a copy of the
draft, cover page memo

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.880
from a person known as
the staff secretary.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.010
So it was a very
important person

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.900
in the government of
the United States,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:41.490
because she is the person who
controls the flow of paper

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.080
to the president and
from the president.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.970
You want to give something
to the president,

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.095
you don't just wait till
you see him in the hallway

00:10:48.095 --> 00:10:49.640
and slip it to him.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.580
You have to give it to
the staff secretary.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:56.980
And it's mainly, I think, for
efficiency, for record-keeping

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.620
purposes, for sure, and
because it's been done

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.440
that way for many, many years.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.630
My understanding is that
going back to Eisenhower,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.640
they've had this process
in the White House.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.750
And it's literally
called staffing,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.380
by which the whole purpose
is that when something gets

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.110
to the president, it has been
reviewed by the people who

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.590
need to review it so that the
president can have confidence

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.130
in it.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.470
We wouldn't send a draft
speech to the president

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.300
that hadn't been fact checked.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.350
We just wouldn't do it.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.810
And I don't think the staff
secretary would let us,

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.761
because the staff
secretary would ask--

00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:34.760
I'm thinking of Harriet
Miers, who was the staff

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.860
secretary at the beginning.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.040
She would ask for the
annotated version.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.850
You know, where's the
fact-checked version

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.433
of the speech?

00:11:41.433 --> 00:11:44.540
Because if the president
has any questions,

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.480
we can only have
answers if we have--

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:53.620
whenever there's a verifiable
assertion in a speech,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.640
it was the responsibility
of the fact checkers

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.910
to drop a footnote explaining
where that came from.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:04.310
And so when the president
would get a speech,

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.210
he could be confident that, OK.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.050
He never had to say, OK,
this is a major address

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.150
on foreign policy, for example.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.710
The president never
had to say, well,

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:17.307
has this been reviewed by the
National Security Council?

00:12:17.307 --> 00:12:18.890
The answer would
always be-- he didn't

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.090
have to ask that question.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.860
Condi Rice would have
seen it, or her top deputy

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.090
would have seen it, and it
would have passed through them.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.790
And they might
have made changes,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.810
but the president didn't
have to know blow by blow

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.280
what happened in the process.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.110
He just needed to know that
it went through the process.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.850
And that's why if you ever had
a typo or anything, by the time

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.400
it reached the president,
a typo would have

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.660
gotten through a lot of people.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.590
SPEAKER 1: Do you know if
that process continues today?

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.340
JOHN MCCONNELL: I'm
guessing it does.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.047
I don't know exactly
what the speech process

00:12:57.047 --> 00:12:58.130
is in the White House now.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.880
I'd be interested in knowing,
but I just don't know.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.940
But if I had to
guess, I would guess

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.690
that when a document
got to the president,

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.770
it had gone through staff.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.232
It's just such an efficient
way of doing things.

00:13:14.232 --> 00:13:16.700
One thing I remember
thinking when I

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.800
was learning about all these--

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.330
about these processes
and methods,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.140
I thought, well, that
makes a lot of sense.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.550
Let's suppose I read
something this weekend,

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.390
an article in "The New York
Times" magazine, or something

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.450
that I follow online,
and read it and found

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.270
it very interesting,
and just think,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.460
well, I know the president
would be interested in this.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.360
And if he didn't see it,
I'd like for him to see it.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.891
Well, I would think, well, OK.

00:13:49.891 --> 00:13:51.390
OK, I'll give this
to the president.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.223
I'll give this to the
president's secretary,

00:13:53.223 --> 00:13:54.480
and she'll give it to him.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.210
Well, what if seven people
on the White House staff

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.550
had the same thought,
and all seven of them

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.210
gave this article to the
president's secretary

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.260
or somebody and said,
will you give this to him?

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.904
It's this pile of paper.

00:14:06.904 --> 00:14:08.820
Or if you just give it
to the staff secretary,

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.580
the staff secretary might--

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.530
I'm guessing in a case like
that, if seven people said,

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.597
I'd like to make sure
the president saw this,

00:14:16.597 --> 00:14:17.930
there's a memo to the president.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.970
Attached is an article, and
the following seven people

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.290
suggested that you look at it.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.570
So it's very streamlined
and everything else.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.430
I also noticed at
the White House,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.370
when you would get a document
back from the president,

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.850
it would be stamped.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.774
They have a stamp that says,
the president has seen.

00:14:36.774 --> 00:14:38.190
And that goes into
record-keeping.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.400
So it's part of the
Presidential Records Act,

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.890
I'm sure, that if the
president has seen or had

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.590
something in his possession,
they need a record of that.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.170
So it's all very,
very efficient.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.050
Made our job easier
in a lot of ways,

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.680
because the staffing
process, you know,

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.600
they had to turn things
around pretty fast

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.600
and get them to
the speechwriters.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.340
The cover memo
would say, comments

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.370
due in the speechwriting
office at 5:00 PM today.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.170
They never had more
than a day or so.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.360
They really didn't, because
we had to get that thing ready

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.260
and approved.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.170
If it was a foreign trip
that the president was going

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.680
to be speaking on, we had to
get everything-- everything

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.060
he was going to say for those
week or 10 days prepared

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.390
and done and approved and in a
book before Air Force One took

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:27.930
off.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:28.740
SPEAKER 1: What
was the difference

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.570
between writing
for the president

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.090
and writing for the
president when he

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.415
was a presidential candidate?

00:15:36.415 --> 00:15:40.690
JOHN MCCONNELL: The
main difference was--

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.770
in the specific case
of George W. Bush,

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:49.830
I noticed that when I was first
working for him as governor,

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.470
and then as time went
on into his presidency

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:57.300
and into his second
term to the end,

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.850
he became a much
more active editor.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.920
He was a pretty good
writer in his own right,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.711
but not that he had a
heck of a lot of time

00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:09.270
to sit down and write things.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:15.660
But he never sort of let
up on the speechwriters

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.040
or the speechwriting process.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.170
He never kind of laid off.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.230
Even after years had
gone by, he still--

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.540
if anything, he was more
demanding as time went on,

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.240
because he got more
sure of himself

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.440
and how he wanted to
put things, and also

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.970
comfortable with the standards
that a president is entitled

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.530
to expect.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.900
But if you speak in general
about the difference

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.430
between running for a president
and presidential candidate,

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.480
the main one is, of course,
the fact that in a campaign,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.260
it's all about sharp contrast.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.990
It's not just, vote for me.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.380
It is, make sure not to
vote for my opponent.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.530
And these can be
put in rough terms

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.190
or they can be put
in gentler terms,

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.960
and we've seen both
kinds, and we've seen much

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.109
in the range between the two.

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:15.089
Also in campaigns, you're
expressing aspirations.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:19.140
You're expressing the hope that
you will be put in a position

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.730
to be able to do things.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:26.160
You can say things like, I
will instruct the Secretary

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.910
of Veterans Affairs to carry
out a new policy of review

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.260
of the veterans' hospitals,
or whatever else.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.530
And that's how you
write it in the speech.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.080
But when you're writing
for the president, you say,

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.410
I have instructed the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.150
to carry out this policy.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.760
Suddenly you're doing things.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.290
You have that power.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.596
And the president can
speak for the nation

00:17:50.596 --> 00:17:55.740
without any fear of
contradiction or seeming

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.750
presumptuous.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.210
A candidate can't do that.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:04.710
Campaigns are, by
their nature, divisive.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.270
And so you've got
debates, you're

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.410
in a context where
ads are being run,

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.200
arguments are being
played out on TV.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.940
Very high stakes
meetings between

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.540
the presidential candidates
and the pressure builds.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.920
And as the election
draws near, the speeches

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.070
tend to get tougher, and
the definition of the choice

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.570
tends to get sharper.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.710
And the expression of
feeling and intensity

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:43.240
of feeling about what's at stake
in this election, you know,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.610
gets stronger.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.820
And writing for a president,
again, the contrast,

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.660
it's much more about unity.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:59.140
It's much more about appealing
to a far broader section,

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.270
not just of the country,
but of Congress.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.520
I mean, you want everybody's
vote when you're running,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.280
so it's not as if you're not
speaking to the whole country.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.980
But by the same token,
when you're president,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.480
you want to get things done.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.700
It's not going to be quite so
much about the wrongheadedness

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.410
of your adversaries.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.910
It's going to be if you're
going to be successful, I think.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.950
You know, far greater
attempts to find common ground

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.970
and not be as divisive as
the rhetoric of a campaign.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.900
SPEAKER 1: With regards
to national speeches,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.660
how did you manage to be
able to connect with people

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.459
across all 50 states?

00:19:36.459 --> 00:19:38.750
Because we have people that
have different backgrounds,

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:39.416
different needs.

00:19:39.416 --> 00:19:41.960
How did you make that connection
in a way that was genuine?

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.250
JOHN MCCONNELL: That's
a very good question.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.050
And I think that the answer
is, you just keep it at--

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.670
because of the
diversity you mentioned,

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.130
you just have to keep it
at a very general level.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.880
You know, try to make the appeal
as broad as you possibly can.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.140
Not that it's so general
as to be incoherent,

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.410
although politicians
have done that at times.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.780
You hear them make a pitch,
and you have to think, well,

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.380
what exactly is
he talking about?

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.920
Or what exactly is he trying
to get people to agree to?

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.830
Sometimes the Italians
have a phrase, selling air.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.850
[LAUGH]

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.060
And sometimes you hear that
in the political context.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.640
But I always, when I
think in those terms,

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.960
I think about Ronald
Reagan, who always assumed

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.120
an intelligent listener.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.890
And he assumed not necessarily
that the person was agreeing

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.580
with him, and not necessarily
that the person was disagreeing

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.430
with him, but that the
person was open-minded enough

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.090
to listen to him, and
therefore persuadable.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.720
And so I always kept that
kind of ideal in front of me

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.500
when I was thinking
about an issue

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.711
that I had to write
persuasively on.

00:21:00.711 --> 00:21:02.710
SPEAKER 1: And you were
at the White House right

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.870
in the middle of September 11.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.294
What was that experience like?

00:21:06.294 --> 00:21:08.710
JOHN MCCONNELL: Well, that was
the day everything changed,

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:13.030
of course, and we had just
gone through the first summer

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.360
of the presidency.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:20.590
And it was kind
of a typical week.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.480
The president was traveling.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.520
The vice president was
at the White House.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.700
And I remember my
colleague, Matthew Scully,

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.540
who I spent so much
time writing with

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.660
and write with now in
the private sector,

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.100
he and I spent all
of Monday, September

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.690
the 10th working on a speech for
the president for that Friday.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.350
And I looked at my calendar
at the end of the day,

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.390
and I was getting
ready to go home.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.890
And I thought, ooh.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.060
The vice president has
a speech Friday too,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.400
and I haven't really done
much thinking about that.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.170
And I'd better check
with him about what

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.340
he would like to say.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.600
So I called the vice
president's secretary

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.750
and asked if I could meet
with him the next morning

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.010
on the 11th.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.350
And she told me to come in
first thing in the morning,

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.000
and I did.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.170
And when I went to see him and
I was waiting outside his door--

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.720
he was finishing up a
brief meeting beforehand.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.090
I got there about 8:30.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.980
That's when I thought
I was going to see him.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.350
Waited for a while, and
while I was waiting for him,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.260
we received word
that the first plane

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.500
had hit the North Tower of the
World Trade Center in New York.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.290
And while I was still waiting
for the vice president

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.560
and the TV was on and
we were looking at it,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.060
that's when the Secret Service
man standing outside the door

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:45.380
got word that it was
a commercial jet that

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.110
had hit the World Trade Center.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.380
And the instant
feeling in the room

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:57.580
was just this uneasy sense that
it probably wasn't an accident.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.760
And then within a minute
or two, vice president

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.300
motioned me to come
into his office.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.130
And I went into his
office, and the TV was on,

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:11.440
and it was, of course, on New
York and the burning tower.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.210
And I just said,
oh, sir, I just want

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.220
to talk to you about
the speech for Friday.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.350
And he said yeah, sit down.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.990
But we really didn't talk.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.420
We just sat there looking
at his television.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.570
And while we were watching
it, the second plane

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.190
hit the South Tower.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:30.940
And that was the moment that
it was obvious to everybody,

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.730
everybody watching, that
it was a coordinated attack

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.550
on the country.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:41.080
And within a few minutes,
Condi Rice was in there.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.980
Josh Bolten, the
Deputy Chief of Staff,

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.290
a couple other senior people.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:52.210
And the vice president spoke
to the president on the phone

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:53.080
a couple times.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.870
And I was in there, but no
one was looking over to me

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:59.440
asking for my advice
about what should be done.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.214
And I told the story many times.

00:24:04.214 --> 00:24:07.870
I thought, well,
whatever I was here

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.700
to talk to the vice
president about is not

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.250
going to be important anymore.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.530
There's not going to be a speech
on Friday by the vice president

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.470
in any way connected with what I
was there to talk to him about.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.770
So I left, and went
back to my office.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:25.590
And this is the very
time that they discovered

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.340
that a plane was coming
at the White House

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.050
at 500 miles an hour.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.020
And that's when the vice
president was evacuated

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.980
in a very intense scene,
a very rushed scene, where

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.295
he was taken down into a bunker,
which is somewhere under the 18

00:24:40.295 --> 00:24:44.930
acres of the White House
complex, because the plane was

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.540
coming directly, almost
directly north at the White--

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.050
or I should say, east
at the White House.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.020
And that's the one
that hit the Pentagon.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.940
And if you look at
a map of Washington,

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:02.410
DC, the Pentagon and the White
House almost perfectly line up.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.516
I always thought of the
Pentagon as being way, I guess,

00:25:05.516 --> 00:25:07.390
east of the White House,
but it really isn't.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.065
And if you've ever
flown into Washington

00:25:13.065 --> 00:25:14.440
and you look for
the White House,

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.120
it's the last
thing you can find.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.200
You can see the Capitol.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.610
You can see the
Lincoln Memorial.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.440
You can see the
Washington Monument.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.050
But the White House is
just really hard to find.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.010
It's not the tallest
building in its neighborhood

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:27.970
by any stretch.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.630
There's hotels nearby that are
taller than the White House.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.220
You just can't find it, unless
you really know the city

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.580
and know where it is.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.930
And so I don't know what
happened on that plane,

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.270
but maybe they just
couldn't find it,

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.980
and it hit the Pentagon.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.970
I just don't know.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:47.380
But anyway, it was coming
at the White House.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.130
And that's when I called my
mom in northern Wisconsin

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:53.170
to reassure her that
everything was fine.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.720
And she's the one who told me
to get out of the White House,

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.553
because she'd heard on
television that there

00:25:57.553 --> 00:26:01.210
was an evacuation going on,
and I didn't know about it.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:06.310
So I went out and
joined the evacuation.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:13.440
And as I went out with
this throng of staff,

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.110
I remember one of the uniformed
Secret Service officers said,

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.800
everybody run.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.900
There's a plane coming at us.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.390
And I don't remember
running, but I

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.300
do remember seeing a
plane north of the White

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.790
House over 16th
Street, and thinking

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.600
that that was a plane that was
about to hit the White House

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.290
and destroy the White House
and kill everybody on board.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.500
And I remember
that as the most--

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:45.240
you know, that was the most
genuinely shocking feeling that

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.400
I had had all day,
because I hadn't--

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.440
the evacuation,
I just, as I say,

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.300
just kind of found out about it.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.900
There wasn't the moment
of shock other than seeing

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.680
that plane hit the South
Tower on TV, of course.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.130
Was just seeing that
plane and being convinced,

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.510
I'm watching a plane that is
about to destroy the White

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.780
House.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.270
It was not.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.900
At that point, the Pentagon
had already been hit.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.760
So what I saw was
either a military plane

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.330
or a commercial jet
that had been diverted.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:22.040
I never found out what that was.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:27.444
But people were wandering the
streets, White House staff.

00:27:27.444 --> 00:27:29.110
And I thought, well,
I'm a speechwriter.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.014
I'd better not go home.

00:27:31.014 --> 00:27:32.680
They're probably going
to need some help

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.420
from the speechwriters today.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.162
And I just-- there
was no evacuation plan

00:27:37.162 --> 00:27:37.870
or anything else.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.880
Nothing like this
had ever happened.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.550
So I just remember
seeing another staff guy

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.660
on the street who worked in
the Office of Administration.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.560
And he said, go to the
DaimlerChrysler headquarters

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.179
on I Street, because Mrs.
Bush's chief of staff's husband

00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:55.720
worked over there
and just sent word,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.530
if there's any White House staff
looking for a place to gather,

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.640
please come here.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.870
And so that's where we
gathered, and I worked there

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.010
with Mike Gerson--

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.949
or I'm sorry, with
Matthew Scully

00:28:09.949 --> 00:28:11.240
and a couple of our colleagues.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.720
David Frum and Matt
Rees were there,

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.600
and we were on a speaker
phone with Mike Gerson.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.420
And Mike had been driving
in to the White House,

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.742
and he was on Highway 395, going
in from Alexandria, Virginia,

00:28:23.742 --> 00:28:24.700
toward the White House.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.650
And he saw the plane
that hit the Pentagon.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.150
He didn't witness
the impact, but he

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.660
saw the plane a moment
before, and never made it

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.470
into Washington.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.720
They diverted all the traffic.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.080
We did a draft speech for
the president for that night.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.950
But really, that
project became the work

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.759
of Karen Hughes, his
senior counselor who

00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:49.050
had been with them the whole
time that he was governor,

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.580
and had now moved to
Washington with them.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.060
And really, the speech that
night was Karen's work.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.400
And then right after that,
of course, Wednesday morning,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.370
the 12th, we saw the President.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:07.170
Mike and Matthew and I
were in there with him.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.860
And of course, we
knew that we were

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.320
going to have some very
big assignments quite soon.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.780
One of them was to write a
speech for a memorial service

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:19.720
at the National Cathedral, which
was going to be that Friday.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.790
So that was a very
quick turnaround speech.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.520
And that was where
Billy Graham preached,

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.449
and there were five presidents
of the United States

00:29:27.449 --> 00:29:28.490
sitting in the front pew.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.630
And then on Monday
morning, the 17th,

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.910
we got word that the
president was very likely

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.030
going to address Congress
on Thursday the 21st.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.420
And that was the quickest
turnaround of a major address

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.290
we ever had.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:48.520
That was a draft of a
speech to Congress, which

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.900
would be given to the largest
audience in human history,

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.830
and they wanted that
draft in one day.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.910
And we did it.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.910
We didn't have a conclusion,
but we drafted the speech.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.990
But the president called
us in and gave us basically

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.570
the organization of
the speech by saying,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.850
Americans have questions.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.380
Who attacked our country?

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.860
Why do they hate us?

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.260
How do we fight and win
the war, and et cetera?

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.980
And that was pretty much
the organizing principle

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.967
of the speech, the questions
that Americans had.

00:30:21.967 --> 00:30:23.800
SPEAKER 1: In general,
how did the president

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.590
prepare for his speeches?

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.812
JOHN MCCONNELL: President
Bush, he really prepared.

00:30:30.812 --> 00:30:32.020
He would read things through.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.270
He would make his edits.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.980
And sometimes he
would call the writer

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.330
or he would give the edits
to the staff secretary,

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:44.140
and the staff secretary
would pass them along.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.000
Or sometimes he would
call Mike Gerson,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.810
and Mike would bring
them into the team.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.440
But then when he
had the final draft,

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:59.140
if it was a major, major event
like the State of the Union,

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.470
which is the speech that
the speechwriters hate most,

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:09.220
because it's so huge and so
unwieldy, and it has so much--

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:14.940
it has to cover so many
bases that, you know,

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.430
you write 25 transitions
in one speech.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.922
You usually have three
or four transitions.

00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:22.630
But a speech like
that, you have to cover

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.294
so many different topics.

00:31:24.294 --> 00:31:25.210
So that's a tough one.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.645
Also the delivered draft of the
State of the Union is draft 30.

00:31:29.645 --> 00:31:30.452
[LAUGH]

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.690
And so it's an endless process.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.860
And it is also one
of about 20 speeches

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.460
the president gives in January.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.876
So it's not like you have a
reprieve from everything else.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.510
So to answer the question,
when the president would

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.340
have a State of
the Union, we would

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.770
do a heavy outline for
him around Christmas time,

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.330
and then he would react to it.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.460
And the outline would
be based on the policy

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:02.364
input that had been generated
over the preceding few months.

00:32:02.364 --> 00:32:04.280
OK, what's he going to
talk about in the State

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:04.821
of the Union?

00:32:04.821 --> 00:32:08.990
What's going to be the program
for the year just begun?

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.885
And then we would sit down
and do the first draft.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:16.265
And then that would go
through a very small--

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.530
a fraction of the
ordinary staffing process.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.260
Just a few of the
very top people.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.210
The vice president,
a few others.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.345
And then you would go
for the second draft,

00:32:29.345 --> 00:32:33.346
and then it would be a
slightly broader staffing.

00:32:33.346 --> 00:32:34.970
And then you'd get
it to the president.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.670
And then the president,
I remember he would--

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.830
that's when we would go
and sit in the Oval Office,

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.270
and he would sit
back in his chair

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.510
and read that speech aloud.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:50.310
And throughout the State
of the Union process,

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.480
that's when I would see
the president the most,

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.820
more than any other speech.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.120
In general, that's true,
because he would practice it.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.520
There would be formal--

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.350
there's a movie theater in
the White House, about a third

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:08.420
of the width of this room,
about as deep, with curtains

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.036
and a movie screen and
movie theater seating,

00:33:11.036 --> 00:33:13.285
and that's where he would
practice these big speeches.

00:33:13.285 --> 00:33:15.045
And if you were
involved in the speech,

00:33:15.045 --> 00:33:19.650
you were expected to be
there during the practice.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.330
And so they'd set up the
lectern and the teleprompter,

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:26.900
and he would read things
through and edit there.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.110
So that was a very
elaborate, involved process.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.900
He did the same thing with the
address to Congress after 9/11.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.490
It just was very
telescoped, right?

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.430
It all happened within a
space of two or three days.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.600
And then for the
typical speech, he

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.820
didn't use a teleprompter
probably more than 10 times

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.730
a year.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.840
President Obama used it,
I mean, 10 times a week.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.490
And he just-- and Reagan
used it a lot more

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.770
than George W. Bush did.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.270
But if it was a
non-teleprompter event,

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:58.837
which is the typical case,
he would read it aloud.

00:33:58.837 --> 00:33:59.920
He would underline things.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.100
He would practice it.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.772
He would edit up
until the very end.

00:34:06.772 --> 00:34:08.230
Not edit in the
sense that he would

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.850
call the speechwriter
if he wanted

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.835
one word changed on page four.

00:34:11.835 --> 00:34:13.210
You know, sometimes
he would just

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.940
scribble that in or make
a couple notes to himself

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.880
at the top.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.979
But I always--

00:34:18.979 --> 00:34:22.239
I have told people,
people I have worked

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:25.389
for who do public speaking
in the private sector

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:30.159
now, in some cases, don't
think they're very good at it.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:33.850
And I often remind them that
not everybody's good at it,

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.900
but you can be if
you work at it.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.000
And I always say, the
president got better

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.870
at it over his career,
I think he would say.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.760
I certainly would say it.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.469
Because he practiced.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.690
He wanted it to sound good.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:52.750
We would read our speeches aloud
before we sent them into him,

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.810
because you never know--

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.970
you can think you know
how it's going to sound,

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.064
but you don't until you hear it.

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:00.730
And so we would.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.130
We would read these
things aloud to make sure

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:07.300
it had the right rhythms, that
some words are not good speech

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.680
words, and so you
want to keep them out.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.520
But sometimes writers
let them slip in.

00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:19.810
And you know, you
just get a feel for--

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.760
you know, you don't
want something to rhyme.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.440
[LAUGH]

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.944
And I remember we
discovered that once

00:35:24.944 --> 00:35:26.110
in one of our read-throughs.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.235
Something rhymed.

00:35:27.235 --> 00:35:29.800
And that was-- we
didn't want that.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.800
[LAUGH]

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.730
And then in the president's
case, the vice president too,

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.260
the vice president wore glasses.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.880
President wore
glasses sometimes,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.060
but not when he was
giving speeches.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.590
And so the speeches
were in big type,

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:47.470
so he could read it
without his glasses.

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:51.280
And I will just say that
I talked to a guy who

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.750
worked for Ronald Reagan.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:58.720
Actually, I met the guy, but
he didn't tell me this story.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.700
The story came to me
secondhand that he

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.450
was with Reagan on his
campaign plane in 1980,

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:10.600
and he said that Reagan
was going over a speech

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.890
very carefully on the
way to the next city.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:18.730
And Reagan didn't-- and the
guy tried to interrupt Reagan,

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:22.990
and Reagan was kind of annoyed,
and kind of held him off.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.310
Not now.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.770
And his initial thought was,
he gives this speech four times

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:29.270
a day.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.120
Why does he need to sit here
and over this and practice?

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.750
And he realized that Reagan
really wanted the next one

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:36.990
to be great.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.690
Even if he was reading
the same speech,

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.310
he wanted it to
be a great event,

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.360
so he needed to get
into the moment.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.580
And so that's another thing
I would remind people.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.450
There's no such thing
as overpreparing.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:50.360
There is such thing
as overediting.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.110
We've all seen that,
when a document is just--

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.100
I remember Karen
Hughes said about one

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.645
of the State of the
Union drafts we had done.

00:36:59.645 --> 00:37:03.170
This particular year we had
done it a little bit earlier,

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.540
earlier than was customary.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.570
And by the time
the event came, I

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:14.210
remember there were people
editing their own edits,

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.910
making suggestions,
language changes on things

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:20.120
they had forgotten they
had changed themselves.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.190
And Karen Hughes
said, this thing's

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.740
been floating around
a little too long.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.260
And so you have to avoid that.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.220
Overediting is a
real phenomenon,

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:36.450
because you run into people who
think new is better than good,

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.780
and that is not always the case.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:44.190
But it feels fresh because it's
new, and that can be dangerous.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:50.150
But overpreparing in terms
of getting up and reading

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.910
a speech, I don't
think I can think of--

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.900
I don't think I can imagine
an example of someone

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.655
overpreparing.

00:37:56.655 --> 00:37:58.280
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
that's really helpful.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.780
Because I think
even here at Google,

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.330
there's a lot of opportunities
where public speaking can

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.750
be relevant, whether it's giving
a presentation to your team

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.820
or speaking at
the I/O conference

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.470
that we just had last week.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.060
So with regards
to overpreparing,

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:15.590
do you think that it's better to
sort of just write a few notes

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.020
and then improvise the
rest of your speech,

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.510
or have a full
speech written out

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.282
and then try to go from there?

00:38:22.282 --> 00:38:23.990
JOHN MCCONNELL: It
can be done both ways.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:26.360
I've done it both ways myself.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.460
The first question you
need to ask yourself

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.510
is, how long am I
expected to speak?

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.980
That is a big variable.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:37.182
If they just say, you're
going to get an hour of time,

00:38:37.182 --> 00:38:39.390
and you can come in and talk
about whatever you want,

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.848
everyone's excited
to hear what you

00:38:40.848 --> 00:38:43.159
have to say about anything
that's on your mind,

00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:44.450
those are the greatest events--

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:45.156
[LAUGH]

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:46.280
--because you're ready now.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.270
[LAUGH]

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:54.500
But on the assumption
that those are rare,

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.960
if you have five
minutes, my advice

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.480
is, write out every
word you want to say.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.630
Do the word count, and
if it's at 750 words,

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.310
you cannot go any
longer than that.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:12.190
The 750 words, if you can get
that in the five-minute window,

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.190
you know, you're speaking
150 words a minute,

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.696
that's pretty fast.

00:39:17.696 --> 00:39:22.045
You should aim for 100 to
120, something like that.

00:39:22.045 --> 00:39:24.710
It's hard to predict,
because you don't know--

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.800
there's variables such
as audience reaction.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.870
You know, how fast
someone speaks

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.120
and other individual
factors like that.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:39.590
But the important thing is if
it's a small window of time--

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:45.020
I had a private sector client
come to me a few years ago

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.840
and my colleague, Matthew.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.750
This guy just couldn't
get his message across

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.490
in less than 45 minutes.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:53.630
But he wanted to.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.630
And he wanted-- but he
liked to speak from notes,

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:00.290
and he realized that he
could never speak from notes

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:03.560
and come in, clock
in under 45 minutes.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.710
And so they sent us
videos and transcripts

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:08.940
of some of his
45-minute speeches.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.440
And our assignment was,
write a 20-minute speech

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.240
that makes all these points.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.470
And so we did.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:20.240
And then our only advice
to the guy was, read this.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.240
Get comfortable with it.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:25.710
Get so comfortable with it that
you've almost got it memorized.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:28.170
But keep it in front
of you, because that's

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.320
a position of real
comfort on the platform

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.650
is when you've got it in
front of you, every word,

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.630
but you don't have
to look at it.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:39.765
Because you don't have to
be nervous about forgetting,

00:40:39.765 --> 00:40:42.552
about something
throwing you off,

00:40:42.552 --> 00:40:44.010
which has happened
to people who've

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:47.910
tried to memorize speeches,
and it just kind of fell apart.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:50.910
But just get really
conversant and comfortable

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:54.360
with that speech,
and have it with you.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.800
And people will
be very impressed,

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.360
because you will have a
very economical and polished

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.930
presentation that comes in
within the window that's

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:04.650
given you.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:08.610
Now that's the extreme case.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.810
And speaking from notes is
always very good, as long

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:17.340
as you are very comfortable
with the timing.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.380
I remember, one of
my great friends

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.540
I got to know just
through this work,

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.340
his name was George Elsey.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.100
And I looked him up when I
moved to Washington in 2000.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.590
And George had been a military
aide to President Franklin

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.429
Roosevelt during
the war, and then he

00:41:30.429 --> 00:41:32.970
was a speechwriter for President
Truman his whole presidency.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.400
Traveled around the
country with Truman.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.690
And he just was a wise old
gentleman and wonderful

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.540
to talk to.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:46.147
And he died at age 98 about
a year and a half ago.

00:41:46.147 --> 00:41:47.730
There have been a
lot of speechwriters

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:51.135
who have [INAUDIBLE] a long
time, I'm happy to say.

00:41:51.135 --> 00:41:52.620
[LAUGH]

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.990
But I was going to give a
speech to a group of cadets

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.076
at a military school.

00:41:59.076 --> 00:42:00.700
And I knew what I
wanted to talk about.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.940
I had a little history
I wanted to talk about,

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.500
and I wanted to relate
it to their experience.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.530
And I really-- I was
going to speak from notes,

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.420
and I had 10 minutes.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.681
And this was about-- it
was about 10 years ago.

00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:14.180
I called George,
and I said, George.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.230
You're just going to love this.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.530
I want to tell you about a
speech I'm going to give.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:18.855
And he said, OK.

00:42:18.855 --> 00:42:21.472
And so I said--

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:22.680
I didn't give him the speech.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.387
I read through my notes.

00:42:24.387 --> 00:42:26.470
I said, I'm going to talk
about this a little bit,

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:27.700
then I'm going to
say thus and so.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.783
So I didn't give him the
speech, but just gave him

00:42:29.783 --> 00:42:34.495
the map of what I was
going to be talking about.

00:42:34.495 --> 00:42:35.310
And he listened.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.830
Mhm, mhm.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.056
He didn't interrupt.

00:42:38.056 --> 00:42:39.180
And I got to the end of it.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:43.140
And he said, oh,
that's all very good.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.670
That's all very good.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:46.890
He said, you know the
trouble, don't you?

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.240
And I said, what?

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.220
He said, you've got material
there for two speeches,

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.900
and they've asked
you to give one.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:53.820
[LAUGH]

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:54.750
And I said, really?

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.280
He said, you've got
two right there.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.520
And I started going through
it, and he was right.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.390
He was right.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.050
When I sort of
looked at my notes,

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.250
OK, now I'm going to talk
about, now I'm going to--

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:06.630
now I'm going to just sit here
with my notes in the quiet

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.450
of my office and kind
of look over at the wall

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:12.330
and at my notes, and pretend
I'm giving this speech.

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:15.920
It really went on 50% too long.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.730
So that's when I had
to ruthlessly cut.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:21.360
So it's OK to speak from notes,
but it's really important

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.780
to know precisely how
you're going to start,

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.520
precisely how
you're going to end,

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.310
and then how you're
going to fill the time.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:35.040
I always say as well that even
with experienced speakers,

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.460
sometimes they lose
track of the time.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:43.860
And-- not completely lose track,
but eight minutes in, and they

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:47.250
realize they've only got two
minutes left instead of their--

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:50.440
you know, they're just farther
along in their window of time

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.800
than they thought they were.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.460
You can save yourself by
just knowing in advance

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.840
how this thing ends.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.970
Because you can
always race to your--

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.840
you can always race
to your conclusion.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.880
And you can say, I didn't
get to cover this last point

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.880
as much as I would like.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.963
If some would like me to
elaborate during the Q&amp;A,

00:44:07.963 --> 00:44:09.000
I'd be happy to.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.120
But I really want to
close on this thought.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.210
And then you're home free.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.490
The most painful ones
to see are the ones

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.700
who don't know how
they're going to end.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.220
And so you can feel them
circling the target.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.960
But they just don't know where.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.100
[LAUGH]

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.990
They don't know where
to drop the munition.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:29.573
SPEAKER 1: And on
that note, I'm going

00:44:29.573 --> 00:44:31.830
to get to my last question
before our Q&amp;A session--

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:32.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.795
--which is, what do you
think about Trump's speeches?

00:44:36.795 --> 00:44:39.990
JOHN MCCONNELL: I was
interested to watch

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:44.470
Trump develop as a speaker
during the campaign.

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:47.460
It was-- I'm quite
certain this is

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.780
the only campaign, definitely
in the television age,

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:56.370
where you could get
basically every network that

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:01.010
was broadcasting news live
go with that candidate,

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.520
knowing in advance that
that candidate didn't

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.600
have a speech in front of him.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.050
It was just him.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:10.587
And he spoke from notes.

00:45:10.587 --> 00:45:12.920
And he started, toward the
end of the campaign, I guess,

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.060
reading speeches.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.190
But he sure didn't
do that very much.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:23.860
And I was really struck during
the campaign at how far--

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.780
I mean, he got all the
way to the nomination,

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.270
basically, without
reading speeches.

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:31.980
Nobody has done that in
our lifetimes until him.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.690
And now, of course, he's
reading a lot more speeches.

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:38.480
And as I said before, I don't
know what the process is.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.380
But whatever it is,
it works for them.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.380
And the speech to
Congress, I thought

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.810
he sounded very much
like a president.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.520
There was so much
commentary beforehand.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.170
What's this going to be like?

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:52.540
Is he going to come in
and pull some notes out?

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.490
Throw it on the rostrum
with the assembled

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:57.040
Congress of the United States
and the Supreme Court sitting

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.940
there, the diplomatic corps,
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.690
the whole nation watching.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.030
But no.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.720
He didn't.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.690
He did not treat that casually.

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.280
He sounded like a president.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.450
But I used to love to-- when I
would sit down with my friend

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:17.180
George Elsey who had
written for Truman,

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.150
all he wanted to talk
about was what I was doing.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:24.740
And my interest was in pulling
information from him about what

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.930
happened in the 1940s.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:28.670
And I said, George,
all you want to talk

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:30.420
about's the 43rd president.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.222
All I want to talk about
is the 33rd president.

00:46:33.222 --> 00:46:34.680
SPEAKER 1: Well,
thank you so much.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.190
So now we can go
into our Q&amp;A session.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.900
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.480
Any advice on ums and ahs?

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.810
And also, if you detect you're
starting to lose your audience

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:50.120
or something like that,
you see eyes glazing over,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.514
any way to, you know,
re-navigate on the fly

00:46:52.514 --> 00:46:53.430
while giving a speech?

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:54.880
JOHN MCCONNELL: Um, OK.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.210
There was your um.

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:05.450
You just have-- you really have
to not become self-conscious.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:06.710
Just be yourself.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:10.640
It's going to happen when
you're speaking from notes just

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.050
off the cuff.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:19.980
You have to listen to yourself.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.990
I remember reading that
Richard Nixon did not ever

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.540
watch himself on TV, because
he was afraid of becoming

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.910
self-conscious.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:29.850
And this happens.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.600
This happens to people.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:37.070
But on the other hand, I have
to guess that John Kennedy did

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:38.370
watch himself.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:40.940
And this was a
person who, really

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.190
at the dawn of the
television age,

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.220
became very, very adept at that.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:47.310
I would like to know--

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:50.830
I would be interested in knowing
what other presidents did,

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:56.600
what other successful candidates
for lesser offices did.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.560
Reagan, there was a story
somewhere about Reagan.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.550
He was in the Oval Office,
and he was so comfortable

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.420
with cameras, right?

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:10.510
He'd been a movie actor for
30 years and a broadcaster,

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:16.130
and had also done live
TV in his 40s, which

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.650
was a pretty fairly new venue.

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:20.360
When Ronald Reagan
was 40 years old,

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.370
live TV was just
really hitting it.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:27.410
Anyway, Reagan is preparing to
give a speech to the nation,

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:28.730
and there's a monitor.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:31.490
And he always-- the
monitor was facing him

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.830
so that he could see
what the camera saw.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.050
And he would glance over at it.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.960
He wouldn't look at it during
his speech, but he would--

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.450
this was part of
his preparation.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.780
The monitor would come on.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.690
He knew he was about to go
live, and he was prepared.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:47.964
And the story was that
he was at his desk

00:48:47.964 --> 00:48:49.880
and he's got his speech,
and the lights are on

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.171
and he's looking at the camera.

00:48:51.171 --> 00:48:52.359
He's familiar.

00:48:52.359 --> 00:48:53.900
But he's looking
over at the monitor.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.790
There's nothing on there.

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:58.730
And he's just kind
of looking over.

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:00.320
The monitor's black.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.030
Nothing.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.520
The time is ticking away.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:09.810
Finally, it comes on, and Reagan
sees himself on the monitor

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:10.310
live.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.518
And he goes, oh, there he is.

00:49:12.518 --> 00:49:14.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:17.000
You have to--
there's nothing wrong

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.799
with being sort of aware of
how you look and how you sound.

00:49:21.799 --> 00:49:23.840
I think this is how the
best-- and Reagan was one

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.100
of the best--

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:25.670
become good.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:29.900
So if a person is really, really
concerned about verbal tics

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.540
or whatever, I guess
the advice I would give

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.940
would be to watch
themselves some more.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.280
And then the second
part of your question

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.680
about losing an
audience, there are

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.840
many ways for people to do it.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:47.360
But really, even the
most polished speaker

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.970
is going to lose their
audience after about 20 minutes

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:50.630
of a speech.

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:52.940
Even your best friends
are going to start to go,

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.010
when is this going to end?

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:58.200
You really don't need to
take it that much longer.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.230
You know, that is
a prepared speech.

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:02.666
Unless you have--
unless it's so obvious

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.040
you have so much
ground to cover.

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:11.090
But to pull people
back, humor is always

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:12.810
the best way to do it.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:16.880
But that has to be
something very--

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.840
something very genuine
and something--

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.980
timing is everything.

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.820
It's hard to give
advice in the abstract,

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.880
but the best advice
is just end the thing.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.166
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:30.166 --> 00:50:30.874
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:50:33.617 --> 00:50:35.450
AUDIENCE: I expect that
many Americans don't

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:37.800
watch all speeches
in their entirety,

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.440
but rather will see some
portions of the speech

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.180
as highlighted by the media.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.010
And as a speechwriter,
how does one

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.410
identify what those
hits will be as opposed

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.360
to the entire album in advance?

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.994
Like, focusing on areas.

00:50:49.994 --> 00:50:51.660
JOHN MCCONNELL: Yeah,
that's hard to do.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.690
I can't tell you
how many times when

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:56.610
we were writing
these speeches, we

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.470
would put something
together and think, OK,

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:01.440
now that is going to be the
signature line of this speech,

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.080
and get it wrong.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.120
Just wouldn't happen.

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.340
Difficult to predict.

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.460
Sometimes you can nail it,
just know that something

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.160
is going to get attention.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.620
And unfortunately, in
today's political culture,

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.320
if it's something with
kind of a hard edge,

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.320
if it's something that is
making fun of an adversary

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.740
or something-- you know, if
it just is kind of personal

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:31.970
and is interpreted by the media
as an attack requiring a reply,

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.410
it will always be picked up.

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:37.580
But you know, in my case, I
worked for President Bush.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:40.740
He didn't want to do too
much of that kind of thing.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.680
So it's hard to do.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.650
You keep striving for it,
but it's hard to predict.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.094
I always felt like the
reporters, sometimes

00:51:48.094 --> 00:51:49.760
they would have their
story half written

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.676
before the speech was
done, because they would

00:51:51.676 --> 00:51:53.795
be given the speech in advance.

00:51:53.795 --> 00:51:57.350
And sometimes you need to
hear it in order to realize,

00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:59.510
what were the lines that
had the best impact?

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:03.410
And what were the lines that
really drove the argument home?

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:07.510
Or just reading it
real quickly to see--

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:11.090
very often, they would
put into the stories more

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:14.600
of the fact-specific
stuff than the stuff

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.145
that we thought was really
appealing and musical,

00:52:19.145 --> 00:52:21.650
and were sure would
be appreciated

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:23.570
for the beauty of
its composition.

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:24.544
[LAUGH]

00:52:25.429 --> 00:52:26.720
Hard to predict, I have to say.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.730
But you're always
striving for it.

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.430
AUDIENCE: How do you approach
keeping a consistent message

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:36.300
when the target is changing or
when expectations don't live up

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.070
to what you had initially said?

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:39.892
So I'm going to sell
something for $40.

00:52:39.892 --> 00:52:41.100
I'm going to sell it for $40.

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.310
Well, actually, it's
going to cost $60,

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:43.890
and that information
comes later.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:45.431
As a speechwriter,
how do you craft--

00:52:45.431 --> 00:52:47.521
how do you shape the narrative?

00:52:47.521 --> 00:52:48.020
[SIGH]

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:52.600
JOHN MCCONNELL: Always--
the general point

00:52:52.600 --> 00:53:00.600
there would be always allow
yourself the possibility

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.090
that the facts on the
ground are going to change.

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:06.030
You know, if your sales pitch
is going to need to change,

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:09.510
then there may be something
that needs refining

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:11.440
in what it is you're selling.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:18.252
But in general, if
you know that you're

00:53:18.252 --> 00:53:20.610
in a situation that's
subject to change,

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:22.920
through no fault of your own
and through no dishonesty

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.890
of your own, you just
have to allow yourself--

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:29.790
allow for the fact that
there could be changes.

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:31.660
Don't predict.

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.830
When we worked for President
Bush, I mean, it was a rule.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:37.080
Don't brag on the stock market.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.695
Wow, the stock market went up.

00:53:38.695 --> 00:53:40.650
If the president
brags on that, it

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.510
sounds like he's
taking credit for it.

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:47.160
And if the stock market goes
down, then what do you do?

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.570
Then what do you do?

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.930
I don't think that that rule
has been consistently applied,

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:56.540
but in our case, it
was just something

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:01.277
we were told not to
do, and never did.

00:54:01.277 --> 00:54:02.110
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:03.109
JOHN MCCONNELL: You bet.

00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:05.560
SPEAKER 1: OK, I do have a
question from [INAUDIBLE] now.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.280
This question is from Tim.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:10.450
If tasked with writing
a speech for President

00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:13.670
Trump or a character with a
similar off-the-cuff style,

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:15.310
how would you approach the task?

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:18.850
How might this differ depending
on the speech, such as State

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:21.610
of the Union or charity event?

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:23.860
JOHN MCCONNELL: Well,
everything hinges

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.750
on the nature of the speech.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:30.460
The first question I always
have in connection with a speech

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.920
assignment, other than
the obvious information

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:36.730
of who's speaking and
what the general subject

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:40.720
matter is, the first question
I ask is, who is the audience?

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.360
Is it your friends?

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.940
Is it the unpersuaded?

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:48.940
Is it your adversaries?

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:49.960
Is the press there?

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.060
In most cases, it will be.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.130
Is it a political event?

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:56.290
Is it a nonpartisan event?

00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:59.770
I mean, really
nonpartisan, like a chamber

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:01.860
of commerce or something?

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.390
Is it a building dedication?

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:04.350
Is it a funeral?

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.990
Is it-- just, is
it a commencement?

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:09.240
All these things.

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.740
I always feel like
I'm halfway there

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:15.540
if I know precisely the
nature of the audience.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:18.065
And so that's the first
question I would ask.

00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:19.440
And if you're
writing for someone

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.740
who does a lot of
off-the-cuff, I mean,

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.515
give him some space to do that.

00:55:24.515 --> 00:55:25.890
President Bush,
we gave him space

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:27.639
to do that at the
beginning of the speech.

00:55:27.639 --> 00:55:30.120
He liked to do off-the-cuff
acknowledgements and things

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.080
like that.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.810
And then talk to him.

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:39.150
The best connections between--

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:42.720
the most successful
speechwriting stories

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.260
involve, in my experience,
a real connection

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.780
between the writer and the
person he's writing for.

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.992
If you just get to know
him and can get to him

00:55:51.992 --> 00:55:54.450
and can talk to him-- you don't
have to be his best friend.

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:56.450
You don't have to be in
his office all the time.

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.570
But they've got to
know the writers.

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:00.940
They've got to have
some sort of connection.

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.060
Because writers,
if they're not too

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.610
wrapped up in their own
artistry or whatever,

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:07.680
your whole job is to learn.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.310
And I would also say,
I've had this conversation

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:16.680
with my former colleague,
Matthew Scully.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.260
One of the great
satisfactions of the process I

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.410
described earlier, the three
writers working together,

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:28.510
was the satisfaction of
producing something really good

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:30.490
as part of a team.

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:33.520
It was even better
than the satisfaction

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.830
of producing something
really good on your own,

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:38.470
because you're working
with people you like

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:39.970
and people you trust.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:46.000
And you find that you
are upholding together

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.900
a standard of performance
and effectiveness

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.930
that you always want
to uphold on your own,

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:55.960
but always feel good
as well when it's

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.315
part of a common enterprise.

00:56:58.315 --> 00:57:05.030
And so although most writers
don't like the idea of writing

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:07.090
as part of a group-- most
writers like to write

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.380
in solitude--

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:12.940
I just found that it brought
one of the great satisfactions

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:17.200
of my career, being
part of a team that

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:22.110
had a shared standard of
excellence and performance

00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:24.520
and pride in the
common enterprise.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:31.047
And that builds friendships
and long-term associations.

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:33.380
AUDIENCE: The show "West Wing"
glamorized speechwriting,

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:33.780
in a sense.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.020
I don't know if you
ever watched the show.

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.750
But there are certain
characters who

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:38.624
seem to have a passion
for it, even including

00:57:38.624 --> 00:57:40.890
things like the choice
of words and passages.

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:43.860
Is this something that you
feel is an innate thing?

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.105
Can it be learned?

00:57:45.105 --> 00:57:47.230
I mean, if you're good at
it, can you become great?

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.882
If you're average,
can you become great?

00:57:49.882 --> 00:57:51.840
You know, can you say a
little bit more about--

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.916
I mean, it seems to be
an art to this thing.

00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:54.790
JOHN MCCONNELL: Yeah.

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:58.755
I do think that it is at
one level kind of a knack.

00:57:58.755 --> 00:58:03.180
I mean, that is, there
are people who just

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:08.490
have a natural gift in writing.

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:13.380
And I know them and look up to
them, admire them very much.

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.070
It's also a tool you can
sharpen, no question.

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:21.660
I think you become a
better writer by writing.

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:24.330
You become a better
writer by rewriting.

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:25.440
That I know.

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.000
You become a better
writer by reading.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.680
I really think that one of
the greatest things you can do

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:35.970
is just--

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:37.800
is just be an omnivorous reader.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:43.995
Because you're going to
be drawn to good writing

00:58:43.995 --> 00:58:46.380
if it's something that
interests you and it's something

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:51.330
in an area that you
want to know more about,

00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:53.860
an area that's just
part of your life.

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.610
It doesn't matter
what the subject is.

00:58:56.610 --> 00:59:05.340
It just matters that you keep
developing your sense of what

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:10.090
good writing is
just by seeing it,

00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:11.480
getting to know the quality.

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:16.060
I find that even now, when
I listen to speeches on TV,

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.750
which I always have
done my whole life,

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:21.090
I'm really struck at
how many times you just

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:25.020
hear cliches being repeated
in set-piece speeches.

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:29.310
Everybody spouts cliches in
conversation, because so much

00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:33.870
of what we say is just
what's just come to our mind.

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:36.040
But writing is supposed
to be something different.

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.572
It's thinking.

00:59:37.572 --> 00:59:39.420
It's thinking things through.

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:46.476
It's thinking things from
the perspective of not just,

00:59:46.476 --> 00:59:49.560
how does this appeal to someone
who likes what I'm saying,

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.612
but how is this going
to sound to someone

00:59:52.612 --> 00:59:53.820
who dislikes what I'm saying?

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:54.500
And I just--

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:59.665
I find that when I hear
strings of cliches,

00:59:59.665 --> 01:00:04.540
it sounds to me like someone
was given the task of writing

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:07.930
something, but really didn't put
any thought or effort into it.

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:12.490
I always quote David
McCullough, who

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:16.410
said, writing is thinking
and thinking is hard.

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:17.410
But it pays off.

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:22.810
And just not necessarily
calling attention

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:25.540
to the writing itself,
but it pays off

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.840
when it really calls
attention to the point that

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.250
is being made, and
the writing is good

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.380
and it is conversational.

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.090
It's unpretentious.

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.910
And therefore, the
listener likes it.

01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:42.820
But the listener isn't really
thinking about the writing.

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:46.130
The listener is really thinking
about the point being made.

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:48.240
That's when you've
got something.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.010
SPEAKER 1: It looks like maybe
we have time for just one

01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:52.540
more question.

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.770
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.710
So President Bush
speaks Spanish.

01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:58.270
Various presidents
have had faculties

01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:00.520
with other languages
besides English in the past,

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.030
like Kennedy including German
in his speech in Berlin.

01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:05.830
At what point does
a speechwriter

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:08.430
include or think about
delivering a speech

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:09.430
in a different language?

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:11.638
Or what are the strategic
considerations in including

01:01:11.638 --> 01:01:12.850
other languages in speeches?

01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:17.130
JOHN MCCONNELL: Well,
make sure it's right.

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:21.510
I remember poor Hillary
Clinton with that reset button.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:25.700
I forget what it meant,
but it didn't mean reset.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.260
And that's just-- that's the
writer's nightmare, right?

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:29.760
OK.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.730
This is-- I know
what this means.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:37.410
There's an old story that
Berliner is actually the word

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:39.570
meaning pastry or something.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:40.260
[LAUGH]

01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:44.430
And then so that technically,
President Kennedy said,

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:48.600
I am a pastry, or I'm a
jelly donut, or something.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.250
And I was at a dinner of former
White House speechwriters

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:55.170
a few years ago
with Ted Sorensen,

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.900
who I got to know just
through this organization

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.030
of former White
House speechwriters.

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:03.050
And he spoke to that directly.

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:07.900
He said, you know,
there's a weekly magazine

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.640
called "The New Yorker."

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.250
He said, if I stood up and
said, I am a New Yorker,

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:16.450
no one would interpret me as
saying, I am a weekly magazine.

01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:19.990
He said, everybody knew what
President Kennedy was saying,

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:24.960
and it's kind of a cheap shot,
you know, years after the fact.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.660
But I mean-- and you've got
to get the pronunciation down,

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:31.005
and everything else.

01:02:31.005 --> 01:02:33.130
I remember when I worked
for Vice President Quayle.

01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:36.970
He went to Lithuania right
after Lithuania was no longer

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:38.080
part of the Soviet Union.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.810
And he said some
things in Lithuanian.

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:44.482
But I remember, we really
went over those and made sure.

01:02:44.482 --> 01:02:45.940
We wanted it to
sound right, and we

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:50.692
wanted to make sure it meant
what it was supposed to mean.

01:02:50.692 --> 01:02:51.400
SPEAKER 1: Great.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.816
Well, thank you
so much, everyone,

01:02:52.816 --> 01:02:54.160
for coming and for tuning in.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.201
It was great to have you.

01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:58.990
[APPLAUSE]
