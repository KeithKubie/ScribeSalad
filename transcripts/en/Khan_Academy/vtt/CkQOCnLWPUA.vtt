00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.790
Two videos ago we asked
ourselves if we could find the

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.150
basis for the columns
space of A.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.440
And I showed you a method
of how to do it.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.580
You literally put A in reduced
row echelon form, so this

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.230
matrix R is just a reduced
row echelon form of A.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.040
And you look at its
pivot columns, so

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.290
this is a pivot column.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.880
It has a 1 and all 0's, this is
a pivot column, 1 and all

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.200
0's, and the 1 is the leading
non-zero term in its row.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.920
And this is a pivot column, let
me circle them, these guys

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.530
are pivot columns, and
this guy's a pivot

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.890
column right there.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.200
You look at those in the reduced
row echelon form of

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.140
the matrix, and the
corresponding columns in the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.870
original matrix will
be your basis.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.700
So this guy, this guy,
so the first,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420
second, and forth columns.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.730
So if we call this a1, this is
a2, and let's call this a4,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.980
this would be a3,
and this is a5.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:07.410
So we could say that a1, a2,
and a4 are a basis for the

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.020
column span of A.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.500
And I didn't show you
why two videos ago.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.960
I just said this is
how you do it.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.640
You have to take it as a bit
of an article of faith.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.970
Now in order for these
to be a basis, two

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.030
things have to be true.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.770
They have to be linearly
independent, and I showed you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.130
in the very last video, the
second in our series dealing

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.830
with this vector.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.320
I showed you that by the fact
that this guy is r1, this guy

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.620
is r2, and this guy is r4, it's
clear that these guys are

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.630
linearly independent.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.290
They each have a 1 in a unique
entry, and the rest of their

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.540
entries are 0.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510
We're looking at three pivot
columns right now, but it's

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.030
true if we had n
pivot columns.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.970
That each pivot column would
have a 1 in a unique place,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.400
and all the other pivot
columns would

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.790
have 0 in that entry.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.760
So there's no way that the
other pivot columns, any

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.150
linear combination of the other
ones, could never add up

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.200
to each of them.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.580
So these are definitely
linearly independent.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.120
And I showed you in the last
video that if we know that

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.690
these are linearly independent,
we do know that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.250
they are, given that R has the
same null space as A, we know

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.540
that these guys have to be
linearly independant, I did

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.230
that in the very last video.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.060
Now the next requirement for a
basis, we checked this one

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:41.810
off, is to show that a1 a2 and
an, that their span equals the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.750
column space of A.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.680
Now the column space of A is
a span of all five of these

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.960
vectors, so I had to throw
a3 in there and a5.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.060
So to show that just these three
vectors by themselves

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.130
span our column space, we just
have to show that I can

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.210
represent a3 and a5 as
linear combinations

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.950
of a1, a2, and a4.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.160
If I can do that, then
I can say then

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.890
these guys are redundant.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:25.140
Then the span of a1, a2, a3, a4,
and a5 doesn't need the a3

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.500
and the a5 terms, that we can
just reduce it to this.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.790
Because these guys can be
represented as linear

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.630
combinations of the
other three.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.340
These guys are redundant.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.860
And if we can get rid of them
we can show that these guys

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.850
can be represented as linear
combinations of the other,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.910
then we can get rid of them.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.620
And then the span of these three
guys would be the same

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.160
as the span of these five guys,
which is of course the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.350
definition of the column
space of A.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.430
So let's see if we
can do that.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.680
Let me fill in each of these
column vectors a1 through a5,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.380
and then each of these column
vectors let me label them r1,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.580
r2, r3, r4, and r5.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.790
Now let's explore the
null spaces again.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.600
Or not even the null spaces,
let's just explore the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.610
equations Ax is equal to -- let
me write it this way --

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:28.390
instead of x let me write x1,
x2, x3, x4, x5 is equal to 0.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.650
This is how we define the
solution set of this.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.870
All the potential x1's through
x5's or all the potential

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.480
vectors X right here, that
represents our null space.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.490
And then also let's explore all
of the R times x1, x2, x3,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.190
x4, x5's is equal to 0.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.690
This is the 0 vector, in which
case you would have four

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.210
entries in this particular
case.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.260
It would be a member of Rm.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.690
So these equations
can be rewritten.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.370
I can rewrite this as -- what
were the column vectors of A?

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.480
They were a1, a2 through a5.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:18.090
So I can rewrite this as x1
times a1 plus x2 times a2 plus

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.750
x3 times a3 plus x4 times
a4 plus x5 times

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:34.070
a5 is equal to 0.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.270
That was from our definition
of matrix vector

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.790
multiplication, this is just a
bunch of column vectors a1

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.250
through a5, I drew it up here.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.870
I can just rewrite this
equation like this.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.810
Similiarly, I can rewrite this
equation as the vector r1

00:05:51.810 --> 00:06:02.800
times x1 or x1 times r1 plus x2
times r2 plus x3 times r3

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:11.820
plus x4 times r4 plus x5
times r5 is equal to 0.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.690
Now we know that when we put
this into reduced row echelon

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.000
form the x variables that are
associated with the pivot

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
columns are -- so what are the
x variables associated with

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.720
the pivot columns?

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.450
Well, the pivot columns
are r1, r2, and r4.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.070
The x variables associated with
them, we can call them

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.850
pivot variables, and the ones
that are not associated with

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.710
our pivot columns are
free variables.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.290
So the free variables
in this case, x3 and

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.145
x5, are free variables.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.610
And that applies to A.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.410
All of the vectors x that
satisfy this equation also

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.150
satisfy this equation,
and vice versa.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.910
They're the exact same
null space, the exact

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.160
same solution set.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.260
We can also call this x3 and
this x5 as free variables.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.130
Now what does that mean?

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.710
We've done multiple
examples of this.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.740
The free variables, you can set
them to anything you want.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:31.270
So x3 in this case and x5 you
can set it to any real number.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.010
You can set to anything
you want.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.200
And then from this reduced row
echelon form we express the

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.340
other pivot variables as
functions of these guys.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:51.340
Maybe x1 is equal
to Ax3 plus Bx5.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:57.420
Maybe x2 is equal
to Cx3 plus Dx5.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:03.750
And maybe x4 is equal
to Ex3 plus Fx5.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.530
That comes directly out of
literally multiplying this guy

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.010
times this equals 0, you'd get a
system of equations that you

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.740
could solve for your pivot
variables in terms of your

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.980
free variables.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.390
Now given this, I want to show
you that you can always

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:31.450
construct one of your -- in
your original matrix.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.220
So if we go to our original
matrix, you can always

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.059
construct one of the vectors
that are associated with the

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.260
free columns.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.880
You can always construct one of
the free vectors using the

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.930
linear combination of the ones
that were associated with the

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.100
pivot columns before.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.710
And how do I do that?

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.570
Well, let's say that I want to
find some linear combination

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.880
that gets me to this free
column, that gets me to a3.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.810
So how could I do that?

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.330
Let me rearrange this
equation up here.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.580
So what do I get?

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:08.210
I'm sorry.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.360
That's x3 a3.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.800
If I subtract x3 a3 from both
sides of the equation, I get

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:23.900
minus x3 a3 is equal to x1 a1
plus x2 a2 plus -- I don't

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:33.220
have the 3 there -- plus x4 a4
plus x5 -- sorry, x isn't a

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.720
vector-- x5 a5.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.650
This, I guess salmon colored
statement here, is just

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.800
another rewriting of this
equation right here.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.620
And all I did is I subtracted
this term right here, x3 a3,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.900
from both sides of
the equation.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.410
Now x3 is a free variable.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.020
We can set it to anything
we want, and so is x5.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.220
So let's set x3 is
equal to minus 1.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.795
Then this term right here
becomes a 1, because that was

00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:08.170
a minus x3.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.060
And let's set x5 equal to 0.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.750
So if x5 is equal 0, this term
disappears, and I did that

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.150
because x5 is a free variable.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.300
I can set them to
anything I want.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.960
Now I've written a3 as a linear
combination of, I guess

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.660
you could call it my potential
basis vectors right now, or

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.810
the vectors a1, a2, and a4.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.130
They're the vectors in the
original matrix that were

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.850
associated with the
pivot columns.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.070
Now in order to show that I can
always do this, we have to

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:49.790
show that for this combination
there's always some x1, x2,

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.660
and x4 that satisfy this.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.260
Well, of course there's always
some x1, x2 that satisfy this,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.400
we just have to substitute our
free variables, x3 is equal to

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.900
minus 3 and x5 is equal to 0,
into these equations that we

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.210
get from our system when we did
it with the reduced row

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:06.460
echelon form.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.926
In this case you have x1 is
equal to minus A plus 0, x2 is

00:11:13.926 --> 00:11:16.190
equal to minus C, so
on and so forth.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.600
So you can always do that.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.390
You can always express the
vectors that are associated

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.170
with the non-pivot columns as
linear combinations of the

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.230
vectors that are associated
with the pivot columns.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.160
What I just did for a3, you
could just as easily have done

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.180
for a5 by subtracting
this term from both

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.270
sides of the equation.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:44.260
Setting x5 to negative 1 and
setting x3 to 0 so that the 3

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.690
term disappears, and you could
run the same exact argument.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.360
So given that, I've hopefully
shown you, or least helped you

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.240
see or made you comfortable
with the idea, that the

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.000
vectors -- let me do them in a
nice vibrant color -- these

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.480
magenta color vectors here that
are associated with the

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.940
free columns or with the free
variables, the free variables

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:16.520
were x3 and x5, those were these
columns right here, that

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.390
they can always be expressed as
linear combinations of the

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.150
other columns.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.370
Because you just have to
manipulate this equation, set

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.940
the coefficient for whatever
you're trying to find a linear

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.950
combination for equal to minus
1, and set all the other free

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.620
variables equal to 0 that
you're not solving for.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:39.010
And then you can get a linear
combination of the vectors

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.970
that are associated with
the pivot columns.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.630
So given that, we've shown you
that these free vectors, and

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.570
I'm using my terminology very
loosely, that these ones that

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.560
are associated with the non
pivot columns can be expressed

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.300
as linear combinations
of these guys.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.310
So they're unnecessary.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.970
The span of this is equivalent
to the span of this, the span

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.030
of this is the column space of
A, so the span of this is the

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.390
column space of A.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.250
So in the last video I showed
you that these guys are

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.860
linearly independent, and now
I've showed you that the span

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.020
of these guys is the
column space of A.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.270
So now you should be satisfied
that these vectors that are

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:20.860
associated -- let me do it in
a blue color -- that that

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.800
column vector, this column
vector, and this column

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.260
vector, that are associated with
the pivot columns in the

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:32.520
reduced row echelon form of
the matrix, do indeed

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.160
represent a basis for the
column space of A.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.090
Anyway, hopefully you didn't
find that too convoluted.
