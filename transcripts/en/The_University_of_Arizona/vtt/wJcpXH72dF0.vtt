[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:05.660
RACHEL FRANKE:
It's very exciting.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.610
I wasn't expecting
to be part of it.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.000
I think it's really cool that
she does outreach like this.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.070
Her music director was
saying that whenever

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.200
they have the
opportunity to do so,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.180
they try to get people
within the community

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.570
to join them on their
concerts, which is thrilling.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.046
 Hi.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:23.025
 Hi.

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:24.650
ALIA VINSON: We're
trying to figure out

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.090
who we are as performers.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.550
And so to really
be around and be

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.509
on the same stage as such
amazing and iconic performer,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.595
it's a huge learning
experience for us.

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.220
And so I'm just really
excited to learn

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.277
from just watching her.

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:42.079
[VOCAL WARM-UPS]

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:43.947
 All right.Let's do it.

00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:45.080
JACKSON WUJEK:
Well, you never know

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.640
what's coming your
way, especially

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.050
at a great program like this.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.000
Being able to work with a
person that you'd be able to--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.999
that you're going to work
with in the real world

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:52.970
is so thrilling.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.760
I never thought I was going
to be Kristin Chenoweth ever,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.090
but this is a really,
really cool opportunity,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.305
and I'm really excited.

00:00:59.305 --> 00:00:59.930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.138
 (SINGING) Puts us to shame.

00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:03.230
We can bring everyone together.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.430
Yeah.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.330
That was good.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.530
Thank you.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.380
Thank you.
