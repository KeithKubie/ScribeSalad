00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.719
The drinking bird has just one degree of freedom. It can rotate around its

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.822
pivot point. However, the motion along this axis is fairly complex, and is

00:00:06.822 --> 00:00:10.598
difficult to capture in a few simple equations. One brute force method to

00:00:10.598 --> 00:00:13.864
create animations is called motion capture. The idea is to capture the

00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:17.510
movements of a person or object by using a few strategically placed cameras.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.565
The information recorded is processed to derive the paths of various parts of

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:25.190
the body. These motions are then applied to the model in the virtual world. To

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.750
more easily track where each part of the body goes, it's common to attach ping

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.899
pong balls or lights to a person while filming them. These attached objects are

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.230
called markers. There's a a move toward marker less systems where no special

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.805
suits are needed. In the foreground here, you can see the actors pose being

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.951
capture and applied to a character. In this clip there's a lot going on. You

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:45.842
might want to watch it a few times. In the upper right the 2 actresses are

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:50.390
being recorded. The cameraman is also moving around the scene. In the lower

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.860
right you can see a reconstruction of the actresses's motions. On the left,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.094
these motions are being applied to the 2 computer animation characters in real

00:00:57.094 --> 00:01:01.178
time. There're 2 views here on the left. On the one half is the cameraman's

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:05.358
view. The other half shows a fixed camera view of the whole scene. Motion

00:01:05.358 --> 00:01:08.094
capture is used extensively in the film and games industry, as it's a

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:12.600
straightforward way to quickly generate animations and is cost-effective. There

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.235
are some drawbacks. The first is cost of entry. This process is currently not

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:19.964
something you can easily do without some investment. That said, costs are

00:01:19.964 --> 00:01:22.694
coming down, and inexpensive hardware such as Microsoft's Kinect can be used

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:27.509
for capture. You can also use more limited forms of capture. This demo, by

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:27.869
Jerome

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.293
[UNKNOWN],

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:31.984
does head tracking using a web cam. It's using 3JS and is Free Source, so it's

00:01:31.984 --> 00:01:37.160
something you can instantly use yourself. Motion capture can only do so much.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.628
Systems that use markers can track only those markers. For example, hand and

00:01:40.628 --> 00:01:44.968
finger gestures will not be caught by a full body capture system. Motion

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:48.840
tracking is also affected by the limitations of the actors in the world itself.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.464
There are real world constraints on real world performances, and the data is

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:55.070
only as good as your actors can provide. Artists generating animation have

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.670
unlimited freedom, at least until they run out of time or money. To get back to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.550
our humble drinking bird, the way this process could work is that we track the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.382
motion over time. The positions tracked could be turned into the amount of

00:02:05.382 --> 00:02:08.947
rotation of the Z-axis for the bird's moving part. We would then have a giant

00:02:08.947 --> 00:02:12.450
table of values, which we could interpolate between. At some given time T, the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.542
angle of rotation is Z. Apply this rotation at that time, and we have an

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:18.469
animation matching real life.
