00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.140
Data and data storage are in a never-ending
arms race.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.589
The size and cost of memory shrinks while
video and photo resolutions go up, and file

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:09.690
sizes balloon.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.369
The end result is you just never seem to have
enough room on your phone or laptop for all

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.690
your stuff, and you have to choose which photos
of your cat to delete so you can take more

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.740
photos of your cat right now cuz she’s doing
something so cute.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.859
But there’s a limit to how small magnetic
storage can get, and scientists are inching

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:27.859
towards it.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.520
The basic building block of data is a bit,
represented by either a 1 or a 0.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.500
The basic building block of ordinary matter
is an atom.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.399
So scientists have been trying to store a
bit using a single atom.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.239
It actually makes sense when you think about
it.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.789
Magnetic storage has been common in computers
since the 1950s, when hard disk drives held

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.670
a whopping 4-ish MB and was the size of a
refrigerator.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.890
Magnets have a north and south pole, so depending
on which way they’re oriented they can represent

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.780
a one or a zero.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.640
Usually magnetic fields are only noticeable
when the magnetic fields of whole clusters

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.311
of atoms are aligned the same way, but zoom
in closer and you’ll see the electrons of

00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:11.770
atoms basically act as tiny magnets in and
of themselves, so theoretically a single atom

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.690
could be enough to represent a bit.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.990
But down at that atomic scale, things can
be chaotic.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.200
Atoms are extremely sensitive to their surroundings,
which can cause their north and south poles

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.230
to flip.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.590
To store data reliably, scientists need to
prevent this flipping, and most experiments

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.980
in single atom data storage solve this problem
with extreme cold.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.840
In July of 2018 one experiment used holmium
atoms as their magnets, and subjected them

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.070
to extreme conditions.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.430
They found the holmium atoms retained their
magnetization even in a very strong magnetic

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.010
field of 8 Tesla, so long as they were kept
below 45 Kelvin.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.180
Still the researchers hope that the holmium’s
resilience points to more stable data storage

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.970
at less extreme temperatures.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.700
And finally in September of 2018 scientists
announced they had come up with a different

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.850
approach to single atom storage altogether.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.260
Using cobalt atoms on a background of black
phosphorus, the scientists created an energy

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.829
difference between the cobalt atom’s orbitals,
or the regions where electrons orbit the nucleus.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.989
This allowed them to use the electron’s
orbital angular momentum to create the bits,

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.540
instead of their spin angular momentum like
in previous experiments.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.750
Changing the orbital angular momentum has
a bigger energy barrier, which should make

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.120
the bits more stable at higher temperatures,
though they’ve only been tested in extreme

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.629
cold so far.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.109
Even if scientists make single atom storage
stable at room temperature, there are still

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.349
other problems to solve before it goes mainstream.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.810
Data also need to be easy to write with acceptable
an signal to noise ratio.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.280
Most experiments in single atom data storage
use a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope to arrange

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.750
the atoms one by one, which is not effective
enough for practical use.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.109
Single atom storage has a long way to go,
and in the meantime, it looks like I’m just

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.030
not going to have enough space for more pictures
of my cat.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.890
So storage on atom might take a while, but
DNA data storage could be here in a few years.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.840
Check out our video about it here.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.249
Fun fact, there are also some scientists out
there trying to store data on a single ELECTRON!

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:14.639
It’s called electronic quantum holography,
and it very confusing, please don’t make

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.930
me do a video about it.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.139
Catch ya next time on Seeker!
