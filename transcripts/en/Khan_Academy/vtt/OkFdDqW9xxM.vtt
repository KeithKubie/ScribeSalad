00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.940
Use the change of base formula
to find log base 5 of 100

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.050
to the nearest thousandth.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.279
So the change of base
formula is a useful formula,

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.320
especially when you're
going to use a calculator,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.700
because most calculators don't
allow you to arbitrarily change

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.570
the base of your logarithm.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.810
They have functions
for log base e,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.760
which is a natural
logarithm, and log base 10.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.754
So you generally have
to change your base.

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:26.670
And that's what the
change of base formula is.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.086
And if we have
time, I'll tell you

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.910
why it makes a lot of sense,
or how we can derive it.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.710
So the change of base
formula just tells

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:41.140
us that log-- let me do some
colors here-- log base a of b

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.410
is the exact same
thing as log base

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:58.330
x, where x is an arbitrary
base of b, over log base,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:05.810
that same base, base x over a.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.070
And the reason
why this is useful

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.620
is that we can change our base.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.840
Here are our bases, a, and
we can change it to base x.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.600
So if our calculator has
a certain base x function,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.300
we can convert to that base.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.410
It's usually e or base 10.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.080
Base 10 is an easy way to go.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.580
And in general, if you just
see someone write a logarithm

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.140
like this, if they
just write log of x,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.540
they're implying-- this
implies log base 10 of x.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.770
If someone writes
natural log of x,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.200
they are implying
log base e of x,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.770
and e is obviously
the number 2.71,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.240
keeps going on and
on and on forever.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.830
Now let's apply it
to this problem.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.820
We need to figure
out the logarithm--

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.790
and I'll use colors--
base 5 of 100.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.950
So this property, this
change of base formula,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.410
tells us that this is
the exact same thing

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:10.870
as log-- I'll make x 10--
log base 10 of 100 divided

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:18.926
by log base 10 of 5.

00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:20.800
And actually, we don't
even need a calculator

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.240
to evaluate this top part.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.590
Log base 10 of 100-- what
power do I have to raise 10 to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.620
to get to 100?

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.920
The second power.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.530
So this numerator
is just equal to 2.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.654
So it simplifies to 2
over log base 10 of 5.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:37.070
And we can now use
our calculator,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.267
because the log function on
a calculator is log base 10.

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:42.600
So let's get our calculator out.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.210
We want to clear this.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.010
2 divided by-- When someone just
writes log, they mean base 10.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.570
If they press LN,
that means base e.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.700
So log without any other
information is log base 10.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.470
So this is log base 10 of
5 is equal to 2 point--

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.230
and they want it to the
nearest thousandth-- so 2.861.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.280
So this is approximately
equal to 2.861.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.440
And we can verify it because
in theory, if I raise 5

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.050
to this power, I should get 100.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.425
And it kind of makes sense,
because 5 to the second power

00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:26.814
is 25, 5 to the
third power is 125,

00:03:26.814 --> 00:03:28.480
and this is in between
the two, and it's

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.490
closer to the third power than
it is to the second power.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.750
And this number is closer
to 3 than it is to 2.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.190
Well, let's verify it.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.310
So if I take 5 to that power,
and then let me type in--

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.200
let me just type in what we
did to the nearest thousandth--

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.430
5 to the 2.861.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.530
So I'm not putting
in all of the digits.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.880
What do I get?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.560
I get 99.94.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.300
If I put all of
these digits in, it

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.400
should get pretty close to 100.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.874
So that's what
makes you feel good.

00:03:56.874 --> 00:03:58.290
That this is the
power that I have

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.190
to raise 5 to to get to 100.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.610
Now with that out of
the way, let's actually

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.700
think about why this property,
why this thing right over here

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.070
makes sense.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.240
So if I write log
base a-- I'll try

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.120
to be fair to the
colors-- log base a of b.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.080
Let's say I set that to
be equal to some number.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.630
Let's call that equal to c, or
I could call it e for-- Well,

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.550
I'll say that's equal to c.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:45.520
So that means that a to the
c-th power is equal to b.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.530
This is an exponential
way of writing this truth.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.850
This is a logarithmic way
of writing this truth.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.930
This is equal to b.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.780
Now, we can take the
logarithm of any base

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.090
of both sides of this.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.129
Anything you do, if you say 10
to the what power equals this?

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.920
10 to the same power
will be equal to this,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.320
because these two things
are equal to each other.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.680
So let's take the same
logarithm of both sides of this,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.190
the logarithm with
the same base.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.050
And I'll actually do log base
x to prove the general case,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.890
here.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.230
So I'm going to take log of
base x of both sides of this.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.155
So this is log base
x of a to the c

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:29.270
power-- I try to be
faithful to the colors--

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.660
is equal to log base x of b.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.350
And let me close it off
with orange, as well.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.770
And we know from our logarithm
properties, log of a to the c

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.770
is the same thing as c times
the logarithm of whatever

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.480
base we are of a.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.820
And of course, this is going
to be equal to log base x of b.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.540
Let me put-- I can just
write a b, right over there.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.140
And if we wanted to solve for
c, you just divide both sides

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.800
by log base x of a.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.430
So you would get c is equal to--
and I'll stick to the color--

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:30.520
so it's log base x of b, which
is this, over log base x of a.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.690
And this was what c was.
c was log base a of b.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.859
It's equal to log base a of b.

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:38.900
Let me write it this way.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.025
Let me write it-- Well, let
me do the original color

00:06:43.025 --> 00:06:45.150
codes just so it becomes
very clear what I'm doing.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.140
I think you know
where this is going,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.880
but I want to be
fair to the colors.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:55.580
So c is equal to log
base x of b over--

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.920
let me scroll down a
little bit-- log base

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.716
x, dividing both
sides by that, of a.

00:07:02.716 --> 00:07:04.840
And we know from here I
can just copy and paste it,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.380
this is also equal to c.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.020
This is how we defined it.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.650
So let me copy it and
then let me paste it.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.860
So this is also equal to c.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.920
And we're done.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.350
We've proven the
change of base formula.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.770
Log base a of b is equal to log
base x of b divided by log base

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.810
x of a.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.700
In this example,
a was 5, b is 100,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.270
and the base that we switched
it to is 10. x is 10.
