00:00:01.029 --> 00:00:03.070
MALE SPEAKER: I want to
really quickly introduced

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.180
Joe Hall, which is
a total pleasure.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.010
Although last minute
duties, so apologies

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.359
for not being over rehearsed.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:11.650
I've known Joe for a long time.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.240
We were in grad school
together at Berkeley.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.906
While I was in law
school, Joe was there

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:18.720
getting his Ph.D. He was
actually first prominent,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.690
in my life and
around the country,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.050
for working on voting systems,
electronic and online voting

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.530
systems, and also
voting machines

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.500
and the security around them.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.750
And I think that was the
focus of your dissertation.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.040
Right?

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.670
JOE HALL: Oh, yeah.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.439
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
so I worked on that,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.500
and an election season couldn't
go without Joe appearing

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.710
on every various media
outlet talking about it.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.970
And then he's, of course,
moved on from that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.540
into a broader range of work.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.920
He was a post-doc
fellow at Princeton

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.690
with Ed Felten, who is
no stranger to policy

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.860
and technology issues,
and also worked

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.180
with Helen Nissenbaum at NYU.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.460
And in the last year, has
come down to Washington DC,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.024
has joined the
beast, and now works

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:01.815
at the Center for
Democracy and Technology.

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:04.395
He's their first ever-- is that
right? --chief technologist.

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:04.830
JOE HALL: Yeah.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.913
Well, we had a chief
computer scientist before me,

00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:08.365
but I didn't feel comfortable.

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:10.615
MALE SPEAKER: Right, and
computer scientist, too small

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:13.430
of a title for Joe
Hall, who's the Chief

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.850
Technologist at the Center
for Democracy and Technology,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.040
a fantastic online civil
liberties organization

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.510
and advocacy group.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.670
And also, just because at Google
we love our well roundedness,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.030
in addition to all the
other things that he's done,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.440
Joe has also been a pastry chef.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.100
He has been a ranch
hand, and he's also

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.510
instructed yoga,
been a life guard,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.360
and a riflery instructor
for a youth camp.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.110
By the way, if the
apocalypse occurs,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.110
I want this guy on my side.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.604
And with that, I want to pass
it over to Joe Hall for a talk

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:51.270
and, hopefully, some
time for questions.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.910
If you have questions, please
save them until the end.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.750
And also, if you are
and GBC, please leave it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.780
muted to avoid further
technology disruption.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.530
Thank you so much.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.029
Joe.

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:02.296
JOE HALL: Thank you, sir.

00:02:02.296 --> 00:02:02.795
Yes.

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:03.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.611
JOE HALL: Oh.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.752
So I have quite a slide
deck here for you.

00:02:10.752 --> 00:02:12.710
I think I'm going to try
and go for 40 minutes,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.200
and I may skip over some things.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.810
And if I skip over
something that's

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.370
really true and dear to
your heart for some reason,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.120
let me know, and we'll
go back during Q&amp;A.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.036
But I want to make sure
there's plenty of time

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:25.720
for Q&amp;A. Q&amp;A will
not be recorded,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.380
so feel free to do whatever
you want to do during Q&amp;A.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:30.722 --> 00:02:33.180
JOE HALL: So what I want to
talk about here is tech policy,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.850
and specifically, I've
been in DC for a year

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.420
now after leaving academia.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.390
And it's been a crazy
year, man, and I just

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.320
want to give you a
flavor for how crazy it's

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.730
been for what's going on.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.480
And what I want to do
is talk a little bit

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.220
about the FBI and
backdoors, the NSA and what

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.260
we call the
cryptapocalypse, and then

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.950
novel technologies like drones.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.947
And I am the chief
technologist at the CDT,

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:58.030
and we are hiring, by the
way, not that any of you

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.480
should leave wonderful
jobs at Google.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.910
But please, let
your friends know

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.440
that might be interested
in this kind of stuff.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.000
Quick outline, so I got tell
you a little bit about who I am.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.320
We'll do some of that.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.306
What is CDT?

00:03:11.306 --> 00:03:12.930
Some of you may have
never heard of us.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.590
We're pretty low profile kind of
an organization and what I do.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.460
And then talking about how does
tech policy work inside DC?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.850
How does anything about
technology get done?

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.990
Is it as frustrating
as you may think

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.790
it is here in Silicon Valley?

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.030
And then walk through some of
these specific case studies.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.890
So who am I?

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.490
Well, I have a background
in hard sciences.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.025
I did my undergrad at
Northern Arizona University

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:41.140
in Flagstaff, Arizona, where I
modeled planetary atmospheres,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.730
which is a whole lot of fun.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.320
And we actually-- oops.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.440
Oh, I see what's going on.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.310
We actually found clouds
on a moon of Saturn,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.070
called Titan, that has
sort of a methane cycle,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.421
just like the Earth has a water
cycle with oceans and rain.

00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:59.045
And on Titan, they actually have
that, but with something else.

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:00.806
It's very, very cold.

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.430
Anyway, that's just
to give you an idea

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.721
of some of the stuff I've done.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.676
I tend to tell people I hacked
voting machines for my Ph.D.

00:04:08.676 --> 00:04:10.300
It was much more
complicated than that.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.400
We were on the policy
side of this stuff.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.480
We were funded by an enormous
grant by NSF, a $10 million

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.690
grant for five years,
to basically think about

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.020
how do we make these black
boxes a little more trustworthy.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.775
And we were invited,
as you can see,

00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:30.400
we were invited to
hack voting machines

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.940
for the state of California.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.456
This is our current Secretary
of State Debra Bowen.

00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:35.830
A lot of interesting
people here,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.370
Matt Blaise, Alex
Halderman, Dierdre Mulligan,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.450
Ping Ye, who is a Googler.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.889
I don't know if anyone
else here is a Googler.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.180
Many of them have been interns.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.930
And you can see right
here, when we did it

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.709
for Ohio on the right,
this is resetting

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:52.250
all the administrative passwords
on this voting machine using

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.720
a magnet and a
palm pilot we just

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.960
had sort of sitting around.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.420
Yeah, it's that bad,
and it's actually

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.410
kind of a little bit worse
than that these days.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.160
The stuff that I
work on regularly

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.730
involves consumer privacy,
health technology,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.170
national security,
cyber security,

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.650
and technical standard setting.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.674
I still do some e-voting
and some space policy stuff.

00:05:15.674 --> 00:05:17.090
You can kind of
think of me-- this

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.700
is why I call myself
a technologist.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.820
I'm sort of half a lawyer and
a half a computer scientist,

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.930
but my degree is from a
school of information,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.080
so it's like a Ph.D. in
information of all things.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.200
But I say that because
this is my Ph.D. committee.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.930
Pam Samuelson was my
Ph.D. adviser on the left,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.870
and Dierdre Mulligan was my
grant supervisor next to her,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.400
and those two were
law professors.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.840
And then David
Wagner at Berkeley

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.250
was sort of a
computer scientist,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.390
very, very well respected
computer security guy,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.340
the guy I often say what
would David Wagner do

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.100
when I do things.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.532
I may not do that thing, but
I at least ask that question.

00:05:51.532 --> 00:05:53.490
And then [INAUDIBLE]
Cheshire on the far right,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.830
who does social psychology.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.436
So what is CDT?

00:05:57.436 --> 00:05:59.060
The Center for
Democracy and Technology

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.660
is a nonprofit think tank.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.935
We're sort of half think
tank, half advocacy outfit.

00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:05.810
We're a bunch of nerds,
and we do a whole lot

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.580
of actual advocacy work in DC.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.650
We're about 20 years old.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.560
We used to actually be EFF's DC
office, the Electronic Frontier

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.470
Foundation's DC office.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.190
There is a little bit of
a falling out of sorts,

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.920
and we broke off
about 20 years ago.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.060
I can talk about that.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.780
What's our support come from?

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.710
Largely foundations
and corporate

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.279
support, so not half and half.

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:34.820
It's much more
complicated than that.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.256
You can go to cdt.org financial
and add it up yourself

00:06:38.256 --> 00:06:39.880
if you want to figure
these things out.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.790
But this sort of underlines
our principles, which

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.420
involve empowering people
with digital technology

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.936
and the internet, and
this means that we

00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:53.810
want to have things that
are forward looking,

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.240
very progressive types of
collaborative solutions,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.930
and tangible pragmatic
policy outcomes.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.260
And this often involves making
sure we bring businesses

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.550
into the conversation.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.391
We get a lot of flack for
taking corporate money,

00:07:07.391 --> 00:07:09.890
but at the same time, we think
that it's really a good idea.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.420
The internet doesn't just
exist without the economic case

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.310
for doing things
on the internet,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.650
and we think it's really
important to make sure

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.670
that's done responsibly and
that things don't chill that.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.890
And a lot of what we
do is never public,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.320
which people-- it's very hard
to fund things with grant

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.940
money, foundation money,
when a lot of what you do

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.220
is just not public.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.970
When it comes down to face
to face meetings and stuff

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.300
like that, you may not
be able to say here's

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.710
a big press release,
because it may

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.781
deep six entire
relationships you have.

00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:44.280
It's important to
think a little bit

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.890
about what technology policy is.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.190
The basic way to say
it is it's the rules

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.330
that we set about technology,
and it's not just laws.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.160
If you have two small kids
arguing over a very large piece

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.739
of cake, you can set up
a really easy experiment

00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:01.030
because they both have the
interest of getting the most

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.470
cake, where one cuts and
the other gets to choose it.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.980
And that is essentially
aligning incentives

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.541
to get the best outcome,
the outcome being both kids

00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:10.290
are somewhat convinced
that they're happy,

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.892
and they participated
in the process,

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:14.100
so they know what's going on.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.280
But it's not just sort
of social outcomes.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.110
It's also technical, so to
what extent do the things

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.620
we do result in better
things happening,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.200
better technology being
able to exist and thriving.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.450
And economic interests,
to what extent

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.750
does it help the country,
and other countries,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.870
sort of build
innovative products

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.380
and employ people
and things like that?

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.699
This can mean that certain
things are prohibited

00:08:38.699 --> 00:08:40.240
when you make rules
about technology,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.823
and if you're a
technologist-- I don't

00:08:41.823 --> 00:08:45.960
know how many of you in the room
are, but maybe a lot of you.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.340
Technologists can often be
frustrated when someone tells

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.360
them, oh, you can't do
that, and so for example,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.670
you cannot currently take
satellite imagery that is lower

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.487
than about 50 centimeter
resolution, at least in the US.

00:08:56.487 --> 00:08:58.570
If you're a US company,
you cannot put a satellite

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.260
in the air and then sell
the products that come out

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.150
the other end.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.460
That means you guys at
Google can't actually

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.935
use products that
have things that

00:09:04.935 --> 00:09:06.500
are lower than that resolution.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.640
There's currently a
company, Globalize,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.284
currently petitioning
US government

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:12.450
to be able to launch a
satellite that would do that,

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.950
and they're trying
to make the case,

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.660
look, there's not
a lot more that's

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.670
going to be able to--
you know, 25 centimeter

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.730
resolution doesn't
mean you're going

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.320
to be seeing faces
and things that

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.930
might be problematic from
a privacies prospective.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.990
Or particular
installations, that's

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.280
not going to make
a big difference.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.524
Now, we should
also mention we're

00:09:33.524 --> 00:09:35.940
going to be able to start doing
things on the consumer end

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.380
really soon that can be kind
of scary, print gun parts,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.080
print molecules like Sarin gas.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.860
How do you control that when
it's a very cheap consumer

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.240
technology?

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.130
Can you control that?

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.230
Do you have to resort to more
informal methods of control,

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.060
like norms, "Don't do
Sarin gas," to your kids?

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.330
I don't know.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.260
You also can't do
certain things.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.760
Like for example, you can
go buy a pager right now,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.380
hack it, and eavesdrop on all
the pager traffic around you,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.230
very similar to plugging
into an ethernet port.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.580
If you have the right
technical capabilities,

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.480
you can read a lot of
traffic that's flying around,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.220
and your cellphone
broadcasts stuff, too.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.280
You can't just do those
things, and maybe I'm

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.620
preaching to the choir,
just because it's

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.495
technically possible.

00:10:15.495 --> 00:10:18.140
There's reasons
we have rules that

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.950
make those things hard to do,
or at least to disincentivize

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.970
people doing that by
punishing them later.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:30.042
So in DC specifically-- and if
you've been in DC for a while,

00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:31.500
you sort of know
how this works, so

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.720
feel free to go to sleep for
about five or 10 minutes.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.460
There's various sort of
constituencies and stakeholders

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.370
that we work with
to get things done.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.460
Congress is obviously
a big one, lately

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.480
not passing laws so much,
but preventing bad laws

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.460
from being passed.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.250
In Congress, there's
all these support staff

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.940
called staffers,
legislative councils,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.940
various types of people.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.780
They're so key to talk with
when you're in DC in the sense

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.780
that they're often the ones
that, not only do you have

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.860
to explain very
complicated topics to,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.740
but you have to
explain them in a way

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.020
that they can then explain
them to their bosses.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.880
So it's not just, oh, I get it.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.915
It's about, no, look,
this is exactly what

00:11:15.915 --> 00:11:17.790
you need to be able to
say your boss in order

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.456
for them to have a
hope of understanding

00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:21.086
what we're talking about.

00:11:21.086 --> 00:11:23.336
You do that sometimes
through briefings,

00:11:23.336 --> 00:11:25.210
so you'll go in and talk
to a single staffer,

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.168
or a whole bunch of them,
or maybe a whole room

00:11:27.168 --> 00:11:31.129
like this full of staffers, and
it's like pedagogy in a sense.

00:11:31.129 --> 00:11:32.420
You're teaching them something.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.750
You're trying to show
them your way of view.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.677
But it's people who have
maybe 30 minutes between one

00:11:38.677 --> 00:11:41.260
high powered negotiating meaning
where they're doing something

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.060
on nuclear waste,
and something else

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.190
where they may be trying to
get to different kinds of visas

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.430
for immigrant
workers to come in.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.285
We do end up-- people
will hand us bills

00:11:52.285 --> 00:11:54.035
and say what do you
think about this a law

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:55.760
that we haven't
released yet, and we

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.820
have to say it doesn't makes
sense for us to look at that.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.500
Or should we throw
it in the trash?

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.740
Because the second you
start working with people

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.540
and saying this is how
the law should work,

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.710
it becomes lobbying.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.340
When you start to work with the
executive agencies or Congress

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.639
about how laws should look
and how they should pass,

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:15.180
and how this one's
bad, or you really

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.191
should add a feature like that
to it, you're doing lobbying.

00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:19.690
And we are not
registered lobbyists,

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.820
so we have to, by law,
keep it to about 20%

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.150
of our total
resource allocation,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.330
to be technical about it.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.800
The very, very high
profile and valuable way

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.300
to work with Congress
is through testimony.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.440
So we are often, at CDT,
asked to come in and testify

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.080
because a number of us have
expertise in certain areas.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.920
But more often, we say,
look, you don't want us.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.952
You want someone else.

00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:47.410
You want Susan
Landau, for example.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.559
You want Ed Felten.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:49.350
You want Ave Rubin.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.700
You want whoever
it is, Kevin Fu.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.430
You want some of these
people to come in and talk

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.540
to you about these things.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.470
That is a big goal of
us, in that process,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.930
is to make it really
plug and play,

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.660
to sort of have experts
come in and, like I

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.240
was telling Will
over lunch, and Troy,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.580
that you don't want to have
to worry about printing

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.131
50 copies of some
written testimony, which

00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:15.130
is what they ask you do.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.980
Bring 50 copies
of the things you

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.786
just spent two days of
your time writing with you,

00:13:19.786 --> 00:13:21.910
and you're like, wait,
where am I going to do that?

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.280
How am I going to do that?

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:22.910
That sucks.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.530
It's heavy.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.080
What?

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.210
So we do that, and we also
will do things like look

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.620
at the testimony
and say that's going

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.200
to trigger someone's other
policy agenda on this side.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.640
They may have a dog in the
fight on this other issue.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.900
So we try and sort of make it to
where experts want to come back

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.051
and do this again.

00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:45.050
And that's hard to do
because, sometimes, people

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.730
are like I'm never setting
foot back in Washington DC

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.610
after the grilling I got
by that Congress member.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.430
And if that's the
case, that's too bad,

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.470
but we hope to make sure that we
have people come in regularly.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.670
We do work with the
executive branch quite a bit,

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.680
so this includes the White
House and a slew of agencies.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.830
This is sort of like
the alphabet soup slide,

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.610
and there's some--
unfortunately,

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.254
this is not a technical
alphabet soup,

00:14:09.254 --> 00:14:11.170
and so it's not nearly
fun as some of the ones

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.790
later, where I'll talk
about technical stuff.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.000
But the White House has various
sort of arms that we work with.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.730
NSS for the National
Security Staff,

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.540
which has been a huge
challenge lately.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.310
There's just a
whole lot going on,

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.320
and we'll talk a lot
about that later.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.050
OSTP, the Office of Science
and Technology Policy.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.610
We actually have, at least at
the National Security Staff,

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.340
we have a former
CDT employee who's

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.580
the head of the civil liberties
and privacy part of that,

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.790
and so he's extremely
busy these days.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.620
And USTR, the US
Trade Representative,

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.740
how do we work with
other countries,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.490
and how do we negotiate certain
kinds of instruments that

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.830
make sure that the US
is on equal footing

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.690
with other countries where
the things we care about

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.520
are embodied in what we do?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.520
And that can be a challenge
because, on the copyright side,

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.120
the US tend to be
very, very aggro about,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.204
very, very aggressive
about things.

00:15:03.204 --> 00:15:04.870
Whereas what we want
to see is like it's

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.910
very hard to use IETF
standards in Europe

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.680
because they favor
government developed

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:16.080
standards, not open consensus
kinds of flavors and standards.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.659
In terms of agencies,
there's just a ton of them.

00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:20.200
Department of Commerce
is pretty big,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.860
and we work a lot of
them in order to say here

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.140
are the incentives
involved in what we do.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.200
The NTIA, the National
Telecommunications

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.700
and Information Administration,
is the White House's advisors

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.750
in terms of internet
policy, and so

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.550
if you can convince some of
them to care about your issue,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.030
then you're doing a good job.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:46.305
And again, one of the CDT's
former staffers, John Morris,

00:15:46.305 --> 00:15:47.810
is at NTIA.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.634
And NIST is what I've
been doing a lot lately.

00:15:51.634 --> 00:15:53.550
National Institute of
Standards and Technology

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.390
makes all sorts of standards
about cryptography,

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.810
computer security, cyber
security, stuff like that.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:03.476
And this is all to say there's
a bunch of them, Federal Trade

00:16:03.476 --> 00:16:04.850
Commission, Federal
Communication

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.646
Commission, Health
and Human Services,

00:16:06.646 --> 00:16:09.020
the FDA, which is a part of
the Health and Human Services

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.380
in terms of medical
device rules,

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.880
Department of
Transportation is when

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.640
it comes to drones, the Federal
Aviation Administration.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.690
The thing that I want
to get across here

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.900
is, with regulatory
proceedings--

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.060
so those are things like RFIs,
requests for information;

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.210
ANPRMs, and advanced notice
of proposed rulemaking;

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.590
NPRMs, notice of
proposed rulemaking.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.590
These are extremely important
for people to be involved with.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.855
In your private capacity if you
can, but it's very important

00:16:39.855 --> 00:16:41.730
to hear from industry
and trade associations,

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.840
blah, blah, blah,
whatever you want.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.060
RFIs are a way, for an
agency, of saying, look,

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.780
we have no clue
what's going on here.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.720
We need some input.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.690
Please, come to us and
write a short little paper

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.060
and tell us what's going on.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.750
ANPRMs, advance notice
of proposed rulemaking,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.700
says there's a law
that says we have

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.780
to write a rule
about some subject.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.641
We're thinking about
writing it like this.

00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:08.599
We don't know if that's
the right way to do it.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:12.000
Please, come in and let and
let us know if that's right.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.390
And then NPRM is like, OK,
here's what we're going to do.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.540
Because, I should have
said this earlier,

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.250
but when laws get
passed in Congress,

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.099
they're typically
very, very high level.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:27.290
They're typically
go do x, y, or z,

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.430
and then you have to
actually operationalize that.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.100
You have to go and write the
specific rules down and get

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.910
them passed, such
that that works.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.140
So like for example,
healthcare.gov, there

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.090
are a ton of really
crazy thousands

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.540
of pages of rules that talk
about how the exchanges work,

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.070
how things are supposed to work.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.880
There's not a lot of information
about the technical stuff

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.379
in this, which is kind of a
pain in the butt for those of us

00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:56.560
who need to talk to the
press or other people

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.170
about why it's sort of
failing so amazingly.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.640
And I'm not talking about here.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.560
We can talk about
in Q&amp;A. There's just

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.660
some really horrible
things going on.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.966
We also participate in
workshops and proceedings,

00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:09.340
so I'm going to be speaking
at a Federal Trade Commission

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.430
workshop on the Internet
of Things, which

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.620
is a-- I guess it's been
a-- I was going to say it's

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.290
a marketing term, but it's
been around for a long time.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.206
So you can't just sort
of write off like that.

00:18:17.206 --> 00:18:20.176
But I'm talking about
telehealth stuff on the 19th,

00:18:20.176 --> 00:18:21.300
and we'll see what happens.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.040
It should be pretty interesting.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.170
We don't do a lot of court
stuff, like litigation.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.400
We very rarely do that.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.566
I think the last time we
did it was something called

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:31.440
Reno versus ACLU,
which makes sure

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.010
that-- it's about
intermediary liability.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.030
This is why YouTube can have
people come and put things

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.040
up and not get in trouble
themselves for things

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.800
that people put up.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.710
We do file as amici,
so amicus briefs.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.780
That basically means a
friend of the court brief,

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.360
where we come in and we're
not a party to the matter,

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.965
but we want to say, look,
these guys are duking it out.

00:18:53.965 --> 00:18:56.340
But we think you really need
to care about something else

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.170
that neither of them are
going to tell you about,

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.128
or they're not going to
value as much as we do,

00:19:00.128 --> 00:19:02.780
like the public
interest for example.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.306
But we do, in litigation,
support people or partners

00:19:07.306 --> 00:19:12.059
that do litigate and
are all over the place,

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:14.100
like the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, the ACLU

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.690
chapters in every
state, public knowledge.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.320
There's a lot of copyright and
intellectual property stuff.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.670
Press, so this is
the last way that we

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.170
work a lot with people in DC.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.880
Press is amazingly important
and really effective

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.980
when you do it well, and man,
I have a lot of challenges

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.640
with doing press well.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.790
I was on Glenn Beck's-- Glenn
Beck has a cable news network,

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.779
or cable network, called
the Blaze apparently.

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:41.570
I didn't know this.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.900
But I was on it,
and they really are

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.010
on Obama's ass about
the whole NSA thing,

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.260
and they wanted to come in
and someone to criticize it

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.200
and say why are they
doing all these things?

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.325
And we're like, oh, happy
to come and criticize it.

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:54.350
We think it's wrong.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.150
It's not a partisan
thing at all.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.340
It's that you shouldn't
collect that much stuff.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.700
But the disconcerting
part about this

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.380
is that when I want to be
doing a technical analysis

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.790
or writing a paper or
interfacing with someone to get

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.660
something done, it can be
like half of my day some days.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.020
Especially if there's a
Snowden revelation lately,

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.780
I have to clear things for
about a day and a half,

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.502
and it's just a
pain in the butt.

00:20:16.502 --> 00:20:18.210
But you've got to do
it, or they'll never

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.159
come again, which is
not what you want.

00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:22.700
But it's really
important because you

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.650
have this core part of
what people like me do,

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.120
which is translation.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.261
I often have to talk to
technical people about the law,

00:20:30.261 --> 00:20:31.260
like yeah, you did that.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.009
You can't do that.

00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:33.260
Here's why you can't do that.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.010
Or talk to lawyers
about technology.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.550
Here's how that
thing, IPv6, works.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.609
Here's why you
should care about it.

00:20:40.609 --> 00:20:42.900
Here's how you want to change
what you're talking about

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.592
and how your writing about.

00:20:44.592 --> 00:20:46.050
It can be a big
challenge, and what

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.591
I mean by that-- so
for example, here

00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:50.080
is a article from
the other day, where

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.620
I was quote talking
about healthcare.gov.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.482
And the quote comes out,
the beginning-- and there's

00:20:55.482 --> 00:20:57.440
like eight other people
quoted in this article.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.580
But the first quote
and the second one,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.705
if you can't read it, it
says "Some of these things

00:21:00.705 --> 00:21:03.050
are really amateur hour.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:06.337
This might just be an
error, but you could not

00:21:06.337 --> 00:21:07.920
pass an undergraduate
computer science

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.770
class by making these mistakes."

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.694
And it's very
aggressive, and CDT

00:21:11.694 --> 00:21:13.735
doesn't tend to want to
come off that aggressive.

00:21:13.735 --> 00:21:15.550
But at the same time,
we were seeing things

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:21.950
like refer headers leaked to
Pingdom and doubleclick.net,

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.780
and these refer headers had
user names and password reset

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.210
codes in them.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.510
And it's this long URL with all
these ampersand encoded things,

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.990
and we're just like I don't
know what any of that crap is,

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.730
but that is bad, bad, bad.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.300
That would be a fail on
a web security class.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.660
And then at the very
end, the problem

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.880
is even when you get
quoted, sometimes, they

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.970
don't get the quote
right, and you sort of

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:48.720
have to live with it.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.080
So at the very
end, it says, "When

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.455
it comes to functionality,
the last thing you think about

00:21:52.455 --> 00:21:54.944
is security."

00:21:54.944 --> 00:21:56.610
Being experienced in
this kind of thing,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.749
what I tried to get
across was people

00:21:59.749 --> 00:22:01.040
are trying to make things work.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.560
They don't think
about the adversaries.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.184
They don't think
about ways that people

00:22:04.184 --> 00:22:05.850
could mess with your
stuff, and that's

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:06.975
what I tried to get across.

00:22:06.975 --> 00:22:09.956
But it makes it look
like I'm saying, oh,

00:22:09.956 --> 00:22:11.330
securities the
last thing you do.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.846
But I did follow up
there by saying, look,

00:22:13.846 --> 00:22:14.970
you need to think about it.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.780
It's so deeply ingrained that
you can't just add it on later.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.630
This is something that we've
learned about over and over

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.450
again from failures.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.533
You can't add it on later.

00:22:24.502 --> 00:22:26.710
The last part, and the most
important part-- and this

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.750
is why it's so
important that people

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:34.410
like Heather West and others,
and there is people, Pablo,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.520
all these people are in DC.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.020
If you've ever
interacted with them,

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.570
it's because you have to meet
with people face to face.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.590
You have to talk directly to
other companies about things

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:48.070
that you may find to
be of common interest,

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.730
and then trade
associations, people

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.840
who can sort of,
like a union does,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.570
aggregate all of
various companies

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.130
in a sector to say
things of real import.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:02.140
There's a whole bunch of
other people we talked to.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.870
To give you an example,
this is the way

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.590
that we-- two things we really
value at CDT are convenings

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.380
and expertise, so we'll
often bring people

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.870
together in a very closed door
meeting, Chatham House rules.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.370
Or something we even call
stricter than Chatham House

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.030
rules, and that
means you can talk

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.699
about what people--
the Chatham House is

00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:22.490
you can talk about what
someone said there,

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.369
but you can't attribute anything
said to any specific person.

00:23:25.369 --> 00:23:26.910
The stricter than
Chatham House rules

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.850
is you can talk about
the meeting was about,

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.980
but you can't talk about
anyone, or any industry,

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.950
specifically said.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.950
And so it gets kind of weird.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.530
But we talked about-- recently,
we had a convening on hack

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.030
back.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.240
This is the idea of
companies are getting

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.130
attacked constantly,
and they may

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.370
want to take some
measures to respond.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.170
And how far can they go?

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.362
Right now, under the
law, not very far.

00:23:51.362 --> 00:23:52.820
You can do pretty
much anything you

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.070
want inside your own network,
but the second it leaves

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.045
your network, there's
not a lot you can do.

00:23:57.045 --> 00:23:58.820
And there's a really
good book that I

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.865
can refer you to
about this stuff.

00:24:00.865 --> 00:24:04.590
It's brand new, and it gives
sort of a really neat framework

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.510
to think about it.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.070
But the whole point
of that convening

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.486
was what are people
doing, what do

00:24:08.486 --> 00:24:11.980
they want to do, how would
this be received by DC, what

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.960
are some of the risks
that can involved.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.440
If you take down a
hospital in attacking back,

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.360
and it's in the middle
of nowhere China

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.830
or something like that,
that's going to be really bad,

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.205
and you don't want to have
the kind of collateral damage.

00:24:24.205 --> 00:24:27.524
And that can happen because it's
very hard to attribute things

00:24:27.524 --> 00:24:28.190
on the internet.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.580
It's very hard to know
who you're actually

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.200
interacting with.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.283
They could be coming through
a hospital to attack,

00:24:32.283 --> 00:24:34.590
and you never even know.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:40.202
OK, so let's get to
some of the cases here.

00:24:40.202 --> 00:24:41.660
First thing I'm
going to talk about

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.670
is the FBI and
their quest to have

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.450
more backdoors into things.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.770
So in 1994, there
was a law passed

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.010
called CALEA, the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement

00:24:54.010 --> 00:25:00.920
Act, and this was essentially
the law enforcement community

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.280
realizing that people are moving
from regular landline phones,

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.780
that you could take two little
alligator clips to and listen

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.280
to what they're
talking about if you

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.180
get to the write little
wire loop somewhere.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.870
There is increasingly
digital switching.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.930
There is a whole bunch
of new technologies

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.200
that made it very hard
to do wiretapping,

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.290
and so they passed a
law that said anyone

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.260
who does telecommunications
has to build, and has to buy

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.890
and has to build
into these systems,

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:30.040
a way for us to
actually wiretap people.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.140
And curiously
enough, that did not

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.410
apply to sort of the burgeoning
internet, at that time,

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.550
and the web, which
was about to be born,

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.710
and that's a very good
thing, in our opinion.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.030
Now, fast forward about
2010, about 2010, the FBI

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.690
started to argue via
their general counsel,

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.360
a woman named
Valerie Caproni, who

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.760
I think now works for
Boeing, that they were,

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.390
quote, unquote, going dark.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:55.935
And what they argued
is, geeze, people

00:25:55.935 --> 00:25:57.810
aren't using-- it's not
just about the copper

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.855
wire and the alligator
clips anymore.

00:25:59.855 --> 00:26:01.980
People are not even using
phones that much anymore.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.230
They're talking in ways, to
each other, that don't even

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.710
include telecommunications
protocols at all.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:13.130
For example, if you think
about web mail, like email,

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.020
you may start your day off at
your home answering some email.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.600
You may go to a coffee shop
and answer some more email.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.620
If they want to
wiretap you using

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.780
the signals on the
very end there,

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.639
they have to actually,
first of all,

00:26:25.639 --> 00:26:27.930
have a relationship with your
internet service provider

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:28.430
to do that.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.020
And if they're using Gmail,
they will get entirely encrypted

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.690
stuff because you guys use SSL.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.440
But if they're using someone
else who doesn't do SSL,

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.936
but then they have
to figure out,

00:26:37.936 --> 00:26:39.810
OK, well, that's the
coffee shop you went to.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:40.670
Who's their ISP?

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.180
I need to wiretap
you there, too.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.815
And so they're really
worried about people sort

00:26:43.815 --> 00:26:45.273
of hopping around
so much that they

00:26:45.273 --> 00:26:48.750
can't do it in a turnkey manner.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.170
In fact, a number of
people have argued

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.640
sort of the opposite, that
now, in this day and age,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.770
it's actually a golden
age of surveillance.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.920
The more that we do every
day-- more and more,

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.050
what we do every day is mediated
by things that can record what

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.416
we're doing, and
there's so many signals

00:27:08.416 --> 00:27:09.790
being passed around
that it's not

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.120
so hard to imagine
recording that stuff.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.500
And this is actually
Peter Swire,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.280
and [INAUDIBLE] Ahmad
wrote this for us.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.800
It's a really neat,
wonderful piece just

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.940
to point to and
say, look, in fact,

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.414
it's not exactly this
going dark problem.

00:27:24.414 --> 00:27:26.330
What we, in fact, have
is more and more people

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:30.140
collecting more and more
stuff about what we do.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.850
Then about round 2010, we
started hearing grumblings

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.350
about something that
we're calling CALEA II,

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.870
and this is plugging
this loophole

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.020
in the original
wiretapping law that

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.050
would extend wiretapping
obligations to software itself.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:50.710
And we think that is a
horrifically bad idea.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.770
And some of these
proposals would basically

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.670
require you to
write software that

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.720
was born with a wiretap
capability in it, so born

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.640
wiretap capable.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.610
And if you didn't do that,
they would come to you,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.870
and you'd get these
escalating fine regimes.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.480
And it's actually totally--
some of these things

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.730
were leaked in the press,
and they got pretty strange.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.299
Like the Washington Post
claimed they would serve you

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:18.590
with this thing saying you
need to change your software

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.380
to build in this wiretap
capability, this backdoor

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.980
into it.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.270
If you didn't do it in 90
days, you'd get a $10,000 fine,

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.373
and that $10,000 would be
doubled every day indefinitely.

00:28:30.373 --> 00:28:32.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.072
JOE HALL: That's the kind
of reaction I like to hear.

00:28:35.072 --> 00:28:36.530
You know, it doesn't
take very long

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.490
to get to the entire market
cap of most organizations,

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:43.029
or most businesses in
some small countries.

00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:45.320
A couple of weeks is all you
need of that kind of thing

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.630
to totally wipe someone out.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.880
So then the next week,
about a week or two later,

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.340
it was, oh, this is going
to be $25,000 a day,

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.660
and it's going to be additive.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.990
And I'm like, OK,
at least then, i

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:55.270
can start seeing
you making a case

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.380
that this is just
a cost of business

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.470
if you're going to do
secure communications.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.630
But in the end, we
really don't think

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.380
that there should
be any law that

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.160
outlaws purely encrypted
end-to-end communication

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.350
systems, which it sounds
like this would do,

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:13.872
sort of require you to
serve clear text to people.

00:29:13.872 --> 00:29:16.080
So we've been hearing about
this, and we're like, OK,

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.970
what can we do here?

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.810
And this is one of the
key ways that we operate.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.480
We organized an
expert report, so we

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.930
got a bunch of extremely
smart people together.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.650
We wrote a sort
of draft, and said

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.460
what do you guys
think about this?

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.220
How can we make this better?

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.650
And it involved sort
of a curated list of 20

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:38.640
of the top cryptography,
computer security, and network

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.130
security experts in
the world, one of which

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.430
is sitting in this room, Susan.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.660
But this is a really
interesting list of people,

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.410
and this is curated
in a way that it's not

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:52.662
sort of simply people that
everybody would recognize.

00:29:52.662 --> 00:29:54.370
So there's people on
here that definitely

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.660
have cachet, so the Peter
Neumanns, Edward Feltens,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.270
Phil Zimmerman who created PGP.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.780
He was involved with this.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.600
But they're sort of
young people and people

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.820
that keep a low profile.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.710
So Eric [INAUDIBLE], who
now works in Mozilla.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.240
Fred Schneider, very,
very smart professor

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.450
at Cornell, who was on the,
believe, the Air Force defense

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.380
or one of the defense
advisory boards,

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.840
so very top secret
cleared individual

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.030
who was willing to
make this argument.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.330
Anyway, so a whole bunch
of really-- Matt Green,

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.880
who's probably one of
the most accomplished

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.970
and promising young
applied cryptographers.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.660
Feel free to take issue
with any of this in the Q&amp;A.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.220
But our argument was
relatively simple.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.560
We talked about a few things.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.290
We said the architected
vulnerabilities,

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.350
what you're asking,
these back doors

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.380
just fundamentally
undermine security.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.340
When you engage
in communications,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.790
these are things
that are designed

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:57.120
to undermine your ability to
speak privately and securely

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.070
with someone, and
it's designed to do so

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.060
in a way that is undetectable,
which is fundamentally

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.090
a problem.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:05.300
These things are backdoors.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.830
These kinds of backdoors and
endpoint software and products,

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.440
are really difficult and messy.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.380
So for example, if you do say,
OK, FBI tells me, via this law,

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.260
we have to build a backdoor
into what we're doing,

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.219
how do you manage that?

00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:21.593
How do you manage
access to that?

00:31:21.593 --> 00:31:23.360
If you get a valid law
enforcement request

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.310
from Iran or from
China, what do you do?

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:30.300
So you say, OK, well, we have
a business case that we're not

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.120
going to do that or whatever.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.850
Or you get one from
a police officer

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.520
in a tiny town
somewhere in America,

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.480
and you may not be-- especially
if you're a mom and pop shop,

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.090
you may not have the capability
to sort of understand

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:46.650
what's going on
there or the desire

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.560
to think about those
kinds of things.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.667
And this sort of
slam dunk argument,

00:31:50.667 --> 00:31:52.250
it's always good to
have one of those,

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.490
is that this is just
not going to work.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.960
If you put backdoors in
these products, a lot of them

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.360
are open source,
Chrome, Firefox.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.750
You can see these things,
rip them out, open SSL.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.760
The things that are
not open source,

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.270
you can have binary patches.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.440
That's what a jailbreak is,
is a binary patch to something

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.140
to make it do something else.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.410
And finally, you could
actually procure this stuff

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.868
into some country that doesn't
have a stupid law like that,

00:32:18.868 --> 00:32:21.490
so it doesn't make any
sense to do any of this.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.060
We took a small group of these
people, so Ed Felten, Bruce

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.329
Schneier, Eric [INAUDIBLE],
and Mike [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:28.329 --> 00:32:29.870
a former student of
Matt Blaise who's

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.754
now a professor at
Georgetown, to the White House

00:32:32.754 --> 00:32:34.045
and the Department of Commerce.

00:32:34.045 --> 00:32:39.190
The Department of Commerce
was very much sort of-- it

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.049
felt like they wanted
ammo to try and shoot

00:32:41.049 --> 00:32:43.340
these kinds of things down,
whereas in the White House,

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:49.310
it was very clear that
they were sort of listening

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.680
but not playing in other
cards or showing us anything.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.370
They didn't really
make any commitments.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.170
They didn't seem
to be very shocked.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:57.545
I think this is
sort of something

00:32:57.545 --> 00:32:59.470
they expected and heard before.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.350
Now, the key part of
this, and something

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:05.060
that I have to emphasize,
is that this is only

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.280
the first part of the battle
against the FBI in terms

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.680
of backdoors.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.860
It didn't deal with
centralized services.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.670
Our argument was
all about endpoints,

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:19.530
and unfortunately, and sadly, if
you, as someone in the middle,

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:23.610
have clear text, if you
have access to the stuff,

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.130
you can be compelled
to give it over.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.470
And so there's examples,
hush mail about 10 years ago.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.490
Lavabit, most recently,
shut itself down rather than

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:38.192
give up 400,000 of its users
to, I believe, the FBI.

00:33:38.192 --> 00:33:40.150
We're going to need help
making these arguments

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:41.420
about centralized services.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.240
For example, how does lawful
intercept undermine security?

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.360
I need to be able to make
that argument sometime

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.570
in the future, not
anytime really soon.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:54.910
But I think this underlines
that, especially at CDT,

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.670
and I think hopefully,
people in this room

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:01.690
agree, that you
can't tap everything.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.790
Technically, there will be
something that you cannot

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.470
listen to.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.760
I think that there's a
lot of interest these days

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.440
in the venture capital community
about end-to-end secure

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.500
communication tools
of various types.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.010
There's just a ton
of action there,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.239
and that was before Snowden.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.572
That was a thing before Snowden.

00:34:22.572 --> 00:34:25.020
It's definitely bigger, now.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.389
And this may sound kind
of sci-fi, but it's true.

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:31.230
We will have things
you put in your head

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:34.230
to computationally
support cognition

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.770
at some point in the future.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.857
Maybe it's farther away
than some people think,

00:34:37.857 --> 00:34:38.440
but who knows.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.620
It's going to happen.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.770
That stuff should
not-- you should

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:44.274
have an enclave inside
your head that you

00:34:44.274 --> 00:34:46.290
can keep your
secrets to yourself.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:50.480
I mean, we need some sort of--
I don't know what we need.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.900
We need something that
basically makes that happen.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.330
So that was all in play,
and then Snowden happened.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.560
So that was May 16 when we
wrote that, and then June 4 is

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.495
when Snowden happened.

00:34:59.495 --> 00:35:02.450
And so to transition
into another case study,

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:05.350
the cryptapocalypse, and I have
to go a little bit faster here.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:07.830
And what I mean by the
cryptapocalypse-- so

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.810
cryptography involves
math that is hard.

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.100
So math that you can do
easily in one direction,

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.370
but it's very hard to do
in the other direction,

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.960
like really hard, like billions
of years of computational power

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.560
hard.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.090
This year has been,
since June, a real pain

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.340
in the butt for some of us
just because every week you

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.715
get this new revelation, and
we have to make sense of it.

00:35:29.715 --> 00:35:31.905
We have to make sure that
we have a policy response,

00:35:31.905 --> 00:35:33.780
we got a press responsible,
blah, blah, blah.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.850
But for now, I'm going
to focus on two things.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.808
I need to move a little
quicker than I thought,

00:35:37.808 --> 00:35:40.860
but Bullrun and something
called MUSCULAR.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.010
Bullrun is essentially
the NSA's program,

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.750
and the GCHQ, the
UK version of NSA,

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.605
the Government
Communications Headquarters.

00:35:50.605 --> 00:35:52.670
It's not a very
descriptive title.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:56.020
But they're using tricks,
as Bruce Schneier says,

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.700
to undermine security.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.910
They are either stealing
or compelling people

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:05.410
to write certificates for
them, SSL certificates.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.160
You can think of it
as stealing encryption

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.610
keys or compelling people
to give you the keys.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.650
It seems like they're
planting moles in internet

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:15.080
and technology companies,
so someone in this room

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.656
may by paid by the
NSA in addition

00:36:16.656 --> 00:36:17.655
to being paid by Google.

00:36:17.655 --> 00:36:19.587
Who knows?

00:36:19.587 --> 00:36:21.170
And we've seen some
companies actually

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:22.821
institute military
security protocols,

00:36:22.821 --> 00:36:24.570
to where very sensitive
things are handled

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:28.330
by two people, and your hopeful
that not both those people are

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.430
a mole.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:31.520
And they've been planning
backdoors and standards,

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.410
and when someone comes with a
set of source code to the NSA

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.670
and says please help us
evaluate this implementation

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.694
of a cryptography
product, they will say,

00:36:40.694 --> 00:36:43.110
oh, here's a couple of things
we found that were problems.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.650
Here's a couple of
vulnerabilities,

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:48.590
and they're also keeping some
for themselves to use later.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:53.320
And MUSCULAR, you
may all know about.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.184
They're up on your data
center traffic, apparently,

00:36:57.184 --> 00:36:58.600
and they're using
the sort of lack

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.410
of constitutional oversight
in foreign countries

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.060
to tap that traffic.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.920
Obama, at some point, realized
that this wasn't going to stop

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.420
and decided he'd put a
panel to study the thing

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.090
and tell him what he should do.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.610
We were all bit
disappointed to see

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:15.180
that it was,
essentially, all law

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.930
professors and all
insiders, so everyone

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.000
had some sort of involvement
with the Obama administration.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.520
Although, Peter Swire is one
of them, and Peter Swire,

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.160
if any of you know
him, is awesome.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.535
He wrote that thing about the
golden age of surveillance.

00:37:28.535 --> 00:37:30.740
Definitely a skeptic
about surveillance.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.380
The CDT, Dan Auerback,
if you knew him.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.210
I think he used to be a Googler.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:38.340
And EFF, we basically
responded in a public comment

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.612
kind of forum, so not this is
an expert report that we're

00:37:41.612 --> 00:37:43.820
going to put up here, but
this is sort of an argument

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.670
that we want to make that
a lot of people believe in.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.652
And 47 people signed onto it.

00:37:48.652 --> 00:37:50.360
You probably can't
read this, but there's

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.500
a lot of really
neat people here.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.916
I'm going to bring
your attention.

00:37:52.916 --> 00:37:55.940
We're trying to continue
to sort of bring

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.810
in a bunch of different
kinds of people,

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.760
so there are some--
Ross Anderson

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:06.090
and Stephen Farrell
are both UK based

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.130
security experts
of various types.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.940
Joan Feigenbaum, we have some
sort of theoretical crypto kind

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.650
of people, people who do
sort of bigger thinking,

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.140
and a whole bunch of
scrappy activists.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.990
Ash [INAUDIBLE], Runa
Sandvik from the Tor Project,

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.880
although they didn't list
that affiliation here.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.715
Morgan Marquis-Boire,
who affiliation here

00:38:24.715 --> 00:38:28.380
with Citizen Lab, but he is a
Googler, very, very smart guy.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.660
We made the following
argument, which

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:35.150
is that if you're going
have a secret court that's

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.970
going to look at
technical topics,

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:39.350
you need that secret
court to have someone

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.140
with technical expertise on it
to evaluate the arguments that

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.766
are being made.

00:38:43.766 --> 00:38:45.140
Not only that,
but we pointed out

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.710
how not having a
technical person

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.400
in the room for
this stuff resulted

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:53.084
in a massive overcollection of
surveillance data in the past,

00:38:53.084 --> 00:38:54.500
specifically with
something called

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.580
MCTs, multi communications
transactions.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.430
That's like they grabbed a Gmail
screen shot as it flies by,

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.970
and so it has a bunch of to
and from email traffic on it.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.780
One of those may be
a foreign person,

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.040
which means they can keep
it, but all the rest aren't.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.260
And they claim that it's
not technically possible

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.240
for them to sort
these things out,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.540
which is bullshit because,
if you look at the JSON

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.800
structure for that, you
could very easily grab

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.695
just what you wanted.

00:39:22.695 --> 00:39:24.820
And there's other things,
like call detail records,

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.694
which they're grabbing
all of our call detail

00:39:26.694 --> 00:39:29.990
records every day in the US.

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:33.070
Apparently, at one point,
they include cell towers.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.290
They don't now, they tell us.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:37.050
I don't know how we're
supposed to know that for sure,

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.580
but at some point they did.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.300
Because when the cops come
and ask a telecommunications

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.597
carrier for call detail
records, they typically

00:39:43.597 --> 00:39:45.680
get the cell towers you
connected to when you made

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.470
calls.

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:48.280
That's very easy, and
increasingly easier,

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.446
to use to pinpoint your
location throughout the day.

00:39:54.564 --> 00:39:55.980
We talked about
wholesale attacks.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.070
These are non targeted.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.412
You're weakening
everyone's security.

00:39:59.412 --> 00:40:01.620
But I think the most important
argument that we made,

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.530
that got Ross Anderson and
Stephen Farrell on-- this

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.280
is something that we're
going to be making

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.210
a lot more noise
about very soon.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:10.530
--is that the US's commitments
to civil liberties and privacy

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:14.100
really demand that we treat non
US persons' data with respect.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.510
We can't just sort of say,
oh, they're foreigners.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.990
We can do anything
we want to them.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.990
That is just totally offensive.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.470
It's especially
offensive to anyone

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:23.970
who runs a global
internet business.

00:40:26.504 --> 00:40:27.920
Part of these
revelations revealed

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.090
that the NSA is doing
some things that-- it's

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.090
kind of hard to tell
exactly what they're doing,

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.940
but it seems to be clear
that they planted a backdoor,

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.610
that there may be a backdoor--
we can't know for sure.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:42.530
--in this particular
thing called DUAL_EC_DRBG.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.150
It's a random number generator.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.940
In cryptography we
have to generate

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.370
a lot of random
numbers very quickly.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:49.520
You can't just use dice.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.764
It would take you forever,
and it would not be fun.

00:40:53.764 --> 00:40:55.680
But NIST actually, when
they heard about this,

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.870
thought long and hard about it
for a few days, and then said

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.430
please don't use this thing.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.560
We think there's
a problem with it.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.724
If you think there's a
problem with it, let us know.

00:41:05.724 --> 00:41:06.890
Please don't use this thing.

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:09.290
And then you saw
RSA security, which

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.940
makes a lot of libraries
for cryptography products,

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.040
issue a product recall.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.498
The first product
recall I know of,

00:41:15.498 --> 00:41:18.920
and I'd love to be
proven different, where

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.256
it was essentially
someone recalling

00:41:21.256 --> 00:41:23.630
a product because their own
government had sort of hacked

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.300
their stuff.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.930
That was not a
good thing to see.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.799
The fact that they had
been accused of or had,

00:41:32.799 --> 00:41:35.340
or it was unclear that they'd
inserted a backdoor in this one

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.299
random number
generator caused people

00:41:37.299 --> 00:41:38.840
to start looking
around other things,

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.690
and this curious case
of SHA-3 came around.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.190
SHA-3 is a hash
standard, something

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:47.000
used in the
cryptographic hashes.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.370
This is a five year
competition to replace SHA-1.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:56.020
SHA-1 is based on this
way of doing hashes that

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.060
had been attacked,
and was basically

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:02.390
everyone thought that, at some
point, it will fall entirely,

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.460
and you won't be able to use
any of the stuff anymore.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.160
They won the competition
in October of 2012,

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.660
this is one called Keccak.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.180
It's a really fascinating thing.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.430
I can talk about more
if you hear about it.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.810
It turns out it was modified,
after the competition,

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.420
by NIST before it wrote it up
into a long, boring document

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.920
that says if you're going to
build something that does this,

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.280
here's how you do it.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.770
And a lot of people are like
why did you modify that?

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:26.740
Why did you reduce
the security of it?

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.540
And a number of
different arguments.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.510
So when I heard about
this, first of all,

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.426
I tried to make sense
of it, and so I wrote up

00:42:33.426 --> 00:42:35.550
a little blog post
that basically

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.790
said what the heck is
going on with SHA-3.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.915
And I figured the cryptographic
community isn't that big.

00:42:41.915 --> 00:42:44.290
Nerds who care about this,
there's not that many of them.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:45.450
I'm going to put this up.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.290
It totally took our server down.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:49.915
I don't know what it was.

00:42:49.915 --> 00:42:52.992
Part of the problem is,
because of who we are,

00:42:52.992 --> 00:42:54.450
we don't drop
cookies, and we don't

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:55.866
drop locally stored
objects, which

00:42:55.866 --> 00:42:59.122
means we can't use things like
Cloudflare to sort of-- anyway,

00:42:59.122 --> 00:43:00.330
I could talk more about that.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:01.920
But anyway, so it brought
our thing to its knees,

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.330
and we're like, oh, geeze,
people care about this.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.632
I met with the White House, two
people at the White House, Tim

00:43:07.632 --> 00:43:09.734
Polk and R. Schwartz,
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:09.734 --> 00:43:10.900
really concerned about this.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.720
Why don't you just
standardize the thing

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.460
that won the competition?

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.200
It looks bad if you don't.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.012
Turns out, that resonated,
and in fact, SHA-3

00:43:20.012 --> 00:43:21.720
is now going to be
standardized, and it's

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.957
as won in the competition form.

00:43:23.957 --> 00:43:26.040
It's going to have all the
strong secure-- I mean,

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:31.570
this is like pre-image collision
on two to the 500-- I mean,

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:35.015
it's just so enormously huge.

00:43:35.015 --> 00:43:37.390
It'll probably be a very long
time before anyone actually

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.700
cracks it, but the whole point
was have a really strong one

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.947
for people who do really
crazy things like elections

00:43:43.947 --> 00:43:45.530
or certain kinds of
mixed [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.140
You need a whole lot of
collision resistance.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.570
Anyway, but NIST is
also doing some review

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:55.530
of their entire cryptographic
standards suite.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.160
Let's talk about drones.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:57.809
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:57.809 --> 00:44:00.100
JOE HALL: So drones are really
interesting because it's

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.190
sort of a novel technology.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.170
It's not like
something before it.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:08.920
It's really new in DC, and I'll
try and be really quick here.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.520
They have a whole
lot of promise.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.175
100% of crop dusting
is done in Japan

00:44:13.175 --> 00:44:15.300
with drones, unmanned
aircraft, and the whole point

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.920
is crop dusting is
extremely dangerous.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.320
You often have wind
breaks at the end.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.010
You're really low, and if you
don't pull up quick enough,

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.593
you hit a bunch of
trees, and you die.

00:44:21.593 --> 00:44:22.750
And it's horrible.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.100
It's useful for a
whole bunch of things.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.670
There is a very
serious potential

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:30.040
for abuse with unmanned
systems, especially

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.127
these kinds of systems.

00:44:31.127 --> 00:44:31.960
They're really tiny.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.509
You often hear
before you seem them.

00:44:33.509 --> 00:44:35.300
They're very, very
cheap, so right now, you

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.520
can get one for about $300,
a quadracopter from Parrot.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.170
There are no humans on board,
and that's a good thing,

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.060
but it means that they can
go places that planes can't.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.290
So it can go between
buildings, and it

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.910
can do things that
planes can't do.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.012
It can handle crazy G-Forces.

00:44:51.012 --> 00:44:52.470
Some of these things
can stay aloft

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.330
for many, many days,
weeks in some cases.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.760
These are gas powered,
obvious, not battery powered.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.740
And they're going to, very soon,
have all types of surveillance

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.230
packages that manned
aircraft have.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.175
Gigapixel cameras, so being able
to get centimeter resolution

00:45:06.175 --> 00:45:08.590
in a place like Manhattan
can be very useful

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.090
for a variety of things.

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:11.930
LiDAR, laser kinds
of things, can

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.490
see through foliage,
an image what's

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.491
behind sort of disuse
kinds of barriers.

00:45:16.491 --> 00:45:18.740
Synthetic aperture radar
could see through your drapes

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:22.570
at home, and it can tell if
something in your front lawn

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:25.310
hasn't move a couple centimeters
and things like that.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.560
And these aren't things that
people really understand,

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.080
or we should understand or
should begin to understand.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.490
The FAA has to integrate drones
into the national air space

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.940
by 2015, and they're going
through a regulatory process

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.970
to do that.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.830
We're really thinking a lot
about privacy and safety

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:45.500
for drones.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:49.385
You know, how do other aircraft
know what's around them?

00:45:49.385 --> 00:45:51.510
If you ever flown aircraft,
birds are real problem.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.800
Well, think of these as
metal and plastic birds

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.380
that are flying around
that you might smack into.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.670
And how do people
in their backyard

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.780
get an idea of what's
in the sky above them.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.310
We imagined pretty
simple analogy.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.831
For vehicles, some of this
stuff works with just a license

00:46:06.831 --> 00:46:07.330
plate.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.280
License plates aren't
there just for the cops.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.250
It's for you, too.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.660
Someone does something, or
someone left their lights on,

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.280
there's a whole bunch
of uses for sort

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.890
of a meat space
cookie for vehicles.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:20.180
And planes have
something similar

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:23.890
in terms of an N-number on
their fuselage or their tail.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:26.970
So I thought what about a
license plate for drones?

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:29.354
Well, an N-number is
way too damn tiny.

00:46:29.354 --> 00:46:31.520
You'd need a telescope to
be able to visualize that,

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.010
and that's not going to work.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.830
So what about a radio
frequency license plate?

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.790
What if you broadcast
an identifier?

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:41.750
And so I wrote this
thing that's kind of-- I

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.041
hadn't thought about this much.

00:46:43.041 --> 00:46:45.989
I don't know anything
about flight regulations.

00:46:45.989 --> 00:46:47.780
We got a lot of feedback,
and they clued us

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.540
into this thing called
ADS-B Out, automatic

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.010
dependent surveillance,
mode B out.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.750
This is, essentially, a radio
frequency standard required

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:59.235
by the FAA for all
aircraft by 2020.

00:46:59.235 --> 00:47:01.620
It broadcasts an identifier,
position, velocity,

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.870
altitude every couple
seconds, and it's

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:10.810
used on manned aircraft to sort
of replace-- when you do radar,

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:13.350
you get an echo back
from every sweep,

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.619
and you have to extrapolate
where the plane's going,

00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:17.410
how fast it's going,
where it currently is,

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:22.326
and you have a very big
error radius on that value.

00:47:22.326 --> 00:47:24.700
If it knows where it is, and
it tells people where it is,

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.520
and it's a very
precise type of thing,

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.090
you can actually reduce that
error radius and pack planes

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:31.190
in for landing a
whole lot quicker.

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:33.360
This is sort of how it works.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.220
The planes have very
fine GPS, or GLONASS,

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.962
the Russian version of GPS.

00:47:40.962 --> 00:47:42.420
And then they
broadcast this stuff,

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:46.610
and other planes can see them,
and ground based receivers

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:48.770
can see them, too.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:50.910
We basically said,
OK, FAA, you need

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:54.360
to have a registry
that has who owns--

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.070
UAS is another word for drone.

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:59.110
Ask me why later.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.040
You need to talk about
what kind of thing this is.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.309
What kind of airframe type?

00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:05.350
What weight does it have?

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:06.225
What's it's wingspan?

00:48:06.225 --> 00:48:07.372
How big is it?

00:48:07.372 --> 00:48:09.580
And then it needs to have
a data collection statement

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.450
that shows here's all the
stuff that we want to do.

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:14.260
Here's what we're
going to collect.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.926
Here's what we're
going to share it for.

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:18.230
Here's how long we're
going to keep it.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:20.600
Here's someone to talk
to if you get upset.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.150
And you should issue something
called a Mode S hex code, which

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:26.480
is the thing you broadcast
on your airplane.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.500
It's a 24-bit identifier.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.577
And then a U-number,
sort of like a N-number,

00:48:30.577 --> 00:48:31.910
something that's human friendly.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.570
You can think of those IP
address and domain name

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:36.820
if you want to.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.800
We said everyone should have
to broadcast this thing,

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.510
but it's unclear if it should
have to be from the airframe

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:44.320
or from the ground.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.550
And the whole idea here is
that both people in aircraft

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.970
and people on the ground
can, in real time,

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.010
see what drones are doing.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.187
And the FAA-- or you
could have a Google Drone

00:48:55.187 --> 00:48:57.520
that sort of showed where all
the drones were in a given

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.340
area.

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.480
In fact, you can buy
stuff that does this now

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.070
because some companies already
have their planes outfitted

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.410
to the 2020 standard,
so you can go, for $900,

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.564
buy this little antenna
that hooks up to your iPad.

00:49:08.564 --> 00:49:10.480
For some reason, they'll
only work with iPads.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.110
Not sure why.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:14.050
Maybe they just want to
support one platform.

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:16.290
Here's another one from
Garmin, a little bit cheaper.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:17.456
You can use these in planes.

00:49:17.456 --> 00:49:21.140
Maybe that's why, because a
lot of the flight plan software

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.350
is iPad based.

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:26.350
Oops, since we said this,
and essentially said that,

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:29.430
the FAA responded and
said, oh, we don't care,

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:30.330
which is too bad.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:32.400
But there's been a lot of
other interest in this,

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.760
and I think the FAA may
actually mandate this.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.950
There are a lot
of complications.

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:39.170
If you want to have
these things on aircraft,

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:43.250
you need a flight certified
GPS, which is really expensive.

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.616
And you have to
have a transponder.

00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:46.990
So this is what
these things look

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.790
like they have a
human interface, which

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:51.060
you don't need for a drone.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.530
And that hardware box is about
the size of the pack of cards,

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:56.325
so it's not that big.

00:49:56.325 --> 00:49:57.700
And you probably
can't read this,

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.130
but I actually wrote these
guys at Trig Avionics that

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:03.040
make that things, and it's like,
hey, how much does this cost?

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:03.640
And said, you know,
we're actually

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.180
outfitting these
things on drones

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.200
that have to operate in airspace
that require this right now.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.260
It's about $6,000, so if you
have a $300 drone, in order

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.940
to play, maybe you have to
spend six grand to get it up.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:16.720
Maybe that's OK.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.350
Maybe it raises the
barrier high enough

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:21.350
to where not everyone
will have one.

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:22.190
I don't know.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.210
Anyway, that's it.

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:25.000
Sorry, I went way over.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.760
[APPLAUSE]
