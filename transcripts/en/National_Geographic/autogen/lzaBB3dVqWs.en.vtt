00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.900
MORGAN FREEMAN: What

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.667
sees or feels presence of God?

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.700
It can alter the
course of many lives--

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.600
even change the world.

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:18.033
I want to know what it's like.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:19.600
[music playing]

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.500
Do our traditions set us apart?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.533
Or do they connect us in
ways we never imagined?

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.033
MAN: This is no story.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.467
This is not a tale.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:29.467
This is history.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:30.867
How has it changed you?

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:32.367
MAN: The thing that
really sticks with me

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:33.667
is that unconditional love.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.266
This is the room
of the mysteries.

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.200
MORGAN FREEMAN: Oh my.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.600
Look at this.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.700
WOMAN: They've decided death is
better than life with no faith.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.834
MAN: I didn't know if
demons were real or not.

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.100
Now I do.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.467
MAN: Your worst enemies
are within yourself.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.633
MAN: There is one
supreme entity.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:04.066
And that entity can
take many forms.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.800
MAN: This is the space where
the living goddess lives.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.800
Why were you chosen?

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:14.600
MORGAN FREEMAN: They
are God's way of showing

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.934
us how to live better lives.
