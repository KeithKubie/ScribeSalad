00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:02.111
- [Instructor] Let's
imagine a very simple world,

00:00:02.111 --> 00:00:03.722
as we tend to do in economics,

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:06.450
that has two countries that
are each capable of producing

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.765
either pants or shirts,
or some combination.

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:10.889
And so what we have here

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.776
are the production possibility curves

00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:14.566
for each of those countries,

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.694
and this is in per worker per day.

00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:19.475
So, for example, in country
A, per worker per day,

00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:21.428
they could, if they put all
of their energy into pants,

00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:22.506
they could produce 20.

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:24.037
If they put all of their
energy into shirts,

00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:25.152
they could produce 10.

00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:26.574
Or there could be some combination

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:28.304
that would sit on this line.

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:31.379
Now, to help us digest the
production possibility curves

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:32.657
for these two countries,

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:35.105
let me construct an output table.

00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:36.076
So this will be,

00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:38.692
this column will be the
output for country A.

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:41.893
This column will be the
output for country B.

00:00:41.893 --> 00:00:45.110
And we're gonna think about
the maximum number of pants,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.277
maximum pants,

00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:49.996
the maximum output of
pants per worker per day.

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:52.023
The input is the worker per day.

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:56.190
And then let's think about
the maximum number of shirts.

00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:00.047
So pause this video, and see
if you can fill this out.

00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:01.445
What are the max pants and shirts

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:03.924
in country A and country B?

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:05.468
Well, in country A, I
already talked about it,

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:07.998
the maximum pants is 20,

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:09.140
20 pants.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.384
And then the maximum shirts,

00:01:10.384 --> 00:01:13.316
if they didn't make any pants, are 10.

00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:15.061
And in country B,

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:17.144
the maximum pants are 30,

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:22.866
and the maximum shirts, it
looks like that is about 45.

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.568
Now, from either of these
production possibility curves

00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:27.126
or from this output table,

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:29.265
because we have a
constant opportunity cost,

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:31.450
these production possibility curves

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.821
are straight lines with a fixed slope,

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:35.836
we can calculate the opportunity costs.

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:37.572
So let's do that next.

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:39.342
So this is country A,

00:01:39.342 --> 00:01:41.884
and then this is country B.

00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:46.869
And let me calculate the
opportunity cost of pants,

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.623
and let's calculate the
opportunity cost of shirts.

00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:53.743
So pause this video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:55.612
What are the opportunity
costs of pants and shirts

00:01:55.612 --> 00:01:56.906
in countries A and B?

00:01:56.906 --> 00:01:59.238
And fill out this table.

00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:01.357
Well, one way to think about it,

00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:04.585
in country A, I could put
all of my energy into pants

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:06.335
and produce 20 pants,

00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:09.709
or I could put all of
my energy into shirts

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.571
and produce 10 shirts.

00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:14.186
10 shirts, s for shirts, p for pants.

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:15.936
And so if I want the cost of pants,

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.516
I could just divide both sides by 20,

00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:20.428
and I would get pants,

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:23.747
the amount of energy per pant is equal to,

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.690
well, 10 divided by 20 is 1/2 a shirt.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.337
So the energy for pant is 1/2 for,

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:33.763
is the same as the energy for 1/2 a shirt.

00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:35.574
And so we could say the opportunity cost

00:02:35.574 --> 00:02:39.841
of producing a pant is 1/2 a shirt.

00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:42.073
If we want the opportunity
cost for shirts,

00:02:42.073 --> 00:02:44.733
we could take the
reciprocal of this number.

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:47.249
We could say it's going
to be two over one pant.

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.491
Or we could start with this
equation right over here,

00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:53.442
and instead of solving for
p, we could solve for s.

00:02:53.442 --> 00:02:55.522
How much energy, in terms of pants,

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:57.866
does it take for us to produce one shirt?

00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:00.864
So if you divide both sides
of this equation by 10,

00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:02.031
you would get,

00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:06.533
you would get two p is equal to s.

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:07.931
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.109
the energy to create one shirt

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.851
is equal to the energy
to create two pants.

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:17.213
So the opportunity cost of
producing a shirt is two pants.

00:03:17.213 --> 00:03:18.535
With that same energy of the shirt,

00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:20.502
you could produce two pants.

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:22.697
Now, let's also fill it out for country B.

00:03:22.697 --> 00:03:24.313
And if you haven't done so already,

00:03:24.313 --> 00:03:26.744
try to use the same method to fill this,

00:03:26.744 --> 00:03:30.084
the opportunity costs for
pants and shirts for country B.

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:33.836
Well, in country B, I could
put all of my energy into pants

00:03:33.836 --> 00:03:35.283
and produce 30 pants

00:03:35.283 --> 00:03:39.311
or all of my energy into
shirts and produce 45 shirts.

00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.297
So the opportunity cost per pant,

00:03:41.297 --> 00:03:43.154
if I divide both sides by 30,

00:03:43.154 --> 00:03:47.438
it'd be 45 over 30,
which would be equal to,

00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:49.393
they're both divisible by 15,

00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:50.830
3/2 of a shirt.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.863
The energy for one pair of pants

00:03:52.863 --> 00:03:55.985
is the same as the
energy for 1 1/2 shirts,

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.162
I guess I could say.

00:03:57.162 --> 00:03:58.569
So let me write it that way.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.664
So the opportunity cost of pants is,

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:04.941
for each pair, I'm giving up 1 1/2 shirts.

00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:08.078
And then, in the
opportunity cost for shirts,

00:04:08.078 --> 00:04:09.893
well, I could just solve for s here.

00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:12.158
If I divide both sides by 45,

00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:16.325
I get the same energy for
one shirt would be 30/45

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.992
of a pair of pants,

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:23.705
which is the same thing
as 2/3 of a pair of pants.

00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:26.810
And so I could write that
as 2/3 of a pair of pants,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.360
or, if I want, oh, let me
just write it that way,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.193
2/3 of a pair of pants.

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:35.720
So given the opportunity costs,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.564
what should each of
these countries focus on?

00:04:38.564 --> 00:04:41.537
Pause this video, and
try to figure that out.

00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:45.907
Well, let's first compare their
opportunity costs in pants.

00:04:45.907 --> 00:04:50.525
So let's first compare their
opportunity cost in pants.

00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:53.912
It is clear that country A
has a lower opportunity cost

00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:55.549
for producing a pair of pants.

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:57.292
It's only giving up 1/2 a shirt

00:04:57.292 --> 00:05:00.845
while country B is giving up 1 1/2 shirts.

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:05.097
So country A has the comparative
advantage right over here,

00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:07.180
so comparative advantage,

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:10.822
right over here, in pants.

00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:13.002
And so it should focus all of its energy,

00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:15.089
according to the theory
of comparative advantage,

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:19.472
it should focus all of
its energy on pants.

00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:21.079
And likewise, if we look at,

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:23.126
so here we compared this to this,

00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:26.626
and likewise, if we try to look at shirts,

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:29.431
right over here,

00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:32.046
if we look at their opportunity cost,

00:05:32.046 --> 00:05:34.740
country B is only giving
up 2/3 of a pair of pants

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.870
while country A would be
giving up two pairs of pants.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.118
So country B has the
lower opportunity cost

00:05:41.118 --> 00:05:44.058
or the comparative advantage in shirts.

00:05:44.058 --> 00:05:48.225
So country B should put all
of their focus here on shirts.

00:05:49.823 --> 00:05:51.930
Now, I know what you might be thinking.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.490
People can't just walk
around wearing only shirts.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.012
People might get cold below their waist.

00:05:58.012 --> 00:05:59.853
Or people don't want to only wear pants.

00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:02.423
They might get cold above their waist.

00:06:02.423 --> 00:06:05.468
And so how can people in these countries

00:06:05.468 --> 00:06:08.188
get the other type of garment?

00:06:08.188 --> 00:06:11.489
Well, the obvious answer is,
if they focus in this way,

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:13.233
they can trade.

00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:15.993
And what would be an
acceptable trading price,

00:06:15.993 --> 00:06:17.486
let's say, for pants?

00:06:17.486 --> 00:06:20.095
Let's focus on pants for a second.

00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:23.495
So if we're thinking about
the market for pants,

00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:25.100
so if you're country A,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.826
what would you be
willing to sell pants for

00:06:27.826 --> 00:06:29.409
in terms of shirts?

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:32.958
Well, a good price, so to speak,

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.014
would be something higher
than your opportunity cost.

00:06:36.014 --> 00:06:37.476
So A

00:06:37.476 --> 00:06:38.309
willing

00:06:39.655 --> 00:06:40.488
to sell,

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.892
sell pants

00:06:45.644 --> 00:06:46.477
at price,

00:06:48.332 --> 00:06:49.929
I'll put that in quotes
'cause we're really thinking

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:51.771
of price in terms of another good,

00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:54.929
at price greater than
their opportunity cost,

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:58.179
greater than 1/2 of a shirt.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.839
And you could think of this
willing to trade or sell.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:03.672
I'll put that in quotes.

00:07:03.672 --> 00:07:05.962
They're really trading
in our everyday language,

00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:07.163
right over here.

00:07:07.163 --> 00:07:10.122
And likewise, what about country B?

00:07:10.122 --> 00:07:10.955
Well, B

00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:12.718
willing

00:07:14.243 --> 00:07:15.808
to buy pants,

00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:18.490
they need pants, otherwise they
would just be walking around

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.916
with only shirts on,

00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:21.583
willing to buy pants

00:07:24.216 --> 00:07:25.133
at a price,

00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:31.883
at a price less than their
opportunity cost for pants.

00:07:31.883 --> 00:07:34.716
And so that would be less than 1.5

00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:37.820
of a shirt.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.780
So what would be a price that
is greater than 1/2 a shirt

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.940
and less than 1 1/2 of a shirt?

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.413
And really any price in between
these two values would work.

00:07:48.413 --> 00:07:49.892
Well, a nice round number is,

00:07:49.892 --> 00:07:54.467
well, they could trade at one
pair of pants for one shirt.

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:56.911
So a clearing price,

00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:57.744
a price

00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:02.106
that would work could be

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:02.939
one p,

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:04.652
one pants,

00:08:06.077 --> 00:08:07.637
for

00:08:07.637 --> 00:08:08.470
one shirt.

00:08:09.452 --> 00:08:12.338
And now, let's appreciate
the gains from trade

00:08:12.338 --> 00:08:14.372
that they would both have here.

00:08:14.372 --> 00:08:16.700
So let's imagine this
world where country A

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.804
is producing 20 pants per worker per day.

00:08:20.804 --> 00:08:23.596
But let's say they decide that they want,

00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:25.496
instead of those 20 pants,

00:08:25.496 --> 00:08:28.931
they would want to trade
15 of them away for shirts.

00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:30.780
And so they would get, at this price,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.435
they would get 15 shirts.

00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:35.210
So they're gonna give up 15 pants.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.597
They're giving up 15 pants,

00:08:36.597 --> 00:08:39.793
so they'll only have five
pants right over here.

00:08:39.793 --> 00:08:42.798
But they're going to get 15 shirts.

00:08:42.798 --> 00:08:44.718
So they're gonna get 15 shirts.

00:08:44.718 --> 00:08:47.162
And they're going to end right over here.

00:08:47.162 --> 00:08:49.598
This is where country
A is going to end up.

00:08:49.598 --> 00:08:51.137
And what's cool about this

00:08:51.137 --> 00:08:54.789
is we've gone beyond the
production possibilities curve.

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:57.736
So you see, very clearly,
the gain from trade.

00:08:57.736 --> 00:09:00.998
Country A could not have gotten
to this point on its own.

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:03.921
This is above the production
possibilities curve.

00:09:03.921 --> 00:09:06.281
Likewise, country B

00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:09.193
was over here, with 45 shirts.

00:09:09.193 --> 00:09:11.776
It gave up 15 of those shirts.

00:09:11.776 --> 00:09:13.308
It now has 30 shirts.

00:09:13.308 --> 00:09:15.796
But it now has 15 pants.

00:09:15.796 --> 00:09:17.229
At least some of the people in the country

00:09:17.229 --> 00:09:19.236
are going to be able to wear pants now.

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:21.349
So it now has 15 pants.

00:09:21.349 --> 00:09:23.471
Once again, it, too, is in a point

00:09:23.471 --> 00:09:25.635
beyond its production possibilities curve.

00:09:25.635 --> 00:09:29.064
It would not have been able
to get here without the trade.

00:09:29.064 --> 00:09:31.474
So they are both better off.

00:09:31.474 --> 00:09:33.994
So the key thing, the key
takeaway from this video

00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:37.226
is we now appreciate why
comparative advantage is valuable,

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:38.712
once again, making all the assumptions

00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:41.208
for these simplified economic models,

00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:44.309
because we can calculate
out opportunity cost

00:09:44.309 --> 00:09:45.908
from that comparative advantage.

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:47.596
And then we could think
about what's a good price

00:09:47.596 --> 00:09:49.141
that they'd be willing to trade at

00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:50.739
and see that when they trade,

00:09:50.739 --> 00:09:52.543
they both are able to get beyond

00:09:52.543 --> 00:09:54.961
their production possibilities curve.
