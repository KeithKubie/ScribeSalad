00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.850
Listening to radio lab radio from W. N y.

2
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.853
S. T. E. N. P. R,

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.060
<v 1>please enter your address,</v>

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.030
Colorado calculating route.

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.250
Okay, now I'm getting closer to him. Whew.

6
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.210
We begin our journey. The sour old are you? I'm 42. Oh Man, I'm 63.

7
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.930
This isn't gonna work. I don't know with this woman,

8
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.970
her name is Sharon Roseman. Okay. Enough of that.

9
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.970
And we're going to talk about a little but predicament. She got herself into.

10
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.580
Um, I was about five years old.

11
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.900
I lived in a small suburb of Chicago called Maywood,

12
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.130
Illinois.

13
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.130
And I was outside playing on the street or in a bunch of kids.

14
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.630
They were playing this game, blind man's bluff.

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.410
And she was the person who is it? Where's the blindfold?

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.360
And all the other kids try and scatter around and they have to freeze and then

17
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:11.150
they can turn to you and you can only hear them.

18
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.850
And the objective is basically to feel around,

19
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:17.810
follow the voices until you tag someone. Then they become it.

20
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.010
And that's what she does.

21
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.360
Everybody laughs because the person that I tagged as kind of the loser,

22
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.280
you know, cause they found them first.

23
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.430
So I'm playing the game and they took the blindfold off and suddenly

24
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.920
I didn't know where I was. I didn't recognize anything,

25
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.780
this horrible panic set in because nothing looked familiar to me.

26
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.020
Absolutely nothing. I just, uh,

27
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.430
I ran blindly just running, just to run,

28
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.700
cause I was so scared and I ran into the backyard of this house in front of me

29
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.170
and I saw my mother sitting in a lawn chair and I said,

30
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:04.370
why are you here? And she said, what? What do you mean? Why am I here?

31
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.660
I said, why are you in this backyard? Where are we? She said,

32
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.590
what are you talking about? We're at home. I'm in the back yard. And he said,

33
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.680
but this is in our house. And she said, yes,

34
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:17.720
this is what are you talking about?

35
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:22.250
And I couldn't explain it and I just kept crying and just kept saying,

36
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.600
I don't know where I'm at.

37
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.240
And your mother must've been very worried at that moment. Well,

38
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.020
unfortunately my mother said something to me that actually changed my life

39
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:41.030
forever. She pointed her finger in my face and she said,

40
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.270
don't ever tell anybody,

41
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.250
because they'll say you're a witch and they'll burn you. What?

42
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.020
Which I don't know. I don't know.

43
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.260
And from that moment on, it was my secret.

44
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.310
She realizes now that what happened to her in that moment when she was five and

45
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:06.670
playing the game was that her whole world had rotated.

46
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.790
The quarter turn a quarter turn picture where you're sitting right now. Yeah.

47
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.020
You would still be sitting in that same room,

48
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.380
but the wall that you're looking at right in front of you is now one wall over

49
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:23.590
to the right. Let me make it easier. If I were on the toilet,

50
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.170
say sitting there looking straight ahead.

51
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.160
[inaudible] is now the bath tub in a different place than it was before the sink

52
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.530
in a different place by about 90 degrees. Everything.

53
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.270
Everything in the entire universe, but just horizontally. It doesn't tilt or no,

54
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:41.860
it doesn't tilt. East West becomes north south, like in Colorado here,

55
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.940
the the mountains, the rocky mountains are on the west end of town. Right.

56
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.780
When this happens to me, they moved to the north end of town,

57
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.190
but everything else moves with it. So the first time that happened, did you,

58
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:58.540
you say you didn't know where you were yet, you recognize things,

59
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.810
but they just weren't where they were supposed to be or I didn't even recognize

60
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.160
them that very first time. I was so panicked. I just didn't know what to do.

61
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.120
Did it ever happen again? Over and over and over?

62
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.190
<v 3>I mean, I get lost all the time as you, but that's loose is different. Yeah.</v>

63
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.820
Before we go any further, let's just orient real quick. I'm Jad Abumrad.

64
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.010
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.

65
00:04:28.011 --> 00:04:30.050
This hour we're calling it lost and found,

66
00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:34.160
so I'm going to be experiencing the feelings like Sharon pat of being totally

67
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:38.690
lost and then that relief that you feel as Sharon will feel eventually of being

68
00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:39.710
totally found.

69
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.020
<v 1>Oh no, totally. Let's go back to her story. Did it ever happen again?</v>

70
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.240
Over and over and over.

71
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.350
She says this 90 degree rotation problem would come on in all kinds of

72
00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:54.740
situations. Sometimes even when she had her eyes closed.

73
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.390
But what saved me was that shortly after that first episode,

74
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.190
I went to a little birthday party and we were playing, um,

75
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.900
pin the tail on the donkey and they put a blindfold on me and spun me in

76
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:12.950
circles. You must've been like, oh man, you want to do that?

77
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.550
It was awful because after that first turn, everything did shift.

78
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.770
But then on the second turn, when they spun her around again, it fixed it.

79
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.240
Really? Yeah. Dizzy. That's so weird.

80
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:30.860
If I played a third time crazy again, so it's binary, it's like on, off, on,

81
00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:33.950
off. Sadly. Exactly. But I couldn't tell anybody that,

82
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.180
but now she had a fixed or temporary fix. So from that moment on,

83
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:39.530
anytime her world would shift,

84
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.180
I would go into the bathroom and I'd close the door so nobody could see me and I

85
00:05:44.181 --> 00:05:46.850
would spin in circles until it fixed it.

86
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.450
You spin and it reasserts itself correctly. Yeah.

87
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.950
And I still do that to this day, even in public stalls when she has to,

88
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.260
which can be humiliating because what would you think if you went into a

89
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.070
bathroom and you saw somebody,

90
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.060
somebody his feet going round and round and round.

91
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.540
In any case with this secret spinning techniques,

92
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:13.430
Sharon has sort of been able to get by. She got married, had three kids,

93
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.720
but when, when my children were babies, if one of them would cry out,

94
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.010
just cry out in their sleep. Invariably she'd wake up, Bang into a wall,

95
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.400
completely turned around. And then I would have to follow their cries,

96
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.890
the sound of their cries until I could find that their bedroom. Huh.

97
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.470
There was no explanation for that. I had to just say I was clumsy.

98
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.540
So you never told them? No,

99
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.790
and my husband didn't know and I'm not married to him anymore. But um,

100
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.310
and you can leave that in

101
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.330
<v 4>the point is she kept it a secret. But</v>

102
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.890
<v 1>one day when Sharon was 29,</v>

103
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.080
she was on her way to her brother's house and, uh, she got turned around.

104
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.650
So I called him from a pay phone and I said,

105
00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:59.240
I can't find your house.

106
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.970
She read them the names of the street signs and he said, Sharon,

107
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.230
you're like two blocks from my house. And I,

108
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:07.520
I just started crying and I told them the story.

109
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.000
He was just shocked.

110
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.390
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

111
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.320
<v 1>so he dragged her to the hospital and they saw some specialists and they kept me</v>

112
00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:23.250
in, um,

113
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.150
in the hospital for like a week doing every kind of test you can imagine.

114
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.310
And it showed nothing.

115
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.660
They basically told me it was psychological.

116
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.320
Like it's all in your head. Yes. Wow.

117
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.700
<v 4>And that you were the only one in the whole universe who had this problem?</v>

118
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.380
<v 1>Yeah, I thought, okay, I must be a witch.</v>

119
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.043
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

120
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.830
<v 4>Huh? I mean that, that's, that's just, that's a crazy story. Okay.</v>

121
00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:59.080
Just to pull out for a bit, after we talked with Sharon,

122
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.950
we ended up speaking with them. Well, if you've heard Radiolab before,

123
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:05.020
you probably know that voice. Um,

124
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.220
Jonah Lehrer then let me ask you like a question.

125
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.150
Jonah Lehrer yes, there you go. Jonah is a science writer and an author.

126
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.030
My last book was how we decide there's a lot about the brain.

127
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.720
And so we played him tape from the Sharon interview just to see, we think,

128
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.450
and he had an interesting take. Well it's, I mean it just,

129
00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:26.230
it just wanted these great windows into this talent we completely take for

130
00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:30.760
granted. Um, and, and you realize this is such sophisticated software,

131
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:34.090
there's so many different algorithms that are running that allow us to not get

132
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:35.320
lost in the way to the bathroom.

133
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.430
One way to think about this story he says is not why does Sharon get lost all

134
00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:42.020
the time? But why don't the rest of them exactly.

135
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.470
And a lot of this is brand new science. So we're talking the last three, four,

136
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.730
five years. But in that time he says,

137
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:52.420
scientists have just begun to figure out how brains make maps of our

138
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:54.250
surroundings from moment to moment.

139
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.480
They have identified at four different types of cells that make these maps

140
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:01.020
possible. Everything from place cells to grid cells to border cells.

141
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.010
Like can we go through ways? Cells? Yeah, no, no, we'll, we'll slow down. But,

142
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.430
but,

143
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.210
but all the cells come together to give us these incredibly rich messages.

144
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.390
All began to make more sense to us. When Jonah said, okay,

145
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:15.240
let me do it this way. I just took a trip into this office,

146
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:18.900
but I'm sitting in a radio station and let me do the same thing as I did it in

147
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:22.020
my brain. I got out of my car, I walked to the front of the building.

148
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:23.520
So I open up the door

149
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.890
and somehow some way my brain begins to make sense of this space.

150
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.360
First thing that happens. He says his little cells in his head called red cells.

151
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.070
Come on mind grid cells are pretty weird. I gotta be honest.

152
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.500
Before he's even taken the step into the building,

153
00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:44.890
these grid cells kind of like mappers are surveyors. They just lay on a grid.

154
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.670
It's gray. This matrix over the hallway right in front of him.

155
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.750
Unbeknownst to me, that grid is composed of equal lateral triangles,

156
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.180
[inaudible] triangles. Yes. It's pretty spooky. As I'm walking

157
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.780
down the hallway, I passed from one triangle to the next.

158
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.650
My brain is keeping track of exactly which triangle I'm in.

159
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.760
I pass it by a wall so some border cells go off.

160
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.260
Avoid the concrete road, just respond to borders, edges,

161
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:22.040
physical limits. I look to my right and my head direction cells change,

162
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.960
but then they changed the ActiveWoo hid directions l so there is a head

163
00:10:25.961 --> 00:10:28.400
direction neuron firing all the time when I'm facing.

164
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.150
<v 6>Get ahead. When I turned my head to the left,</v>

165
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.710
<v 4>that neuron stops firing. We have a new head direction neuron firing.</v>

166
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.790
<v 7>Now I'm back to the deadhead.</v>

167
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:43.610
I turned to the right new head direction on firing deadhead.

168
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.400
<v 6>These cells keep you oriented so you know where you are in the grid and now it's</v>

169
00:10:48.401 --> 00:10:51.430
time to fill in the details and this is where things get really [inaudible].

170
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.600
<v 4>Cool. Proceed down the Cardo as I take a couple more steps.</v>

171
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.660
Now my place cells are probably beginning to get active.

172
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.060
It's the aim here, sal. It's like for every landmark in the space,

173
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.040
each body passes by the brain will drop a little. Yeah,

174
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.700
it's like an, I'm here,

175
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.540
people here at the coffee table and then I'm here at the potted plants and then

176
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.800
I'm here at the door in the studio.

177
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:23.220
So now as I imagine myself walking from this little closet,

178
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:25.260
like space back to my car,

179
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.620
as I pass by the coffee table with the magazines that plays so fires now and by

180
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:35.060
the front door, that place all fires. Now I'm on the sidewalk, that place.

181
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.890
So fires, now I'm buying my car. That place.

182
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.850
So fires and when you put it all together, the place sells the grid cells,

183
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:45.930
the borders, hills, what you get, he says just a symphony of electricity,

184
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.470
which somehow is translated for me

185
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.800
into an idea, a space,

186
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.600
<v 1>and this whole neural symphony,</v>

187
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:02.170
it mostly takes place in a particular part of the brain. Hippocampus.

188
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.080
So if Jonah were to just hazard a guess about Sharon,

189
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.880
she should get her hippocampus checked out, is what she should do. Mimi,

190
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.950
you know, that's just a guess. Now getting back to that story,

191
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.670
even though I was 29 I was an adult, I had children.

192
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.490
The point at which we left off, Sharon had gone to the hospital,

193
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:19.660
gotten a bunch of tests,

194
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.050
and the doctors had told her that I needed to go see a psychiatrist.

195
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.880
I felt like a freak.

196
00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.813
<v 6>Hello.</v>

197
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:33.090
<v 1>But then one day years after that I was watching some TV show.</v>

198
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.350
Imagine scanning a crowd. It was a newsy 2020 type thing about face blindness,

199
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.890
blindness. People can recognize faces and at the end of the show,

200
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:45.130
the reporter mentions this website to the website. Sharon goes,

201
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.170
she was curious and when she gets there,

202
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:50.380
this little window pops up that asks [inaudible] she wants to take a survey.

203
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.730
So I thought, well, I'll do it.

204
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.850
And it was mostly questions about face recognition.

205
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.880
But as I got deeper and deeper into the questionnaire,

206
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.970
the question started turning more to have you ever experienced being in a,

207
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:07.981
a place that should look familiar to you but suddenly does not [inaudible] and I

208
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:12.540
was like, oh my gosh, that's me and asked for explanations.

209
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:13.750
So I was just typing away.

210
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:18.751
And typing away and eventually she meets the doctor who had finally d which her,

211
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.030
<v 3>uh, my name is Jeff [inaudible].</v>

212
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.270
I'm a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Calgary.

213
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.240
And do you have a strong sense of direction and I'm curious, I don't actually,

214
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.020
I am, I'm not a gifted direction like you know in guy,

215
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.933
but just that

216
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.540
<v 1>this idea that maybe just like face blindness,</v>

217
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.780
there could be such a thing as location blindness.

218
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:44.020
So he asked Sharon to go online and play this game so to video games like

219
00:13:44.121 --> 00:13:45.380
virtual reality,

220
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.570
<v 3>not like where do you have to shoot people and find people and Blah Blah.</v>

221
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:53.380
<v 1>The screen would be showing you these landmarks like a flower shop and bar bank</v>

222
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:53.870
bakery.

223
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:58.870
And then eventually I need it to be able to to say where things are with respect

224
00:13:59.181 --> 00:14:02.300
to one another. Well No,

225
00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.990
nothing man, not even a guess for me.

226
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.210
And it actually made me physically ill.

227
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.840
And then Giuseppe told her something before you, I'd met this woman,

228
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.700
<v 3>this lady who has complained about orientation and she also failed this test.</v>

229
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:19.060
So I brought her in to the lab and had her play the game in this counter in the

230
00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:23.140
MRI scanner in the brain scanner and we were able to find activity all over the

231
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:25.900
brain except in one little place.

232
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.650
We were not able to detect any increased activity within the hippocampus,

233
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.640
which just so happens to be the home of Jonah's little guys play cell order

234
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.120
cells, grid cells. That

235
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.860
<v 1>particular part of the brain and the hippocampus just never developed and at</v>

236
00:14:39.861 --> 00:14:43.880
that point that's when Giuseppe for the first time told her this thing has a

237
00:14:43.881 --> 00:14:48.881
name d t d for developmental topographical disorientation

238
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.620
and that's not trivial because when something like this has a name,

239
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:59.480
suddenly it's not your fault. I felt like I was reborn. I keep telling him,

240
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:04.280
you are my hero, you'll always be my hero. Have you ever met Sharon?

241
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.370
I mean face to face and we are, we are supposed to meet now in this fall.

242
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.880
What if you like to meet her and fall in love with her and then she gets lost

243
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:13.970
and you rescue her and the science is ruined but you get married.

244
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.470
I am already married. Okay. Never mind. But anyway,

245
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:19.730
Giuseppe's there,

246
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:23.780
he's got a couple patients and he's wondering how many other folks like this are

247
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:26.210
out there. So he puts up a website. We said okay,

248
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:29.090
we are looking for people who have this specific symptoms.

249
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.440
One year later we were basically dealing with 700 people.

250
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.310
Oh shoot. Yeah.

251
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.450
So he sets up an Internet forum where they can all talk to each other.

252
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:46.451
I'm the moderator and now Sharon corresponds with DTD suffers from all over the

253
00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:50.720
place. There are others out there who experienced the 90 degree rotation.

254
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.550
Oh, what about spinners though? Do you have, you've ever met at spinner?

255
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:56.710
<v 5>Okay.</v>

256
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.570
<v 1>No, no, no.</v>

257
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.253
<v 5>Okay.</v>

258
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.720
<v 1>Actually I should get some water cause if I love it. Oh here.</v>

259
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.810
Well there's one there. That one, that's fine. Then do another one.

260
00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:13.520
A few months later she did another woman named Sharon.

261
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:18.350
My name is Sharon Mitchell. The last name is m a C h. E. L rhymes with Rachel.

262
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.990
Okay. When this Sharon heard about the first Sharon,

263
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.760
she says she bolted straight up.

264
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.320
There is a woman in Colorado who has what I have and I,

265
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.490
it was such an emotional moment for me that she decided to fly to Colorado to

266
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:35.530
meet Sharon Roseman and they spent a day together. All right,

267
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.190
so let's just start with the easy stuff.

268
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.700
And they spoke with reporter Dave Vendor described yesterday. I mean,

269
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:44.840
what was it like to, uh, to get together yesterday and yesterday was awesome.

270
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.550
I got out of the car and we just gave each other a hug. And it was, it was,

271
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.700
it was a bond that I've never experienced with anybody else in my life ever.

272
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.510
No, we still don't know what's wrong with Sharon and Sharon and the others.

273
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.270
We certainly don't know how to fix it. But whereas before,

274
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.850
when Sharon and Sharon were lost and alone,

275
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.960
now they're lost and together this bond that we share.

276
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.240
So in a way it was wonder, it's like they're not really lost.

277
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.630
We sat down right away in the hotel lobby and started to laugh.

278
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.670
We couldn't stop laughing. Everything.

279
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.550
We were telling our experiences right away and comparing notes,

280
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:20.990
not even finishing our sentences.

281
00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:25.850
These things that we laugh at or things that nobody else would think was funny.

282
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:31.130
Like we sat there probably for 15 minutes describing how we were going to

283
00:17:31.131 --> 00:17:36.131
navigate from this hotel to the shopping mall that we could see right out the

284
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:41.210
window of the hotel. And we had to come up with some contingency plans. Yeah.

285
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.350
So we had, we had the gps if we needed it.

286
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:49.250
Sharon had a map in her hands if we needed it. We had street names.

287
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:54.530
We were just hoping that at least one of us was there instead of being messed

288
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:58.910
up. And so, um, we got there.

289
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.100
There it is. There it is. There it is weird. Most talks are jumping up.

290
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.210
It was really ridiculous. If anybody says,

291
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.410
and they have no clue why we were so excited that we found Nordstrom.

292
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.790
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

293
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:26.500
<v 1>big thanks to Molly Webster for producing that piece with us. And by the way,</v>

294
00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:29.560
you know the little kid's toy that's got a sit and spin oh yeah.

295
00:18:29.561 --> 00:18:33.100
Where you sit on it and you go in circles and you get dizzy. Yeah. Okay. Well,

296
00:18:33.101 --> 00:18:37.900
I want somebody to invent the, we're not being recorded, right? I mean,

297
00:18:37.901 --> 00:18:41.770
this is, we are, but it's okay. Okay. I want the big ass sit and spin.

298
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.950
That would be so helpful to me.

299
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:54.790
I could just get up in the morning and just get on my little big asset and spin

300
00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:57.160
and I could make my days much easy.
