00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
Guys welcome back today is an exciting day because today is the day that we are making rope with our homemade rope making machine

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.840
that we made out of very simple materials that I got from my hardware store

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.000
Hopefully its simple enough that you can make one at home as well,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.660
and today I'm going to show you what it can do.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.080
I've gathered up a number of different materials ranging from cotton yarn to sisal to dazzle twine, I didn't even know that was a thing.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.760
We're gonna put these things through our rope making machine and see what quality and variations of rope we can make today.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.940
And the coolest thing about this setup is theoretically, I should be able to operate it by myself.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.560
Let's see if that's really the case.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.760
So to start off our experiment today, I thought it would be fun to start with some of this polypropylene twisted mason line.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.220
Now the line itself says it's not made for any load bearing applications

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.820
because one strand by itself really isn't that strong.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.840
But the process of winding weak individual strands into one rope makes these fibers exponentially stronger.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.280
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.440
Now the whole idea of building the system the way I did is to automate the process so one person

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.840
by themself can make rope at home.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.260
Now in doing a few experiments preparing for this video today, I came across a few snags that affected the quality

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.900
of my rope

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.480
So I've made a few adjustments to this system that'll hopefully address those challenges

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.100
first thing i did was take a little bit

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.390
of sandpaper and stand out the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.920
individual holds and the rope make some

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.720
stops to make them a bit smoother that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.189
way the lines won't snag up when they

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.869
start twisting i also went down to the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.610
hardware store and found a little round

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.619
knob that i put on the back and the idea

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.850
here is that's going to reduce the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.890
friction so the top can slide a little

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.229
bit easier when it's ready to the swivel

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.549
hooks that i picked up have a tendency

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.320
to bind and they don't swivel as much as

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.729
I wanted them to so I just gave a few

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.920
shots of wd-40 that'll hopefully add a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.450
little bit of lubrication and get them

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.250
spinning a bit quicker and I increase

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.810
the weight of our counterweight by using

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.180
a larger water bottle so now we're ready

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.710
to make some rope and here's how we get

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.270
started since I've already got these

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.560
clamps hear what I'm going to do is just

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.659
tie a quick Slipknot and loop it over

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.490
one of the tops of the clamps there just

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.049
to hold it in place and then run the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.820
string all the way down to one of the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.079
bottom hooks I'm gonna start with the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.090
bottom left hook it's important that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.380
this string goes in between these two

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.810
guidelines and hooks on from the inside

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.750
to see why in a second now this line can

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.790
run back loop back around our post and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.229
we're going to do the same thing with

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.619
the hook on the right side we're going

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.000
to make sure the line goes inside the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.429
two guide wires up around the hook and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.509
pull it tight

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.610
one more loop around the back post and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.200
this time we're going to go over the top

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.540
of this unit and we're going to loop

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.450
into the top hook and run it back so as

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.799
easy as that all of our line has been

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.120
run so now we can disconnect it from the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.280
post travel up the line a little bit and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.810
we can just form a simple Slipknot that

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.799
will give us a little loose they'll

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.560
connect right into our swivel hook pull

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.920
that tight and snip off the excess so

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.440
slippery now from the wd-40 now if you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.250
look at the way I design this

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.540
road-making top here there's little

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.799
slits that connect to each of these

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.480
holes and that's what these strings can

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.359
fit up inside and be held in place once

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.319
they're in there they're not going to

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.359
come out and it's very important now

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.739
here's where it gets fun guys all we

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.090
have to do is take our slider and push

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.010
it to the back connect our drill to one

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.720
of the spare bowls pull the trigger and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.620
watch what happen

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.400
okay so looking at the quality of this

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.960
robe guys it's still not what I want it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.970
to be and I think that's because this

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.140
little ball that I put on the back

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.150
didn't actually get pushed it kind of

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.920
like bypass the ball and created a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.140
little not here so we take that ball off

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.120
I'm going to cut it in half drill in tap

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.740
a hole so we get kind of a half moon

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.480
crescent shape stuck on the back

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.710
hopefully that will help guide it a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.060
little bit better than this one did oh

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.490
don't tell me that glass oh geez dang it

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.460
i thought that was plastic so update

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.050
guys apparently our little knob was made

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.300
of glass i cannot cut it in half so i'm

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.260
gonna have to make one out of wood

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.660
instead it's only a fail if you give up

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.590
and stop trying the thing that turned

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.970
out pretty good for just hacking it

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.270
together

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.010
what bumper that has to work I can't see

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.570
how it wouldn't all right we're trying

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.799
this again guys but this time we're

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.450
using our modified would bumper at the

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.380
back see if that makes a difference

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:52.050
and stuff there we go look at that now

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.340
watch what happens if I release a little

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.720
bit of tension on the line here watch it

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.800
happen to the string all that tension

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.810
that was trapped in there comes right

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.180
out and now look at our rope oh my

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.210
goodness that is professional look at

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.940
that guy's so I think our little bumper

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.380
on the back there made a huge difference

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.360
it pushed it along look at this right

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.100
here does that not look like a

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.290
professional piece of cordage that is

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.290
absolutely gorgeous there's a nice piece

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.760
of three strands rope we just made out

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.380
of listed mason line now that's the

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.360
other stuff is really really strong it

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.060
can be really fun if not with all the

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.760
sweet smell of success update guys we

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.890
have just had some success this worked

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.420
with a pull the trigger and about 60

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.460
seconds of run time we just made

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.290
ourselves about a four-foot length of

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.510
rope now this still needs to be tied off

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.100
and cut but there's a very easy way to

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.390
do that now you're going to need is a

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.920
little bit of electrical tape a pair of

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.140
scissors watch this now take a small

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.640
piece of electrical tape and just wrap

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.560
it around a few times at the very end of

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.910
the rope where you want to cut it off

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.130
then go to the back end of the rope and

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.020
do the same thing now if your rope has a

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.430
few imperfections along the first

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.720
students is that's pretty normal that's

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.950
no big deal just come up to where it

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.780
starts looking good and wrap your tape

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.850
there instead this will be the beginning

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.890
of your finished rope cut the rope at

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.090
the back just where the electrical tape

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.380
ends and be prepared because that's

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.970
going to release attention and drop your

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.920
counterweight now simply snip off the

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.360
other end and you're finished rope is

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.450
complete these little bits here you need

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.890
to get rid of just pull your slider back

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.570
and they come right off the hook no

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.150
problem let's check out what we've got

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.540
nice piece of orange cordage I mean that

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.560
looks really cool guys that is

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.450
completely legit and this is one that

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.740
you can practice time your knocks with

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.320
and for example very quickly we can make

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.870
ourselves a little square not cool thing

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.610
about this knot is just like two loops

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.040
pull together well it's pretty cool

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.530
so great news guys apparently now we can

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.240
make a rope very quickly and very easily

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.160
let's change things up a little bit and

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.440
have some fun with color now one thing

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.700
going through my mind is if you put a

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.230
different color of rope on each one of

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.400
the strands and they're wound them

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.900
together what would the Rope end up

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.820
looking like let's try throwing these

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.410
three colors on and seeing how they turn

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:03.509
out

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:30.340
and stop I like this system so we just

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.870
turned three different colors of twine

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.270
into 13 stranded rope and if you look

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.250
carefully here you can actually see all

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.720
the different colors you can see the

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.849
pattern and you could actually follow

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:42.069
the line if you twist it you can see how

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:43.750
the color twists up and melds in with

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.580
the other ones that's really cool and I

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.110
think it's a good example of how the

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.210
ropes twisted and bind together now the

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.650
Rope is pretty spin but it's a lot

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.300
stronger than the twine itself and

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.680
theoretically you can make three of

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.210
these strands quite a bit longer and

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.710
wind them together to make an even

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.780
thicker rope as we kind of fun to do

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.240
we've got an orange rope we've got a

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.039
multicolored rope the next question on

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:04.569
my mind is what if we took some cotton

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:06.789
yarn and put four strands on each foot

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:08.590
how that turned out how's that going to

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.729
look let's go find out

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.000
three that rope looks great that is one

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.190
hundred percent cotton guys and that

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.029
looks profesh go fishing now run very

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:39.000
very tight I like it just for comparison

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.399
here's one i did with two strands to

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:43.200
hook and this is the one we did four

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.089
strands proposed not surprisingly it

00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:47.640
essentially doubled the size the guys

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.440
we've made rope out of cotton out of

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.050
swine out of twisted mason line for this

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.670
last experiment i want to go back to my

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.459
scouting ruth and try to ISIL now if you

00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:57.600
look at the package here it says this

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.339
only has a working load of five pounds

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:01.230
which really isn't that much but you

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.580
combine these things together in terms

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.050
of rope and their strengths goes up

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.820
exponentially the problem with this

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.290
stuff is it's got a lot of fibers that

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.670
stick out usually you need a couple

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.230
people to help pull the lines apart as

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.760
you're making the rope so I went down to

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.200
a local laundromat and pick up some wire

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.399
hangers to see if we could make a

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.529
makeshift spacer to do it all for ax

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:20.149
kind of looks like a car

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:49.980
cool wow it worked did it guys we

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.230
single-handedly made a nice length of

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.670
sie soll rope and this is really

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.110
nostalgic stuff for me because it takes

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.900
me back to my Boy Scout days this smell

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.339
the feel I mean this is the stuff that

00:09:59.339 --> 00:10:00.930
we used to make and to get all these

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.610
fibers off the sides we would usually

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.370
drag this to the flames of fire but in

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.170
lieu of a fire today I'm going to use my

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:14.160
propane torch instead mmm smell brings

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.470
back memories roads like this still have

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.940
quite a bit of tension wounding to them

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.800
so they need to be stretched they need

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.120
to be beaten they need to be worked over

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.010
time and they will soften and loosen up

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.410
and be a little bit more workable you

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.000
can make ropes a lot longer than this as

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.529
well just for fun I tried making about

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:30.180
20 foot lengths of rope because that's

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.380
as far as I could stretch it across my

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.910
living room but you could scale this

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.529
idea and go even longer as long as you

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:36.089
had enough spacers in between so the

00:10:36.089 --> 00:10:38.130
fibers didn't catch into each other we

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.350
now have the power to make rope at home

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.060
and this could virtually be applied to

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.710
any fibrous material you could use

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.720
coconut Hut you can use them you could

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.700
use string you can even use human hair

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.250
I'll be an interesting project limit so

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.780
I hope you guys try this making rope is

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.880
a lot of fun simple materials a great

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.770
weekend project so go give it a try

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.540

one talk to you then rope like this I

feel like we should go build a pirate

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.980
ship a nice big wooden ship hey guys

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.450
