00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:06.240
- I DECIDED TO PULL A PRANK
THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:09.009
A MASTERFULLY SUBTLE
AND CONVINCING PERFORMANCE.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.944
[Italian accent]
EXCUSE ME.

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:14.414
IS THIS THE CLASSROOM
OF <i>PROFESSORE</i> ROMER?

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.583
- UH, YES.
CAN I HELP YOU?

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:19.152
- YES,
I'M FROM MORETTI'S DRY CLEANING,

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.320
AND I'M HERE TO DROP OFF
YOUR UNDERWEARS.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.289
[laughter]
- I'M SORRY.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.125
YOU'RE IN THE WRONG CLASSROOM.
PLEASE TRY THE BURSAR'S OFFICE.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.493
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
<i>PROFESSORE.</i>

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.195
I'M IN THE RIGHT CLASSROOM.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.632
YOU REMEMBER, YOU DROP OFF
A PAIR OF UNDERWEARS WITH US

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:35.502
THAT HAD THE BIGGEST POOP STAIN
ON 'EM ANYBODY EVER SAW.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:36.970
[laughter]
- OKAY, NOW, LOOK.

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:38.539
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
SOME KIND OF A PRANK.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:39.973
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT'S WHAT WE SAID

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.842
WHEN WE HAD A LOOK
AT THESE UNDERWEARS.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.344
WE SAID, "SOMEBODY'S TRYING
TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A PRANK."

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.679
BUT IT WAS THE TRUTH.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.614
- AND--AND IT'S
A STUPID PRANK TOO.

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.816
WHAT KIND OF DRY CLEANER
WOULD HAND-DELIVER

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.819
A PAIR OF UNDERWEAR
TO MY WORKPLACE, HUH?

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.988
- WELL, THAT'S--YES.
THAT'S A--THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.356
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THAT?

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.624
- YEAH.
- WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHY?

00:00:57.658 --> 00:00:59.560
I GOTTA LAY MY OWN EYES
ON THE GUY

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:01.828
THAT MAKE THIS BIG POOP STAIN
IN HIS UNDERWEARS.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.063
[laughter]
IT'S A BIG POOP STAIN.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.299
- PUT THE PHONES DOWN.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.401
- YOU MUST HAVE HAD TO WEAR
THE SAME PAIR OF UNDERWEARS

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:10.070
FOR, LIKE, TWO WEEKS AND NEVER
TAKE OFF YOUR UNDERWEARS

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.371
TO MAKE THE POOP.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:12.840
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT,
PROFESSOR ROMER?

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.541
- I'M GONNA CALL
CAMPUS SECURITY, OKAY?

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.210
- THAT'S CRAZY.
YOU'RE CRAZY, PROFESSOR ROMER.

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.711
- DON'T SAY THAT!
- IT'S CRAZY!

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.379
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE,
