00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.660
So I'm here with Courtney Drake,
who's a product manager here at Udacity.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.000
So thank you for talking to us today.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.830
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.540
&gt;&gt; So the first thing I wanted to ask
was that, there's this perception for

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.210
online education that's very
disconnected and impersonal.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.610
And does that necessarily
have to be the case?

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.640
&gt;&gt; I don't think it does.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.530
And I would say that's something
that we have really focused on.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.840
Udacity is the kind of research and
our experience with students,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.190
that social learning is more
effective than not social learning.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.590
And so that's something that we have
really actually invested in quite a bit,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.350
especially this year.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.500
I think the challenge with
social learning is that you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.750
still want to preserve some of
the core benefits of online learning,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.570
like self-pacing and
students' ability to kind of

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.360
have their learning schedule be
flexible around their life schedule.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.130
So those kind of butt up against
the ability to connect students and

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.560
have them really build deep
connections with each other,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.960
when their are not really in
a synchronous environment.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.490
I think those are some
of the challenges.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.390
We focus on a couple of different
ways of integrating, Interaction,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.860
and collaboration into our
online learning platform.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.990
The first way is through forums.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.300
And through forums, we've really focused
on, how can we help students help each

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.560
other, and help them answer each other's
questions, and share with each other,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.740
and share with a broader
community of students.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.630
But it turns out that it
hasn't really been enough for

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.580
students to feel like
they are in a community.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.470
Especially,say, when it's a nano degree
community that 500 plus students, it's

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.350
really hard to feel like I"m connected
to those other 499 other students.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.610
So we've moved more recently
in addition to forums,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.160
is small learning communities
that we're calling teams.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.980
So when students sign up for
a nano degree,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.850
this is kind of rolling
out progressively.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.160
They get matched up with a group of
ten to 12 other students who they

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.859
then have a chat room with through the
course of their nano degree experience.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.840
And what we're hoping will
kind of happen through that is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.230
they build a personal connection
with those other students.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.655
And that's kind of their first point
of contact if they have a question,

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:08.650
is run it by my team members.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.420
If we can answer it ourselves awesome,
and if not then we're posting to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.870
the forums or going to coach support
to ask for support from Udacity.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.920
And we're hoping that will
kind of help with three

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.120
problems around social learning,
one is accountability,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.470
is feeling like there are other people
who care about my progress, and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.830
if I drop off that doesn't just
effect me, that effect other people.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.570
The other is just a level of engagement.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.460
I don't feel like I'm alone.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.900
And the third piece is if
I'm helping other people and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.750
I'm teaching other people,
I actually learn more that way.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.700
So having those connections where
we can kind of have a back and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.960
forth chat exchange,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.240
can actually deepen what I'm learning
if I'm the one who's the helper.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.890
I think that exactly what you just
described is something we try and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.470
create in our OMS classes, which we
do it on piatza right now at least.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.010
And I think we exactly try and create
that, is a lot of interaction among

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.220
students and very frequent interactions,
so that I feel like there is a community

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.430
here, present right now, and if I write
something I'm going to get a response.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Pretty quick and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.890
pretty targeted to
what I'm talking about.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.190
Another interesting thing that
happens in the OMS community is that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.340
the largest social community around it
is actually a student run community.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.750
It's run by several students who
created the Google Plus community.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.210
And I think that creates a lot
of interesting ownership.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.330
Because it's student run it's not this
kind of thing that I'm being handed and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.990
being asked to play by your rules.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.950
Is there anything we can do when
designing online technologies or

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.820
educational technology in general
to kind of allow room for

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.350
these kind of student driven
communities to emerge?

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so when we've
experimented with how do we help

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.730
students create small communities.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.230
And when we have just kind of
let them have a free for all,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.260
we found that they don't,
it's like some students start it, and

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.600
the really driven students will
start smaller communities.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.590
And it's really awesome
when they do that, and

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.520
we've seen some great interaction.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.500
But the norm is not,
I'm going to start a community or

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.140
I'm going to join a community on my own.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.530
And so we've actually felt like we've
needed to give students more structure

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.660
to form those communities.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.210
That's just why we have facilitated
this way of having them

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.680
join a team from the very beginning.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.160
We say, tell us you're availability.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160
We will put you in a team.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.740
And then let them go from there.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.400
So we felt like we actually
needed to create that structure.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.490
And I guess we'll see if,
how the ownership plays out there.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.430
And even when we've
experimented with that,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.960
saying we're going to actually
put you in teams together.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.920
We found that, unless one student really
steps up into some kind of leadership

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.810
role, they kind of fall flat.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.510
And so, where we've said, okay,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.300
how do we scale really solid community
interaction if we don't necessarily

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.210
know who those students are who are
going to step up into a leadership role?

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.530
And so, they actually see it
the idea for a guides program,

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.430
is what we're calling it.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.250
Where we're enlisting students who are
farther ahead in nano degree programs,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.010
who have graduated, to come back and
be a guide for our teams.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.040
So, they're coming to weekly
sessions with those teams.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.090
And they're engaging in chat with
those teams throughout the week,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.910
to really help them foster a sense of
community, and get to a point where

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.320
they're really gelling and can carry
themselves forward on their own.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.080
So that's something we've just started.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.710
It's pretty cool,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.600
because it is actually students who
are coming back into that fray.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.270
And it's actually really nice kind of
a motivational piece, to kind of say,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.110
look at this other student who is in
the same place I was three months ago.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.510
And look at all they know.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.960
And maybe they even have a job
already that I want to get.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.410
Eventually.
So it's a nice piece of motivation, and

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.200
it's also a way for

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.860
us to kind of have feet on the ground,
know what's going on.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.790
And make sure that those
communities are healthy and strong.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.230
&gt;&gt; That actually sounds very similar
to what we do in the EOS program,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.570
because what you describe
is very similar to TAs.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.940
When we solicit next semester's
TAs from this semester's students.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.870
And I think it works really nicely
when we have a big group of very,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.900
very good students who
are passionate about helping.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Who aren't just,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.220
you know,
crossing an item of a to-do list, but

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.660
really enjoy helping out
their fellow students.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps, one of the most

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.030
inspiring things about
the LMS program is that

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.030
we see a lot more of those students
who want to help each other and

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.160
want to come back and work on it and
contribute to the class.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.410
So yeah, it's been very inspiring
[INAUDIBLE] work nicely.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.570
&gt;&gt; So
one thing I've noticed also is that

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.460
we have a stereotype that online
education is impersonal, disconnected.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.240
And then, like you just said,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.975
that there are ways we can
actually compensate for that.

00:06:17.975 --> 00:06:18.810
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.700
&gt;&gt; But are there times when
the online environment actually makes

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.130
it even better than it could
be in person, do you think?

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.220
I definitely think that there are times,
for sure.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.810
And one piece of it is the geographical
reach that we get with online learning.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.420
Is that we have students who
are connecting from all over the world.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.040
And that's a really
powerful experience for

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.180
someone who has never done that before.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.370
And if you're all in the same place,
you don't get that kind of diversity of

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.330
perspective that you do with
a global learning community.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.840
So we definitely have that piece.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.340
The other piece is that if it's less
synchronous and people are running on

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.850
their own schedules, it means
they're kind of available whenever.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.020
We've actually leveraged mbile for
this with the team feature that

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.930
we just released where we have mobile
chat apps on both iOS and Android.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.330
So I've had this happen with my own
team which I'm participating in,

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.660
where I will be at a dinner or
something.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.030
And I see that my team chats something.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.330
And I can just pop back in and
answer a question.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.290
So they come ubiquitous.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.010
Nature of the internet,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.160
really helps students connect
more frequently with each

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.673
other than just if we're having a class
once a week or something like that.

00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:36.050
It keeps and keeps the communication
flow happening more easily.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree completely.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.760
I think one of my experiences being
an instructor in this program has been

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.840
that I can sign onto Piazza that we
use for our forums right now, and

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.330
in five minutes, I can interact
with ten different students.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And come back an hour later

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.320
and do it again.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.940
And in person you
really can't have that.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.520
&gt;&gt; Right..

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.180
&gt;&gt; That frequency of interactions.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.060
That kind of,
that perception is 27 available.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.710
Really changes what we can do and
how often we can interact.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.290
&gt;&gt; For sure.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.250
&gt;&gt; Well thank you so much.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.610
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
Hope it help.
