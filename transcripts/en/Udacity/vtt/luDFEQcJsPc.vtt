00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Of course it causes a new error.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If I go to my output for 100 steps, I find that the y value is between 0.7 and 0.9.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It really a lot of error.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Put differently, the robot oscillates a bit like this with a fairly constant

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
new offset error due to this bias.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Even though the bias was in steering, it manifests itself

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
as an increased crosstrack error in the y direction.
