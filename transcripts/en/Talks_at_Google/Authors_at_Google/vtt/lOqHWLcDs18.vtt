00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.750
MALE SPEAKER: Today with
us is Neil Davies, who

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.790
co-authored the book "Biocode."

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.550
The living world runs
on genomics software.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.950
Genomes can now be sequenced
rapidly and increasingly

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.570
cheaply.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.180
The genomes of large
numbers of organisms,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.060
from mammals to microbes,
have been mapped.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.010
Getting your genome sequenced
is becoming affordable for many.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.200
The ability to read
DNA has changed

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.840
how we view ourselves and
understand our place in nature.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.880
So this is a great book to
get into the meaning and uses

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.290
and all of the new advances
in genomics science.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.120
It was written by Dawn
Field, senior research fellow

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.120
at Oxford e-Research Center,
and by our guest today,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.610
Neil Davies, executive director
of the UC Berkeley Gump South

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.150
Pacific Research Station.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.470
Neil Davies lives on
Moorea, the sister island

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.720
to Tahiti in French Polynesia.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.460
He's the lead
principal investigator

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.530
of the Moorea Barcode
Project, a $5 million

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.230
effort to sequence DNA barcodes
on all known microbial species

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.400
on the island.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.610
Both are research associates
of the Biovidersity Institute

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.450
of Oxford, where they are using
their complementary experiences

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.430
to co-found the International
Genomic Observations Network.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.080
They have published
between them more than 140

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.560
scientific articles,
including in science, nature,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.840
nature genetics, nature
biotechnology, nature methods,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.650
and PNAS.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.504
PNAS stands for?

00:01:42.504 --> 00:01:45.045
NEIL DAVIES: Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:46.990
MALE SPEAKER: OK,
I didn't know that.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.300
And they have both
research interests

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.870
in evolution, populational
genetics, genomics,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.680
metagenomics, DNA barcoding,
bioinformatics, biodiversity,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.850
and data sharing.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.308
Please join me in welcoming
Neil Davies to Google today.

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:02.266
NEIL DAVIES: Thank you.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:07.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.570
Thank you very much,
and it's a pleasure

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.130
to be here just to talk a little
bit about our work, of course

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.200
to talk about this
book, which we'll cover,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.740
which really if anything,
is a homage to DNA,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.780
a truly remarkable molecule.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.830
Since the origin of the
universe and then the earth,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.950
DNA appeared, as far as we
know, for the first time

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.200
on this planet about
four billion years ago

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.390
and eventually led to us.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.850
And this had many
consequences and will continue

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.020
to have a lot of consequences.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.470
You can see what this
molecule has done.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.650
We humans have seen it from
outer space looking back.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.100
That is the phenotype, the
expression of this molecule.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.270
Because the Earth is really
fashioned to a large extent

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.720
by the activity that resulted
from DNA, initially from,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.770
again, as far as we
know, one single molecule

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.890
that miraculously
appeared on Earth

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.840
about four billion years ago.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.920
And we represent
continuous family

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.940
descended from that
molecule and the first cell.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.780
And then more recently to our
little tiny sliver of time

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.570
here in modern days, covering
this 300-year period,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.530
back in 1769 when
people like Captain Cook

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.120
was out exploring
the planet, and

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.115
the first coordinated
scientific global mission

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:46.940
occurred back then to
observe the transit of Venus.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.280
100 years later, DNA
was first recognized.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.577
100 years after that, DNA had
got to the moon, thanks to us.

00:03:55.577 --> 00:03:56.660
Or it took us to the moon.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.520
We took it to the moon.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.420
And 100 years from now,
we're suddenly already

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.620
in the Anthropocene in
that we, DNA through us,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.310
is really changing the
world in a major way.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.697
And we don't quite know what
2069 is going to look like.

00:04:12.697 --> 00:04:14.530
And that's part of what
I'm going to address

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.769
in this presentation.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.630
But there's lots of
technologies that are evolving,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.870
but our particular focus here is
the truly spectacular advances

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.940
of genomic technologies,
which of course go along

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.070
with the plummeting price
of what it costs now

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.220
to read DNA sequences.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.970
So you've probably
all seen these kinds

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.810
of graphs before
based on Moore's Law

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.730
and genomic sequencing, which
really obviously derives

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.740
largely from the
advances in computing

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.270
in the first place, which
has made this possible.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.450
It shows that the cost of
getting your genome sequenced

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.562
is heading down to $1,000
and soon below that.

00:04:58.562 --> 00:05:00.270
And the consequences
of that for humans--

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.530
we're going to be sequencing
ourselves, many times

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.030
over probably, and
some projections

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.920
of how many human genomes
may be sequenced by 2024

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.570
are in the billions.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.340
So again, this is the
usual exponential growth

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.710
in technology.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.770
But what are the impacts
of this going to be

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.560
on us, on our personal health?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.730
But also, because
DNA is universal.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.210
Everything living, as
far as we know, has DNA.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.120
And it's a standardized code.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.040
It's the same code.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.540
So whatever was developed
to read our genomes

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.150
works in everything else.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.410
So we're able to leverage
the advances driven primarily

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.320
by medicine, and we
can read genomes now

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.050
in every other species on Earth.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.055
And that's really in my
personal interest, is of course

00:05:46.055 --> 00:05:49.640
an interest in the health
of humans, too, but also,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.925
what about all the other
species, of which, of course,

00:05:51.925 --> 00:05:54.220
we humans depend upon.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.880
So our ability to read
DNA has advanced massively

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.520
but including up to
the point now where

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.970
we can start to write
that code as well.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.230
And this is in many ways
an even bigger shift.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.010
We can understand, we can
see what nature has done,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.790
but now we have this God-like
capacity where we can actually

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.835
potentially create life.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:20.180
We can certainly modify it.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.260
And that's the first time
in four billion years

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.007
that anyone else has been
shaping our biological future.

00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:29.840
So this is the first
time we can potentially

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.845
start a new tree of life
synthetically, which

00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:34.720
would be the first time
in four billion years

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.344
and in the universe,
as far as we know,

00:06:36.344 --> 00:06:39.770
the only other time that
that's been possible.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.620
So that should at least give
us a little pause of thought,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.960
the consequences of
that philosophically

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.285
as well as practically.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.970
So DNA is everywhere now.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.200
You read about DNA all the time.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.640
And has all kinds of
benefits and impacts

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.480
of what we can do with
this new-found capacity.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.120
So here's just several
articles showing

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.290
some of the applications of
DNA sequencing technologies.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.890
And they're obviously
far beyond medicine.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.840
Dawn Field, if
you're interested,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.910
follow her blog here.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.820
She keeps up to date on
some of these advances

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.720
from across these broad
range of applications.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.970
So I encourage you to
have a look at that,

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.080
at her blog there.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.590
But today I'm going to talk
more about specifically

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.980
about biodiversity genomics
and some of the work

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.370
that I'm personally
more involved in

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.210
and particularly how we take
this understanding of genomics,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.475
apply it to other
species, and ultimately

00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:43.370
to ecosystems to
really start to build

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.250
a computational model of place.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.050
I'll explain what
I mean by that.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.420
Essentially, you want to built
avatars, not just of ourselves,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.370
but of the places
we live in, so we

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.385
can perform some of the
scientific experiments

00:07:56.385 --> 00:07:58.600
that we need to be
able to do if we're

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.050
going to understand
how to manage

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.870
our ecosystems in the future.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.050
But of course we can't do
them in the real world because

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.926
of temporal and ethical
and other concerns.

00:08:06.926 --> 00:08:08.550
So we really have to
do them in silico.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.940
It's our only option.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.020
Like global climate
modeling, we have

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.120
to rely on computer models,
because we only have

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.450
one Earth to experiment on.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.000
So the Earth is, I think
Carl Sagan described it,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.920
a pale blue dot in
the darkness of space.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.569
And it is our island home.

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:32.610
And when we look at it,
we see this is an island,

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.860
and we really need to take
care of the island we live on.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.150
This view on Google Earth--
so I'm happy to be here--

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.530
is centered on Oxford, which
is where I'm originally from.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:51.000
And I moved in 2000 to
Tahiti in French Polynesia.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.710
And really, I have to say,
Google does fantastic things,

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.820
and Google Earth is-- everyone
says maps and seeing things

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.370
changes your perspective.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.940
I had no idea where
I was living until I

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.240
played with Google Earth.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.330
And so I was thinking,
oh, this is going

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.380
to be fun to see where we are.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.379
I knew I was in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean,

00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:14.460
but I had no idea quite how
big the Pacific Ocean was.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.920
And I think-- maybe
someone here can

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.460
test this-- what view, if
you send to Google Earth,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.250
where do you see the most ocean?

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.590
This is centered on Moorea.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.240
I suspect it's pretty close.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.640
I don't know exactly
what the point is.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.040
As an anecdote, I was
in Hawaii, where I lived

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.706
prior to moving to Tahiti.

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:34.330
But I went back there
a few months ago,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.240
and I was in a taxi.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.710
And the taxi driver said,
oh, where are you from?

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.222
I said, well, I live in Tahiti.

00:09:40.222 --> 00:09:40.930
He said, oh, wow.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.013
You live in the middle of
the ocean, huh? [LAUGHS]

00:09:43.013 --> 00:09:44.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.720
I was on Oahu, which
for most people

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.830
is pretty much in the
middle of the ocean.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.820
Anyhow, so the Pacific,
as recently described

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.820
in "The Economist,"
is a blank on the map

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.597
except for some little islands.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.680
But it's bigger than the
world's entire land mass.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.660
So the Pacific is a
pretty significant place,

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.590
even though for humans it's
been largely a blank, at least

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.280
for most humans.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.500
But the island of Moorea,
where the research station

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.470
is located, is part
of French Polynesia,

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.490
which is an overseas
territory, a country of France.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.480
It has five million
square kilometers

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.120
of exclusive economic zone.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.040
So it's a big footprint on the
Earth that's controled there

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.440
by French Polynesia.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.800
The island of Moorea
is unusual, in that it

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.730
has two international
research stations located

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:40.940
on it, UC Berkeley, also the
French [INAUDIBLE] National

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.550
Lab on the same island.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.975
So here we are located on
the North Shore of Moorea.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.210
And we formed a
partnership along

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.000
with a number of
other institutions

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.825
to really try and study this
island in a lot of detail.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:03.070
So the Criobe, the French lab,
has been there since 1971,

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.420
primarily studying coral
reefs, which makes these coral

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.480
reefs probably the
longest studied anywhere

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.670
in the world continuously.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.360
The Berkeley station
was established in 1985.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.160
So we're celebrating
our 30 years.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.250
It was donated by
Mr. Richard Gump,

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.210
who was from San Francisco,
Gump's department store.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.500
You may have seen it.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.250
And we've had a lot
of support from Gordon

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.700
Moore and the Gordon and Betty
Moore Foundation since then,

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.450
including building
the laboratories

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.210
and funding some of the research
programs I'll talk about.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.620
Finally, we now have another.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.080
Just off the coast of
Moorea is a small atoll,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.870
which used to be
owned by Marlon Brando

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.440
and is currently owned
by the Brando estate.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.040
And there, we have a
partnership with an eco resort,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.410
and we have a small research
station on this atoll.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.160
So we have a high
island and an atoll

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.930
very close to one
another, so two

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:58.119
very exceptional natural
research laboratories for work.

00:11:58.119 --> 00:12:00.160
So I'm going to just give
a little bit of context

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
on these islands, because
I'm going to come back

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.420
to them later in the talk.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.900
But as I say, we have
this scale of complexity

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.100
from a small private island with
a couple hundred people on it

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.150
to Moorea, 17,000 people.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.530
And it's a populated place
with agriculture and fisheries

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.830
and everything else
that a society has.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.810
And then next door
is Tahiti, which

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.105
has 200,000 people and
a jump up in complexity.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.930
The other interesting
thing scientifically

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.350
to know about these islands,
and this applies similarly

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.500
to the Hawaiian Islands,
they're on hotspot archipelagos.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.760
So you have the younger
island down here in the south.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.000
And as the Pacific plate
moves up to the northwest,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.480
the islands move
off the hot spot.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.350
And so they get older.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.600
So Moorea is a little
bit older than Tahiti.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.290
Tahiti is the youngest island
still close to the hot spot.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.340
Bora Bora up there
in the Northwest

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.620
is a much older island.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.059
So we have this
great time machine

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:02.600
ready to move back
and forth in time,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.010
say, what will Tahiti look
like in a few million years.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.220
Well, we can go up the
island chain and see that.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.736
And Hawaii is a similar case.

00:13:08.736 --> 00:13:10.800
So it's truly
remarkable for people

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.410
studying evolutionary ecology.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.139
Because we don't
have a time ship,

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:18.180
and we're working on these
kinds of times scales.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.285
Our processes take that long.

00:13:20.285 --> 00:13:22.410
So it's very hard for us
to do any experimentation.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.022
But here provides a
nice comparative setup.

00:13:26.022 --> 00:13:27.480
You couldn't really
ask for better.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.550
So that's Moorea today.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.660
Moorea in 3 million years is
going to look something like,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.624
which is, in fact, Bora Bora.

00:13:34.624 --> 00:13:36.540
And in 5 million years,
it will look something

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.130
like this, an atoll.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.170
The important part as a
natural system for study

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.940
is that we're at this end of a
natural biodiversity gradient.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.850
So the highest
biodiversity in the world

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.590
is out in Southeast Asia.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.000
This is marine and terrestrial.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.860
As you come across
the South Pacific,

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.590
there's a gradual
attenuation in biodiversity.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.240
Interesting, that also
applies to human culture.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.320
There's 900 or so languages
in Papua New Guinea.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.820
Once you get out to
eastern Polynesia,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.330
there's one clade,
one family of people,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.000
the Polynesians,
who have spread out

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.380
to 50 different ethnographically
described societies,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.890
from Easter Island, New
Zealand, up to Hawaii,

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.020
and Tahiti in the middle.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.550
So it's one monophyletic
group that's down here, so low

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.690
cultural diversity
compared to the West.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.140
And these systems have
gone through the evolution

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.130
that a lot of societies
have around the world.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.120
But the difference
is here the epochs

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.060
are very clearly demarcated.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.140
So the island arose in
the middle of the ocean.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.370
There was no one there.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.920
All the plants and animals
has to colonize that island.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.176
So there was a pre-human period.

00:14:42.176 --> 00:14:43.800
And then these are
last places on Earth

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.040
to be colonized by
humans, Polynesians

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.060
arriving about 1,500 years ago.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.641
So it's relatively very recent.

00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:52.140
Of course, when
Polynesians arrived,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.900
that was a huge impact that came
with plants and other animals

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.710
and insects and led to
a complete overhaul,

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.330
collapse of the system
and then a reformulation

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.460
of a new ecological system, so
an example of complex system

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.725
cycles.

00:15:07.725 --> 00:15:09.600
And then that reached
some kind of stability,

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.390
at least over the 1,000
years or so of Polynesians

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.790
there until-- and this
we know to the day--

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.900
until the first European
explorers arrived

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.260
in Tahiti in 1767.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.290
And that was also a massive
upheaval of the system,

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.930
mainly, at least
for the human part,

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.770
is due to introductions of
new biodiversity, new genomes,

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.610
in the form of infectious
diseases, which led

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.245
to a crash in the population.

00:15:38.245 --> 00:15:39.620
And then the fourth
one is really

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.390
when the islands were
connected to the modern world.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.390
And that started
in around the 1960s

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.880
with the first
international airport.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.630
And mainly that was initiated
through nuclear testing

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.820
that the French were
carrying out at that time.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.230
So each of these
phases really is

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.650
marked by a great
increasing in connectivity.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.770
And these islands
became less of islands.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.425
And of course today,
the big change

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:10.310
is we may be in the
fifth epoch, which

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.300
is driven by the internet.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.260
So a few years ago,
French Polynesia

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.059
laid a submarine cable
between Tahiti and Hawaii

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:18.850
for the first time.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.490
So now there's fiber
optic connection

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.190
to the Hawaiian
Islands, and of course

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.207
from Hawaii to the mainland.

00:16:25.207 --> 00:16:26.915
And so we have now
these two archipelagos

00:16:26.915 --> 00:16:29.050
on either side of
the equator connected

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:33.100
on a backbone of
fiber optic, which

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.380
is having social consequences.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.760
But for us scientifically,
this is a great thing.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.760
So now we're connected
to the rest of the world.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.580
And we can really
study these systems

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.420
and take full advantage of
supercomputer capacities

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.830
on mainland and instantaneous
communications, high bandwidth.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.260
So I'm going to talk in
a little more detail now

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.190
about biodiversity
specifically and how

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.120
it relates to ecosystem
services and genomics.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.610
So this is a new panel.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.340
You've probably all
heard of the IPCC

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.619
for climate change,
Intergovernmental

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:05.980
Panel on Climate Change.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.240
This is a new one with
a similar kind of goal

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.960
but focusing on
biodiversity, because we're

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.170
facing a twin crisis.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.930
We have climate
change, of course

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.740
by carbon emissions,
greenhouse gases.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.889
But we also are
losing biodiversity

00:17:19.889 --> 00:17:22.310
at a dramatic rate.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.109
And I think not
many people argue

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.810
that that's due to humans.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.600
We all know that human activity
obviously kills things,

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.020
sometimes deliberately.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.750
But through land use
change and others,

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.110
clearly we're reducing
biodiversity ourselves.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.570
And that is, in some
ways, much more worrying,

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.290
because that truly
is irreversible.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.780
Once it's gone, we
can't get it back.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.244
So at the research
station in Moorea,

00:17:56.244 --> 00:17:57.910
we have conferences
on different things,

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.940
too, including astronomy.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.500
And one of the
interesting things

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.940
I learned from a recent
astronomy conference

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.070
was talking about
the dark energy.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.533
A lot of that is not really
known, this 70% or so

00:18:11.533 --> 00:18:14.290
of what dark energy is.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:19.360
But astronomy physicists have
this really great clarity

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.500
of view and are far ahead of
us in biodiversity science,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.500
because that's how
it looks to us.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.695
We have about 1.2 million
species that are cataloged.

00:18:30.695 --> 00:18:32.330
And that's pretty good.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.420
But really, we're seeing
things incredibly fuzzily,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.964
because the vast majority of
species on Earth are dark.

00:18:40.964 --> 00:18:42.380
We know they're
there, but we have

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.780
no idea what they are exactly.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.720
So 86% of eukaryotics, of
animal and plant species,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.440
we know, or we
estimate, are still

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.340
out there waiting to be
just described, just listed.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.060
And at the current
rate, that's going

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.790
to take many, many, many,
many years, decades,

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.160
about 20,000 species a year.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.490
So we're not even getting close
to challenging this problem.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.310
And that's really literally
the tip of the iceberg,

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.605
because those are just
the animals and plants

00:19:15.605 --> 00:19:17.600
and eukaryotic larger species.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.320
Half of the biomass on
Earth are microbial.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.070
And who knows how many
species of microbes there are.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.180
And of course, as
we're learning now

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.200
through genomic,
metagenomic techniques,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.190
we humans are largely microbial.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.100
In some estimates, obviously
by mass we're mainly human,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.700
we're the foundation species,
but we're a walking ecosystem,

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.350
and only one in 100 of our
cells of our bodies are human.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.590
And even fewer of our genes
in our bodies are human genes.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.650
So does that change the way
we think about ourselves?

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.630
I'm still who I am.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:52.380
I'm still a human.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.890
But are the microbes
part of me, too?

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.684
Yeah, they are.

00:19:57.684 --> 00:19:59.600
Does that change the way
I think about myself?

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.308
I'm not sure yet.

00:20:00.308 --> 00:20:02.065
I'm still thinking about it.

00:20:02.065 --> 00:20:04.190
But definitely if we want
to understand our health,

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.560
we need to understand
the ecological health

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.440
of our communities.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.523
And that's one of the main
messages we try and get

00:20:09.523 --> 00:20:10.910
across in the book.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.270
We have to think that
we're all ecosystems now.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.910
And we need ecosystem thinking,
which medicine hasn't really

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.610
had to deal with in the past.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.550
So the idea that we
can study biodiversity

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.720
on Earth, which is
undoubtedly vitally

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.760
important to the health of
the planet and ourselves,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.780
just studying this little bit,
the vertebrates and the plants,

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.460
is limited.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.030
Or, as [? Bob ?] [? Robbins, ?]
who all through his slides,

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.130
[? says, ?] wrong.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.830
We really have to
look at the whole.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.015
Because a lot of the important
processes that are happening on

00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:47.140
the planet are being carried
out by these microbes,

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.330
including the processes
happening inside us.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.700
Fortunately, of course,
seems like we've

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.840
got an overwhelming task, but
technology comes to our aid

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.440
here and the exponential
increase in the DNA

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.910
technologies, particularly.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.100
What that's meaning
is that this challenge

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.894
of documenting, at least
in the first stage,

00:21:08.894 --> 00:21:11.060
and then understanding what
all this biodiversity is

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.990
doing before it disappears,
is possible now.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.590
At least we can hope to get
there, thanks to genomics

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:20.430
and, as I said before, because
DNA is a universal code,

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.020
thank God.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.370
If DNA wasn't, and we had to
do the code of the Human Genome

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.305
Project for every
species, we'd be toast.

00:21:27.305 --> 00:21:29.430
I mean, there's no way we
could get funding to that

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.550
for every species, right?

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.120
But it was done for
the humans, and now we

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.530
can apply that everywhere else.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.542
So we're really able
to piggyback on that,

00:21:37.542 --> 00:21:39.125
and it's not a
coincidence, of course.

00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:41.583
It's because it is the standard
code, because life did only

00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:42.140
evolve once.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.667
So we are truly all related.

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:46.500
And that's what's giving
us these new tools.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.458
We're not quite at the
point where you can just

00:21:48.458 --> 00:21:50.469
squash something
on your smartphone

00:21:50.469 --> 00:21:52.010
and you get back
all the information.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:56.010
But we're getting close, closer.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.370
An initiative here of
identifying one standard gene

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:03.280
region that if we sequence them
for a representative species,

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.040
we have a species name,
we can use that tag

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.430
as the identifier for
any bit of biomaterial.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.090
If you have the material, you
can sequence it very cheaply,

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.850
possibly even just squash
it on your phone one day,

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.700
reference a database, and get
back what that species is.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.230
So this is the barcode concept.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.400
The species are barcoded.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.760
But their names, again
very conveniently for us,

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.520
are written inside them.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.062
Our genomes are our names.

00:22:30.062 --> 00:22:31.520
They're our full
names, and they're

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.780
written in every single cell.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.200
So as long as we
have a cell, we can

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.010
identify what the species is.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.610
So it couldn't have
been any easier

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.490
for taxonomists in some ways.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.360
The answer is there
and are already

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.030
pre-labeled in all of our cells.

00:22:47.151 --> 00:22:48.650
So the technology
is getting better,

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.300
but there are some
incompressible,

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.560
or they seem to be
uncompressible, costs.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.540
So unfortunately, DNA
technology is very advanced.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.880
But we can't read
it from satellites.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.410
So to do things at
high scale, we still

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:06.800
have to physically go out
and get a piece of material,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.550
biomaterial.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.520
And these are just places
where you're trying

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.710
to do that from anywhere.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.370
That's expensive.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.722
Just the physical-- how
do you catch these things?

00:23:16.722 --> 00:23:17.930
And catching them isn't easy.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.695
They evolve to
avoid us, generally.

00:23:20.695 --> 00:23:22.070
So that's an
uncompressible cost.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.528
So it's still
expensive to do this,

00:23:23.528 --> 00:23:26.460
even if the sequencing and then
the informatics and processing

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.030
get to be very, very cheap.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.890
So we could potentially
sequence every species on Earth.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.300
It's going to take us a long
time, mainly at least because

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.132
of those collecting costs.

00:23:38.132 --> 00:23:40.090
So one thing we're trying
to do is fast forward

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.173
to the future of what would
it look like if we did

00:23:42.173 --> 00:23:43.920
know all of our biodiversity?

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.253
We can't do that for the whole
planet or even a country,

00:23:46.253 --> 00:23:49.160
but we can essentially do it
for a small island, a model

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.620
systems, as we've done
at the level of organisms

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.320
with model species like
the fruit fly or the mouse.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.530
We've really thrown
the kitchen sink

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:02.430
at those species to
understand how they function.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.420
So medicine, that approach has
been being incredibly powerful.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.830
We've studied both
very simple species

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.280
and extremely complex ones, us.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.420
And we've learned
a lot from studying

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.830
both of those at the same
time in a lot of detail.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.500
So one thing we're arguing
for and promoting in this book

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.710
as well is to take that
model from medicine

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:27.400
and apply it at the ecosystem
and the social ecosystem scale

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.360
in these natural laboratories.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.240
And it's really taking
the systems approach

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.230
that's been developed in
biology, systems biology,

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:41.680
for medicine, the sort of P4
approach, which is Predictive,

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:48.685
Preventative, Participatory, and
apply that to sustainability.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.850
We have to just in
Personalizing it,

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.530
the fourth P, for ourselves,
everyone's different,

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.700
and we want to
understand ourselves

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.420
at the individual level in order
to predict and then prevent

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.965
disease as it comes along.

00:25:05.965 --> 00:25:08.090
But to understand ourselves,
we also have to share.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.920
It has to be participatory.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.890
Because I might have a
sequence of my genome,

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.580
but I can't say too much about
what that will do unless I

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.540
can compare it with others.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.010
So we have to participate
with each other

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.390
and get involved in
the science ourselves.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.310
And that's the same at
the ecosystem scale.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:27.700
Every system is completely
unique and different,

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.080
but it shares
commonalities with others.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.970
So we need to participate,
share, but also personalize

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.150
and develop a predictive
approach, which

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.440
is very intensive.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.760
So how do we go
about doing this?

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.870
So we're proposing this
sustainability science

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:52.040
approach, which explicitly
models itself on what's

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.280
been done in medicine.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.697
Of course, we're having these
big impacts on the planet.

00:25:57.697 --> 00:25:59.530
This isn't quite what
it looks like outside,

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.280
but it probably will do
in a couple of hours.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:09.740
So we're having a big impact,
and we can see that everywhere.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.447
So this is a Pacific
island, so very far away

00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:14.280
from that kind of
traffic, although Honolulu

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.990
has a lot of traffic, too.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.820
But even out in the
middle of the Pacific,

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.620
we can pick up this signal.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.320
Of course, the
famous observations

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.420
from [INAUDIBLE] on the
concentration of carbon

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.160
dioxide, you see the
planet breathing here,

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.930
but it's going up.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.910
So we're having impacts even
in these most remote islands,

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.800
which is showing that
through global change,

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.530
nowhere is pristine anymore.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:42.379
Everywhere is impacted
by human activities.

00:26:42.379 --> 00:26:44.920
So whereas in the past we could
manage things locally and not

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.620
have to worry about what
everyone else is doing, now

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.624
even if you're living
out where I live now,

00:26:49.624 --> 00:26:51.790
you have to worry about
what everyone else is doing,

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.890
because even if you're
perfectly managing your system,

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.795
you're being driven from
outside forces, to which you

00:26:58.795 --> 00:27:00.910
have to respond.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.776
So we need a
sustainability science

00:27:03.776 --> 00:27:06.320
that is theoretically
interesting and challenging

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.277
but is also very applied.

00:27:08.277 --> 00:27:09.360
It needs to be actionable.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.670
We need to come up
with recommendations

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.540
for how do we manage, how
do we adapt to change,

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.390
and how do we mitigate the
changes, if that's possible.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:23.770
And that has to happen at
all these different scales,

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:26.232
At the global scale, certainly.

00:27:26.232 --> 00:27:27.690
Unfortunately, on
the global scale,

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.000
we have limited
governance capacity.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.070
At national scales, we have
a lot more levers to pull.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.869
But also right
down to what people

00:27:35.869 --> 00:27:38.160
really care about is what's
happening in your backyard,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.290
how is this impacting me, which
why all politics is local.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.790
But that's also true of
a lot of these processes.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.520
They're happening at a
local scale, albeit driven

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.410
by global processes.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.996
So the systems approach needs
to be both planet down--

00:27:54.996 --> 00:27:56.370
for example, here
we have to look

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.200
at how is the ocean
becoming more acidic?

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.570
So that's happening worldwide.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.530
It's a worldwide phenomenon
driven by worldwide processes.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:08.450
But if we want to understand
how the natural world

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.150
and how societies
are going to respond,

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:11.820
we need to look at
that more locally,

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.360
and even to the genome.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.812
So for example,
in corals, of you

00:28:15.812 --> 00:28:18.020
want to know what's going
to happen to corals because

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.980
of ocean acidification, we have
to look at the calcification

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:21.510
process.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.760
How does that work?

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.100
What genes are involved?

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.270
Do the corals have
any genetic variation

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.710
that enables them to
respond to different levels

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.370
of acidification and
continue to grow?

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.690
But that we have to understand
at the genome scale and all

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.000
the scales in between.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.880
So it is the massive challenge.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.000
We have to go from
here, molecule,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.520
genome, particularly up,
all the way to the planet,

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.934
and understand how these
things all interact.

00:28:53.934 --> 00:28:55.100
I mentioned the astronomers.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.140
So this is pretty big.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.200
But we probably don't need
to do too much astronomy,

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.040
necessarily, although
the planets certainly

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.350
are impacting us as well.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.936
And do we need to go
to subatomic particles?

00:29:07.936 --> 00:29:09.560
I don't know-- probably not.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:15.270
But still, that leaves us
with a vast swathe to study.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.950
So at the global scale,
there are initiatives.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.070
This is the Group on
Earth Observations trying

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:25.910
to coordinate how we observe the
planet, including biodiversity,

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.970
weather patterns, climate,
physical processes.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.240
And at the genomic
level, we've launched

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.910
a Genomic Observatories
Network, which

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.139
is partly under GEO,
and applying standards

00:29:39.139 --> 00:29:40.680
for how we do this
so we can actually

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.040
compare the data that we're
observing in the field.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.790
Because [? either ?]
we can get sequences,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.120
and there are lots and lots
of sequences now in GenBank.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.680
What's crucial to take
advantage of those sequences

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.570
is the context, the
information about where

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.965
those sequences came from.

00:29:57.965 --> 00:29:59.590
And a lot of them
initially didn't even

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.440
have the time and a place.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.660
And there's very little we can
do with both types of sequences

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.010
without those data.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.142
And then there's all kinds
of other contextual data

00:30:09.142 --> 00:30:10.600
that we need to
have if we're going

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.100
to make those sequences useful.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.140
So because there is a cost
of collecting the sequences

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.730
and there's a cost
to analyzing them

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.260
and all of the contextual
data has much more value

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.960
if they have a rich
context, we want

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.290
to study these,
focus this sequencing

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:32.340
effort in places that are very
well studied across all levels.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.260
And it has to be
focused, because it's

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.770
expensive to do this
at a high density.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.170
So this is an example
from our site.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.294
This is part of a network.

00:30:42.294 --> 00:30:44.460
The National Science
Foundation in the United States

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.560
funds long-term
ecological research sites,

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.880
which are 25 sites
funded by the NSF,

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.940
which are a focused effort
on those places over decades.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.520
So places like that
is where we can

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.340
focus these genomic
observations where

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.150
we know, then, they will be
embedded in this very, very

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.145
rich context.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.690
And our challenge-- let's
click through those--

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.060
is how to integrate across
all of these different data

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.330
sets to address
specific processes.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.750
So I mentioned
there are a number

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.540
of these sites around the world,
and we formed this network

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.700
trying to work together.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.230
The genomic technologies
are evolving so fast,

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.460
there's a lot of the
participatory part, sharing

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.580
what works, what doesn't
work, because we're

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.140
building a genomic observatory,
layering it into studies that

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.540
give it the historical context.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.090
How did we get to
this point today?

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:40.020
So we need the archaeological,
paleoecological work.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.720
The environmental
observatory-- what's

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.770
the environmental context
of those sequences?

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:49.340
Ecological-- the classical
part of counting birds and fish

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.790
and butterflies.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.990
But also social-- what are
humans doing in that system?

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.400
Like I said before, we
can't ignore humans anymore

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.710
in natural systems where we're
key drivers of those systems.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.330
So we have to layer these
genomic observations

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.400
at these various levels.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.050
And these observatories could
be at the scale of single--

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.490
sometimes they're a buoy
that's intensively monitored,

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:17.190
just a point.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.200
It's obviously a
very open system,

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.740
an ecosystem not really, maybe.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.700
People-- we're monitoring
our microbiome.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.860
So in a sense, some of
us, some of the best

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.070
studied people are becoming
genomic observatories,

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.590
looking at how their microbiome
and how their genome changes

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.940
during their lifetime.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.570
That's a form of
genomic observatory.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:38.500
There's work going on in
buildings like a hospital,

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.690
starting from scratch as
the hospital is built.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.220
How is it colonized by
different microbes over time?

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.120
How does that
affect the patients?

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.180
Forests are being studied,
whole river basins, up

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.610
to complete land masses,
small ones or larger ones,

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.800
and then ultimately the planet.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:03.160
So one of the first
actions of this-- these

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.060
are both making
genomic observations

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.230
at a very local scale to
address local questions.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:12.900
But also globally, we can start
to coordinate those and fashion

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.040
a global observatory.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.940
And we did this under a
project called Ocean Sampling

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.480
Day, which was an
attempt to find out,

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.490
can we task the world to make a
coordinated genomic observation

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:30.420
using the same protocols at
the same time on the same day?

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.079
Like you would if you had
a telescope or something--

00:33:33.079 --> 00:33:34.370
we want to run this experiment.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.920
Can we do this?

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.210
So that we did it last year.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:41.890
180 sites around
the world went out

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.570
and did exactly the same
thing on the same time.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.220
And it was from
Antarctica to the tropics

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.860
in all these kind of
different sort of conditions.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.960
And it was done remarkably
cheaply, on a shoestring,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.000
basically, because
we could leverage

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.500
all of these places
that have boats,

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.051
that have people, that have
labs that are already out there.

00:33:59.051 --> 00:34:00.800
They just need
coordination, and we can go

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.372
and start doing the same thing.

00:34:02.372 --> 00:34:04.080
"Just" I say, because
it's a lot of work.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.520
But the infrastructure exists.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.800
If we want to tool it up for
something, we can use it.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.170
So the question is, what
would we do with this capacity

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:13.940
that we have?

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.730
And it's just an
emerging capacity,

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:19.860
which we're realizing for the
first time we have the ability

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.840
to apply.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:30.110
So now I'll switch a little
bit to how we use genomics

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:34.300
at these places and
following our roadmap here

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.219
from systems biology.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.540
If we want to understand a
system from the genome up,

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.590
one of the first things
you need to do is ask,

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:44.610
what's in the system?

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:45.991
What are the parts?

00:34:45.991 --> 00:34:47.449
As I mentioned
before, biodiversity

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.630
is a real challenge,
because we have no idea.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.120
It's like you're trying
to study a car engine

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.502
and you've only got a bit
of the front headlight

00:34:54.502 --> 00:34:56.210
and then the rear view
mirror, and you're

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.620
trying to figure out
how this car operates.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.460
So that's a big
limitation, and we

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.410
had this project, which was
the Biocode Project, which

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.510
started on Moorea,
the goal of which

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.690
was to sequence one
example, at least,

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:14.350
of every species of
animal, plant, and fungi

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.100
as possible from the entire
system, from the coral reefs

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.220
about 150 meters down to 1,200
meters up on the mountaintop.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.820
This was funded by the Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.680
and involved many,
many scientists

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.040
from a lot of institutions
around the world,

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.610
led by the ones listed here.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:36.514
Then, collecting
biodiversity is messy.

00:35:36.514 --> 00:35:38.430
There's a reason why
it's called biodiversity.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.230
It's diverse.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.040
There are all kinds
of variations.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.820
So out there it's very variable,
and the collection methods, you

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:50.210
need specialists who know how
to go and catch these critters.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:53.150
They can involve going up
at night to the mountaintops

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.890
or deep down diving
down to 150 meters

00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:00.190
on the outer slope of the reefs.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:03.500
So that's the cost part.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.827
And then you collect
all of these organisms,

00:36:05.827 --> 00:36:07.910
then come back to the lab,
and they look something

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:11.860
like this, this explosion
of tubes and taking

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.930
digital photographs
of everything, trying

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:16.280
to link the photographs to
make sure it all stays linked

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.910
to the specimen in the
tube, which will eventually

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.270
lead to a DNA sequence.

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:24.270
Of course, the sequencing
was being done mainly

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.645
at the Smithsonian
in Washington,

00:36:25.645 --> 00:36:28.170
so those sequences
get appended later

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.106
to these data, all
the while retaining

00:36:30.106 --> 00:36:31.480
all of the contextual
information

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:36.350
about where that sample came
from in the natural world.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:39.731
So it's a complete explosion
of data carried out

00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:41.730
by different people coming
from different times,

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:45.249
from different institutions
and different countries.

00:36:45.249 --> 00:36:46.790
Most of the work
flow, though, starts

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.930
with this single
collecting event.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.540
It has to be
isolated from nature.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.270
And everything really
hangs off that.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.530
But even before that,
you need to get a permit.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.190
Genetic resources these
days are valuable,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.060
and they are
increasingly regulated.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.400
So that's a part that
can't be forgotten.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.370
But then it generates
from that one event.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.410
There's this cascade as
you get many specimens.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:10.470
Those are photograph
they get sub-sampled

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:13.510
into different tubes, sent
off to different labs,

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.460
and sequenced.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.380
And then all those data get
stored in different places

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.410
around the world.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:22.420
And some of those are
physical specimens.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.490
Many of them are
digital data items.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.154
So how do we keep
track of all these

00:37:28.154 --> 00:37:29.570
and keep them all
linked together?

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.850
And they're all going
to different places.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.900
I'm not going to go into
that, because that's

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.640
a informatics challenge that
at once seems quite simple,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.140
and it is.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.267
The technologies all exist.

00:37:40.267 --> 00:37:41.850
It's more of a
sociological challenge,

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:45.190
because it's very, very
hard to enforce this.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:49.489
So we can actually
reconstitute the data,

00:37:49.489 --> 00:37:50.780
in this case about this island.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.860
And it's a very
massive challenge.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.220
And it really involves
applying unique identifies

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.790
to all of these objects,
which again, sounds simple,

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:04.450
but in reality it's very
hard to make happen.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:08.336
Having done that, if you've
got all your list of parts,

00:38:08.336 --> 00:38:09.460
that's just the first step.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.680
How are they interacting
with each other?

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.150
That's really
what's interesting.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.690
That's kind of the exciting
part, for us as ecologists,

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:16.800
at least.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.880
And that's pivoting
now, as Chris Meyer, who

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.380
directed this project at
the Smithsonian, calls it.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.790
We're going from an inventory,
which is going out and finding

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.010
things and grinding them
up and sequencing them,

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.510
to an approach which is
more observatory over time.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.280
We've got the
reference database.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.690
Now we're actually
going to reverse.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.880
We grind them up, and
then we sequence them,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.820
blast them against our reference
database, and see what we got.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.290
This we can do at high volume.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:45.350
So we're trying to yank this
science into a science that's

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:49.791
high throughput, which is really
what revolutionized biology,

00:38:49.791 --> 00:38:51.540
cellular molecular
biology, is the ability

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.870
to get to high throughput
data generation.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.690
Ecology is still painfully slow.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:56.540
It's hard.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.956
But we're getting to the point
with these new technologies

00:38:58.956 --> 00:39:01.210
where we have a
reference database now.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:04.540
We have these DNA tags.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.510
They're like the license
plates on your car, right?

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.473
So now what we need
to decide is, well,

00:39:09.473 --> 00:39:12.230
where do we put the toll booths
to read these license plates?

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.740
And that's an
ecological question.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.110
How do we understand
who's where in the system,

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.642
who are they with?

00:39:18.642 --> 00:39:20.100
And potentially
who are they eating

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.230
so we can get at things
like the food webs.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.100
Because we can look in the guts.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.170
We can look at plankton trawls.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.634
Because we can just grind
things up and blast it,

00:39:28.634 --> 00:39:29.550
sequence and blast it.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.870
And that part's pretty easy.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.350
So it can be done
at high throughput.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.410
And looking at
these interactions,

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.025
so for example, now we
can get these DNA tags.

00:39:39.025 --> 00:39:40.260
We can look at gut contents.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:44.080
It gives us a whole new view,
so some of this work Chris Mayer

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.390
did with other
partners shown here.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.770
Just as a test, we had
this one cubic foot,

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.460
which our National Geographic
photographer David Littschwager

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.380
photographed, which there was
a display here a couple years

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.140
back.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:01.720
But can we build a food web
of all of these individuals

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.630
that he found in
this one cubic foot

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:07.360
on the coral reef of Moorea?

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.570
And so they did that.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.230
So this is what we think all
of those different individuals,

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.729
how they might
relate to each other.

00:40:13.729 --> 00:40:16.240
You can collapse that down
and say, well, some species

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.684
eat the same thing,
so we'll just

00:40:17.684 --> 00:40:18.850
collapse that into one node.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.960
It makes it easier to
study for one thing.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.100
But we think they're
doing the same thing.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.380
Here are two species of
fish that were collapsed

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.072
into one of those nodes.

00:40:30.072 --> 00:40:31.530
And then we can
start to test that.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:37.450
So we take these guts from these
fish, or rather this team did,

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:38.757
look at what's in those guts.

00:40:38.757 --> 00:40:40.590
Obviously they're hard
to identify visually,

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.410
so the genetics is really
the only way to get at it.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.074
But what we see here is that
these two fish actually eat

00:40:46.074 --> 00:40:47.240
completely different things.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.470
Or at least those
individuals have.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.652
So we were wrong.

00:40:50.652 --> 00:40:52.860
Just because they look like
the same fish hanging out

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.230
in the same place, probably
eat the same thing,

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:59.230
they seem to be much more
specialized than we thought.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:02.230
And we can do the same thing
for birds and other organism.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:05.280
So we start to build
up the interactome,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.170
all the interactions of
this system with evidence,

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.110
or at least relatively
direct evidence if it's

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.359
found in the gut of something.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.155
And this is sort of part
of a broader revolution,

00:41:19.155 --> 00:41:22.190
I would say, in the way
we're looking at ecosystems.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:25.945
And this is work largely drawing
on Tom Whithams' group who work

00:41:25.945 --> 00:41:28.825
on cottonwoods out in Arizona.

00:41:28.825 --> 00:41:34.680
And what they've found is that
the genotype of a foundation

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:39.290
species like a tree, the
variation within the species

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.620
among individuals,
the genetic variation,

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.490
turns out to be
incredibly important

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.410
for ecosystem-scale functions.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:49.900
So treating two
species as if they're

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.140
doing the same thing
in the ecosystem

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.700
is probably a
dangerous thing to do.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:58.680
But even saying that species is
all the same is also dangerous.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.805
So when Tom and colleagues
looked at these trees,

00:42:01.805 --> 00:42:03.430
they found, for
example, the difference

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:06.484
in elevation of 100 meters or
so can have different genotypes

00:42:06.484 --> 00:42:08.900
of tree, which when you put
them in a common garden, which

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.850
is what forestry [INAUDIBLE]
have been doing for decades

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.750
but not really focused
on natural systems,

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.420
when they put them
in common gardens,

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:21.050
whoa-- the ones that are 100
meters higher don't do so well.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.050
And that has all kinds
of knock-on effects also.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.440
This tree, Whitham's group
found that the tree also

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:33.070
has a characteristic set of
insects and bacteria and fungi

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:37.240
and even birds that are linked
to the genotype of the tree.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.840
So trees of the same species
with different genotypes

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.730
have different communities.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:44.520
So there's an extended
phenotype of the tree,

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.260
a community-level genomics.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.045
So understanding the genomic
variation within species

00:42:52.045 --> 00:42:54.660
can be crucially important,
particularly if they're

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.900
foundation species, like trees,
on which a lot of other things

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.540
depend.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:04.790
And the trees have different
variability at elevations.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:07.180
That's reflecting
environmental adaptation.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:11.420
So what they've shown, too,
is that if you replant trees

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.260
in restoration
projects, that you're

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.776
planting the wrong genotype.

00:43:14.776 --> 00:43:16.150
And often we try
and plant what's

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:19.080
local because we're scared
of invasive species.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.670
And we plant the local
type tree here locally,

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:23.940
because that's good.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.330
That could be very bad.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.400
It could be good
in a stable world,

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.582
but in a world of rapid
environmental change,

00:43:29.582 --> 00:43:31.790
you spend millions and
millions of dollars replanting

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.192
your forest, in 20 years
time, those trees won't

00:43:34.192 --> 00:43:35.900
[? slide there ?]
anymore because they're

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.252
the wrong genotype.

00:43:37.252 --> 00:43:38.710
You should have
gone further south,

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:42.850
picked up ones 1,000
kilometers further south.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:45.350
That genotype will respond
to the future climate

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.572
in your locality.

00:43:46.572 --> 00:43:49.030
But for that, we need to have
a sophisticated understanding

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:52.040
of genomic variation,
climate, and what's happening

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.010
in the future climate.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:55.770
And some of these
certain corals, it's

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.310
likely to be the same.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.600
We're beginning-- the
first genome sequence

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.090
for a tree was the cottonwood.

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:04.100
That's partly how
Whitham's group were

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.610
able to advance so rapidly.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.310
Also on land, this
is traditionally

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.640
done, common garden approaches.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.020
Corals are the foundation
species of coral reefs,

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.220
and we're finding the
variation among corals

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.890
is likely to have similar
kinds of consequences.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.800
So if we're going to really
be able to preserve variation,

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.415
we might have to think of
things like assisted migration.

00:44:25.415 --> 00:44:27.540
These species are not going
to survive on their own

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.520
if there's not enough
genetic variation where

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.915
they are unless we introduce
types that are able to survive.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:42.040
So I'm going to finish up there
with a consideration of when

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:45.310
we get finally down
to this end where

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:47.390
we've got a lot of
this other information.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:50.180
And now we're able to start
quantifying interactions

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:50.930
and modeling them.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:52.388
And we really
understand processes.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.920
So for the last 10
minutes or so, I'll

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.530
talk a little bit about that.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.210
And what we're
trying to do here is

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:05.880
build a model or set
of models that simulate

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:10.740
or describe as accurately as
we can the whole ecosystem,

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.430
including the humans in it,
so a social ecological system

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:16.260
ultimately.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:23.070
So these computational models
of complex entities exist.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:27.210
So we have them already for
some things, the obvious one

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:28.070
being the cell.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:32.320
So the cell is the
foundation of biology.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.440
And we understand an
awful lot about the cell

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.460
now, up to the
point where we have

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.420
an avatar of bacterial cells.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:46.600
And actually, we can even
artificially synthesize

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.220
the genome and
potentially create

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.080
a new species of bacteria,
which is being done.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.660
Craig Venter's group
have done that, recoded

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.690
and relaunched a cell.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:01.630
You still need the cell,
but we can artificially

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:04.445
synthesize a new genome,
put it into a cell,

00:46:04.445 --> 00:46:05.820
boot the cell back
up, and you've

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:10.770
got a new species
created by humans.

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:15.820
It's inspired by biology.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.280
It's using its biological
still, and it's still

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:24.821
using an actual cell, but
it's still a physical example

00:46:24.821 --> 00:46:26.820
of where you can actually
now understand things,

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.167
because we can build them.

00:46:28.167 --> 00:46:30.125
If you can't build it,
you don't understand it,

00:46:30.125 --> 00:46:31.120
as the saying goes.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.840
Well, we can start to build
at least genomes of cells.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.260
We can also build
them in the computer.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.960
So this was the first whole
cell computational model.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:46.341
And what does that set up?

00:46:46.341 --> 00:46:47.840
I mean, in cells,
of course you have

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.090
lots of cells in a laboratory.

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.910
You can do lots of
things with cells.

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.430
But still, it was
considered potentially

00:46:54.430 --> 00:47:00.090
revolutionary to be able to have
these silico avatars of cells

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:03.490
where things emerge from
the model or from the avatar

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:05.030
that you didn't expect.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.530
And then you can go and look
in the real world and say, hey,

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.070
does that actually happen?

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:12.860
And so it becomes
a discovery tool

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.530
for finding out things
back in the real world.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.135
And so it was hailed partly as
sort of a dawn of virtual cell

00:47:19.135 --> 00:47:19.635
biology.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.390
Whether it will actually
supplant the need for [? wet ?]

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:36.930
lab is probably doubtful, but
it certainly is enhancing it.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:40.181
So virtual cells, computational
models of cells exist.

00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:42.180
And they're getting more
and more sophisticated.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:47.650
And now that's including up to
small multicellular organisms.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.360
So this is back
in 2008, saying we

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:54.160
need to move from the cell
level up to interactions

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.495
and how communities function.

00:47:56.495 --> 00:47:58.120
And so in this paper,
they were talking

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.910
about how organisms
interact and move up

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.430
to understanding ecosystems
through these sort of network

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.220
analysis approaches.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.240
But look at what they
were calling an ecosystem.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.510
It was something
around your tooth.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.640
It's not necessarily
the ecosystem

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.240
we're talking
about at our scale.

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.800
But what it shows is
we are all ecosystems,

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:26.740
whether it's our body,
buildings, up to the planet.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.240
And specifically at the case
of landscape-scale social

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.640
ecological systems, we need to
be able to deliver predictions,

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.490
forecasts that policy
can respond to,

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.070
if we're going to
hope to maintain

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:44.530
the health of our
societies and our planet,

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:49.490
just as we do at the scale of
our bodies through medicine.

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:53.820
So predicting the
future-- this was in 1769

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.280
when Captain Cook came out
and he went all the way

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.050
around the world to look
at transitive Venus.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.550
And I won't go into details of
that, but it was coordinated.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.883
It had to be done-- because
the transitive Venus doesn't

00:49:03.883 --> 00:49:05.510
happen very often,
every century or so.

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:07.635
You had to be there to
observe from different parts

00:49:07.635 --> 00:49:10.610
of the world in order
to estimate the distance

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:12.280
between the Earth and the sun.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.050
That was what it
was being done for.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:18.070
But they knew back then exactly
when the next transit would

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:22.890
be, in 1769, so it was
arranged to go out there

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.260
and observe it
right at that time.

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.530
So the prediction
even then in physics,

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:30.990
astronomy, was very accurate.

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:34.224
And the last transit of Venus
was two years ago, I think.

00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:35.140
Have I got that right?

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.760
Yeah, two years ago.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.720
And we went out to the
same spot in Tahiti

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.530
and stood there and
stood on the beach

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:46.180
and waited for the transit of
Venus, along with thousands

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:49.760
of other people who were
there in this big ceremony.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.527
And the last person
to do that was Cook.

00:49:53.527 --> 00:49:54.610
So it's pretty remarkable.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:56.680
And also sitting there, well,
what if this doesn't happen?

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.090
This would really shake up
physics, like, it better.

00:49:59.090 --> 00:49:59.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:00.930
I hope this happens.

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.950
It would be embarrassing
if it didn't.

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:05.550
But of course, it did.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.160
So physics is safe for a while.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.910
But interesting anecdote
because I like this,

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:17.340
but Captain Cook sent
out Sir Joseph Banks, who

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:20.410
was future-- this expedition
was funded by the Royal Society

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:21.390
from London.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:23.994
So it was a
scientific expedition.

00:50:23.994 --> 00:50:25.660
And he set up his
observatory on Tahiti.

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.910
He sent Banks, who was a
botanist, over to Moorea

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:30.890
to observe it from
Moorea just in case

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:32.840
it was cloudy on Tahiti.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:37.430
And Banks was the first
European to set foot on Moorea.

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:40.435
So it's kind of nice for me
that the first European who

00:50:40.435 --> 00:50:42.860
arrived on Moorea was there
as a scientific mission

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.880
to set up an observatory,
and, of course,

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.220
we're still doing that.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.800
And here's Frank Murphy,
our associate director

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.660
at the station.

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:54.260
We're standing right on
the spot where we think

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.070
Banks-- this is on Moorea.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:58.550
It's eroded now,
but this was where

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:03.820
he stood there to observe
the transitive Venus.

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.430
So physics is good,
can predict things.

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:11.320
Biology, we can't predict any--
we have general predictions

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.890
but with certainly nothing
like the accuracy of this.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:18.996
But that's always
going to be a case.

00:51:18.996 --> 00:51:21.120
We're never going to get
to that level of accuracy.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.890
But we need to make these
forecasts useful forecasts

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.220
at various scales.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.970
And so I'll finish
with this, because this

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:30.450
is what we're trying to do now.

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:32.800
We're trying to
integrate all of these

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.220
at the genomic level, all
of the different sciences

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:39.470
that we have but
focused on one system.

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.680
How do we join those
into an overarching model

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.930
that simulates that
system in a useful way?

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.160
Can we do that?

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.470
And this project, the Island
Digital Ecosystem Avatar

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.880
Consortium now has
about 80 scientists

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:58.200
from around the world, including
physicists and astronomers

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.070
who are trying to
understand how we would even

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:02.430
set about doing this.

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:05.180
We've had a number of workshops
over the last year or so.

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:10.610
And really, this is
relating to the book's dream

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:15.530
of using genomic information
from cells up to the planet.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:18.320
How do we do that ultimately
to model the Earth?

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.260
That's overwhelmingly
complex, but we're

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.090
trying through these
genomic observatory

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:28.720
sites, and Moorea in
particular, to at least get

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.510
a handle on these.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:32.110
We still have to
start at the molecule,

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:34.120
but we only have to go
to the island, which

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.590
is a lot less than the planet.

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:39.125
So we're hoping that's
a little more tractable.

00:52:39.125 --> 00:52:41.140
But once we can do
that, we have to have

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.760
to solve all of
the same problems

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.090
that we'll have to solve
everywhere else in the world

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:47.990
and including at
the global scale.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:55.220
So it's a focus, yes, but it
still has global ramifications.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.010
So I think I'll stop there.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:58.174
Thank you very much.

00:52:58.174 --> 00:53:02.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.550
AUDIENCE: It certainly
seems clear that some place

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.450
like Moorea would
be an ideal place

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:12.660
to start an effort
like this, because it's

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:17.570
relatively self-contained
and relatively isolated.

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:21.970
But you've cited a number of
different kinds of factors,

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:23.610
I mean not counting
the things that

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:25.985
happened when the humans first
arrived and everything got

00:53:25.985 --> 00:53:28.430
completely screwed up, but
just on an ongoing basis,

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:31.880
there's the arrival of
new plants and animals.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.570
There are environmental changes
like temperature and acidity

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:37.130
in the oceans and so forth.

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:40.660
And then also since
you excluded microbial,

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.340
that's effectively part
of the environment, too.

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.740
And any of those three
things, or all of them,

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.090
will be changing over time.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.340
Are those things happening
on a long enough time scale

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.430
that they won't interfere with
the time scale of your work?

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.880
Or alternatively,
is there anything

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.760
you have to do to try to keep
particularly the new plants

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.320
and animals from arriving
and disrupting you?

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.910
NEIL DAVIES: Yes, so I
think yes to both questions.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:08.760
But of course you're
absolutely right.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.910
Moorea is changing all the
time, and we can't stop that.

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:16.340
We absolutely have to
look at the microbes.

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.840
So at present, we've done the
survey of the large organisms,

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.050
because those were the
easy ones to do first.

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:25.360
But a lot of work is also taking
place at the microbial level.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.860
The ocean sampling
data I mentioned,

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:32.760
for example, was a microbial
survey of surface sea water,

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.320
looking at marine microbes.

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.640
So we need to expand that
Biocode Project, the Moorea

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.360
Biocode Project, to include the
microbial parts of the system.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.990
To do that, we're going to
focus on foundation species.

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:45.690
Because we can't do
all the microbes.

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:49.257
So as I mentioned,
the trees-- so

00:54:49.257 --> 00:54:50.840
what's the genomic
variation in trees?

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.930
Because the Biocode Project
was a species-level inventory.

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:57.180
So we have to also look at
population-level variation

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.320
among all the different
individuals on the island.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.160
So the inventory part
is far from complete.

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.430
We've got a better handle
than we have elsewhere,

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:07.090
but we've got much,
much more to do.

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:09.910
And the next phases, we'll
be looking at key foundation

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:13.160
species, genomic variation
within those species,

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.930
and their microbial
associates and the interaction

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:18.860
between those.

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:21.257
We can't stop.

00:55:21.257 --> 00:55:22.840
We have the scale
of the island, which

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.890
we're trying to understand
and model what's

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:26.930
happening inside the island.

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:29.300
But we have to take all of
the external inputs, which

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.510
at least we can measure,
because in an island,

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:33.860
we know what's outside and
what's inside our system.

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.930
The drivers from
outside, we're there

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:37.800
taking regional
and global models

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.700
and downscaling those
and linking them

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.910
to our local models.

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.550
So we're not ignoring what's
happening at the larger

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:48.470
scale and different
time scales, but having

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:52.090
to integrate that with what's
happening at the local scale.

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:54.840
So I didn't mean to
imply that we're only

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.390
doing the larger species
and ignoring the microbes.

00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:59.950
And the global
changes, we absolutely

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:01.450
have to take into account.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.700
But the predictive
models are basically,

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.200
can we predict what
this island will

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:11.470
look like in a few decades
under likely scenarios

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:14.360
of environmental change-- that's
one of the simulations we want

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:19.340
to run-- and under likely
scenarios of policy

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:23.860
change and, of course, the
interaction between those two?

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.450
So we're not trying to simulate
every possible scenario.

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:29.140
We're trying to simulate a small
number of scenarios that are

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.410
relevant and hopefully useful.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:35.860
MALE SPEAKER: Quick
question here-- so

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:40.780
what kind of collaborations
are you looking to establish?

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:44.660
I heard that you're working
with the Smithsonian, Oxford

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:45.760
University.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.800
Is there any other
field that you would

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.840
like people to contact you?

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.640
And what's the best
way to get in touch?

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.590
And what is the thing
that like your institution

00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:58.680
can provide for these
other institutions that

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.310
may have like a fruitful
collaboration in the future?

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:03.070
NEIL DAVIES: Yeah,
so absolutely.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.010
So the consortium, the
idea of consortium,

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:09.340
is completely open
to-- the idea is

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:13.490
to make this system available
to study remotely, right?

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:16.090
We're trying to digitize
the whole system,

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:20.280
put it into supercomputers
so it can be studied remotely

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.800
but also connecting back
to what observations need

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.880
to happen on the real world.

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.516
Because it's not
a computer game.

00:57:26.516 --> 00:57:27.890
So we need to
model what we think

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:31.260
can generate these
visualizations, simulations,

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:34.590
and then validate those
in our-real world systems.

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:38.090
So it will involve some
work on the ground and teams

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:39.890
on the ground doing
this deployment

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:43.180
of new senses, satellite
imagery, and embedded network

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:44.050
sensing.

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:45.820
Obviously the genomics
has to be done,

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.030
at least the collections
have done, locally.

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:50.160
And then the number of
institutions involved,

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.990
we have 20 institution
sort of nodes in the Avatar

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:56.590
Consortium at the moment.

00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:59.390
ETH Zurich was one of the
founders, as you mentioned,

00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:02.300
Oxford, the French
[? CRNS ?] lab.

00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:06.660
So it's completely open to
anyone who wants to join,

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.880
thinks they have
something to contribute.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:13.260
And also part of
this is addressing

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:14.760
the sociological
problem I mentioned

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.680
earlier of data sharing.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.840
Because the avatar
is going to be open.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.990
The idea is that everyone puts
their data in there, not just

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:24.700
the data, but the models.

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:28.860
And everything else will go
into this infrastructure.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.300
So all of the experiments
should be reproducible

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.550
so anyone else in the
world can try them.

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:35.590
You can actually
run new experiments

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:37.930
if you can do those
experiments virtually.

00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:41.110
And also, the avatar will
help task us, hey, we're

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:44.890
trying to model this,
but we don't have data

00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:46.760
on this aspect of your system.

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.910
Can someone somewhere else?

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:51.501
We really need that if somebody
else could go out and look

00:58:51.501 --> 00:58:53.250
at the physiology of
this species of coral

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:54.930
or whatever it might be.

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:57.700
So it also helps
identify opportunities.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.860
And we provide
support physically,

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.590
because we have the
labs in the field.

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:05.345
But really, this is a call
for collaboration with anyone

00:59:05.345 --> 00:59:06.765
who's interested.

00:59:06.765 --> 00:59:08.390
MALE SPEAKER: Please
thank Neil Davies.

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:09.640
NEIL DAVIES: Thanks very much.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.940
[APPLAUSE]
