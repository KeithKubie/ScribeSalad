00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.790
The standard habit of the mind is to take
careful note what’s not right in our lives

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.299
and obsess about all that is missing. But
in a new mood, perhaps after a lot of longing

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:20.290
and turmoil, we pause and notice some of what
has – remarkably – not gone wrong. The

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.760
house is looking beautiful at the moment.
We’re in pretty good health, all things

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.200
considered. The afternoon sun is deeply reassuring.
Sometimes the children are kind. Our partner

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.989
is – at points – very generous. It’s
been quite mild lately. Yesterday, we were

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.359
happy all evening. We’re quite enjoying
our work at the moment. Gratitude is a mood

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.480
that grows with age. It is extremely rare
properly to delight in flowers or a quiet

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.550
evening at home, a cup of tea or a walk in
the woods when one is under twenty-two. There

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.660
are so many larger, grander things to be concerned
about: romantic love, career fulfillment and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:10.210
political change. However, it is rare to be
left entirely indifferent by smaller things

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.940
in time. Gradually, almost all one’s earlier,
larger aspirations take a hit, perhaps a very

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.500
large hit. One encounters some of the intractable
problems of intimate relationships. One suffers

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.670
the gap between one’s professional hopes
and the available realities. One has a chance

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.560
to observe how slowly and fitfully the world
ever alters in a positive direction. One is

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.140
fully inducted to the extent of human wickedness
and folly – and to one’s own eccentricity,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.600
selfishness and madness. And so, ‘little
things’ start to seem somewhat different;

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.460
no longer a petty distraction from a mighty
destiny, no longer an insult to ambition,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.060
but a genuine pleasure amidst a litany of
troubles, an invitation to bracket anxieties

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.510
and keep self-criticism at bay, a small resting
place for hope in a sea of disappointment.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.660
We appreciate the slice of toast, the friendly
encounter, the long hot bath, the spring morning

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.160
– and properly keep in mind how much worse
it could, and probably will one day, be.
