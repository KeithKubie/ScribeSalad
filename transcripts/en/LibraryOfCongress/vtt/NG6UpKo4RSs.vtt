00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.530
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.163
&gt;&gt; You're having a
program a great deal

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.003
of details about Natasha Trethewey.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.003
And I'm not gonna repeat
them except to acknowledge

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.650
that of the highest awards
in our field including

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.333
for example the poet-- the Pulitzer
Prize that's what she received

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.946
for her last book, "Native Guard."

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.260
And we know her very much as a poet.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.613
And while we hear a poetry today,
we're also gonna hear something new

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.266
from her as listeners, as
readers which is her prose.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.563
Like Natasha Trethewey,
I'm a child of Mississippi,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.080
and with considering how best to
introduce her work with this focus

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.206
on people in a place and
time, I naturally thought

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.266
of the writers of our state.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.253
I thought that the
parallels between her work

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.163
and partners regarding the
land is a living character.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.886
Wealthy on the courage
of the individual,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.490
Margaret Alexander Walker and
Richard Wright on the testimony

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.496
and even the rage of the submerged
voices, but I found an equal linkage

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.433
with Robert Frost and their
mutual care for the poetic turn,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.596
for the shape note of
knowledge revealed in the space

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.903
between two lines of
suspended revelation.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.000
Robert Frost stated,
"Poetry is a way

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.123
of remembering what it would
impoverish us to forget."

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.110
And when I think about what
Natasha's achieved here beyond

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.263
Katrina, that's what I think of.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.980
This is a stay against
that impoverishment.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.700
It is a stay against
that forgetting.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.193
She says one line from
a quite wonderful poem

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.413
that hopefully we might here.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.280
She says, "Bring only
what you must carry."

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.393
And clearly she assigned
herself that hardest of task,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.000
she decided to carry the story of a
region, and a tragedy to a region,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.996
and honestly a neglected story
of the Mississippi Coast.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.486
And this was a burden
she gave herself

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.703
and she carried it to the heart.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.506
And it is my honor and privilege
to welcome Natasha Trethewey.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.663
Thank you very much.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
It's such an honor to be here.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.760
I'm delighted to get to read a
little bit of poetry and prose

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.936
to you since I am in the
poetry and prose tent.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.663
This book is in many
ways a hybrid itself.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.830
Because I am a poet, I couldn't
help sticking a little poetry

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.996
in between all the prose
that I was writing.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.070
The book is an attempt
to remember my hometown

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.586
and the other hometowns along
the Mississippi Gulf Coast

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.880
that were devastated
during hurricane Katrina.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.770
I began writing this
book because I used to go

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.143
around the country giving readings.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.813
And before I would read
from my last book of poems,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.673
I would ask people
what they remembered

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.450
when they heard the words
"hurricane Katrina."

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.830
Always they said, New Orleans,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.430
almost never did anyone say
the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.453
The poem is dedicated-- the
book is actually dedicated

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.140
to my brother Joe.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.940
It tries to trace the rise of
tourism and the gaming industry

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.240
on the Mississippi Gulf Coast,
the kind of development fermented

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.826
by the gaming industry,
and also the kind

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.786
of environmental destruction
that went along with it.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.370
It's interwoven with the story
about my ancestors who arrived

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.350
on the Mississippi Gulf Coast
around the same time that the City

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.136
of Gulfport got its charter.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.900
And it ends up being a story
about my brother and his life

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.723
and what happened to him in
the wake of the hurricane.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.086
A story that I think becomes
emblematic for the kinds

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.893
of suffering that people
who are often invisible

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.663
on the coast have endured.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.786
I'll begin with the
poem from the book

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.046
that also is the first
poem in my last book.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.983
They're both the first
poems in both of these books

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.263
because the poem underwent a kind
of revision after the hurricane.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.076
I had turned this poem in to
my editor in March of 2005.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.120
It was a very figurative meditation
on the impossibility of going home

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.513
or those places we've left behind,
not because the places are gone

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.593
or forever changed,
but because we are.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.906
By August 29th of '05
this poem became literal.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.630
Theories of Time and Space.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.270
You can get there from here,
though there's no going home.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.533
Everywhere you go will be
somewhere you've never been.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.193
Try this: head south
on Mississippi 49,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.940
one-by-one mile markers ticking
off another minute of your life.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.423
Follow this to its natural
conclusion-dead end at the coast,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.390
the pier at Gulfport where riggings
of shrimp boats are loose stitches

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.963
in a sky threatening rain.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.523
Cross over the man-made
beach, 26 miles of sand dumped

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.420
on a mangrove swamp -
buried terrain of the past.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.663
Bring only what you must carry -

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.946
tome of memory its
random blank pages.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.716
On the dock where you board
the boat for Ship Island,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.253
someone will take your picture:
the photograph - who you were -

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.023
will be waiting when you return.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.400
Somewhere in the post-Katrina
damage and disarray

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.313
of my grandmother's house, is
a photograph of my Joe and me,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.553
our arms around each
other's shoulders.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.160
We are at a long-gone nightclub
in Gulfport, the Terrace Lounge,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.550
standing before the photographer's
airbrushed scrim - a border of dice

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.956
and playing cards around us.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.703
Just above our heads the words "HIGH
ROLLERS", in cursive, embellished -

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.703
if I am remembering this
right - with tiny starbursts.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.943
It is 1992, the year
the first casino arrived

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.233
on the Mississippi Gulf Coast,
and with it a new language meant

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.566
to invoke images of high-stakes
players in exclusive poker games,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.890
luxurious suites on the
penthouse floor, valet parking,

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.063
and expensive cars lined up in
a glorious display of excess.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.623
Scenes from a glamorous casino
someplace like Monte Carlo

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.176
or Las Vegas - nothing like the
gravel parking lot outside the club,

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.950
the empty lot beyond it, and
the small, run-down houses

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.603
on either side, each

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.203
with a chained-up dog
barking into the night.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.176
Not far from the club,
beyond the spot

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.936
that held the old Gulfport
City Limits sign,

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.460
is the neighborhood
my ancestors settled

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.173
in when they arrived
on the Gulf Coast.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.523
Roughly five miles north
of the beach and downtown,

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.676
the place called North Gulfport was
once the northernmost settlement

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.836
beyond the city.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.430
One of two historically
African-American communities

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.910
that sprang up along the Mississippi
Gulf Coast after emancipation,

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.716
North Gulfport has
always been a place

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.943
where residents have had fewer
civic resources than those extended

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.910
to other outlying communities.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.156
Isolated and unincorporated,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:36.593
North Gulfport lacked a basic
infrastructure: flooding

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.600
and contaminated drinking
water were frequent problems.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.663
Although finally incorporated in
1994 - not long after the arrival

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.753
of the first casino - many of North
Gulfport's streets still lack curbs,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.413
sidewalks, and gutters.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.476
Before the arrival of the
casinos brought tourists

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.550
down Highway 49 toward the beach,
there were few streetlights

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.270
and North Gulfport
was cast in darkness.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.186
When I was growing up there,
North Gulfport was referred to as

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:10.716
"Little Vietnam" because of the
perception of crime and depravity

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.003
within its borders - as if its
denizens were simply a congregation

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.776
of the downtrodden.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.510
Even now, it is a place that
outsiders assume to be dangerous

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.013
or insignificant - run-down and
low income, a stark contrast

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.220
to the glittering landscape
of the post-Katrina beachfront

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.956
with its bright lights and
neon bouncing off the casinos

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.160
onto the water.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.280
Were North Gulfport not
along the main thoroughfare,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:43.743
making it necessary to drive
through to get to the beach,

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.803
it might be easily forgotten.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:50.890


00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.730
Witness, here is North Gulfport -
its liquor stores and car washes,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.530
trailers and shotgun shacks
propped at the road's edge;

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:05.220
its brick houses hunkered against
the weather, anchored to neat,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.193
clipped yards; its streets named
for states and presidents -

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.640
each one a crossroads of memory,
marked with a white obelisk;

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.476
its phalanx of church houses
- a congregation of bunkers

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.973
and masonry brick, chorus of
marquees: God is not the author

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.980
of fear; without faith
we is victims;

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.720
sooner or later everybody
comes by here.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.980


00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.130
In the year leading up to
landfall, a few miles up highway 49

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.143
from the beach, my
brother was beginning work

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.676
on the shotgun houses.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:49.970
The boost in tourism brought by the
casinos had created a greater need

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.373
for housing, North Gulfport had
finally been annexed and the strip

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.660
of Highway 49 that
run right through it,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.600
was undergoing a great
deal of development.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.053
&gt;&gt; Where there had been
darkness for so many years,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:05.753
streetlights appeared guiding
travelers from the beach

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.833
to Interstate 10, pass the Walmart,
fast food restaurants, motels,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.326
gas stations, and convenient
stores up to the new outlet mall.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.380
My brother's property was
right in the middle of it.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.460
Most of it at the crossroads
of old Highway 49

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.960
and Martin Luther King Boulevard.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:26.386
For years, the shotgun houses Sonny
Dixon had built languish in a state

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.360
of disrepair, unpainted
sagging, many still occupied

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.573
by tenants who'd been there since
he was alive, the rest vacant

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.346
and sometimes sporadically
occupied by drug users.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.500
The remaining tenants
had paid the rent now

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.280
up to 250 dollars a
month, steadily for years.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.203
Ms. Mary in the duplex at the
corner of MLK and Arkansas,

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:54.926
Chapman's Fruit Stand, and
AD's Bail Bond business

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.613
at old Highway 49 and MLK.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.416
Armed with tools and experience,
Joe began repairing each one,

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.086
putting in new floors and carpet,
new countertops and appliances,

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.310
brushing on a good coat of paint.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.796
Ms. Mary nearly cried when
Joe fixed up her house.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:15.843
Each day whenever he was
outside, someone would drive by,

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.996
stop and roll the window
down to look.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.276
People kept coming by to say,
thank you, he told me, and "Man,

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:26.916
I appreciate what you're
doing for the community."

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.356
For many long time
residents, it must seemed

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.823
as if Sonny Dixon had returned
in the form of his young nephew.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.783
By the start of the summer of 2005,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:40.923
nearly all of the houses
were renovated and rented.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.943
In a few months with the profit,
Joe could get them insured.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.320
Katrina made landfall
on August 29th, 2005.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.703
Out in the Gulf, Ship Island
was completely submerged.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.076
The storm surged up to 27 feet.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.913
Mississippi officials recorded
238 deaths, tens of thousands

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.416
of people were displaced.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.163
Even though she was a
renter, Ms. Mary had lived

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.736
in her duplex for nearly 30 years.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:12.593
She survived the storm in it, but
before long, she'd have to leave

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.600
as the severely damaged structure
began to fall down around her.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.553
Hearing her story, I thought of
Bessie Smith's Backwater Blues,

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.133
when it thunders and lightnings
and the wind begins to blow,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.820
there are thousands of people
ain't got no place to go.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:33.336
The kind of repairs her house would
need, Joe couldn't afford to do.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:37.490
He'd spent all his savings on
repairing them prior to the storm.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:41.413
Before the second anniversary
of landfall,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.643
the city would demolish the duplex
and my brother would be struggling

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.663
to pay the taxes on vacant land.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.510
[ Pause ]

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.913
&gt;&gt; Watcher, after Katrina, 2005.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.843
"At first, there was
nothing to do but watch.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.870
For days, before the trucks
arrived, before the work of cleanup,

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.010
my brother sat on the
stoop and watched.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.020
He watched the ambulances
speed by, the police cars,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.386
watched for the looters who'd come
each day to siphon gas from the car,

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.783
take away the generator,
the air conditioner,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.933
whatever there was to be had.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.833
He watched his phone for a
signal, watched the sky for signs

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.923
of a storm, for rain,
so he could wash.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.793
At the church, handing
out diapers and water,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.900
he watched the people line up,

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.730
watched their faces
as they watched his.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.630
And when at last there
was work, he got a job,

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.930
on the beach, as a watcher.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.296
Behind safety goggles, he
watched the sand for bones,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:59.156
searched for debris that clogged
the great machines, riding the prow

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.123
of the cleaners, or walking
ahead, he watched for carcasses,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.146
chickens mostly, maybe
some cats or dogs.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.603
No one said remains.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.570
No one had to.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.036
It was a kind of faith,
that watching.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.203
My brother trained his eyes to bear
the sharp erasure of sand and glass,

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.223
prayed there'd be nothing
more to see."

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.163
After my initial journeys
back home following Katrina,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:37.303
I stayed away for a long time,
tough my grandmother asked again

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.220
and again to make the trip.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:39.806
"I know I can't live
there anymore," she'd say.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.060
"I just wanna see it one more time."

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.246
For three years, I kept putting
her off, saying, "One day."

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.796
So that at 92, she
could at least hold

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.453
on to the hope of getting there.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.863
I never considered the
consequences of this tactic,

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.916
how it might haunt me later.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.306
When I started going back more
often, it was because I had to.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.363
And by then, it was too late.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.593
It occurs to me now that I
have been waiting foolishly

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.963
for the recovery to be complete.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.000
I had wanted to show her the
place she'd spent her life

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.260
without the narrative of destruction
still inscribed on the landscape.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.083
During the year or
so, after the storm,

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.240
everything that has been disrupted
seemed to be starting to settle,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.793
the narrative of recovery
overwriting the devastation.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.510
My grandmother had lost a lot
of weight during her ordeal.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:35.820
But in the nursing home at
Atlanta, she started eating again.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.040
My brother too, seemed to on
his way to remaking his life.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:43.900
Even without his rental units,
he was earning a living.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.286
There was a good deal of
work to be had on the coast,

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.853
government contractors were hiring
Cruz [phonetic] for the work

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.080
of cleanup, and Joe
was doing it all.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.343
I remember too, that he called one
day, excited about the possibility

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.070
of a small business loan to rebuild
his rental units, though later,

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.336
he'd learn that he did not
qualify for assistance.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:07.950
Like a lot of people in North
Gulfport, he wasn't eligible

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.320
for the kinds of programs
that it helped business

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.220
and wealthier citizens
get back on their feet.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.220
And it wasn't long before
the initial cleanup was done,

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.643
though recovery was still a long
way off and still hasn't occurred

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.886
for some of the poor
citizens in the region.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.023
Just more than a year after
landfall, the contractors pulled

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.736
out of Gulfport and other
devastated Mississippi Costal towns,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.693
leaving behind much less
work for people struggling

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.433
to recover and rebuild their lives.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.173
Even the retail store Joe worked

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.906
in part time before the storm
did not rebuild on the coast.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.700
The owners relocated the business
farther north where they had family.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.040
Not only were jobs
leaving the coast,

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.046
much low income housing
had disappeared too,

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:58.506
and wasn't being rebuilt in the
same numbers as before the storm,

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.940
thus rendering recovery a lot harder
to achieve for many of its citizens.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.446
I can't help thinking too
that the photograph we made

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.980
in 1992 foreshadowed something else.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:15.736
Driving through the old
neighborhood not long ago,

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:18.443
I remember that my brother and I
had waited in line to have it taken.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.176
The line had stretched around the
dance floor, and we stood there

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.216
with everyone else that
night to pay the 5 dollars

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.043
to pose beneath those
words; high rollers.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.080
It was as if we needed to get close
to that image of luck and money

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
in a place where so many
people had so little.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.786
Perhaps, it's better
the photograph is lost.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.746
I know the desire to see the
images of the past in light

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:52.500
of the present would be too strong,
and I'd be tempted to read into it

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.140
in our gestures, the way
we held onto each other,

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.870
what I would not see then,
the irony of those words,

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.376
how they mock so many of the
people who stood beneath them.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560
[ Pause ]

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:13.116
&gt;&gt; The first letter of my brother
writes me during his incarceration

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.396
arrives on August 13, 2008, a week
after we bury our grandmother.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.830
It comes bearing his name
and his inmate number, R0470,

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.240
along with a warning stamped in red
that the letter is from an inmate,

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:29.623
and that the facility, the county
jail where he awaits sentencing,

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.676
is not responsible for content.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:37.450
He is a stoic in the letter
as he was at the church,

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:40.000
the day of our grandmother's
memorial service.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:42.670
I know things are hard right now.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.570
It seems like everything
comes at one time.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.026
And I relived that morning while
thinking of him trying to be strong

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.900
in his cell, perhaps, because so
much has happened in what seems

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.066
like a short amount of time.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.070
I feel that I have gone
through it as if I were walking

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.543
through was set, an
artificial backdrop

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.663
onto which our lives have been
projected, along with a story

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.126
that is already in process
and beyond our control.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.103
I think of it now as
not unlike the fake town

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.506
at the dude ranch I
visited when I was a child.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.560
The buildings were
rundown, mostly facades,

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.306
and I was surprised the first time
I saw the actor stage a shootout.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:26.536
My grandmother and I stood
watching, at once part of the scene

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.063
because we were there and
not, as though we had walked

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.520
into some bizarre turn of
our lives, and it was playing

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.113
out right there before us,
and we were unable to stop it.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.466
The morning we buried
are grandmother,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.906
the church was like that.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.840
Still in disrepair, the sanctuary
unused, the church seemed abandoned.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.870
On the ground level, windows on both
sides of the church were boarded up,

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.583
and a couple of the
high windows up top

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.770
that overlooked the balcony
were still blown out.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.476
&gt;&gt; I could see birds
flying in and out of them.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.990
The church marquee
hadn't been repaired,

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.386
and most of the glass
were-- glass was missing.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.180
A few letters hung on,
and oh, on its side,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.213
what looked to be a broken
F. Missing its smaller arm,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.443
it resembled the gallows in
a child's game of hangman.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.273
Only the small bunker
attached to the back

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.113
of the church was functional.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:27.443
It was the place food was
served after services,

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.383
and it held Sunday school
classrooms and a nursery.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:33.640
When I call to tell the
caretaker, Mr. Crouch,

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:36.830
that I was bringing my
grandmother's body back to Gulfport

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.220
to have her home going ceremony
in the church she belonged

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.800
to her whole life, he thanked me.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:47.640
Since the storm, we've lost a
lot of our members, he said.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.046
Mount Olive is still struggling
to raise the money for repairs

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:53.960
that the insurance
company didn't cover.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.786
Most people have moved on
to places that are still

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.653
in the process of rebuilding.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.213
Mr. Crouch, now in his early 80s,
had done this job most of his life.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.043
I had arranged with him to
have the doors opened early

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.323
so Joe would be able to have
some time with our grandmother.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.876
The Sheriff had granted
him permission to come,

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.650
but only to a private viewing,

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:18.506
and we had to schedule it two
hours before anyone was supposed

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.980
to arrive for the ceremony.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.303
My husband, Brett, and I
arrived early, even before 8 AM,

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.883
when officers reschedule to
pick him up for transport.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:31.246
We didn't find anyone
there when we arrived.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.720
No police car.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.996
So we decided to circle the
block around the building

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:41.443
in case they parked somewhere
else, turning the corner

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.186
of Jefferson right in front
of my grandmother's house

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.780
onto the access road that runs
parallel to Highway 49, we saw them.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.350
They were near in the
intersection of 49 and MLK,

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.210
headed in the direction of the jail.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:56.903
I could see my brother's head just
above the top of the back seat.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.070
When I saw the car's
blinker come on, I panicked.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:04.273
It seems funny to me now
that in moments like this,

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.546
it becomes so easy to
ignore the rules of traffic,

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.153
of law and order on the road.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:12.896
I asked Brett to speed up, and
he did, flashing the headlights

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.736
and honking the horn as he pulled
up close behind the police car.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.306
When they stopped, I got out
and hurried toward the driver.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.470
Later my brother would tell me

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:27.733
that the two officers
have been skeptical,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.866
that because of the
condition of the church,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.933
they hadn't believed any kind

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.270
of services could be
taking place there.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:36.720
As I stood in the middle
of the road,

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:38.903
afraid they were just going take
him back, I could see the officer

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.350
in the passenger side looking at
me, my black dress, and stockings,

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:46.556
and shoes, while the other one
chuckled, "We are just going

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:50.050
to get something to drink," he said.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:53.983
"We'll bring him right back."

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:54.840
We've been told when our request
to have Joe there was approved,

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.220
that we were not allowed to have any
contact with him, and that we'd have

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.526
to stay back several
feet from where he was.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.190
I didn't even look
at him in the car.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.743
When the officers brought him
back and parked near the entrance

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:10.383
of the church's auxiliary
building, Brett and I stood off

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.810
to the side, away from the entrance.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.293
A few people had begun
to arrive early,

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.116
and I had to tell them they'd
have to wait outside in the heat

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:25.270
until the private viewing
was over and Joe was gone.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:27.306
When he emerged from the car, I
saw that his ankles were shackled

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.873
and his hands were
cuffed behind his back.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:33.330
I hadn't seen him like that
before, and I stood there trying not

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.356
to register any emotion on
my face as I watched him walk

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.603
into the church, flanked
by the two officers.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:48.150
In my memory, this happens in
slow motion, like a trite scene

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.673
from a movie, and I feel
like I noticed everything,

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:52.120
particularly the sound of his feet
shuffling in the leg restraints,

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.196
the birds flying out of the
sanctuary and settling in the tree

00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.406
across the street,
the whoosh of the door

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.426
as Mr. Crouch opens
it to let them in.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.066
When Joe was inside several
feet, Brett and I follow,

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.256
shutting the door behind us.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.220
The flowers haven't yet arrived, and
the low ceilinged room seems sparse,

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:20.043
homely, except for the fuse
they've managed to salvage

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.523
and the folding chairs
where the choir will sit,

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:27.743
the room holds only an organ, a
small podium, and wooden chairs

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.760
for the pastor and deacons, and
the platform bearing the casket.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:33.333
Before Mr. Crouch shuts the
door to the makeshift sanctuary,

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.246
I can see Joe standing before
the open casket, his head bowed.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.053
When Joe comes out a short
while later, his eyes are red,

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.160
and I look at him a
good long moment trying

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.800
to make my face convey
everything I am not allowed to say.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.360
Perhaps the officers
are moved by all this.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.270
The grandson in restraints,

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.820
the run down shirts still
wearing the vestiges of Katrina,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.453
the small congregation there
to say goodbye to a woman

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.576
who wanted nothing more
than to come back home.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.300
During the home going ceremony, I
can't help thinking of what recovery

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:14.683
and rebuilding means in
this little room dressed

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.890
up to served as the sanctuary.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.456
My grandmother had made the
draperies that hung in the church,

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.396
and she'd seen her own
daughter eulogize before them.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.590
And yet, here she was, being
remembered in a room that served

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.706
as church cafeteria,
beneath low ceiling tiles,

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.843
warped in stains reminders
that Katrina isn't over.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:40.303
As my niece PJ stood at the podium
to remember her great grandmother,

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:43.723
I realized just how much she'd
lost in this ordeal, and I imagined

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.370
that for the rest of her life she
remember this time as underscored

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.010
by the devastation of Katrina.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:54.990
She could mark the passing
of her great grandmother,

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.483
the arrest of her father, the
turmoil of these years as aftermath.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.070

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.680
People carry with them the blue
prints of memory for a place.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.320
It is not uncommon to hear
directions given in terms

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:24.343
of landmarks that are no longer
there, turn right at the corner

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:28.590
where the fruit stand used to be,
or across the street from the lot

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.736
where Ms. Mary used to live.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:36.990
Some time ago, before the storm,
my grandmother and I were shopping

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:40.763
in Gulfport, and we met
a friend of her shopping

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.830
with her granddaughter too.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.170
The woman introduced the
girl to us by her nickname,

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:51.023
then quickly added the
child's given name.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.396
My grandmother, a proud woman,
not to be outdone, replied, "Well,

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.086
Tasha's name is really Nostalgia."

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.790
[ Laughter ]

&gt;&gt; Drawing the syllables out to
make the names seem more exotic.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.853
I was embarrassed, and immediately
corrected her, not anticipating

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.433
that the guilt I'd feel later could
be worse than my initial chagrin.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.366
Perhaps, she was trying to say,
Natalya, the formal version

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.570
in Russian to which
Natasha is the diminutive.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.666
At both names, Latin
root, the idea of nativity

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.283
of the birthday of Christ.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.833
They share a prefix with words
like natal, national and--

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.180
&gt;&gt; -- although it was very
poetic prose was that?

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.770
&gt;&gt; Yes. You know, it seems too
big, I think, in many ways.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:48.143
Too big for the kind of extended
meditation that I wanted to do

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:52.703
about the nature of historical
memory, interwoven with the history

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:54.583
of the Mississippi Gulf Coast,
as well as my family history.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.016
I had in mind Robert Penn
Warren's segregation,

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:04.093
the book that he published two
years after the ground decision,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.956
which was very much a travel
narrative, where he journeys back

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.166
to the south to rethink
his own relationship

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.160
to the place he comes from.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:16.160
It was a lovely model for me, a
very slender book, but it helped me

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:19.206
to figure out a way
to tell this story

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:21.760
that I didn't think I
could tell in poetry.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.960
Yes?

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.560
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.960
The first one was, would
you talk a little bit

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.426
about your experience
with Cave Canem?

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.326
And then the second one is,
who are your favorite poets?

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:38.913
&gt;&gt; Okay. Actually, my very first
book won the first Cave Canem poetry

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:43.320
prize, which is how
it got published,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.746
something I'm deeply grateful
for because it allowed,

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.806
all of the sudden, an
audience, you know.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.073
I thought I would never
get a book published.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:53.573
So it was great that
Cave Canem came along

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.906
for black poets to
send their work to.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.903
I am actually gonna
be there as faculty

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:00.436
for the first time next summer.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:06.370
So it feels like I get to give
back, you know, to this place.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.513
I forgot your other
quest-oh, my favorite poets.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.510
You know, there are so many, and
you know, it's always changing.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:17.543
But the easiest thing, that I can
say, at least about my last book is

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.413
that I found a great
kinship with Irish poets

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:23.616
because of their relationship
to homeland and histories.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.556
So for example, the work of
Eavan Boland and Seamus Heaney,

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.970
particularly his book, North,
the engagement with history,

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:35.416
that sense of psychological exile.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.803
Of course, the first book that
my father gave me that I carried

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.686
around as my literary bible when I
was first writing to write poems,

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.103
was Rita Dove's, Thomas and Beulah.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.240
I added to that Yusef
Komunyakaa's Magic City.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.840
So if you take Heaney's North,
Eavan Boland's In a Time of Violence

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:58.616
and The Lost Land, and Thomas
and Beulah and Magic City,

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.843
those are my literary ancestors,
at least most, immediately.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.090


00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.740
Yes?

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.140
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ms. Trethewey.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.006
In your book, Native Guard, there
are quite a few poems and form,

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.673
as well as [inaudible] forms.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.473
And I was wonder if
you could comment on--

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.870
well, your thoughts on how form can
still be relevant for poets today.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.513
'Cause you hear a lot of people
still saying, "Oh, you know,

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.506
form is for 50 years ago.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.273
You can't use that."

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.940
So--

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.940
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.673
I have been told that I am
old fashioned because of that.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.473
I can't imagine that I could write
about some of the difficult things

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.740
that I try to write about
without the scaffolding of form.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.710
For me, it's a way of imposing
a very necessary restraint.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:50.443
I found that-- I know a lot
writers will say this-- that some--

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:52.650
they turned to form for the
most difficult material.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:55.116
But form is, of course, memorable.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:57.713
I mean, that's not to say that free
verse writers haven't invented their

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.920
own sort of memorable cadences
in poems that we love and recite.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.840
But there is something about
the memorable nature of poems

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:10.630
and traditional forms, those
cadences, those rhymes,

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.303
and in Native Guard, because
I was trying to remember,

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.330
trying to re-inscribed things
that have been forgotten,

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:24.216
I realized that I needed that
scaffolding of form to try

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.620
to create something memorable.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.620

You know, people-- I mean,
you guys know the story.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.806
I mean, so much of the media
did turn to the travesty

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:55.993
of New Orleans with good reason.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.660
But it's a different story.

the Mississippi Gulf Coast--

remember the difference

between the manmade disaster of New
Orleans and the natural disaster

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.633
that hit the Gulf Coast and
those towns all along the coast,

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.480
ground zero, for Hurricane
Katrina's landfall devastation.
