00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.749
&gt;&gt;Well, good afternoon everyone, and welcome
to another Outstanding Authors at Google talk.

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:08.929
If you look at some of our recent products
that we've launched everything from, you know,

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.799
Google Earth on the Moon to now Google Earth
on the Ocean, we have a really big focus on

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.210
exploration and making information accessible
to everyone.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.330
And this tradition in the oceans, really you
know got its start

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.210
and got its major push with Jacques Cousteau,
the famous ocean explorer.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.619
In fact, if you make a visit by the Googleplex
right now we have

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.870
a temporary loan of a sculpture of Jacques
Cousteau

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.899
along with other ocean -- ocean pioneers.
And so, you know, we have a firm connection

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.850
with the sea.
And so today our talk is on the man himself,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.100
on Jacques Cousteau, his life, his family.
We're joined today by Brad Matsen who is a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.820
famed ocean author,
and he'll be speaking to us about his latest

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.649
book which is all about Jacques Cousteau,
Jacques Cousteau, the Sea King.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.780
So after our talk we'll have some time for
some questions and answers, so please use

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.540
the mikes for our YouTube audience.
Without any further ado, please join me in

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.850
welcoming Brad.
Thank you very much.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.490
BRAD MATSEN: Hi everybody.
Like the rest of the world, I live with Google

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.570
everyday,
and this is my first time in the throbbing

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.990
heart of it.
And it’s just thrilling to see.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.150
I haven't walked around it.
It took me forever to find a place to park

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.729
until I found a guy who parks the car for
you, which was very good.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.530
The business of navigating through places
that no one has ever been before is your life;

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.830
you do this.
This is what you do, I assume, here.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.689
Someone told me this is the area where a lot
of engineering goes on.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.899
You make it possible for us to push a button,
and we're on the moon.

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.549
And now that Sylvia called your bluff on the
oceans, we can look at the oceans.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.270
Jacques Cousteau was the son of a French lawyer
and a wealthy woman who was the daughter of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.100
a wine grower of --
a grape grower who made wine near Bordeaux,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.530
France.
And he was born in 1910;

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.070
travelled all over Europe with his father,
who was a factotum for wealthy American ex-patriots.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.490
Eventually ended up in flight school where
he was about to become a fighter pilot and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.860
had a car crash which almost crippled him.
And he was reassigned as a gunnery officer

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.540
 -- this is right at the beginning of World
War II --

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.210
reassigned as a gunnery officer on a cruiser
near Toulon, France,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.060
where he lived with his wife, and by the late
'30s, his son, Jean-Michel, his oldest son,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.990
and his son Philippe.
And Cousteau met a man named Philippe Tailliez,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.710
who noticed Cousteau was having trouble adapting
to physical therapy he was being given for

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.910
the wounds that he suffered in a car crash.
And Tailliez says, "Gee, you know, you really

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.300
ought to consider going spear fishing with
me.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.220
It might be a really good way to get plenty
of exercise."

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.430
So Cousteau started spear fishing and ran
into another spear fisherman who was very

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.090
famous on the Rivera at the time --
and this is skin diving; they're not diving

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.650
with tanks.
There was no underwater breathing at this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.730
time except for hardhat diving and some very
restrictive devices that had been pioneered

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.550
ever since Jules Verne wrote 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:36.760
I don't know if anybody's familiar with that.
But, really, a remarkable, urgent need that

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.060
people had to go underwater, find a way to
breathe and swim free;

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.841
and Cousteau was obsessed with it.
He was also obsessed with making movies.

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:50.860
When he was 13-years old, he was kind of a
shy kid, very mechanically inclined, built

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.210
models, loved to tinker,
would be in the backyard and would build a

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:02.300
crane out of twigs, you know.
And he was just a very inventive kid and he,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.940
the Pathé brothers, another technological
breakthrough.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.680
I see where my mind is today because I'm here
in the throbbing heart of Google.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:19.160
But this huge technological breakthrough of
film, motion picture film.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.680
There were several wonderful breakthroughs
by Georges Méliès the first person to discover

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.490
that.
He was actually a magician, and his idea with

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.520
the camera was to adapt it to use for magic
tricks.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.920
And no one could ever really, really see where
the whole thing was going and neither could

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.040
Cousteau.
All Cousteau knew was that with the camera

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.570
in his hand, he had personality.
People liked him.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.410
And this was his entree into being an acceptable
social person.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.750
Well, anyway, he -- flashing forward again,
in 1943 he's on the coast there.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.470
They're not starving in southern France during
the German occupation, but they're not eating

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.120
very well, either.
They're living on beans and bread and butter.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.290
When they can get it, very little meat.
So skin diving for fish was really important

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.970
and they lived near Bandol,
site of another great wine growing region

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.930
and dove in the Mediterranean to catch food,
catch fish for food.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.360
And also Cousteau was tinkering with finding
a way to put a camera in a fruit jar so he

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.750
could take it underwater,
wind it to trigger 30 seconds of film, bring

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.120
it back up, and from this he made a movie,
his first underwater movie,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.640
before the invention of scuba, called "60
Feet Down."

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.640
And 60 feet was about the limit that a person
could get to by taking a single breath,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.930
going to 60 feet and doing a little bit of
work and getting back up and staying alive.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.601
So the goal was Cousteau and the other two
men, who became his best friends, and they

00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:01.880
called themselves Les Mousquemers
They had -- they were just great buddies,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.889
and these are guys in their late 20s.
You know, extremely vital.

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.200
And so the Les Mousquemers were obsessed with
trying to experiment with experimenting with

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.950
ways to breathe underwater.
And they tried to breathe oxygen.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.960
They built what's called a re-breather which
is a device that, at that time,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.310
anyway, you had to manually inject oxygen
into the loop of the -- the breathing loop,

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.380
and the CO2 that you were exhaling was absorbed
by soda lime in a canister.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.470
It was a very primitive device and there was
no way to control the amount of oxygen really

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:48.220
that you were ingesting or breathing.
And Cousteau had a high intolerance for oxygen

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.400
toxicity and almost died experimenting with
this.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.510
So he was fed up with using oxygen and wanted
to try compressed air. Another technological,

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:03.130
wonderful breakthrough that was happening
at this time was that the compression of gas

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.380
which is a marvelous transformation of physical
states, basically.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:16.290
I wrote ten pages on compressed gas in what
one of my editors calls an expository death

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.150
spiral.
And, of course, it was cut from the book.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.660
It isn't there but I can tell you about it.
When gas is compressed it changes states.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.230
The simplest form is water boiling in a tea
kettle.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.351
You change the temperature -- all the variables.
You're probably all scientists, so you know

00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:37.160
all about this,
you can manipulate one variable and it changes

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.920
the state of the matter.
Anyway, they had figured out how to compress

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.070
gas.
It was hugely important for steelmaking for

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:51.080
aviation, for carrying oxygen to higher altitudes
so people could breathe when they were flying.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:57.410
And it was problematic because you had to
contain it in extremely strong vessels that

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:03.060
were very, very heavy.
So the main company in France that was taken

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.080
over by the Germans called Air Liquide.
And it just so happened that Cousteau's wife,

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.830
Simone Melchior, who he had met when he was
16-years old at a party

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.699
when he showed up at the party with his camera,
party at her mother's apartment in Paris and

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:21.520
took her picture.
I've seen the film, and you can see her face

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.730
in the camera, and she mouths her name, Simone
Melchior.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:31.530
And you know that Cousteau behind the camera,
his beloved camera, had asked her what her

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.820
name was and she tells him.
Turns out that she's the daughter and granddaughter

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:41.440
of French Navy Admirals.
And her father, Henri Melchior, had retired

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.210
from the Navy and was a director of Air Liquide,
the company that produced compressed air tanks

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.710
and had learned the technology.
I know.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.260
It all goes together, doesn't it?
Really remarkable.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.570
I want to read you a little bit about the
day that Cousteau got the first Aqua-Lung.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:07.710
He went north in 1943, December 1943, to Paris
to visit his mother and to bring food because

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:15.020
things were really hard in the north of France.
Southern France was called "Vichy France."

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.950
It was run by a puppet government but it wasn't
occupied by troops. Northern France, things

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.490
were very bad.
Cousteau's mother and some other relatives

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.020
lived up there along with his brother, Pierre
Antoine Cousteau, his only brother.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:35.510
He was older and he was a Nazi collaborator.
He had written several anti-Semitic books.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:43.790
He was the editor of a German-controlled magazine
that essentially supported a vision of France

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:49.930
as a German territory.
He was also able to get Cousteau phony papers

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:55.650
as a marine biologist so that he could travel
around France including this trip that he,

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:01.940
Simone, and their two sons made north to Paris
in the winter of 1943.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.670
There he met at Air Liquide an engineer named
Emile Gagnan.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:13.640
And Emile was working, like most of the scientists
and engineers at Air Liquide, as little as

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.270
possible.
They wanted to do as little as possible to

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.360
help the Germans make steel, airplanes and
all of that.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.900
But for their French compatriots, they worked
very hard.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:29.100
And one of the things Emile was working on
was a demand regulator was to burn methane

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.360
in farm vehicles.
So he had come up with basically a two-stage

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.730
regulator that when the pressure in the manifold
fell to a certain point, the diaphragm would

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.600
release a dose of methane
and when -- and when it, the pressure in the

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.600
manifold, rose it would close -- that's basically
what a regulator is.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.270
So Cousteau went and talked to Emile Gagnan
and Emile showed him one of these regulators.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.980
In the next three weeks, the two of them came
up with something that worked relatively well.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:04.290
Attached to three tanks of compressed gas,
three steel tanks of compressed gas,

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:10.180
and Cousteau and Emile went out to the Seine
and tested this device in the river.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:15.470
It didn't work perfectly because the exhale
valve and the intake valve were different

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.060
levels,
which meant that when your body was in one

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:23.250
attitude, it would work really well.
When your body was in a different attitude,

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.940
it became hard to breathe.
In the opposite attitude, the tank would run

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.550
free.
Finally, Gagnan says he had it figured out.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.550
Cousteau goes back to Toulon, and Gagnan,
a month later, sends

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.630
him an Aqua-Lung fully charged with the valve
in the right place.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.880
And I want to read you a little bit from the
book.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.560
Can I see -- do I have to adjust?
Should I adjust this somehow?

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:57.649
It knows what to do; right?
Throbbing heart of Google.

00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:02.930
So here's Cousteau and he's back in Toulon
and they're -- he's living communally with

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:08.080
Les Mousquemers, his buddies, their wives,
a couple of other people who were interested

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.880
in making movies.
And it was just better to be with other people

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.430
during hard times.
And it also meant that they could share the

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:22.790
scavenging duties for getting food which involved
going -- going diving off, skin diving until

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.700
the Aqua-Lung arrived.
[READING]

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.060
For weeks they had talked about the Aqua-Lung
whenever the topic of conversation turned

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.720
to diving.
Cousteau had explained the simple mechanism

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.060
of the regulator,
the strength of the new steel tanks that allowed

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:43.000
the air inside to be compressed to many atmospheres,
and the intricacies of the intake and exhaust

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.580
valves that would allow a diver to breathe
easily in any attitude underwater.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.940
Together, they speculated that hunting fish
and lobsters was going to be as easy as plucking

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.980
vegetables from a stall table in the market.
The interesting thing about Cousteau that

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:04.840
struck me as I worked on this book,
which began five years ago, was that his impulse

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:11.130
to dive was, was really driven by the desire
to get more food.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:16.330
It was a very primitive urge and the filmmaking
came second for a very long time, the thing

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.190
that made him very famous.
[READING]

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.900
Most of all, Cousteau insisted the Aqua-Lung
meant the

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.470
end of experiments with dangerous gasses and
holding

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.750
their breath to shoot film underwater.
Early the following morning, before the sunbathers

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:35.779
were out, the household trooped in pairs through
the pine garden to a quiet inlet with the

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:40.050
gently sloping beach, out of sight of the
sentries in the city center.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:44.080
Dumas carried the Aqua-Lung.
But when they reached the water, he helped

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.670
Cousteau into its harness and followed his
instructions for double checking that the

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.950
air was turned on.
The tanks were secure and the two hoses were

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:58.180
firmly attached to the regulator.
As the best free diver in France, Dumas would

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.089
stay on shore to be ready if something went
wrong.

00:14:02.089 --> 00:14:07.230
Simone, Cousteau's wife, in mask, fins, and
snorkel, would swim out to watch over her

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.910
husband from above and signal to Dumas if
he got into trouble.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:18.880
Cousteau spat into his mask, a trick the Les
Mousquemers used for keeping a clear mist.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.470
He fitted the mask tightly to his face, covered
his nose and eyes to his brow, clamped the

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.180
mouthpiece between his teeth,
looked around for a moment at all his friends

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.740
and waddled into the water.
When Cousteau was chest deep, he stopped and

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.279
lay face down to gauge his buoyancy with the
tanks of air on his back.

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:44.100
He and Gagnon had designed the Aqua-Lung to
be slightly buoyant in sea water because adding

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.459
weight was simple and subtracting weight was
impossible.

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:52.790
Dumas waded out and cinched a belt around
Cousteau with five pounds of lead but it wasn't

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.480
enough.
He added two pounds more, stepped back and

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:02.510
watched his friend sink slowly into the crystal
clear water of the Mediterranean.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.740
Cousteau breathed effortlessly, delighted
by the distinctive whistle of air when he

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.870
inhaled,
the rippling of the bubbles over his head

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:15.930
when he exhaled, and the snap of regulator
as it released each breath.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:20.250
Any scuba divers here?
You know what I'm talking -- it's so distinctive,

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:25.360
and it still is, it's the same.
Any kind of regulator you're using, it's that

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.560
extremely seductive sound.
It's like the first Nikon motor drive sound,

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.140
you know.
It just has something really primitively seductive

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:39.230
about the regulator.
When Cousteau, let's see --

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.779
[READING]
Cousteau let his arm stream along his sides,

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:46.959
fluttered his legs, and glided slowly over
the sloping sand.

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:51.579
The light danced down from the surface and
flashed off the bottom until it gave way to

00:15:51.579 --> 00:15:57.450
a canyon full of dark green sea grass.
Cousteau coasted to a stop.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:03.550
He exhaled until his lungs were nearly empty
to find out what that did to his buoyancy.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:09.920
As expected, he sank slowly until he inhaled
and began to rise toward the surface.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.780
Taking a single breath from his tanks turned
him from a negatively buoyant object into

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.730
a positive one.
His lungs, he realized were a sensitive balance

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.490
system.
He steadied himself with his arms and swam

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.390
smoothly down to about 30 feet.
About one atmosphere.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:32.320
The atmosphere increases every 33 feet.
14.8 pounds at the surface, every 33 feet

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.279
another 14.8 pounds.
It's really quite a pressure change even at

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:38.760
30 feet.
[READING]

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.460
Cousteau felt a squeeze in his ears and sinuses
but no other effects of the pressure, and

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.910
no change that he could sense in the flow
of air.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.740
The regulator was operating efficiently at
two atmospheres of pressure.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.440
Cousteau smiled into his mouthpiece as he
reached the bottom of the little canyon greeted

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.390
by a flashing school of fish, round and flat
as saucers.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:04.970
He hung onto one of the rough limestone walls
and did a quick check of his equipment,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.400
patting his harness and weight belt, shrugging
his shoulders to be sure the tanks were riding

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:14.270
right and adjusting his mouthpiece.
Cousteau looked up to the surface which was

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:19.799
shining like a rippled mirror.
Directly above him, Simone was a small, silhouetted

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:23.809
doll, silhouetted doll against the dazzling
sheet of light.

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:29.850
The doll waved at him; he waved back.
Cousteau held on to his rocky anchor and studied

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:34.889
his bubbles on their way to the surface.
They swelled and flattened into mushroom shapes,

00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:38.409
identical to jellyfish as they rose through
the water.

00:17:38.409 --> 00:17:42.889
Since the bubbles flowed from the regulator
behind his head, the water in front of him

00:17:42.889 --> 00:17:48.109
was clear which gave him a moment of elation
as he thought about eventually diving with

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:52.110
his camera.
I thought about the helmet diver arriving

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:59.539
where I was in his ponderous boots and struggling
to walk a few yards obsessed with his umbilici

00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:04.859
and his head imprisoned in copper,
Cousteau remembered about that moment.

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:10.490
On skin dives, I had seen helmet divers lean
dangerously forward to take a step, clamped

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.700
in heavier pressure at the ankles than the
head.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:18.239
A cripple in an alien land.
From that day forward, we would swim across

00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:23.760
miles of country no one had ever known,
free and level with our flesh feeling what

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.600
the fish scales feel.
Cousteau looked again at the fish nosing curiously

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.980
around him.
They always returned to the horizontal from

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.149
a burst up or down.
Cousteau concluded because the horizontal

00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:41.950
must be the ideal attitude for moving in a
medium 800 times more dense than air,

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:46.419
any other attitude required an expenditure
of energy.

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:51.389
Cousteau kicked and rolled for several revolutions
on axis from the head to his feet.

00:18:51.389 --> 00:18:56.769
He turned a somersault, he did a barrel roll
he remembered from flight school.

00:18:56.769 --> 00:19:03.330
He exhaled, sank head first to the bottom,
balanced upside down on one finger, and laughed

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.289
so hard he lost his mouthpiece.
Taking a breath was slightly more difficult

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:11.029
with his head straight down than in any other
attitude

00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:14.710
and Cousteau made a mental note to report
that to Gagnon.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:19.370
He flipped upright, kicked hard, and soared
upward through his own bubbles until he was

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:24.619
just ten feet below the surface.
He swam out into deeper water and dove to

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:29.950
60 feet, three atmospheres.
Nothing he did changed the steady whistle,

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.450
gurgle and snap of his breathing.
The regulator worked perfectly with his body

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.239
in any attitude.
Three full tanks of air would give him 60

00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:44.100
minutes at 60 feet.
Cousteau figured he had used up 15 minutes.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.389
Despite the chill of the deeper water, he
was going to stay as long as he could.

00:19:48.389 --> 00:19:53.899
He swam over familiar limestone chasms that
narrowed and turned into tunnels that had

00:19:53.899 --> 00:19:59.840
terrified him as a free diver afraid of being
trapped inside with no air.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.029
Now, Cousteau coasted fearlessly into one
of them.

00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:07.369
The brilliant light from the surface dimmed
as though it were being peeled away in layers

00:20:07.369 --> 00:20:10.720
above him,
his tanks scrapped against the rocks above

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.229
him and he felt the first twinge of claustrophobia.
Cousteau's instincts for self-preservation

00:20:17.229 --> 00:20:22.080
overcame his passion to explore.
He'd done enough on his first test dive.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.769
Before heading for the surface, he rolled
on his back to take a look at the roof of

00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:30.710
the tunnel and saw that it was alive with
lobsters,

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.970
hundreds of them were backed into the niches
in the limestone.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.529
Their eyes glowing like fireflies in the dim
light,

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:42.479
their antennae flaying as they tried to get
a fix on the giant intruder.

00:20:42.479 --> 00:20:45.909
Cousteau thought about his family and friends
in ill-fed France,

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:50.899
grabbed a pair of lobsters, backed out of
the tunnel and kicked for the surface.

00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:56.100
Simone saw him rising and swam down and took
the catch the rest of the way to the beach.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.570
He made five more trips into the lobster bonanza.
Simone shuttled their catch to shore,

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.990
and Cousteau became the first meat driver
with the enormous advantage of being able

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:15.440
to breath underwater and swim like a fish.
Cousteau quickly was making movies and he

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.249
ran into Louis Malle. Actually, he didn't
run into him, he went after him.

00:21:19.249 --> 00:21:24.600
He went to Paris looking for a filmmaker once
he had alcalin working right.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.581
And he was in charge of the French Undersea
Naval Research Group,

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:32.700
and they had a boat, a ship, a little ship,
actually.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:39.129
And then he found a way to buy Calypso which
was a converted minesweeper that he then turned

00:21:39.129 --> 00:21:42.799
into one of the most famous boats that ever
sailed.

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:46.999
It's as famous as Endeavor, or Challenger
or any of the great ocean exploration boats.

00:21:46.999 --> 00:21:51.679
The little ship called Calypso.
I'm assuming that most of you have Cousteau

00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:59.600
familiarity of some kind. It's remarkable
for me to have experienced thousands of people's

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.590
stories about Jacques Cousteau.
And when I would bring --

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:08.999
one the indulgences you have to have when
you know writers is that the writers don't

00:22:08.999 --> 00:22:12.082
talk --
they talk about the same thing all the time

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:15.639
until they finish the book.
So for five years I've been talking about

00:22:15.639 --> 00:22:17.850
Jacques Cousteau.
I took a couple years off and talked about

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.139
Titanic for awhile
but I talked about Jacques Cousteau and people

00:22:22.139 --> 00:22:26.159
would tell me their Cousteau stories.
It was like I'd asked them about their operation,

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:32.580
you know, or the death of a friend.
Or you know it was one of those topics you

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.109
tell somebody something and they always tell
you something back.

00:22:36.109 --> 00:22:40.379
Cousteau became famous after making two films
that won Oscars.

00:22:40.379 --> 00:22:45.249
One was called The Silent World and it was
really the story of learning how to dive.

00:22:45.249 --> 00:22:49.619
The book for it was ghost written by a guy
named James Dugan.

00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:55.639
After that Cousteau was chartering Calypso
out to oil companies to do oil exploration

00:22:55.639 --> 00:23:00.249
which was much more efficient with scuba diving
than it was with hardhat diving.

00:23:00.249 --> 00:23:07.080
And so ironically, very deliciously ironically,
Jacques Cousteau really began as a pioneer

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.229
in oil exploration 25 years before he became
a famous environmentalist.

00:23:12.229 --> 00:23:19.539
He also developed what's called saturation
diving which was a way to saturate divers'

00:23:19.539 --> 00:23:25.899
bodies with nitrogen and pioneered all of
the relationships in fractional gas pressures

00:23:25.899 --> 00:23:29.310
inside bodies,
along with some other people who joined him

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.540
in this work.
But eventually he put divers down to 400 feet,

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.070
left them there for a month,
and they went out and did work on dummy oil

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:43.609
wellheads that was broadcast by primitive
television into the boardrooms of oil companies

00:23:43.609 --> 00:23:49.599
to show these guys that they could put oil
rigs in 400 feet of water. It was a phenomenal

00:23:49.599 --> 00:23:54.210
breakthrough and these experiments were called
Con Shelf One, Two, and Three.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:24:00.409
And he produced a film called "World Without
Sun" that also won an Oscar.

00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:07.369
After that, a producer in Hollywood, David
Wolper, who was really a remarkable fellow.

00:24:07.369 --> 00:24:11.659
There's an expository death spiral on David
Wolper because he was so fascinating that

00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:16.940
didn't really make it into the book.
But Wolper has made his bones as a producer

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:22.970
by buying the first Soviet films of Laika
the dog that the Soviets shot into space in

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.799
the late 50s
and turning it into a sensational documentary,

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:30.379
which the networks wouldn't buy.
And Wolper said, "Oh, the hell with you,"

00:24:30.379 --> 00:24:33.950
and he started his own network,
went around to all the little stations around

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:38.119
the country, broadcasts his documentary.
And finally ABC news, which was controlling

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:43.349
ABC at the time, said, "Oh, well, we'll let
you show some documentaries on our station."

00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:50.529
Hard to believe when you look at new technologies,
like yours, I always think you know we really

00:24:50.529 --> 00:24:54.639
don't know where this is going.
And like television was never perceived as

00:24:54.639 --> 00:24:59.409
a medium for selling advertising.
It was perceived as a public service to dispense

00:24:59.409 --> 00:25:02.629
news.
That was the main impulse of television, of

00:25:02.629 --> 00:25:05.769
broadcast television.
So they didn't want to do documentaries which

00:25:05.769 --> 00:25:12.950
they considered to be flawed, corrupt by music,
story line, set-up scenes and things like

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.239
that.
Anyway, Wolper broke through.

00:25:15.239 --> 00:25:20.849
He saw a Cousteau documentary that had been
produced for National Geographic on a Red

00:25:20.849 --> 00:25:26.669
Sea trip that Cousteau took for oil exploration
and with his wife sitting in their living

00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:29.679
room and he said, "You know, the television
looks like an aquarium.

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:33.629
People would love this."
So he goes to Monaco and he makes a deal with

00:25:33.629 --> 00:25:36.350
Cousteau.
And he goes down to look at Calypso.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.570
And Calypso is just a hardworking little research
ship at this point, and Wolper says this thing

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.710
looks terrible, you know.
You're going to have to paint it.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.669
I don't want divers in black costumes.
I want divers in silver costumes with yellow

00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:49.710
helmets.
I want -- you know, and so Wolper turns Cousteau

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:56.090
into a television star for a series that he
sells to ABC.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:00.590
Kind of another marvelous expository death
swirl on how that happened. But it becomes

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:06.299
"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau" which
is what most people remember about their childhoods,

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:10.490
at least people of my generation remember
about their childhoods, looking across a turkey

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:17.639
TV dinner watching Jacques Cousteau underwater.
So he does this for ten years.

00:26:17.639 --> 00:26:19.320
Then he moves on.
He does some --

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:24.169
this is when he becomes an environmentalist.
He founded the Cousteau Society and he --

00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:27.830
which is the fastest growing environmental
organization in the world -- because he can't

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:32.190
stand what he sees happening to the Mediterranean
Sea.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:39.019
Moves into PBS, does a dozen really on-the-nose
documentaries showing ocean deterioration

00:26:39.019 --> 00:26:42.880
which were very unpopular.
Nobody wanted to see them in spite of the

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.789
fact that he had 300,000 members of the Cousteau
Society,

00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:50.659
environmentalism was becoming a cause celeb
in our culture

00:26:50.659 --> 00:26:53.389
but people still did not want to watch that
for entertainment.

00:26:53.389 --> 00:27:01.029
PBS canceled him after the series, which incidentally
was funded by ARCO.

00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:07.559
The PBS series was funded by ARCO.
A lot of irony in this book or in this story.

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:14.580
And he went on the recommendation of John
Denver to meet Ted Turner, and Turner and

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.489
Cousteau --
the only one missing in that meeting was P.T.

00:27:18.489 --> 00:27:22.219
Barnum.
The two greatest showmen in American --

00:27:22.219 --> 00:27:26.090
two of the greatest showmen in American history
met in Atlanta.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:32.719
And Turner wrote him a blank check, basically,
and he produced 42 documentaries for cable.

00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:40.599
So Cousteau had moved from home movies to
Oscar-winning films to broadcast television,

00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:43.289
public television, and finally into cable
television.

00:27:43.289 --> 00:27:46.389
I'm going to save the rest of this story for
the book.

00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:50.109
You can read it.
Cousteau's life turned sour in about 1979.

00:27:50.109 --> 00:27:54.470
His son was killed.
He had started a second family without telling

00:27:54.470 --> 00:28:00.619
the first family that he had a second family.
It created a terrible rift when his first

00:28:00.619 --> 00:28:04.279
wife Simone finally died,
and he married his mistress with whom he already

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:10.769
had two children,
and then made her the heir to everything that

00:28:10.769 --> 00:28:14.639
he had done.
I know that you have a -- Jennifer was telling

00:28:14.639 --> 00:28:18.340
me you have a lair.
I apologize; I haven't explored this yet but

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.899
I will for sure.
A lair coming from Cousteau Society.

00:28:21.899 --> 00:28:28.149
But they are now the possessor of all of the
material that Jacques Cousteau produced.

00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:33.899
So that's where you want to go to get it.
His son Jean-Michel runs something called

00:28:33.899 --> 00:28:40.809
the Ocean Futures Society which is now also
producing television documentaries.

00:28:40.809 --> 00:28:45.149
And they helped me an awful lot with the book
along with Fabian Cousteau, who I think has

00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:49.219
been here, Jennifer said.
So, that's the Cousteau family.

00:28:49.219 --> 00:28:52.999
It has been a very interesting five years
for me.

00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:58.599
And it's a pleasure to share the book with
you; I hope you enjoy it. Thank you.

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:01.739
Any questions?
Any questions or Cousteau stories?

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.109
Anybody got a Cousteau story?
Yeah?

00:29:03.109 --> 00:29:08.169
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:29:08.169 --> 00:29:23.429
BRAD MATSEN: Yeah, sure, the technical details
of the first regulator. I believe the tanks,

00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:31.940
the three tanks, were at 300 PSI.
And the regulator staged it down to 14.8 coming

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:37.559
through in two stages. There are footnotes
in the book relating to this.

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:44.059
I got my advice on this from someone you enshrined
in your Hall of the Ocean recently, Phil Newton.

00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:47.330
I don't know if anybody had a chance to meet
that remarkable guy.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:52.789
But he's a pretty amazing person and he was
my guru for explaining how all this works.

00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:56.789
I mean, just the business of breathing, you
know, it's purely mechanical.

00:29:56.789 --> 00:30:01.719
It's a purely mechanical thing so when you're
designing a regulator, all you're doing is

00:30:01.719 --> 00:30:04.269
kind of really recreating your diaphragm.
That's what it is.

00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:07.549
You reduce the pressure on this thing and
it reacts a certain way,

00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:13.330
that's how we breathe by pressure reducing
and rising and falling.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:14.330
Yes?

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.519
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:22.039
BRAD MATSEN: I had just -- this, five years
ago, I had finished a book that was fairly

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:27.049
successful on William Beebe and Otis Barton.
Anybody ever heard of them?

00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:30.289
The book is called "Descent: The Heroic Discovery
of the Abyss."

00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:36.149
These were two ocean pioneers who had themselves
sealed into a four and a half steel ball with

00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:42.220
two four-inch glass,
silicon glass portholes, and lowered to a

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:46.570
half-mile into the ocean off Bermuda.
And they were the first human beings to descend

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:52.820
beyond sunlight. Anyway, I had just written
that book and I was sitting around my apartment

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.129
in New York with my girlfriend one day
and I was saying, "Geez, Marilyn, I haven't

00:30:56.129 --> 00:30:57.950
the slightest idea what I would do for an
encore."

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:03.279
With this she said, "How about Cousteau?"
And I was shocked to find that no one had

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:06.049
done it yet.
There were two biographies written in the

00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:08.809
mid-80s.
One was kind of a hatchet job.

00:31:08.809 --> 00:31:12.849
Someone really didn't like Cousteau and wanted
to make his family feel bad about him, I guess.

00:31:12.849 --> 00:31:15.940
I don't know.
And the other was this sort of a celebrity

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:20.629
biography by a man named Axel Matson but it
only took Cousteau up to 1985.

00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:24.269
He died in '97.
I just lost it.

00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:27.929
We good?
We're good.

00:31:27.929 --> 00:31:33.799
There we are.
Couldn't have a technological breakdown here,

00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:39.639
could you?
So yeah, that's how I got into it.

00:31:39.639 --> 00:31:43.899
And it -- the first thing I did is I said
maybe.

00:31:43.899 --> 00:31:47.679
You know that how the wisdom of that, right?
I mean before you get involved in something

00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:51.809
that is going to occupy your life for 2 to
5 years, you say maybe.

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:55.859
And when I was saying maybe, I went to France.
I said I want to go look at where this guy

00:31:55.859 --> 00:31:57.889
was born;
I want to find Calypso.

00:31:57.889 --> 00:32:02.519
I had no idea where Calypso was.
So I went to his village in Saint André de

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:05.830
Cubzac, saw his grave;
I saw the place he was born.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.700
I went on a train north a couple of hours
to La Rochelle where I heard Calypso was.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:14.359
And I found Calyspo, and she was sitting there
rotting on a dock, held together by canvas

00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:17.529
straps.
And when I saw --

00:32:17.529 --> 00:32:22.700
when I saw Cousteau's grave and I saw his
birthplace and all that, it wasn't quite enough.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:27.289
I had one foot in the story then.
But when I saw Calypso, I thought, you know,

00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:32.450
something's not right here.
And to me as a journalist, as a writer, that's

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:36.629
what I was looking for in his story.
So it was really seeing Calypso rotting at

00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:41.669
the dock.
Which incidentally, Francine, Cousteau's widow,

00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:47.779
who inherited everything was in a ten-year
legal battle with Jean-Michel for control

00:32:47.779 --> 00:32:52.999
of Calypso.
Now Calypso has been, is being renovated at

00:32:52.999 --> 00:32:59.179
a shipyard in Brittany with a grant from Carnival
Cruise Lines of all people.

00:32:59.179 --> 00:33:03.249
And supposedly will sail next spring, again;
knock on wood.

00:33:03.249 --> 00:33:08.249
It'd be wonderful if it happened.
Yes?

00:33:08.249 --> 00:33:18.039
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:35.090
BRAD MATSEN: Well, the question was did Cousteau
and his Les Mousquemers have any idea at the

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.039
time what they were doing when they were diving
to several atmospheres.

00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:42.570
The answer is no.
And in fact they made their first film about

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.599
a shipwreck,
and their first dive during which they spent

00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:50.159
more than 20 minutes at the bottom was to
130 feet.

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:53.759
And they were taking grave risk.
Haldane -- I don't know if, Haldane was the

00:33:53.759 --> 00:33:58.309
fellow who pioneered the real understandings
of --

00:33:58.309 --> 00:34:02.219
for hard hat divers and for people who worked
in bridge caissons,

00:34:02.219 --> 00:34:06.190
anybody who was working under pressure was
susceptible to the bends.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:11.100
So there had been some research on this.
And they had primitive dive tables but Cousteau

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.120
refined them,
he and the others who worked with him.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:22.880
Cousteau had -- his genius, really was for
getting other people to do things for him.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:30.820
I think, you know, that's probably the pattern
of innovative people who bring technological

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.890
breakthroughs to the world,
they figure out how to get people to realize

00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:36.679
their vision.
And he was a genius at that.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:42.870
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:55.860
BRAD MATSEN: The question was did they use
the dive tables in caissons and in early diving.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.990
The answer is yes;
they did the best they could.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:06.230
The real caisson's disease or the bends first
came to be a real problem when they were building

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:10.330
the Brooklyn Bridge.
Incidentally, marvelous, marvelous book on

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:16.051
the building of that bridge by David McCullough,
if anybody wants to pick up a 600-page book

00:35:16.051 --> 00:35:19.720
and read it.
And that tells a lot about how they --

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:25.900
men were coming out dying and bent.
And they could only function again when they

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.890
went down
and the original work on figuring out what

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:35.240
was causing the bends was done on goats.
And later on, actually the goat was physiologically

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.240
similar enough to the human body so that's
the test animal that they use.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.270
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:51.230
BRAD MATSEN: You know, he was -- he was an
inquisitor, but mostly Tailliez was, Philippe

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.660
Tailliez was.
Tailliez, far as I could figure, he did most

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.310
of the library work for Cousteau.
He was one the who came up with Haldane's

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:04.750
tables.
And of course, like every new technology it

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:10.160
proceeded at breakneck speed once they made
the first discovery of using the Aqua-Lung.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:16.030
Within the first six months they had some
good dive tables assembled. They really understood

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.820
what was going on.
And they -- excuse me.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:23.250
They had also lost a diver.
Six months after the first dives, they lost

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.310
a diver at the Underwater Research, in the
Underwater Research Group.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.760
So they started realizing how dangerous this
thing was.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.380
And they were also doing things like trying
to find out how deep they could go without

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.530
knowing.
And that's -- which is when they lost the

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:41.730
diver.
They would go down a rope holding on to weights

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:46.260
and hang a slate at the greatest depth and
try to get back up.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:51.020
Very risky.
Again Cousteau didn't do a lot of this himself.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:55.030
He had a chronic ear problem, a chronic ear
squeeze problem.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:59.511
Anybody else?
Yes?

00:36:59.511 --> 00:37:04.770
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:14.870
BRAD MATSEN: Yeah, he renounced it except
for the chef on Calypso.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:20.340
The chef could spear fish when they were on
expeditions.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:25.750
During the filming of The Silent World and
the earliest episodes of The Undersea World

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.510
of Jacques Cousteau,
the two films and the first television series,

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:32.450
Cousteau was on the ship a lot.
After that, he wasn't on it very much so a

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:38.420
lot of spear fishing did go on.
His objections to spear fishing were essentially

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:46.000
those that he felt for over fishing in general,
which as is often the case,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.160
it took the really sensational revelation
of what was happening to tuna in the Mediterranean

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.480
which was a real disaster as far back as the
60s.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:01.330
And Cousteau observed that.
And his environmental sensibilities gradually

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:08.001
crept up on him but were primarily motivated
by what he saw as a young man in the early

00:38:08.001 --> 00:38:11.660
40s when they were skin diving
and what he saw in the Mediterranean just

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:19.500
ten years later from pollution runoff and
over fishing.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.350
Well, thanks a lot.
Appreciate it.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:22.079
Thanks for having me.
