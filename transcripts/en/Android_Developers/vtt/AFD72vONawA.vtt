RETO MEIER: Good morning,
everyone.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.720
Welcome to Android Developers
Strike Back.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.360
Last week, we heartlessly
reviewed camera apps in the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.320
app clinic and redesigned
those apps in

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.170
Android Design In Action.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.830
Now it's time for the developers
of those apps to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.210
have their say.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.100
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.780
Today, we're lucky to be joined
by the developers of

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.510
three of the apps we looked at
last week, including IM CTO

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.530
Ramzi Risk, Glimmr developer
Paul Bourke, and Alex Drizen

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.210
of Camera ZOOM FX.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.360
As always, we're safe in the
Android Developers bunker in

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.870
an undisclosed location.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.630
So Ramzi, Paul, and
Alex are joining

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.140
us via Google+ Hangouts.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.330
RETO MEIER: Also joining us is
are resident design guru,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.654
Roman Nurik, live
from New York.

00:00:44.654 --> 00:00:46.255
ROMAN NURIK: It's
Saturday night.

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:48.100
Hey, guys.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: Before we meet the
developers, let's quickly

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.920
review last week's
prescriptions.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.305
Reto, what makes a
great camera app?

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:55.660
RETO MEIER: Well, we
went through each

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.090
of these last week.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.820
And really I think what it
comes down to is having

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.990
something which is really
compelling.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.540
It's a very visual medium
so you want

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.250
everything to just work.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.590
So, first and foremost, you want
it to look great without

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.010
contradicting the
design guide.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I think that
was something that we really

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.440
wanted to emphasize
because cameras

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.880
are an artistic medium.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.760
They deserve an artistic
user interface.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.840
They don't need to look
like an alarm

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.280
clock or a text editor.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.990
But they need to not contradict
or change our

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.320
design guidelines in a way
that might confuse users.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.790
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.560
You want it to be something
which is a really rich

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.860
experience, but not a confusing
experience.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.540
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.500
RETO MEIER: I think that's
really the cake.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.080
We want to make sure that it
supports every image in the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.730
image gallery.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.980
So there's a lot of these apps
which are providing filters

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.770
for photos.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.655
We want to make sure that it
works, even if the image that

00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:46.510
you happen to choose
is on Picasa or

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.560
some other image provider.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.260
Flickr or whatever, yeah.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.450
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.675
Hipster filters we mentioned,
some way to be able to browse

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:56.250
a community of photography,
which I think really helps

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.600
draw you in and understand
what the benefits are.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.150
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that was
something that I hadn't really

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.640
thought about.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.910
But it is a really nice bonus
to help you feel like you're

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.660
part of a larger community
and compare

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.605
your photos with others.

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:06.440
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.080
And the last point which I
wanted to mention was that it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.759
should work on devices
without cameras.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.270
So Nexus 7 devices, anything
like that, which may not have

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.760
a back-facing camera, but it's
a really great device for

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.650
looking at photos and enjoying
that community.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, remember,
though, we ended up adding one

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.290
thing at the end that we didn't
put on this slide.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.940
And that is that, at least as of
Jelly Bean, which is a much

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.720
faster OS UI wise than previous
OSes from Android,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.430
you should be able
to have jank-free

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.650
scrolling in your app.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.220
So as I'm browsing a large
number of images--

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.680
now, of course, sometimes you're
going to see a blank or

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680
placeholder image as
that image comes

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.480
down from the network.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.480
But if the image has been
loaded, you should be able to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.040
scroll up and down without
seeing any jank.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.420
And by jank, we mean just
frame rate drops, little

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.260
pauses in the scrolling.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.480
Some of the apps did that
really, really well, better

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.760
than our own apps, in fact.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which is
always impressive.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.300
So it was great to see that and
definitely something which

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.600
we are going to be looking for
in pretty much all the apps

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.640
we'll look at in the future.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.101
I think that's going to
be a big part of it.

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:06.120
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.220
RETO MEIER: So let's
get started.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.265
Let's have a look at
each of the apps.

00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:12.620
So these are the apps that
we reviewed on Friday.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.190
EyeMe, Glimmr, Camera ZOOM FX,
and, what was the other?

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.110
Picnik, I think.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.780
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think you
said EyeMe again.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.970
But it's really EyeEm.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.330
RETO MEIER: It's EyeEm.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.900
I don't know why I keep
saying EyeMe.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.390
We should ask Ramzi,
see if he's willing

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.110
to change the name.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.490
It's going to make it
much easier for me.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.820
So, happily, we do have the
developers of three of these

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.340
apps to speak to today.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.770
We are going to start with
Ramzi from EyeEm.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.100
So before we do kick over to
him, I just want to show you

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.180
quickly on screen here what the
lab results were judging

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.660
by the criteria which
we put forward.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.750
And I think the two big concerns
we had were the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.140
ability to support every the
image in the gallery.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.550
And I think we had a
couple of concerns

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.410
about the design guide.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.620
And can you remember
what was the jank

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.160
factor like on the EyeEm?

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm
sorry, I don't.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.386
RETO MEIER: I think
it was reasonable.

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:03.196
But I don't think it
was the standout.

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:08.450
So let's get Ramzi on and let
him speak for himself.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.980
So hi, Ramzi, can you spend a
little bit of time-- tell us a

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.530
little bit about yourself, a
little bit about the app, just

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.992
so the audience knows
who you are.

00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:20.170
RAMZI RIZK: Absolutely, first of
all, thanks for having us.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.209
And thanks for the review.

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:26.380
We can rename it to EyeMe as
soon as you guys release

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.121
support for Action Bar on--

00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:29.504
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:29.504 --> 00:04:32.590
RETO MEIER: That's
a fair call.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.160
RAMZI RIZK: No worries there.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.535
Yeah, so, I'm Ramzi.

00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:40.030
I'm one of the engineers behind
EyeEm and one of the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.500
four guys that founded
it originally.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.820
Not much to say about myself.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.060
I develop Android, among
other things.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.420
Recently, our team has grown
over the last few months.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.280
And now we have actually some
really awesome developers that

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.360
are taking care of most of
the Android development.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.300
And that's why the app has
gotten so much better over the

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.620
last couple months.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.150
But yeah, and EyeEm
itself is--

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.810
well, you can say it's a
photo-sharing platform.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.920
But we like to think
of it as the next

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.350
generation of photo discovery.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.690
So photo filters, hipster photo
filters are all awesome.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.180
But what we really like
are data centers.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.730
And what we think is that the
fact that you're taking photos

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.980
with your mobile means you have
so much more information

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.510
available to you that
you don't need to

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.890
make the user enter.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.070
So you don't need
the hash tags.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.910
You don't need all of that.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.295
But you have the location
information.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.720
You know what sort of
location it is.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.010
And based on that, you can
always learn a little more and

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.410
make better recommendations.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.540
And that's what we're
trying to do EyeEm.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.810
So the idea is whenever you take
a photo, you're telling

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.340
us a little bit more
about what you

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.890
like and how you live.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.890
And we use that, learn a little
more, and make better

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.890
recommendations so that you're
always getting nicer content

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.610
recommended to you.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.320
And you're always discovering
content independent of the

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.490
social graph.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.870
So it's buzzwords, topical
graph, interest

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.900
graph, all of that.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.000
And that's what we're
focusing on.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
RETO MEIER: Very nice.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.510
And that's, in fact--

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.680
I think the key thing for me
when I was browsing through

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.970
the app was being able follow
these little bread crumbs of

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.700
links, Things that,
ooh, that's taken

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.020
at the Android building.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.690
I would love to see how many
other photos there are.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.790
So that, for me, was
really compelling.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.905
It's a very, very interesting
service.

00:06:16.905 --> 00:06:20.542
RAMZI RIZK: And can I say
one more thing quickly?

00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:21.960
RETO MEIER: Please, yeah,
this is all about you.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.910
RAMZI RIZK: Awesome.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.060
First of all, again, I want to
apologize because the app

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.799
crashed while you were demoing
it, while you were trying to

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:29.110
take a photo.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.300
And this is a funny story,
because we had actually just

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.730
released that update a couple
hours before the show.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:40.260
And we'd switched our location
detection stuff into the

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.720
repository that you
have on Google

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.160
Groups, the Protips location.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.580
So we were sort of
inspired by that.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.350
And we tested it, and it was all
OK, except in the case of

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.400
latitudes that were
minus 120, 122.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.640
So basically--

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.425
yeah, and thanks for reporting
it because otherwise we

00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:01.410
wouldn't have found that.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.370
IAN NI-LEWIS: You're
very welcome.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.451
RAMZI RIZK: It was pretty
cool of you.

00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:05.530
RETO MEIER: Oh that's great.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.440
That's really interesting.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.290
So Ian's playing with
the app right now.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: I like how
Googolplex is a tech

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.240
startup near you.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.470
RETO MEIER: [CHUCKLES].

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that's
how we roll.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.860
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.460
Well, I can see a lot of
duct tape in this room.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
there you go.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.450
So, yeah, I think the scrolling

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.700
is definitely usable.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.390
But, as you said, it wasn't
the standout.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.580
There are apps that scroll
a lot better than this.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.210
But in general, the performance
is pretty good.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.560
And I really, really like the
way that you can see these

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.650
different categories, although
some of them are a little bit

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.280
mystifying.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.260
Like I don't know why that
pretty girl on the train

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.420
tracks was labeled coffee.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.390
Maybe that's some sort of
slang that I don't know.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.650
RETO MEIER: Yeah don't
ask, don't tell.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think that the
main objection that we had to

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.610
the UI was the camera button.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.280
What do you think, Ramzi?

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.840
RAMZI RIZK: I absolutely
agree.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.000
I mean, you guys definitely
know this.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.360
It's a bit of a challenge trying
to keep up with design

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.410
guidelines in a lot of ways.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.310
And especially, like you said,
when it comes to photography

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.230
apps, you have your
own spirit.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.830
And we're a very design-driven
company.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.430
So we have a team of people
that are always

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.300
tweaking this stuff.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.310
And actually, this is one of
the things that they are

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:20.710
looking at.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.200
So they started basically
looking and realized that

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.140
issue when you mentioned
it last Friday, was it?

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.480
And they are looking at
ways to improve that.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.790
So it definitely
will be moved.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:30.745
It makes sense.

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:32.039
IAN NI-LEWIS: Because it's
certainly tricky when you have

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.950
capacitive buttons.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.940
Different manufacturers
do different things.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.659
And, of course, a lot of
manufacturers do have big

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.480
fixed buttons.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.370
But they're all getting
sued so--

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.390
apparently.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.870
RETO MEIER: That's not working
out well for them.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.190
RETO MEIER: And I do notice that
this app, it does sort of

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.600
point you towards the camera
in that it has the sort of

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.670
bubbles which float around the
button to indicate, hey,

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.550
something's down here.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.660
And you should check it out.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.985
I wonder--

00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:01.020
RAMZI RIZK: That's when it's
loading more content.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.830
That's sort of the loader,
the spinner.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.940
RETO MEIER: That's
interesting.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.040
OK, that's kind of cool.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.135
Roman, I know you spent a bit
of time looking at different

00:09:08.135 --> 00:09:08.940
camera apps.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.190
And they're all going to have
this same sort of issue as to

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.815
how do you make the button
more visible.

00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:18.790
Do you have any tips for
EyeEm, in particular?

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.650
ROMAN NURIK: I think the one
problem I have with the

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.860
placement is that the other
half of the button, it's

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.730
negative space, basically.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.430
I mean, you almost see the
other half of the button

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.950
overlapping with the
home button.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:35.160
So when your finger jumps to
that location, your finger

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.950
jumps to where the
home button is.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:42.020
I think the general location,
it's kind of hard to move it

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.410
to a completely different
part of the screen.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:50.410
But having it fully on the
screen or just bigger, a

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.980
larger touch target, is going
to drastically minimize the

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.470
number of errors.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.200
But it is just something that's
difficult, especially

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.700
for camera apps, where that is
probably the most common place

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.014
for a shutter.

00:10:04.014 --> 00:10:05.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: Fair enough.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.680
RETO MEIER: That's fair.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.760
Otherwise, I think-- oh, there
was the menu button.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.910
Yeah, Ramzi help us out.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.920
You've got to get rid of
the menu button, man.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.120
RAMZI RIZK: Yeah, yeah, guys.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.700
Actually, like the stuff that
you mentioned, it's all being

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.290
taken care of.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:25.440
We're doing final testing
for supporting--

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.310
well, going up to
target SDK16.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:32.060
And we've dropped the camera
required, made it into a--

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.780
or camera provisions
not required.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.190
RETO MEIER: Awesome.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.580
RAMZI RIZK: So basically you
can use it with or without.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.335
And what else did you mention
that we took care of?

00:10:42.335 --> 00:10:45.080
RETO MEIER: Oh, the Picasa
gallery stuff, yeah.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.490
RAMSEY RISK: Sorry?

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.070
RETO MEIER: Being able to edit
images from Picasa or Flickr

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:49.600
or wherever else.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.805
RAMZI RIZK: That's
all in there.

00:10:50.805 --> 00:10:53.310
That should be hopefully out
there tomorrow night.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.486
RETO MEIER: Oh, that's
awesome.

00:10:55.486 --> 00:10:56.550
RAMZI RIZK: And with image
scrolling, I think we might

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.230
have nailed the jankiness
part.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.990
RETO MEIER: Oh, good.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.220
RAMZI RIZK: It's a
big challenge.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: It is really
hard, isn't it?

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.900
It's when you're dealing with
this much information, and

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.405
these bit maps are large enough
that any one of them

00:11:08.405 --> 00:11:10.660
could just about blow
your Java heap.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.380
We've actually spent a long
time here just trying to

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.900
figure out all of the best
techniques for that.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.740
Dan Galpin's been working
on it in his spare time.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.820
But, yeah, I will say that, at
least on this build, the

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.890
jankiness does seem to be
increasing a little bit,

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.930
making me think that there is
a memory leak somewhere or

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.230
some kind of resource leak.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.930
RAMZI RIZK: That is the
problem exactly.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.910
We do cache images, so we
have two-layer caching.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.740
And the disk caching, it seems
that the disk caching is

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.190
causing some of these issues as
well, so the seek time on

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.940
disk, which is what we're trying
to figure out right now

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.670
and finalize.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.760
RETO MEIER: We will definitely
be keeping

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.530
an eye out for that.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.960
It sounds like you've pretty
already done all the things

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.680
that we thought needed
to be doing.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.190
We're still looking for
a pure Java solution.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.100
But I think that for some photo
things, you actually do

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.880
have to drop down into the
Linux layer and the NDK.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.940
Because at that point, you can
do efficient file mapping, and

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:18.310
you can do decoding with neon
instructions instead of with

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.150
Java instructions.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.360
So that may be part of it.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.290
There's also--

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.190
one thing that you have to
avoid like the plague is

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.970
allocations during
your scrolling.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.890
Because as you acquire and
release objects, every release

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.420
is a possible GC.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.345
RAMZI RIZK: Yeah.

00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:38.080
RETO MEIER: So yeah, I mean,
we'd definitely love to hear

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.120
from you and from your team once
you guys have the next

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.650
launch out.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.300
And if it is nice and smooth, it
would be great to hear some

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.040
of the hints that you guys
might have for other

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.980
developers which
are going to be

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.300
encountering the same thing.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.780
IAN NI-LEWIS: Some of our other
guests may have some

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.980
advice as well.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.780
Let's go ahead and take a look
at Roman's redesign.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.060
Do we have one for that?

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.020
RETO MEIER: I don't
think we do.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.970
For EyeEm, I think Roman
left that one alone.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.910
I think Glimmr and
Camera ZOOM FX--

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.135
IAN NI-LEWIS: Good
the way it was?

00:13:05.135 --> 00:13:06.060
RETO MEIER: I think so.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Except for
that camera button.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.770
RETO MEIER: Except for
the camera button.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.510
Roman, you didn't feel like you
wanted to spend half an

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.476
hour talking about different
ways to put a

00:13:15.476 --> 00:13:16.466
camera button on screen?

00:13:16.466 --> 00:13:20.090
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, the thing is
to what we try to do with

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:24.820
Android Design in Action is we
try to look at the apps that

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.650
have a lot of UX possibilities,
like a lot of--

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.880
something that we can change
drastically and still maintain

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.990
the core app.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.716
I think EyeEm--

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:38.390
I'm hoping I'm pronouncing
that right.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.820
I think EyeEm, just like you
guys, are very close.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.210
The only redesigns we would do
would probably be just very

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:46.950
small visual tweaks
here and there.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.470
So we didn't think it was
worth spending too

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.220
much time on it.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think that
really the main critique that

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.900
I have of the interface is that
compared to some of the

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.530
other photo apps we saw, it
takes a long time to get a

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.130
full-size image.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:08.240
And once I've drilled down into
the full size, then you

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.540
can't just move to another
image really quickly.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.985
RETO MEIER: It would be nice to
have that type of scrolling

00:14:13.985 --> 00:14:15.190
from that perspective, too.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.720
Like I--

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.700
in general, and maybe you could
put Ramzi back up, Deb?

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.610
I think when I'm looking at this
interface, I feel like

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.210
it's got everything
that I want.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.280
But it's not ordered in the
order that I want it most.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.070
So the frequency of wanting to
go from picture to picture

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.550
with some of this information is
much lower than wanting to

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:49.100
actually interact with some
of this extra information.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.280
I wish I could just go
immediately to the screen and

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.310
then swipe back and forth with
pictures, back and forth with

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.650
pictures, and then up and down
for other things in the

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.350
category, or maybe even like
a drawer or something.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.390
Because remember that
photo apps are all

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.365
about browsing photos.

00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:06.830
RAMZI RIZK: Right.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Cool.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.423
Well, I think that's
all the time we've

00:15:09.423 --> 00:15:10.380
got to spend on EyeEm.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.990
RETO MEIER: So thank you very
much for joining us today.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.140
And thank you for a great app.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.680
We are really looking forward
to seeing the update and

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.390
getting all of the extra stuff
that we asked for.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:19.980
RAMZI RIZK: Absolutely.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.240
RETO MEIER: Thanks, man.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.980
RAMZI RIZK: Thank you, guys.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: Thanks very
much for joining us.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.120
RETO MEIER: All right, so next
up we're going to take a look

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.270
at Glimmr by Paul Bourke.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.290
So this is little bit different
from some of the

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.040
other apps that we looked
at in that it's not

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.140
about taking photos.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.740
It is about browsing
Flickr effectively.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.860
So it's very much all about
being able to create these

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.760
rich, smooth, scrolling
experiences.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.405
So we gave him a couple
of red marks.

00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:46.850
But it was on stuff which
the app doesn't

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.700
actually have to do.

00:15:51.965 --> 00:15:54.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: Why don't you
introduce yourself, Paul?

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.610
MALE SPEAKER: So Paul's actually
having some rejoining

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.535
our Hangout.

00:15:57.535 --> 00:16:00.430
Maybe we can move on to the
next app and get the next

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.050
developer on and come
back to Paul.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.670
RETO MEIER: Sure, absolutely.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.400
Yeah, we can totally do that.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.460
Lets move on to Camera ZOOM FX
while we're waiting for Paul

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.480
to get his Hangout connection
working once again.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.120
So this is a little bit more
like EyeEm in that it is

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.010
effectively a camera
replacement.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.500
I think the key difference here
was that Camera ZOOM FX

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.670
wasn't so much about the
community of photography.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.650
It was more about being able to
create great photos with an

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.290
app that replaces the
native camera.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.030
Or at least that was my
perspective, so it will be

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.990
interesting to hear Alex's.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.150
I think where we gave it a red
mark here again was some of

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.060
the community stuff and some
issues with the design guide.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.640
And this is, in fact, an
app which Roman and his

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.110
team took a look at.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.220
So I think we will actually
start by having a quick look

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.480
at some of those changes.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.610
So Roman, if you want
to talk us through.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.180
We've just got basically the
two screenshots on screen.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.690
Do you want to give us a very
quick rundown of some of the

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.600
thinking behind the changes
that you did?

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.596
And then we can let Alex
tell us why they are or

00:16:58.596 --> 00:16:59.952
are not a good idea.

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:02.720
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so like we
said in Android Design in

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.739
Action, I think the main thing
that we wanted to do is, from

00:17:05.739 --> 00:17:08.319
an interaction standpoint,
just to simplify

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.640
the location of things.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.460
So we basically put the camera
and settings on the right, and

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.099
then effects, which is I
think the most awesome

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:16.925
part of this app.

00:17:16.925 --> 00:17:18.140
There's so many awesome
effects.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.624
We put that on the left
just to simplify

00:17:19.624 --> 00:17:21.089
the model for users.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:24.219
And then we started grouping
things like the shutter time

00:17:24.219 --> 00:17:27.615
or the shutter type and
the camera settings.

00:17:27.615 --> 00:17:30.820
We moved that, along with
the other settings,

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.430
into a single screen.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.445
And then we made the image,
the entire camera preview,

00:17:35.445 --> 00:17:39.230
take up the entire screen,
which I did caveat is not

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.740
possible in some cases.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.135
But that takes up the entire
screen, And all the controls

00:17:43.135 --> 00:17:44.340
are just overlayed.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.090
The last point I wanted to make
was that we branded the

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.490
shutter, the shutter
button itself.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.680
And we made it so that it was
larger and further away, if

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.400
possible, from the home button
to try to minimize the number

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.940
of accidental touches
on the home button.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.270
So I think those are
the main things.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.220
RETO MEIER: All right,
perfect.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.170
So let's see if we can
get Alex on screen.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.470
And just tell us a little
bit about yourself Alex

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.300
and about the app.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.740
And then we can start talking
about some of the changes

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.100
which Roman and his team
suggested and how they fit

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.262
into your vision of the
app going forward.

00:18:20.262 --> 00:18:22.100
ALEX DRIZEN: Sure.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.570
My name's Alex Drizen.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:28.160
I've been working with Android
for about three years.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.160
Camera ZOOM FX was kind
of our first app.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.590
And where we've kind of been
quite fortunate is to be

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.270
involved with Android right
from the beginning.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:41.450
And I think Camera ZOOM FX was
actually the first app on the

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.070
Google Play Android market,
as it was then, to support

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.880
digital zoom.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.222
RETO MEIER: Oh, nice.

00:18:46.222 --> 00:18:47.855
ALEX DRIZEN: Yeah, so it kind of
starts in the app where we

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:50.570
were trying to solve
a lot of the--

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.070
I suppose the end of problems.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:57.040
You're going back to the days
of the G1 and 1.5, 1.6.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.440
So the app kind of
built from there.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.930
Digital ZOOM was kind of what
started it, hence the name.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:02.825
We were originally
Camera ZOOM.

00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:03.090
That

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.890
RETO MEIER: Makes sense.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.440
ALEX DRIZEN: Then we added
the FX, changed the name

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:05.650
to Camera ZOOM FX.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.400
RETO MEIER: I see what
you did there.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.010
ALEX DRIZEN: Yep, it's getting
longer and longer.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.480
I don't think we will change
the name again.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.160
But essentially, there are
two parts to the apps.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.400
As you mentioned, the first half
is at the capture time,

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.160
trying to improve on the ability
that people have

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.150
whilst they're composing
and taking pictures.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.190
So we're looking at things like
grid compositions, stable

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.763
indicators, burst mode,
time lapse.

00:19:32.763 --> 00:19:35.010
Burst mode, for example,
we can take up to

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.820
10 shots per second.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.230
And I guess kind of where we're
going is we look at

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.670
doing a major update
every year.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.270
We did a major update
last August.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.000
And-- you see my cat has
actually just come into the

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.830
frame here.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.000
RETO MEIER: Well, it wouldn't
be a Hangout without a cat.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.470
ALEX DRIZEN: Well, absolutely.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.630
And this year, we actually have
another big update, which

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.230
is coming out probably in
the next few weeks.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.660
That's

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.130
RETO MEIER: Exciting.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.805
ALEX DRIZEN: So I would like to
kind of say thanks to Roman

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:09.800
and to Nick for looking at the
redesign, actually, because

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.670
it's very good timing for us.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.750
We haven't finalized
the design.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.380
So what you've given us is the
chance to see what we've got,

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.370
what's working, and where
we can improve.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.900
So a lot of the points
that you raised we

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.860
completely agree with.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.983
Starting with things like the
shutter button, we have had a

00:20:26.983 --> 00:20:28.310
lot of feedback around that.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.440
We are making that bigger.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.740
We actually love Roman's design
with the wheel, the

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.700
cover effects around that.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.400
We think that looks
really great.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.340
We like the fact that it's
bigger, it's further away from

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.380
the home button.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.385
We also agree that probably most
useful settings in the

00:20:47.385 --> 00:20:48.980
app are the power features.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.970
So changing the auto
focus mode.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.955
So we kind of agree with Roman's
points there about

00:20:54.955 --> 00:20:57.130
moving that to the right-hand
side of the screen.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.760
I suppose the only issue that
we have is that because the

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.590
app is kind of two parts, we
have the capture time and the

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.040
effects screens, what actually
happens once you flip to the

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.070
FX mode, the effects becomes
the most important toolbar.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.430
And what we try to do is have
a similar interface at the

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.940
capture time as you would
have it at the FX time.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:17.360
RETO MEIER: That makes sense.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.750
ALEX DRIZEN: So that's kind of
one of the reasons why the FX

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.200
is on the right.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.390
But we are kind of reviewing
that to see if there is

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.790
possibly another approach
that we can take.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: I can't remember
exactly what

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.350
Roman did with this.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.850
But I remember when we reviewed
it, we said it would

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.156
actually be interesting to put
this on a view pager so I

00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:37.600
could go back and forth between
camera and effects or

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.290
have some other--

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.010
RETO MEIER: Some easy way
to switch between.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.500
I can see why you want to keep
the interface similar in that

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.530
once you learn it in one mode,
you don't want to have it in a

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:49.355
completely experience when you
switch to the other mode.

00:21:49.355 --> 00:21:52.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
so all right.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.430
So here's a beautiful photo
that I just took.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.470
Reto making kissy
faces at Dan.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:07.400
So, yeah, Roman, what all is
wrong with this interface, or

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.030
could be changed, or
could be better?

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:10.880
Or Paul--

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.630
this is Paul, right?

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.070
No, this is Alex.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.190
I'm sorry.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.126
RETO MEIER: This
is Alex, yeah.

00:22:13.126 --> 00:22:16.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: Or Alex, do you
want to weigh in on what

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.956
you're changing here?

00:22:17.956 --> 00:22:20.420
ALEX DRIZEN: Yeah, we've
actually got a whole bunch of

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.070
changes coming down the line.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.110
We're actually moving up from
version 3.5, which is on the

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.780
Google Play now, up
to version 4.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.250
So it is a major update.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.940
I mean, some of the features
that are going

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.870
in there, auto rotate.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.735
I know that's something
that you mentioned.

00:22:34.735 --> 00:22:35.040
RETO MEIER: Oh, nice.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.590
ALEX DRIZEN: And we absolutely
agree that

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.660
needs to be in there.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.200
It's actually been quite a bit
of work because there's so

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.920
many controls in the
camera screen.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.520
And we actually have to--

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.930
in terms of the actual--

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.370
it's a landscape screen, but
you have to present some

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.520
controls kind of turned
on their side.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.830
So that has created
work for us.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.236
But we're pretty confident,
and I'm happy with the way

00:22:54.236 --> 00:22:54.820
that's gone.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.580
RETO MEIER: Oh, that's great.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.640
ALEX DRIZEN: We also, following
on from your

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.110
feedback, you talked about being
able to work on devices

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.410
with front-facing camera
only or devices

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:05.830
that have no camera.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.085
That's something that will
be fully-supported.

00:23:08.085 --> 00:23:09.230
RETO MEIER: Oh, that's
awesome.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.435
ALEX DRIZEN: We're looking at
doing more on the holo theme.

00:23:12.435 --> 00:23:15.500
So, again, Roman's work,
we loved it.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.290
I showed it to my designer, and
he's kind of, yeah let's

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.800
kind of do what my design has
done and let's kind of do what

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.890
Roman's done and put
the two together.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.370
And we think we've got something
really good.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.990
RETO MEIER: This is
such a treat.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.080
So we review these apps.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.970
And then within a couple of
weeks, we're going to have new

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.340
versions of all of them
with all of the

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.450
features we asked for.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:38.150
We should review more apps.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:38.970
No, that's really great, man.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.150
That's great news.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.470
I kind of almost feel like
there's not much left to ask,

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.730
because we can just look in a
couple weeks and see exactly

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.370
what they've done.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:50.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm really curious
to know what sort of

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.820
problems you had or what sort
of challenges you needed to

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.240
overcome developing this
app for Android?

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.640
Because obviously it does a lot
of very complicated work.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.720
ALEX DRIZEN: Yeah, I guess
because we were kind of there

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.520
from the beginning, we were
always trying to support right

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.990
back to Android 1.5.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:16.390
And when you look at cameras,
the main complexity is in the

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.340
camera screen, not in
the effects screen.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.830
And on the camera side of
things, it's really just

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:26.900
trying to pull together a
consistent app which can deal

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.790
with if everyone has different
focus modes, different scene

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.250
modes, different filters
available, the zoom works

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.480
differently on different
phones.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.660
We actually managed to even
provide zoom on phones like

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.740
the Nexus S, which didn't
support any

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.522
kind of zoom at all.

00:24:44.522 --> 00:24:48.790
So it really has just been
a case of just going--

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:52.110
at home, I have eight
devices myself.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.400
And we have testers all around
the world who are giving us

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.220
feedback and saying
what works.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.990
One of my test devices is not
necessarily going to work

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.110
somewhere else.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:05.140
So the real the complexity has
to do with fragmentation.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.880
But it's also been a real
opportunity because we're now

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.430
in a position where we have
over a million users all

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.040
around the world.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.330
And we're getting this
amazing feedback from

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.070
all different places.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.310
So it's an opportunity.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.560
But it's an ongoing challenge.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.680
Every time a major new device
comes out, like the Nexus 7,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.670
before that the Galaxy
Nexus, we were

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.700
always facing problems.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.310
And on NDK, one of the problems
that we have is that

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.895
we get the devices after you.

00:25:34.895 --> 00:25:35.290
RETO MEIER: Good point.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.650
ALEX DRIZEN: So often our
users will find problems

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.640
before we even have a
chance to fix them.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.040
So it's an ongoing battle.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.720
But we're really happy with
where we've got to.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.596
I think this particular release,
we're focusing a lot

00:25:47.596 --> 00:25:51.830
on the design and adding some
additional camera features.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.400
So, for example, things like
brightness, exposure controls,

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.770
concept controls, which,
again, vary quite a bit

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.010
between devices.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.850
Pinch to zoom, we think we've
got that working now in a way

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.750
which won't affect the
older devices.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.570
So we're kind of happy with
the way it's looking.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.610
We're going out to
beta next week.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.800
So anyone who wants to come and
take part in that, just

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.350
shoot me an e-mail.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.460
RETO MEIER: I suspect that
we'll get some takers.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.730
We're kind of running out of
time a little bit, but I did

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.500
want to dig a little bit deeper
into what you talked

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.500
about having testers
all over the world.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.650
So I think with a camera
replacement app, as you say,

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.060
you're going to be right on the
forefront of really having

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.630
to test on a lot of different
hardware, because there are

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.660
just a lot of different
cameras.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.360
So are those people who work as
part of your organization?

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.485
Or do you have a public alpha
testing group of people who

00:26:46.485 --> 00:26:48.720
you send out to test
the app on a lot

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.215
of different hardware?

00:26:50.215 --> 00:26:55.250
ALEX DRIZEN: We have a group,
who every time we go to beta,

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.770
they're pretty much our
core group of testers.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.920
And that's going to be
between 10 and 15.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.075
And then, in addition to that,
what we do is, once we are at

00:27:05.075 --> 00:27:08.210
the stage where we're ready to
go to do beta, we do invite

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.860
people through channels
such as this.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.920
Or when people e-mail our
support desk, we will kind of

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.770
say, actually, the feature
you're requesting, that's

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.260
something we've worked on.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.320
Would you be interested
in seeing the

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.540
beta for that feature?

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.350
And nine times out of 10,
they're going to say yes.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.360
Send it to me straight away.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.580
If someone's emailed you
recently, you know that they

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.980
have an active interest
in your app.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.050
And the fact that they're taking
to you, you know that

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.780
they're going to spend the time
looking at it giving you

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.610
valuable feedback.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.350
So, to be honest, it's
never been a

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.840
problem getting testers.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.580
That's never been a
problem at all.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.280
I suppose having enough time
to spend on each case is

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.670
probably more challenging.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.350
RETO MEIER: I can see
how that would work.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.210
I mean, as a user, that's
what you really want.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.050
You email the developer and
go, yeah, this thing isn't

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:54.940
working on my phone.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.880
Or I want this feature.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.705
And to get that email back
going, yeah actually, we've

00:27:57.705 --> 00:27:58.600
fixed that.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.870
Do you want to beta test it?

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.260
Is kind of an awesome
experience.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.880
Maybe it's because
we're geeks.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.500
But it certainly tells me the
developer cares about the app

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.250
and cares about the community
of people developing it.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I think as
a developer, feeling like

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.450
you've got a community
behind you has got

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.400
to be a great feeling.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.830
So bravo.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.350
We are just about out of time.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.240
Was Paul able to get in?

00:28:24.668 --> 00:28:27.180
MALE SPEAKER: Paul was unable
to join the Hangout.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.380
I think it had something
to do with his Tablet.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.990
RETO MEIER: I think he was
joining us via a device rather

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.320
than a computer, which
is impressive

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.010
that it can be done.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:40.480
It's unfortunate it
didn't work out.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.430
But we will try and get some
feedback from Paul and maybe

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.180
share it on G+ afterwards.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.130
I think it would have been
really useful to talk to Paul,

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.530
because I think Glimmr was the
app which had the incredibly

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.910
smooth scrolling.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, this
is exactly what happened.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.040
We said, oh, maybe some people
will give us some hints about

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:56.780
smooth scrolling.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.260
Boom, Paul's gone.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.470
I didn't realize that was
this kind of show.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.280
RETO MEIER: Yeah, he's going,
yeah, you're cutting off.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.346
I'm going through a tunnel.

00:29:06.346 --> 00:29:08.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right, let's
go ahead and wrap up then.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:09.640
Thanks very much, Alex.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.620
Thank you, Ramzi.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.705
And thanks, in absentia, Paul.

00:29:13.705 --> 00:29:14.750
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.330
Thank you all for joining us.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.720
It's really great to hear back
from you developers to find

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.500
out a lot about what the
challenges are, how you've

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.850
overcome them, and, in this
instance, especially to find

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.650
out all of the cool stuff that
you've already done.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.040
And we'll get to look
at very soon.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, we really
appreciate everyone who's

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.450
taken the time to listen to
what we have to say and

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.740
implement design guidelines and
Android features that you

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.770
didn't have before.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.480
That's always not only a great
way to satisfy your users, but

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.640
a great way to get the Android
development community to look

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.520
at your app and possibly even
promote it on Google Play.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.390
So we will certainly be looking
out for these updates,

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.200
because we want to nominate
those for

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.840
featuring on Google Play.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.560
We don't have very much
power in that sense.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.750
But we can always at least--

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:01.100
RETO MEIER: We try.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:01.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: --send an email.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.525
RETO MEIER: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:30:03.525 --> 00:30:05.360
And I think these apps are good
enough that it's going to

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:05.710
be self-evident.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think
they're fantastic.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.100
RETO MEIER: Put them in front of
someone and I think they'll

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.320
see the benefits
straight away.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.460
Also coming up later this week,
so on Friday me and Ian

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.600
are going to be back for the
app clinic to get the apps

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.160
which we're going to then talk
about next week on this show.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.030
So this week, we're going to be
looking at travel planning

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.120
and booking apps.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.330
And we're going to go back to
our desks after this and

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.390
choose the apps to look at.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.700
So if you haven't already
nominated your favorite travel

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.580
booking and or planning
app, do run on to

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.480
the Moderator page.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.490
And now you can find that
at the developers.googl

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.390
e.com/live/android.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.970
Navigate your way to the app
clinic show for this Friday.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.810
And then your Moderator page
will be right there.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: And in what will
probably turn out to be a

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.760
fruitless attempt to be more
prepared, we are also going to

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.850
choose the apps for next week
tomorrow so that we'll have a

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.280
week to look at them.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.130
So if you have any specific
ideas for--

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.160
I'm sorry what was the--

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.650
RETO MEIER: I have no idea.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: You should go look
and look at our Moderator

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.770
and find out what we decided
next week is going to be.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:04.910
RETO MEIER: Indeed, indeed.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: What were we
saying about being prepared?

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.210
RETO MEIER: That we we're going
to try and do it and

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.050
fail miserably.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.120
So I think we nailed that.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.758
IAN NI-LEWIS: The intro
to this show went

00:31:10.758 --> 00:31:11.310
well, didn't it?

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.370
RETO MEIER: It did.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.675
IAN NI-LEWIS: The first couple
minutes, they were good.

00:31:14.675 --> 00:31:16.650
RETO MEIER: I'm happy that we
went that far at least.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.830
And then, of course, we've
got the games review.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.740
And I don't know who's
going to be with Dan.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.385
And I don't think we should
even try to guess.

00:31:22.385 --> 00:31:23.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what?

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:26.740
The entire game show tomorrow
is going to be a potluck.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.270
It's going to be very
interesting.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.380
RETO MEIER: That's something
to look forward to.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.510
Let's see, so, yeah,
that's it.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.050
Again, thank you to our
developers for joining us, and

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.880
to Daniel for engineering the
show, and to Roman for joining

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.370
us all way from New York,
where it's late in the

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.280
afternoon by now.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.090
And I'm surprised he hasn't
already gone home.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:48.840
My name's Reto.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm Ian.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.310
RETO MEIER: And thank you
again for joining us.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: See you later.
