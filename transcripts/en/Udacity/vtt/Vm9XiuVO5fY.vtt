00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One way to convince people something is hard is to post a challenge,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
provide some motivation, and see if anyone can solve it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This particular challenge was posted in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in an article that he wrote in August 1977

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that was introducing RSA to a wide audience.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The technical paper on RSA was published shortly after that in 1978.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
As part of this article, he asked for Ron Rivest to come up with a challenge.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This was the challenge that was published in this article.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Given a public key and an e--and here we have n as a 129-digit number--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and the intercepted cipher text, figure out what the message was.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That can be done by factoring n.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Ron Rivest estimated that factoring n would take about 40 quadrillion years.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It turns out this was a little bit off.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The actual time was 17--without the quadrillion--years.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It was shown by a team lead by Derek Atkins in 1994

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that these two numbers multiplied together to produce the n in the challenge.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
For the quiz, the question is what does this mean--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the fact that Derek Atkins and his team were able to break n into these two factors.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This is kind of a silly quiz, but I hope you'll think about it anyway.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Some of the answers are more serious than others.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It could mean that RSA is fundamentally broken.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It could mean that the magic words are "squeamish ossifrage."

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It could mean that RSA keys need to be longer than 129 for good security.

00:01:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Or it could mean that time flies when you're factoring,
