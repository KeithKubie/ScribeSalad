00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I think that the revolution in

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010
I think that the revolution in
 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.640
I think that the revolution in
neuroscience is sort of happening in two

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650
neuroscience is sort of happening in two
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.039
neuroscience is sort of happening in two
fronts one is the study of epigenetics

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
fronts one is the study of epigenetics
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.990
fronts one is the study of epigenetics
and the best way to think of the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
and the best way to think of the
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.100
and the best way to think of the
epigenome is that if the our genomes our

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
epigenome is that if the our genomes our
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.499
epigenome is that if the our genomes our
DNA is the hardware of a computer our

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
DNA is the hardware of a computer our
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.599
DNA is the hardware of a computer our
epigenome is the software so it's

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
epigenome is the software so it's
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.240
epigenome is the software so it's
actually sort of telling our DNA how it

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
actually sort of telling our DNA how it
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.439
actually sort of telling our DNA how it
should be expressed how much of a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449
should be expressed how much of a
 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.029
should be expressed how much of a
particular protein should be expressed

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
particular protein should be expressed
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.870
particular protein should be expressed
at what time during our life and the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
at what time during our life and the
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.109
at what time during our life and the
epigenome is heavily influenced by our

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
epigenome is heavily influenced by our
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970
epigenome is heavily influenced by our
environment and not just our environment

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
environment and not just our environment
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709
environment and not just our environment
our parents environment and their

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
our parents environment and their
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.799
our parents environment and their
parents environment some of the software

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
parents environment some of the software
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.740
parents environment some of the software
programs are so embedded that they make

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
programs are so embedded that they make
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.049
programs are so embedded that they make
these changes that last for generations

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059
these changes that last for generations
 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.270
these changes that last for generations
others for just a small period of time

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280
others for just a small period of time
 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.340
others for just a small period of time
so the revolution is really coming in

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350
so the revolution is really coming in
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.139
so the revolution is really coming in
understanding that there is no more

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
understanding that there is no more
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.110
understanding that there is no more
nature versus nurture debate nature and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
nature versus nurture debate nature and
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.959
nature versus nurture debate nature and
nurture are intertwined they're really

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
nurture are intertwined they're really
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.660
nurture are intertwined they're really
impossible to separate and as we look at

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
impossible to separate and as we look at
 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.240
impossible to separate and as we look at
our study of brain and behavior we need

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
our study of brain and behavior we need
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.790
our study of brain and behavior we need
to understand that there is no behavior

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
to understand that there is no behavior
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.219
to understand that there is no behavior
there is no biology outside of the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
there is no biology outside of the
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200
there is no biology outside of the
environment and then the second point I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
environment and then the second point I
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.950
environment and then the second point I
think in neuroscience for a long time

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960
think in neuroscience for a long time
 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.980
think in neuroscience for a long time
we've been gender blind so many studies

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
we've been gender blind so many studies
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.780
we've been gender blind so many studies
for many reasons have only focused on

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790
for many reasons have only focused on
 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.510
for many reasons have only focused on
males of the species or have not

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
males of the species or have not
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640
males of the species or have not
compared men and women and they haven't

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650
compared men and women and they haven't
 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350
compared men and women and they haven't
compared male and female brains and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
compared male and female brains and
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.020
compared male and female brains and
although it's quite controversial and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
although it's quite controversial and
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819
although it's quite controversial and
for whatever reason people want to take

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
for whatever reason people want to take
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.520
for whatever reason people want to take
different to mean smarter or better I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
different to mean smarter or better I
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.010
different to mean smarter or better I
don't think that we can ignore anymore

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
don't think that we can ignore anymore
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.100
don't think that we can ignore anymore
that male and female brains have certain

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
that male and female brains have certain
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.319
that male and female brains have certain
circuits that are sexually dimorphic the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
circuits that are sexually dimorphic the
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.999
circuits that are sexually dimorphic the
same way that we have downstairs regions

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
same way that we have downstairs regions
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.039
same way that we have downstairs regions
that are different we have some upstairs

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
that are different we have some upstairs
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.039
that are different we have some upstairs
regions that are different as well and

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049
regions that are different as well and
 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.510
regions that are different as well and
moving forward in the study of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
moving forward in the study of
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789
moving forward in the study of
neuroscience we're gonna have to really

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
neuroscience we're gonna have to really
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920
neuroscience we're gonna have to really
pay attention to the fact that there are

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
pay attention to the fact that there are
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660
pay attention to the fact that there are
these differences to understand what

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
these differences to understand what
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.470
these differences to understand what
they mean for behavior

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480
they mean for behavior
 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.540
they mean for behavior
