00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.780
Welcome back to Google
Developers Weekly

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.514
for February 3, 2014.

00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:13.430
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.680
of what's happening in the
world of Google Developers,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.980
on the set and off.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.390
Since the introduction of
version 3 of the YouTube data

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.760
API, many developers are
migrating from version 2,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.960
as you might expect.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.470
From New York, Jeff
Posnick walks us

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.990
through the API
calls you need to get

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.031
a list of the videos
uploaded in a given channel,

00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:31.150
featuring live demos
using the API Explorer.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.224
You can learn this and
more at youtube.com/dev.

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:36.390
In our second event,
highlighting Orbitz integration

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450
with Google Wallet,
Yousef Attalla of Orbitz

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.783
joins Maru Bouza to demonstrate
how their customers earn

00:00:40.783 --> 00:00:43.120
and track loyalty
points called Orbucks

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.440
using the Orbitz and
Google Wallet Apps.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.820
Alex Maier, Community Manager
for Google Cloud Platform,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.320
took the stage here
in Mountain View

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.260
to announce live the winners
of the Google Cloud Developer

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.130
Challenge.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.750
There were 12 winners from
6 regions of the world.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.050
Did you win, or you want
to find out who did?

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.280
Check it out, and if anybody
asked, I voted for you.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.960
Tomorrow's great apps are going
to come from minds much younger

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.660
than my own, and the best
way to get the kids coding

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.250
is to teach them how early.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010
Developer advocate
Julia Ferraioli

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.760
spoke with Ashley
Galvin about her work

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.130
with girls who code, and
how she develops curricula

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.910
that appeals to everyone.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.567
And our GDL weekly
wrap-ups would not

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:19.150
be complete without
another appearance

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.556
from our Udacity CS256
mobile web dev team.

00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:24.430
Chris Wilson, Sean
Bennett, and Peter Lubbers

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.450
are back with a third
edition of Office Hours

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.300
tackling lessons 6 and 7.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.530
You can cram in our YouTube
channel and find out more

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.070
at udacity.com/course/cs256.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.570
In addition to all
this great stuff,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.153
the Android developers
team brought us

00:01:37.153 --> 00:01:39.430
new DevBytes, focused
on recording out videos,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.490
and our personal favorite, best
practices for playing games.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.800
As far as I see it, any game
I win was designed perfectly.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.530
Check them out at
 developers.google.com/live/android.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.280
Also, Dart fans got a new
release of the Dart Editor

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.560
in the dev channel this week.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.030
Lots of cool new features,
including the start for support

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.420
for Angular and
Json Quick Assist.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.870
Check it all out
at dartlang.org.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.120

miss a thing from the world
