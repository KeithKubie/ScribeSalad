Thanks Kyle. Let's use the day object to do another calculation. If you haven't

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.693
already booted up BlueJ, you should do it now and open up the days project.

00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:14.880
Mariner4 launched November 28, 1964. It took 228 days to arrive on Mars. What

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.430
was its arrival date? Before you do this, I want to show you one more thing

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.470
that you can do with objects. I've opened up the days project in BlueJ. I can

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.280
make a day object and now I can quickly see exactly the day that's in here

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.010
using the two string method. I won't actually do it, because I want you to be

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.000
able to do this yourself. And try it. But that should make it much quicker. So

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.615
here are some hints. Use a day object to do the calculation And use the

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.930
toString method to read the day. Make sure that when you write the arrival

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.000
date, you use the same format that the toString method uses. And don't worry

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.170
too much if you don't have BlueJ working yet. You can just skip to the answer

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.670
video and watch it carefully. There will be more examples you can do soon.
