♫ music ♫

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:17.805
My name is Kaitlyn Hova.

00:00:18.647 --> 00:00:22.647
I'm a software engineer, neuroscientist,
and a musician.

00:00:23.897 --> 00:00:25.927
I also have synesthesia.

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:29.656
Synesthesia is a blending of the senses.

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:32.574
1 in 23 people have a form of it.

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:36.867
For me, when I hear, 
specific musical notes,

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:38.627
I see specific colours...

00:00:39.087 --> 00:00:43.087
...and these colours are much brighter...
at night.

00:00:43.087 --> 00:00:53.177
♫ violin ♫

00:00:53.177 --> 00:00:56.007
What you're seeing in front of me, 
is a lot like what I see

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:57.007
...when I hear this music.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.771
♫ violin ♫

00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:04.041
Each one of these coloured 
lights corresponds to a particular note

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:06.085
The colours are always the same.

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:17.555
♫ violin ♫

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:19.785
I've seen these colours my whole life.

00:01:19.797 --> 00:01:23.477
But I didn't know that was unusual, 
until I was 21 years old.

00:01:23.477 --> 00:01:27.697
♫ violin ♫

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:30.921
It was the final music theory course, 
for my music major,

00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:33.634
that, at the end of my class, 
my professor mentioned

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:36.292
that some people can physically 
see sounds as colours.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:39.292
♫ violin ♫

00:01:39.292 --> 00:01:42.268
And to me... I thought... duh...

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.631
...and everyone in the classroom 
turned to look at me.

00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:47.021
♫ violin ♫

00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:49.682
We did tests, 
where they played notes on the piano

00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:50.682
...and I told them what colour it was...

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:53.200
♫ violin ♫

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.081
...and at that point I knew 
that I had synesthesia.

00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:02.991
♫ violin ♫

00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:05.961
Synesthesia can manifest itself 
in so many different ways.

00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:09.873
It can blend itself together 
vision, taste, smell, sound...

00:02:09.873 --> 00:02:10.873
...it can be almost anything.

00:02:10.873 --> 00:02:12.371
♫ violin ♫

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:16.042
But for me... it's always been about 
the colours in music.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.027
♫ violin ♫

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.950
Synesthesia makes the music 
a very visual experience.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.010
♫ violin ♫

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.770
Now, listening to a piece 
is sort of like watching a video.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.882
♫ violin ♫

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:32.971
I can listen to it over and over again...

00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:35.644
...and focus on different colours and patterns, 
each time.

00:02:35.644 --> 00:02:54.304
♫ violin ♫

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:56.400
Now... if you turn to face the city... 
(using arrows on top left corner of video)

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.299
you can really step into my shoes, 
and see what I see.

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:57.947
♫ violin ♫

00:03:57.947 --> 00:04:01.259
I'm not sure what I would do,
if my synesthesia went away.

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.517
But, I'm sure that the world 
would look a lot different.

00:04:05.517 --> 00:04:09.517
♫ violin ♫

00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:18.761
