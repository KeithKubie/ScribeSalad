00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.460
Thanks to Curiosity Stream for supporting Crash Course.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.960
Hello!

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960
As you might have noticed, I’m not Craig
or Lily.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.880
My name’s Michael Aranda, and I’ll be
your host for the last third of Crash Course Film.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.080
Now, since we’re getting to know each other, let me ask you a question: What’s your favorite film?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.340
Maybe there’s a movie that makes you wanna
get fit, or become a spy, or save the world

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.220
Or maybe you love anything that Zoe Saldana
is in, because she’s just the coolest.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.539
Films can have an awesome story or sloppy
lighting, dazzling special effects or characters

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.410
who are just straight-up stereotypes.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.160
All these things can affect how you feel about
a movie, and whether you’d give it a thumbs

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.930
up on Netflix… because that’s a thing
now.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.140
But they can also affect how it fits into
cinema history, and impacts the world around us.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.980
We’ll think critically
about a lot of very different movies, starting

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.210
with an American classic that many people
call “the greatest film ever made.”

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.450
It came from ambition and some unusual circumstances,
with Orson Welles at the helm.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.640
And even though it’s been a long time since
its release in 1941, this film’s technical

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.600
cleverness and story still resonate with audiences
today.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.940
I’m talking, of course, about Citizen Kane.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:17.540
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.480
Calling Citizen Kane one of the best films
of all time is a complicated claim to make.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.080
To be honest, the idea of ranking movies and
making a top ten list may be fun, but it’s

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.790
not what film criticism is really about.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.600
It’s about thinking deeply about how the
movie works, both to us as an audience member,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.580
and within history and society.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.920
It’s about understanding, deconstructing,
feeling, and learning.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.140
So is Citizen Kane the “Greatest Movie Ever
Made?”

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.090
Well, we can’t answer that, because it’s
not the question we should be asking.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.630
But there’s clearly something about it that
sticks with us.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.000
And maybe that something is its origin story.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.140
Orson Welles was hoisted into the spotlight
at the ripe young age of 23, when he was performing

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.910
with The Mercury Theatre company — a troupe
that he helped create.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.450
In 1938, Welles directed and narrated the
radio drama The War of the Worlds, and supposedly

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.680
struck fear into some listeners who thought
that an actual alien invasion was happening.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.280
Welles on the radio: We know now that in the early years of the 20th century...

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.080
This world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.100
But he also caught the attention of studio

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.600
execs at RKO, one of the five film studios
that reigned during the Golden Age of Hollywood.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.120
Not only that, but they gave him complete
creative control, which was, like, really

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.379
unusual at the time.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.099
So he did what any plucky artist in his mid-20s
would do: he packed up his stuff and invited

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.980
his buddies from the Mercury Theatre company
to come with him to Hollywood.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.689
Now, I don’t want to sell them short.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.340
This was a group of very good actors.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.349
And, despite his lack of experience with the
movie industry, Welles leapt into this project

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.129
with a lot of ambition, performing experience,
and fresh ideas.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.689
He wanted to be involved in as many aspects
of the film as possible, from directing to

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.689
starring as the film’s eponymous Charles
Foster Kane.

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.719
Welles filled out his production team with
other talented men from Hollywood who were

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.170
itching to experiment with their craft — people
like Gregg Toland, a cameraman who contributed

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.359
a lot to the film’s look and technical innovations.

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.270
And Welles is credited as co-writer with Herman
J. Mankiewicz, a journalist who hopped over

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.480
into the world of filmmaking, and was an experienced
screenwriter by the time he worked on this project.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.960
Citizen Kane tells the life story of a wealthy
newspaper magnate.

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:20.799
The first time we meet Kane, he’s on his
deathbed in a massive mansion called Xanadu,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.740
dramatically murmuring his last word: “Rosebud.”

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.639
The story is told in flashbacks through interviews
with people Kane once knew, like his friend

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.540
and fellow reporter Jedediah Leland, his business
manager Mr. Bernstein, and his second wife,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.670
Susan Alexander Kane.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.659
In the last sequence of shots, we find out
that “Rosebud” is referencing a sled he

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.450
had as a kid, before he was separated from
his family and sent to boarding school with

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.450
a new guardian.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.200
So Citizen Kane could be a story about…
well… a lot of things: the loss of childhood,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.859
human flaws, memory, or the complications
of power and wealth.

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.109
Film criticism is... pretty subjective.

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.000
But Citizen Kane is also a story that was
influenced by real life — specifically,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.310
tycoons like the news mogul William Randolph
Hearst.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.950
While Welles insisted the film wasn’t meant
to be a personal attack on Hearst, all of

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.720
the parallels and the fact that Mankiewicz
was a former friend of Hearst made him take

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.220
the film real personally.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.180
And when you have a buttload of money, and
power over lots of news outlets, your grudges

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.299
become public.

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.299
Fast.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.410
Initially, RKO and Orson Welles planned on
debuting Citizen Kane at the Radio City Music

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.230
Hall, like other big RKO movies.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.710
But the venue turned it down.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.700
Eventually, the the film’s release was delayed
until May 1st, 1941 in New York.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.520
And the critical reception was actually pretty
good!

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.590
A review by Kate Cameron, published on May
2nd in the New York Daily News, called Citizen

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.340
Kane “one of the most interesting and technically
superior films that has ever come out of a

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.340
Hollywood studio.”

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.980
The controversy did mess with the film’s
commercial success, though.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.010
It didn’t gain much public traction until
it was released again in the 1950s.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.570
So part of what makes Citizen Kane memorable
is that it was an ambitious project, headed

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.280
by a maverick filmmaker, and had a lot of
drama around its release.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.220
We humans do love ourselves some drama.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.440
But the content of the film speaks for itself,
too.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.890
The creators of Citizen Kane had the freedom
to play and innovate.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.760
Many of their technical experiments changed
the way film was being used as a storytelling

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.000
medium — which, arguably, could be another
way to define “greatness.”

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.060
It takes a keen eye to notice some of these
tricks, or at the very least some good commentary tracks.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.100
A lot of the innovation had to do with cameras.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.630
Gregg Toland, the cinematographer, helped
pioneer the use of deep focus lenses, so that

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.590
everything in a scene is in focus at once,
not just the foreground or the background.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.390
Citizen Kane doesn’t use focus to guide
your attention in a scene.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.160
Instead, things like dialogue or movement
draw your eye to certain people at certain times.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.720
It’s very much like theater, where Welles
had honed his directing and acting chops.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.280
They use perspective to surprise you, like
to mess with your sense of scale when Kane

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.590
walks toward a normal-looking background,
only to be dwarfed by a huge window or fireplace.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.710
It’s a neat visual effect, but also punctuates
the story with a little metaphor.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.750
You’re seeing this man physically shrink
in his environment as he’s losing control

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.320
over his business and life.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.340
And camera movements are combined with other
practical effects to really immerse you in

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.360
the story.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.570
Take the scene where Kane is a kid playing
in the snow, while his parents are inside

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.710
a cabin and talking about sending him away.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.940
The camera pulls back through a window, and
eventually stops on the other side of a dining table.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.460
But, from the final framing, you can see that
the table would’ve been in the way of the

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.460
movement.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.840
The trick is in the set: it’s actually a
mechanical table that splits and comes back together.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.400
So the mise-en-scene is never broken, and
the scene can keep playing out.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.900
You, the viewer, are none the wiser, because
you’re wrapped up in this incredible illusion

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.940
of reality the film has constructed.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.270
Other practical tricks are used in The Inquirer
office, where Kane’s newspaper staff works.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.640
These scenes were unusual for movies at the
time, because there are visible ceilings.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.360
Now this doesn’t sound that weird.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.720
Because, y’know, normal office buildings
have ceilings.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.940
But production teams usually stuck lights
and sound equipment above their actors’ heads.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.460
So to keep the movie magic intact, they had
to keep ceilings out of frame.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.940
In this case, the lights and microphones are
still up there — just, hidden right above

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.690
the ceilings, which are made of muslin sheets.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.230
They also cut out chunks of the floor to make
room for the camera, so they could get dramatic

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.210
low-angle shots, making the actors look larger
than life.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.300
The trick to Citizen Kane is that all these
effects — which are everywhere — don’t

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.580
feel like effects in the same way a CGI dragon
does.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.660
They subtly draw you into the world.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.780
For instance, Welles often blends matte drawings
with physical sets, to make everything seem

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.960
more immersive, despite a limited budget.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.840
This is how they create the beginning of the
film, leading us toward the window of Xanadu

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.950
and Kane’s deathbed.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.360
Plus, it’s how they make the inside of Xanadu,
the outside of The Inquirer building, and

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.290
audiences during the big campaign speech and
opera.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.620
These tricks were accomplished with optical
printers, which let them shoot and light two

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.710
images or scenes separately, and stitch them
into one.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.111
Effects also let them add visual twists to
the story, in ways Welles couldn’t with

00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:33.111
live theatre.

00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:37.070
Like when Susan Alexander is performing in
the opera, we crane up from the stage and fade

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.960
into the rafters to see the opera’s production
team reacting to how awful her performance is.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.120
The transition is precise and deliberate,
and nowhere near as easy as dropping a fade

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.800
into a digital video editor today.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.000
Now, maybe you noticed some of these technical
tricks, but they’re done well and not obvious

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.830
unless you’re paying close attention.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.790
And that’s one of the coolest things about
good filmmaking.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.510
But, a lot of the time, what makes our favorite
movies so memorable is just a well-told story.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.990
And, if you think about it, Citizen Kane doesn’t
really have a mind-blowing plot.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:09.280
It’s a straightforward tale about a powerful,
wealthy newspaper tycoon and his shortcomings,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.031
and the dialogue is all pretty crisp and generic.

00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:15.090
You get a newsreel summary of Kane’s life
at the beginning, but it’s mostly told through

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.860
flashbacks, and they’re part of what make
the film feel so true to life.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.490
And even though it’s easy to link Charles
Foster Kane with William Randolph Hearst,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.650
this archetype of a driven, powerful jerk
who just wants people to love him is pretty

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.740
relatable to a lot of us — even Welles himself.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.580
So you might see things you like and hate
about yourself in Kane, or Susan Alexander’s

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.820
naive optimism, or Jedediah Leland and his
disillusionment with a friend.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.959
Honestly, the fact that it’s his childhood
sled isn’t the most profound or surprising

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:42.770
twist out there, it’s not like there are
hidden identities or “I see dead people.”

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.639
But, you have to admit, the film goes all-in
on the idea of lost childhood.

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:50.839
Kane drowns his feelings in material objects
and tries to live vicariously through Susan

00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:54.990
Alexander’s youth, telling her, “we’re
going to be a great opera star.”

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.370
Or maybe you agree with the film critic Pauline
Kael that the sled is just kinda gimmicky.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.050
But critics, including her, don’t call Citizen
Kane “great” because it makes you realize

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.670
profound things about life, the universe,
and everything.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.040
Every scene isn’t a masterpiece, but the
film holds up over time and people seem to

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.829
get a lot out of it — historically, technically,
or narratively.

00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:16.010
And, like I mentioned before, the whole idea
of “the best film of all time” is ultimately

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.920
kind of… silly.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:22.019
It’s more about understanding why and how
we make movies that mean so much to us, or

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:23.019
to the world.

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:25.160
And that’s pretty beautiful in itself.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.790
Next time, we’ll take a hard left turn into
an action/adventure/horror film that’s almost

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.410
as quotable as Casablanca, James Cameron’s
Aliens.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.620
And if you want to watch along with us,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.360
