thing<00:00:39.570><c> to</c><00:00:39.660><c> do</c><00:00:39.780><c> it's</c><00:00:40.020><c> the</c><00:00:40.110><c> quickest</c><00:00:40.440><c> thing</c><00:00:40.469><c> to</c>

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 align:start position:0%
thing to do it's the quickest thing to
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.340 align:start position:0%
thing to do it's the quickest thing to
do<00:00:40.770><c> and</c><00:00:40.950><c> we</c><00:00:41.579><c> can</c><00:00:41.730><c> do</c><00:00:41.850><c> it</c><00:00:41.940><c> right</c><00:00:41.969><c> now</c><00:00:42.350><c> so</c>

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 align:start position:0%
do and we can do it right now so
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.959 align:start position:0%
do and we can do it right now so
therefore<00:00:43.680><c> we</c><00:00:43.770><c> assured</c><00:00:44.040><c> is</c><00:00:44.160><c> your</c><00:00:44.250><c> capital</c><00:00:44.670><c> it</c>

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 align:start position:0%
therefore we assured is your capital it
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.779 align:start position:0%
therefore we assured is your capital it
makes<00:00:45.149><c> more</c><00:00:45.329><c> sense</c><00:00:45.629><c> so</c><00:00:46.260><c> maybe</c><00:00:46.469><c> we</c><00:00:47.430><c> might</c><00:00:47.579><c> act</c>

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 align:start position:0%
makes more sense so maybe we might act
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
makes more sense so maybe we might act
quicker<00:00:48.059><c> so</c><00:00:48.600><c> maybe</c><00:00:48.780><c> it</c><00:00:49.469><c> was</c><00:00:49.590><c> a</c><00:00:49.649><c> good</c><00:00:49.739><c> thing</c>

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 align:start position:0%
quicker so maybe it was a good thing
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
quicker so maybe it was a good thing
right<00:00:51.949><c> this</c><00:00:52.949><c> is</c><00:00:53.100><c> how</c><00:00:53.219><c> I</c><00:00:53.250><c> can</c><00:00:53.520><c> no</c><00:00:54.079><c> no</c><00:00:55.079><c> this</c><00:00:55.230><c> one</c>

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 align:start position:0%
right this is how I can no no this one
