00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.520
Okay, the most reasonable conclusion in this case is that

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.450
the C variant is associated with the higher risk for

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.290
the skin rash. Remember we emphasized that we have a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.430
large group of people that we use for our study and

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.270
we found a difference. That can't be attributed to just

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.970
random chance. There were many more people who had an

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.700
adenine in the control group compared to those in the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.330
skin rash group. They had a higher percentage of people with

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.970
the cytosine at that position, which means that the cytosine is associated

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.800
with this trait more than the adenine is, compared to the controls.
