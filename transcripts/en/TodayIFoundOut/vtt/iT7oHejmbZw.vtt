00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:13.139
Edgar Allan 
Poe is probably best known for his raven that

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.350
squawks “Nevermore,” but he’s also one
of the first American short story writers

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.230
and is often credited with being the “inventor”
of detective fiction.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.160
He also contributed heavily to the genre of
science fiction.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.020
Not only that, but he was one of the first
American writers to earn a living from his

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.210
writing alone.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.710
What’s not as well-known about the man is
that Poe had a somewhat turbulent stint in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.800
the military.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.790
The trouble began when Poe enrolled in a course
at the University of Virginia.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.760
His foster father gave him a $100 (about $2,000
today) to cover living expenses for the year.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.040
Any university student today can tell you
that university fees add up—the courses,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.660
the books, endless ramen feasts and printing
charges.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.690
Well, it’s likely Poe didn’t have the
latter two, but with other college expenses

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.500
and his gambling habit, he nevertheless quickly
fell into debt.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.559
In the end, he quit university after a year
and moved to Boston.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.920
There, he tried to survive on odd jobs but
needed a form of steady income, so he enlisted

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.499
in the army in 1827.

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:15.109
He used the name “Edgar Allan Perry” and
said he was twenty-two years old, even though

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:16.509
he was just eighteen.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.189
Due to the debts he had accumulated in college,
a warrant had been issued for his arrest and

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.579
he wasn’t keen on making it easy for the
authorities to find him.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.759
First serving at Fort Independence in Boston,
he was eventually moved to Fort Monroe in

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:28.780
Virginia.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.969
Likely Poe didn’t care where he was, as
long as he continued to get his $5 per month

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.590
(about $100 today) from the military.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.429
At first, it appeared that Poe would excel
in the army.

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.909
He thrived and was eventually promoted to
sergeant major for artillery, which was the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.209
highest rank achievable by a non-commissioned
individual.

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.579
Still, Poe disliked army life.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.259
Only two years into his five-year commitment,
he explained his situation and asked for an

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.259
early discharge.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.900
Lieutenant Howard, his commanding officer,
agreed to allow him to leave the army before

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.659
his time was up on one condition: he make
amends with his foster father, with whom he’d

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.429
always had a shaky relationship.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.679
Poe’s foster father wasn’t amenable to
making amends at first, but a series of unfortunate

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.099
events resulted in the death of Poe’s foster
mother and a softening of attitudes between

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.239
the two men.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.970
After finding a replacement to finish his
enlisted term, Poe was honourably discharged

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.610
in 1829.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.980
He didn’t end his military career there,
however.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.319
Soon after his discharge, Poe enrolled in
West Point and matriculated as a cadet in

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.720
1830.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.810
Just as he had in the army, Poe proved a diligent
pupil, great with math and languages and well-suited

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.130
to Academy life.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.390
Poe’s time at the academy was financed by
his foster father, John, meaning that Poe

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.260
needed his foster father’s permission in
order to drop out if he wanted to.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.280
Unfortunately, Poe’s relationship with his
foster father was soon on the rocks again

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.569
after John married his second wife, Louisa
Patterson.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.310
Soon after the marriage, Poe learned that
John had fathered illegitimate children with

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.319
another woman—one of them twenty years his
junior.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.189
It led to a row between the two, and Poe received
a letter saying that his foster father wanted

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.209
no further communication with him.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.090
An angry Poe sent a letter to his foster father
letting him know about everything that had

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.090
infuriated him over the years, and demanding
that he let Poe drop out of West Point.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.829
The letter ended with the ominous declaration
that if he wasn’t allowed to leave gracefully,

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.040
he’d get himself kicked out.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.359
With no response from John, Poe set out to
make good on his threat.

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.299
The prestigious student fell from grace, racking
up an impressive 44 offenses and 106 demerits

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.359
in one term alone, followed by 66 offenses
in one month the next term.

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.780
He was court-martialed and tried at the beginning
of February for “gross neglect of duty.”

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.099
His various offenses included being absent
from class parades, guard mounting, and church

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.099
parades.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.459
He also didn’t show up for academic classes,
and refused to obey officer’s orders.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.249
There was a rumour that he once turned up
to drills in a belt and nothing else, but

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.260
there’s nothing in his official record to
corroborate this.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.840
Interesting though such a stunt would have
been, Poe’s preferred method of mayhem was

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.290
not showing up to anything at all.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.019
Poe was, of course, found guilty of all charges
and kicked out of West Point.

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.430
He headed off to New York to pursue writing,
but not before he’d gotten a little something

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.489
extra out of the military first.

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.849
He convinced over 100 cadets to donate money
to fund the release of a new volume of poems,

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.670
titled simply Poems.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:51.000
The book was dedicated to his fellow cadets.
