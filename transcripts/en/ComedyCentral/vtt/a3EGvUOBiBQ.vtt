Have you read the reviews?
They're good, right?  

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:08.341
They're good.  I'm excited

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:12.412
Sophie, I left the heart pills
at  home.  Just relax,

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.015
It'll be fine, you haven't had
an incident in forever.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:18.117
Before today's showing
of Blue Iguana

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.919

our surprise guest.

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.288
The film star Ben Schwartz.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:26.959
What a big suprise for
everybody.  It's me Ben Schwatz.

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:32.231
How are you?  How're you doing 
little boy?  You ok?

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:34.400
He's not good with surprises.
He has a heart condition.

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:37.003
Never been around a big movie
star before?  Is that what it
is?

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.072
He's just a little shocked,
you're one of his two favorite
actors.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.540
I'm going to get your pills.
Can you please 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.908
take care of him?

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:46.146
So what do you like me from is
it the drama stuff or the comedy
 stuff? 

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.049
Both.  Both, oh what a fan.
You say I'm one

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.684
of your favorite actors
who was the other?

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.520
Sam Rockwell

00:00:55.387 --> 00:01:02.228
Sammy time!  Yeah!   You 
don't have to make the noise. 

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.530
This thing makes the noise.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.066
Sorry I'm late guys.
What's wrong with this guy?

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.203
Why are his eyes closed? 
 Are you sleepy?  

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:13.906
He's not feeling to good Sammy.
Sammy.  He can't hear me over...

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:21.948
Sammy he's not feeling to good.
Hey hey hey. Wake up wake up.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:25.552
Yeah you know what always cheers
me up when I'm a little sleepy.

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.254
T-shirt cannon!  T-shirt
cannon!

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.062
 Why would you shoot him
in the face?

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.830
Where else am I going to shoot
him in the feet?

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:39.632
Come on, have you ever shot a
T-shirt cannon before?

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.236
No, I'm so stupid.  Come on.
I think he's a goner.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.705
Bet you fifty bucks he lives.
You're on.  Really that quick?

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:48.274
Alright, I love it.
Hey.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.409
Pay up.  Oh yeah baby.

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:51.777
Don't entourage me.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.648
Sophie, Sophie.  
What are you saying?

00:01:55.681 --> 00:02:00.653
Selfie, selfie. You got it
pal.  Selfie is what you want.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.060
Now us. Now us.

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.467
Right on his dick.
That is a mega-fan.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.169
That is a mega-fan.
You're not looking very good

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.405
though.  Looking bad.
You should crack his chest open.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.040
We should crack open his
chest. We should crack it open.
Maybe a punch in the
middle

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.975
Maybe I punch in the
middle.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.877
and separate it
like a... A doctor, doctor.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.546
A doctor.
Maybe like a real doctor.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.980
Don't you know a real doctor?

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:31.117
Good thinking.
You kidding me?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.186
Dude, you really were great
in the movie.  You really think
so?

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.820
I really felt like
you invested yourself.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:36.989
I did, the character to me 
was way more than what you see

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:39.392
on the screen.  Days
and days of back work on that.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.094
Hello. Clooney!  George
Clooney? What's happening.

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:45.598
Hey, It's Ben Schwartz.

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.633
 Hey, so we got a heart victim.
victimize.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:48.801
I don't know?  Something is
wrong with his heart. 

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.236
He wants to take a lot of
selfies.  

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:56.876
Uh huh, ok got it.   Ben
Schwartz.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.211
He said maybe he needs some
Casamigos. He said he's

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.912
 not really sure
what the problem is.  Casamigos.

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:02.582
Some baby aspirin and some
tequila.  Does anyone have
any Casamigos?

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.284
Anybody have any baby aspirin?

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:09.222
Does anybody have any Vicks
Vaporub?  How bout a little salt
bath?

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.724
Does anyone have a full salt
bath for his fee?  I do.

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:16.196
Is he dead?  I think he's a
goner.  Hello?

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.366
Yeah that's right pal, 
in your face.

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.501
Do you really think I was good
in this movie?

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:24.370
Dude I thought you really mixed
the comedy

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:26.305
and the drama and the action.

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:30.910
It's like Meryl Streep, Tom
Cruise, Jason Statham, Daniel
Day-Lewis..

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:35.915
That's what I was going for.
and like Don Knotts. Dude.  You
felt it all.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:36.616
 Incredible.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.190
Does anyone have a one third
used condom?

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:47.327
Just the bottom third.
Just the bottom third.
