JACQUELINE FULLER: OK,
well, welcome, everybody.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.830
I'm Jacqueline Fuller.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.160
I lead google.org.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.350
It's Google's
philanthropy, focused

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.720
on catalyzing the
best tech solutions

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.020
around the world for humanity.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.722
And today, we have Doctor Paul
Farmer in the house. [CHEERING]

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:21.722
PAUL FARMER: Oh, thanks.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.632
Nerd fest.

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:27.590
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yes.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.090
Yes.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.010
So this is such a thrill
for so many of us.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.290
In fact, as we were
getting the word out,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.510
we had so many people
who were interested,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.430
Doctor Farmer, that we've got
people from Google offices

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.960
in 41 different locations
around the world.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.870
We've got Germany, New York
City, Brazil, Mexico, Austin.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.040
Everyone wants to
hear from you today.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.650
So we're so, so very
grateful that you've come.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.430
And so the flow that
we're going to have is we

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.860
will have conversation
and discussion

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.777
for about 20 minutes.

00:00:58.777 --> 00:01:00.860
We're going to then open
it up for live questions,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.720
so get your questions ready.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.150
And if you're in one of
our offices, off location,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.760
we also have a Dory.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.990
You can find it.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.949
Just go Paul Farmer, if you
want to submit Dory questions,

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:14.990
because we'll want to take
all of your questions.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.582
PAUL FARMER: I'm having
that tattooed on my arm.

00:01:17.582 --> 00:01:19.040
JACQUELINE FULLER:
Go, Paul Farmer.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.982
So let me start by just giving
a little bit of an introduction

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:26.565
for the man who needs
no introduction.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.890
Doctor Paul Farmer is a
medical anthropologist.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.280
He's a physician.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700
He's also an expert in
infectious disease, which

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.106
makes him the spot
on guy we want

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:38.730
to have for our
discussion today, which

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.960
is going to focus, in large
part, on the ebola epidemic.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.020
He's one of the founders
of Partners in Health

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.621
along with Jim Kim,
who's now at WHO.

00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:48.620
PAUL FARMER: World Bank.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.960
JACQUELINE FULLER: Oh, sorry.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.450
World Bank.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.790
PAUL FARMER: Makes
a big difference.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.610
They're the ones with the money.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.220
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.735
Even better.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.730
Even better.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.670
And Partners in
Health, if you're not

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.970
familiar with their
work, is really

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.530
proving what's
possible to deliver

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.390
health care in the
poorest settings.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.419
And Paul is also
chair of global health

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.740
and social medicine at
Harvard Medical School,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.330
where you started,
right, stealing medicines

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.780
for the poor.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.970
He's the chief of--

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.179
PAUL FARMER: That goes
direct to NSA here.

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:22.595
JACQUELINE FULLER:
[LAUGHING] He's

00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:24.700
the chief of global
health equity at Brigham

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.770
and Women's Hospital.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.040
He's an adviser to the UN
Secretary General on community

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.600
based medicines and
lessons from Haiti.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.490
He's an author, of course, most
recently "To Repair the World:

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.870
Paul Farmer Speaks to
the Next Generation."

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.740
And we do have copies
for sale in the back,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.240
if folks would like
to get his book.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.250
Many people know
of Doctor Farmer

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.410
and heard of him because he's
the subject of Tracy Kidder's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.680
biography, "Mountains Beyond
Mountains: The Quest of Doctor

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.640
Paul Farmer, A Man Who
Would Cure the World."

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.210
In fact, show of hands.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.750
Raise your hand if
you've read that book.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.090
So most of the room is
raising their hands.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.590
Actually--

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.173
PAUL FARMER: Raise
your hand if you've

00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:08.290
read "Women, Poverty, and AIDS."

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.697
Thanks loads.

00:03:09.697 --> 00:03:11.190
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.731
All right, but I'm going to ask
a serious question, actually.

00:03:13.731 --> 00:03:16.650
Raise your hand if that book,
"Mountains Beyond Mountains,"

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.660
changed your life in
a significant way.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.594
PAUL FARMER: Raise your hands
if "Women, Poverty, and AIDS."

00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:26.260
JACQUELINE FULLER:
So just one last note

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.030
that Paul is also
speaking tonight

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.740
in San Francisco at City
Arts and Lectures at 7:30.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.900
So if you don't get
enough this morning,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.950
or you want to bring
friends, invite friends,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.420
there's another
opportunity tonight.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.510
So we also want to say thanks to
Paul's colleagues and team who

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.010
are here.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.230
Cassie is Chief of
Staff, his cousin Ann

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.815
is also a Googler,
so well represented.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.940
So Paul, why don't we start
just with a little bit

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.100
of background
about ebola itself.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.880
So, tell us what are the
most important things

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.260
that we need to know.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.160
Why is this epidemic scaring
people like no other,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.620
and where do you see it headed?

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.440
PAUL FARMER: You know,
one of the things that's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.440
important to know
is-- you don't have

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.940
to know the kind of virus it is.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.480
That's not that important.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.000
What you need to
know is I'm pretty

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.225
sure we know where it comes
from and how it's transmitted.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:30.470
It's a zoonosis,
as everybody knows.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.270
But what's happened--

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.540
JACQUELINE FULLER: Meaning
it comes from animals.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.998
PAUL FARMER: It
comes from animals.

00:04:36.998 --> 00:04:38.410
It jumps from animals to humans.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.590
And what happened-- and this has
happened with every outbreak--

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.310
is that primates,
human or nonhuman,

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.220
are not the host, right?

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.222
We're accidental hosts.

00:04:52.222 --> 00:04:53.680
And so there's a
lot of speculation

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.055
that you've probably
already read

00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:59.300
about this that it's from
eating bushmeat, or a fruit

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.520
bat with butterfingers-- very
clumsy fruit bat drops a piece

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.420
of half eaten
fruit, and some kid.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.300
Wherever it came from, that's
not what's going on now.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.580
What's going on now is person
to person transmission because

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.980
of a failed health
care system or systems,

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.690
because it's a region, right?

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.510
That's one thing.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.170
And there are other ways
it could be transmitted.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.410
It's person to person.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.320
When you hear about
burials or funeral rituals,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.010
still, that's person
to person transmission.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.270
The virus can be excreted
after someone dies-- is

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.650
excreted and infectious.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.600
But as far as we know,
it's not airborne.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.835
It's spread through
infected secretions.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.690
Second point I think I would
just move up on the list

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.820
is that you hear that the case
fatality rate is really high,

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.449
but what does that mean?

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.865
It means that a lot of people
who get the virus are dying.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.730
But it doesn't mean
that they should die.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.740
And just for the
sake of argument,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.110
I've been saying-- again, just
for the sake of argument-- what

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.520
if it's not the case fatality
rate that should be 90%,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.550
it's the survival rate?

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.350
And if we had that
as our supposition,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.800
then we'd say, as you
guys say at Google,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.490
how are we going to work
against this goal or this plan?

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.440
And if the goal or
plan is let's make sure

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.120
everybody survives,
then we have to work

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.600
really hard to make sure that
people are diagnosed early,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.430
that they're given proper care.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.690
Because even without a specific
therapy in anti-viral--

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.820
and there are people-- I don't
want to talk about this--

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.172
we do have treatments for
people who present very often

00:06:59.172 --> 00:07:00.630
in what's called
hypovolemic shock.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.920
So when you have ebola, some
of the first things that happen

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.310
are abdominal pain, fever.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.900
Even with a fever, you
start losing fluids.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.300
And then you have
vomiting, diarrhea,

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.840
and just as with any other
cause of those symptoms,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.750
you're losing electrolytes,
you're losing fluids,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.710
and the treatment is
fluid resuscitation.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.370
And any American emergency
room can do that.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.625
Even when someone can't
drink, oral rehydration,

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:34.250
like Pedialyte.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.150
So we've got to
remember that we're

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:44.484
losing people who-- there's not
a lot of T in the ETU-- ebola

00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:45.150
treatment units.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.480
That's the second thing.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.940
I'm only putting
it in this order

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.180
because these are things
I'd like everybody to know.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.645
The health systems issue,
that we've got to do better.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:04.430
And just to throw
out another one,

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.566
now there's finally attention
being turned to ebola.

00:08:09.566 --> 00:08:11.190
We should have done
it a long time ago.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.170
I don't know if my friend
Dan Kelly's in the room yet,

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.260
but we were in
Sierra Leone, where

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.590
he's worked for a long
time, in early June.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.100
Ebola had already
crashed into the city,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.770
and it's never done that before.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.801
It's been an isolated
outbreak, rural areas.

00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:29.800
That's where it started.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.699
But once it gets into
the health care system--

00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:35.240
Here's the third thing that I
think is worth keeping in mind.

00:08:37.047 --> 00:08:38.255
It's a disease of caregivers.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.990
Not just doctors--
nurses, nurses' aides,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.980
but who does the
majority of caregiving?

00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:49.750
JACQUELINE FULLER: Women.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.820
PAUL FARMER: Women.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.090
Your mom.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.690
Women.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.480
Women-- your mom, your
sister, your aunt.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.530
So even the story
from Dallas-- and it

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.700
sounds to me like
the Good Samaritan.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.010
That's the way I read.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:09.650
Some guy trying to help a
pregnant woman who has ebola.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.270
And so those are three things
that just wouldn't come up

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.320
on the first blush
that I think it would

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.460
be good to get into
popular consciousness.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.850
There's a lot we can do.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.940
This is not a new kind of
spread, as far as we can tell.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.680
We've got to protect
our caregivers.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.700
JACQUELINE FULLER: OK.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.650
And then just to set
the scene a little bit--

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.790
some people might not
have the full context.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.940
You mentioned Sierra Leone.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.481
I was there a couple
years ago, and I

00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:36.020
remember I met the
only pediatrician

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.480
in all of Sierra Leone.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.680
I mean, so you're
talking about a country

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.270
where the health system
is already pretty fragile.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.980
And then something
like this hits.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.060
So maybe a word about how this
is impacting the health system.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.080
What response is in place?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.979
What can we do?

00:09:54.979 --> 00:09:57.020
PAUL FARMER: Well, as you
know, Jackie, concision

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.830
is not my strong suit.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.490
But I will say a
word, and that is, it

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:07.060
has already made the
health system fall apart.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.385
So that is also a done deal.

00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:13.330
The epidemic's
out, and it already

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.872
took down the health system--
in Sierra Leone and in Liberia.

00:10:15.872 --> 00:10:18.288
JACQUELINE FULLER: So that
means that people with malaria,

00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:20.830
people with road accidents-- I
mean, it's cascading effects.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:21.490
PAUL FARMER: That's right.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:21.990
Exactly.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.340
And I think the same
is true of Guinea.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.380
I haven't been there, but
talking to Guinean officials,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.880
I think they'd say
the same thing.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.610
It's having a very adverse--

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.720
The majority of ebola
victims won't have ebola.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.680
They'll have malaria, obstructed
labor, some other problems

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.110
that they would have
ordinarily had taken on.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.120
So that means that our work
in emergency response--

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.550
our collective work--
has to be linked

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.930
to rebuilding that system,
and to strengthening

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.330
local capacity.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.510
Yesterday-- a lot of you
know Larry Brilliant.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.650
Doctor Larry Brilliant, who's
now at Skoll Global Threats.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.450
But we were at a
conference, and he said,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:09.535
outbreaks are inevitable.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.275
Pandemics are optional.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.760
And that is pretty pithy, right?

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.860
Because you have to miss
all these chances to have

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.330
a pandemic like this.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.435
And once it's in the global
economy, where people

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:29.127
move around, it's
really harder to stop.

00:11:29.127 --> 00:11:31.460
JACQUELINE FULLER: Well, maybe
just expand on that a bit

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.751
because, I think for folks
outside of the public health

00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:37.120
world, even understanding an
outbreak versus an epidemic

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.640
versus a pandemic and the
impact that that can have,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.700
both in terms of morbidity,
mortality, people getting

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.760
sick and dying, but also
economic impact on a region.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.340
So right now, we're looking
at while the official numbers

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.780
of confirmed are only
about 7,000, right?

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.650
But the estimate
is that it's just

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.200
tens of thousands unreported.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.480
PAUL FARMER: We know that
the doubling time just using

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.030
reported cases-- and again, I'm
sure this is obvious to all you

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.250
nerds out there-- that
reporting capacity is

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.940
related to health
systems, right?

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.240
Strengthening.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:21.550
I was recently in rural
Liberia, and talking to a health

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.310
official, and
there are very few.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.030
It's a thin-- although
they had stood up an effort

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.840
beginning in March, even
out in the rural areas.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:37.030
And I was asking to figure
out the diagnostic capacity,

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.130
is their [INAUDIBLE]
of fever here?

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.280
And because I knew it's the same
forest where it is elsewhere.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.610
And the answer was no.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.010
But what she really meant
is, we don't have a lab.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.980
So there is this
problem also of, well,

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.540
what fraction of the cases are
reported, as you just said.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.030
And the modeling
exercises, as I'm

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.590
sure people saw last week--
some of them are pretty grim.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.590
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.520
PAUL FARMER: But
if you were talking

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.936
about a more than
a million cases,

00:13:05.936 --> 00:13:08.090
you're also talking about
inaction and failure.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.600
And I think we could stop that.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.599
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:12.150
What do you think
is-- just so we

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.360
can get our hands around
how bad it might get.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.470
So now the deaths are
in the thousands--

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:24.020
maybe 4,000 or 5,000 infections,
maybe in the tens of thousands.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.890
But predictions that infections
could go up in the millions.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.332
It could spread beyond that.

00:13:30.332 --> 00:13:31.790
What do you think
what is the worst

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.370
case if we don't do what
we need to do and can do?

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.210
PAUL FARMER: Well, worst
case is really bad.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.540
And you asked me
to define outbreak.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:49.740
I mean, an outbreak-- this was
Larry's point-- zoonoses cause

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.650
outbreaks, because
there's contact,

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.950
and there's a lot of it,
between animals and humans.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.690
By the way, the humans are
winning, as many of you

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.400
know-- meaning the animals
are not doing so hot.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.120
And that isn't because of ebola.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.980
That would be because of us.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.730
So an outbreak is
just a general term.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.680
You can have an outbreak
of two cases, right?

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.600
I would say that this has
never really happened before.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.770
I mean, it's easy to say
it's never happened before.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.160
But to move into
this part of Africa,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.850
into cities, into the health
care system-- a lot of that

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.430
is new at that level.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.020
All of it.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.020
JACQUELINE FULLER: Because
usually the outbreaks

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.870
are closer to the bush.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.340
PAUL FARMER: Or they
also have been associated

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.930
with poor infection
control practices.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.990
The first outbreak,
for example, ran right

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.280
through a mission
hospital, killing

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.935
the nurses and the
nuns and the patients.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.410
And so this is how it started.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.500
But it was contained.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.750
And this time, it
hasn't been contained.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.640
And to get back to the
economic question-- again,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.440
this is all over my
pay grade, or out

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.080
of my field of expertise.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.000
Actually, this is Dan
Kelley, who just came in,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.477
who I was just talking about.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:24.280
Even now, with the number
of cases that are reported,

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.800
the economic impact is
already quite palpable.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.841
JACQUELINE FULLER: Right.

00:15:27.841 --> 00:15:33.820
PAUL FARMER: Because air travel,
ports, cross border trade,

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.060
and tourism.

00:15:35.372 --> 00:15:36.580
JACQUELINE FULLER: Decimated.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:36.930
Yeah.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.790
PAUL FARMER: They've
already badly affected.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.831
JACQUELINE FULLER: Center
for Global Developments

00:15:40.831 --> 00:15:44.270
got some good graphs on that in
terms of the aversion effect.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.230
That is, not even just
direct loss from trade,

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.670
but aversion-- people just
avoiding the entire region,

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.590
and what that can do to
entire regional economies.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.390
PAUL FARMER: So I think
we're already in trouble.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.300
The question is just,
how do we get out?

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.070
I mean, as a species,
obviously, I'm

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:08.860
all for thinking this is
our collective problem.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.570
And I'm also happy that,
as far as I can tell,

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.870
the people in charge in
those countries have said,

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.990
we want help.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:19.770
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yes.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.120
PAUL FARMER: And that
doesn't always happen.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.350
JACQUELINE FULLER: No.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.933
There's a lot more
openness than we've

00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:24.310
seen with some other outbreaks.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.300
So, all right-- one last
question in the how bad is it,

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.550
or how bad is it going to get?

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.466
And then we'll switch
to solutions, I promise.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.950
So we saw the first apparent
case in the US Tuesday.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.340
Should we be worried in the
US or other developed nations?

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.070
Do you see this
spreading in Europe?

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.060
Asia?

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.949
PAUL FARMER: I see it coming
to Europe, but not spreading.

00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:49.490
I see it coming to
the United States.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:55.950
Well, in fact, last week,
I got to play Cassandra.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.640
I was just saying on CNN--
first of all, they put in a room

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.170
where I was supposed to
be doing a talk show,

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.279
and I'm the only human in there,
looking around and saying,

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:05.779
hello?

00:17:05.779 --> 00:17:06.279
Hello?

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:08.859
50 minutes.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:10.319
No human.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.800
Anyway, I said, OK, all right.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.330
I did it.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:12.830
I confess.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:21.650
But when this disembodied figure
came on the camera and said,

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.150
well, is this going to come to
the United States and Europe?

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.829
I said, well, sure.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.250
Because, again, it's
a global economy.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.470
But I agree with the CDC
director Tom Friedan.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.850
I think he's right.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.830
It's not going to spread here,
because we have the ability

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.590
to do what's needed, which is
isolate the infectious patient

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.020
while actually
giving him good care,

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.975
and then doing contact
tracing, which is, as he said,

00:17:48.975 --> 00:17:51.290
bread and butter
of public health.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.605
And to do it, it requires
a lot of resources.

00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:57.390
And that's the
right way to do it.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:02.700
And I think that would happen
in the European countries I've

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.200
been to.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.470
It'll happen here.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.190
So I think we've got a very
good chance of seeing cases,

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:13.122
but not of seeing much in the
way of person to person spread.

00:18:13.122 --> 00:18:14.080
I mean, it will happen.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.280
JACQUELINE FULLER: Unless
the virus mutates, and then--

00:18:18.917 --> 00:18:21.250
PAUL FARMER: Well, the virus
will mutate, I've no doubt.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.270
The question of whether
or not that will change

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.105
is either its virulence
or transmissibility.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.960
Viruses and bugs--
they always mutate

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.520
when we poke at them
with antibiotics

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.384
or other-- so, parasites, too.

00:18:34.384 --> 00:18:35.300
JACQUELINE FULLER: OK.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.716
So then, thinking
about treatment,

00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:39.905
there's been an interesting
sort of debate, discussion,

00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:43.670
in some of the articles about
what's the best approach?

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.960
And so you have,
say, [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.980
on one hand advocating a very
patient centered focus, making

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.350
sure we take absolute best
care and best standards.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.780
You have WHO.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.776
CDC's sort of more of a public
health mindset coming in,

00:18:58.776 --> 00:19:01.275
saying, well, we need to try
these community health centers.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.210
I mean, your thoughts
on if you were

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.340
the czar in charge of
ebola, what would you do?

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.770
PAUL FARMER: Well,
first of all, I

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.820
think that, unfortunately,
no one is really

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.510
advocating for a high
standard of care yet.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.860
That would require, for the
critically ill, critical care.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.850
There's this confusion.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.600
People think that
supportive care

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.900
means holding someone's hand.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.062
And if you're in
hypovolemic shock,

00:19:34.062 --> 00:19:35.770
then you're just going
to hold their hand

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.240
while they die unnecessarily.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.940
So I think we have
a long way to go

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.150
before we can say that
there's any real progress

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.990
on the quality of care.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.010
And again, that's not to
criticize any organization,

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:55.260
especially any that shows up
early to try and save lives.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.270
But what it looks like a patient
focused versus public health--

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.080
we're not even there
yet, because we've

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.630
got neither going on.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.280
And both could go on.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.100
And the one thing I would
say early on in the epidemic

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:17.050
is every time we've
tried to oppose treatment

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.390
and prevention, we've failed.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.510
You integrate treatment
and prevention.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.230
So if you can't drag
people, pull people

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.920
in to your care,
which involves what?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.110
Involves isolation.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.792
That word just means
following [INAUDIBLE] control.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.140
It sounds bad in lay
language, like supportive

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.770
care sounds like
singing kumbaya.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.406
Please don't do that
if I'm in shock.

00:20:42.864 --> 00:20:44.170
Please don't do that anytime.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.185
I went to a Catholic
youth organization.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.550
So just as supportive care is
not singing kumbaya and holding

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:58.940
hands, so, too, is isolation
just a technical term

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.200
to prevent the infection
from reaching other people.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.050
And the best way to
do that is pull people

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.000
in with good care
and good service.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.230
JACQUELINE FULLER: Right.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.410
Giving them incentive
to go, like,

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.500
we trust that the system's
going to care for them.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.375
PAUL FARMER: Exactly.

00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:16.510
And feed them, and let
them-- imagine being shut out

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.360
of modern medicine forever.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.270
There's never been a collision
of ebola and modern medicine

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.990
before that I know of.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.640
So then you have people showing
up in space suits or something,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.420
and then you don't
see your family again.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.160
And if that's going to
happen, which it should,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.870
it's got to be linked to a
warm welcome and survival.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.790
And that'll happen if we
have food and medical care,

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.740
and there's a way to do it.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.690
And that's where we should
go and invest really heavily

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.800
in improving the quality
of care and making sure

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.310
our public health is stronger.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.720
In some countries that have been
credited with stopping ebola,

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.020
it took, really, hundreds,
if not thousands,

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.960
of staffers to do the contact
tracing-- community health

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.200
workers, especially.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.760
And that's the way to go.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.630
So even though you're
right, everybody

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.570
is saying a high
standard of care

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.240
versus public
health, that's been

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.510
a dead end with every other
epidemic I can think of.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.720
JACQUELINE FULLER: Well, you
mentioned contact tracing.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.000
One of the things that we
at Google have been thinking

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.960
about across many, many
teams is just what can we do?

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.910
How can we be helpful?

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.710
What can we do
that's differential?

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:30.350
So google.org-- we've
invested about half a million

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.960
to some groups like
[INAUDIBLE], UNICEF,

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.220
others who are doing contract
tracing, thinking about how can

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.440
we help with some of
the best mobile tools

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.820
available out there to
help with epidemiology?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.110
We have our geo
team, for example,

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.080
that's helping to
do things, even

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.780
like providing
really accurate maps

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.010
with roads and critical
information on them.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.260
We have a creative lab
group, for example,

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.710
that normally works on general
marketing that's doing things

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.980
like helping to create visual
images to do communication,

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.044
so that people in low
literacy environments

00:23:09.044 --> 00:23:10.960
can understand how to
take care of themselves,

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.121
how to take care of other
people, our crisis response

00:23:14.121 --> 00:23:14.620
team.

00:23:16.984 --> 00:23:18.650
This is happening in
regions, obviously,

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.740
where internet
penetration is very low,

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.540
so some of our typical
tools in our toolbox

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.420
are not as effective.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.491
But we're looking at, can
we be helpful in terms

00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:29.990
of people searching
for information?

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.280
One box is providing
information and hotlines.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.640
And Googlers, if you're
wondering what you can do,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.980
if you're in the room,
there's a badge set up

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.140
in the back where you can go and
donate to Partners in Health,

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.670
some other orgs on
the front lines.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.260
You can also join Ebola Announce
if you want more information

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.170
about what's
happening at Google.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.504
But those are just
some of the areas

00:23:53.504 --> 00:23:55.920
where we're trying to think
about how can we help in a way

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.250
that best uses our strengths?

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.041
But I'll just turn the
question over to you

00:23:59.041 --> 00:24:01.100
and say, what should
Google be doing?

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.380
What should the tech
industry be doing?

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.550
What should Americans, what
should be the rich world

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.080
be doing in general
to help here?

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.330
Well, first of all, those sound
like just the kind of things

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.870
that we need Google to be doing.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.280
I mean, there's
more, of course, it

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.870
will not shock you that I think.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.320
And I'd just really like
to formally introduce

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:29.210
my colleague, Doctor Dan
Kelly, who is-- well,

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.710
at least he was, until
about a month ago,

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.930
studying for infectious
disease physician

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.600
training-- studying for an MPH.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.890
And he's been working in
Sierra Leone for some time.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.000
I said, well, time to
go back to Sierra Leone.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.820
And we're actually
headed off together,

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.450
along with our
colleagues, in a few days.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.700
So if you go out to the kind
of places where Well Body

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.210
Alliance works, or
Last Mile Health,

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.590
or Partners in Health's other
sister organization in Haiti

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.650
that's [INAUDIBLE],
which many of you

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:08.900
have supported after
the earthquake,

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.600
a lot of the very
tools you mentioned

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.630
have not been available
to the poor, right?

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.366
It's worse in those
parts of Africa

00:25:18.366 --> 00:25:19.740
with internet
penetration than it

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.260
is in Haiti, which
is bad enough.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.790
So we don't know
what's happening

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.540
where cases are popping up, and
I've seen that already being

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.770
useful-- those technologies
are already proving useful.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.210
And I would just
encourage you all

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:41.060
to keep pushing these
out to the rural poor.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:46.070
The rural poor are the last ones
to benefit, in my experience,

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.450
from technological advances.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.580
And, again, there's
no reason that

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.300
has to be the same
next year as it

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.940
was 50 years ago
or 10 years ago.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.680
So that last mile issue
of going to the people

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.350
really shut out of modernity--
I think Google can push that,

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.790
right?

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:11.760
And another thing that I've
found very helpful for 30 years

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:18.090
is this which we stole
from liberation theology--

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.820
a preferential
option for the poor.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.720
It's kind of a simple
idea, but very radical.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.440
Say you're a doctor, and you can
say, I take care of everybody,

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.160
but my primary concern is
people who are sick and poor.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.270
That kind of thinking too
rarely invades foundations,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.780
educational institutions,
universities, companies.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.800
And I'm only saying
it because I think

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.070
it's really helpful, because
that's the big challenge.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.400
That's another
kind of last mile.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.360
A third is don't buy it
when people say, well, this

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.640
is a really straightforward
intervention.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.630
It's all about-- and
then fill in the blank.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.800
It's all about prevention, it's
all about improving quality.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.549
It's not all about
either of those things.

00:26:59.549 --> 00:27:03.050
It's really going
to be hard, and it's

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.100
going to require
the kind of tools

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.360
that I think people here
would take for granted.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.960
Now, all that said,
the other thing

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.430
is, please be patient with us.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.135
You are the ones who are the
Googlers and the engineers,

00:27:15.135 --> 00:27:16.220
not us.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.350
I'm a doctor.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.720
I don't expect you to understand
how to dose [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.400
or to use the right
prophylaxis for malaria.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.530
I know that stuff, though.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:33.990
But we don't know from
engineering or from IT.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.820
Well, some people on our team
do, but not a lot of us, right?

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.900
So we need you to be patient and
to accompany us with the gifts

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.970
that you have over
the long term.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:49.750
I said this after the
earthquake in Haiti,

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.370
and we did some of the things
that we said we would do.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.290
I'd like to think we did all
the things we said we would do.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.260
We did build that medical
center in central Haiti.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.560
We did make it the largest
solar powered hospital

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.600
in the developing world.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.070
We did build a new IT backbone
to connect it to the Harvard

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:10.930
teaching hospitals so that
you can see an x-ray in Boston

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:14.080
at the same time that you
see it in central Haiti.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.980
We did put a CAT scan-- the
first one in a public hospital

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.460
anywhere in Haiti--
in rural Haiti,

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.610
and, again, connected it to
whatever it goes through.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.187
God or Google or whatever.

00:28:27.129 --> 00:28:28.920
JACQUELINE FULLER:
We'll go with the cloud.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.250
PAUL FARMER: That
accompaniment is critical.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.550
We're begging, be
patient with us.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:37.410
You know things we don't
know, and we really need that.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:43.160
And then third,
this kind of work

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.360
needs resources that
can be turned on a dime.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.489
Why do you think all
these huge bureaucracies--

00:28:51.489 --> 00:28:52.780
they've been there a long time.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:57.400
The UN very humbly,
when I was there,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.890
they were doing our
transport in Liberia,

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.990
because there's no
air bridge, right?

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.020
The airlines aren't
flying, really.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.040
And it'll be worse
now that you've

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.670
had a commercial carrier.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:15.040
I actually flew out, I just
noticed, on the same day

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.790
as that patient, or
the day before, right?

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.940
So I haven't finished
my 21 days either.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.700
JACQUELINE FULLER: Good to know.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.330
PAUL FARMER: If
anyone gave me a hug.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.990
But it's going to
make it worse, right?

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:31.620
So the UN was very grateful
that they got us around,

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.120
including in the rural areas.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.420
But they were saying, hey, we
worked on this for 10 years,

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.680
and then one epidemic,
and everything fell over.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.010
And that's the right
humility, I think.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.270
Not everybody would
say that, but they did.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:49.980
So one of the problems is that
if you study bureaucracy like

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.690
the sociologist Max Weber--
see, aren't you scared that

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.075
I'm going off with some--

00:29:54.075 --> 00:29:54.570
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:55.070
Questions?

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.778
No, just kidding.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.990
PAUL FARMER: OK, I won't
quote sociologists.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.940
But that flexibility--
that only comes

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.620
from discretionary capital.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.920
You guys know that in business.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.100
You can't not know that.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:08.390
We need that.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.030
JACQUELINE FULLER:
On the subject

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.830
of discretionary
capital and what

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.314
we can do-- I mean,
on your site--

00:30:13.314 --> 00:30:15.730
and this is something that we
pushed when we were at Gates

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:20.210
Foundation before Google is if
you ask Americans how much do

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:23.430
you think that we spend
on humanitarian aid,

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.130
the average guess is about 10%.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.150
And in reality, we
spend less than 1%

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.200
of our budget on
humanitarian aid.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.410
So just sort of taking a wider
view, now, from ebola, just

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:40.410
on global health in general,
global development in general,

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:44.180
it seems like we're going to
lurch from epidemic to epidemic

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.740
to crises to crises
until we spend

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.020
some real resources in
some real smart ways.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.420
PAUL FARMER: You know, I
heard Jim Kim said something

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.999
really remarkable the other day.

00:30:53.999 --> 00:30:56.040
Well, I've been hearing
him say remarkable things

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.570
for a long time.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:03.810
But he said that he spends a lot
of his time talking people out

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.630
of talking themselves out
of doing the right thing.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:13.410
And that's because we're all so
socialized for scarcity, right?

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:21.950
And that's a bad thing,
because we can romanticize

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:26.570
frugal innovation,
but I don't buy it.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.900
Sitting in the middle
of a squatter settlement

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.077
in Haiti, or in a rain forest
with no electricity-- that

00:31:34.077 --> 00:31:35.660
is a dangerous kind
of romanticization

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.730
in the middle of an epidemic.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:41.520
And so I know it
sounds attractive,

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.900
but we've got to
have, like you said,

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.390
more resources put
into these problems.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:53.030
I mean, none of us, if
we were critically ill,

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.850
would not want to have care,
nor would we want our kids

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:02.020
to settle for or
get second best.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.570
That's how most of the people
I see in a clinic or hospital

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:06.222
feel as well.

00:32:06.222 --> 00:32:07.430
JACQUELINE FULLER: All right.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.910
So we're going to turn
to live questions now,

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:11.660
and we have a mic right
there in the back.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.620
And then we'll also
take some from the Dory.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.730
Can we get the
Dory questions up?

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:16.230
Great.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.460
So while people are working
their way to the microphone,

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.500
what's your message
to the average

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.810
citizen in the empowered
world, in the developed world,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.820
on what can I do?

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.650
What can an average citizen do?

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:35.410
PAUL FARMER: Well,
I think it's better

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:39.990
to imagine that there's
something you can do, even

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.572
to respond to a
problem that seems so

00:32:43.572 --> 00:32:44.905
remote from your own experience.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:56.020
And whether you call that
empathy or-- it's not

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.079
like pity or mercy are
bad, either, right?

00:32:58.079 --> 00:32:59.120
Those are not bad things.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.870
JACQUELINE FULLER:
We'll take them.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.930
PAUL FARMER: Yeah.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:00.430
We'll take them.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.490
JACQUELINE FULLER: If I'm
dying in that rainforest,

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:02.369
I'll take it.

00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:03.660
PAUL FARMER: Exactly, you know?

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.330
And we should remember that.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.210
Mercy is a good thing.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:13.510
In fact, back to my
PTSD Catholic youth,

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.220
it's one of the
cardinal virtues.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.220
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.340
PAUL FARMER: On the other
hand, if you could link that

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:24.550
to solidarity, and then
link that to pragmatics,

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:28.630
that'll really help with a
problem like this, right?

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:35.430
So in addition to watching
wherever it is you're watching,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.170
or thinking or listening or
hearing about a problem that

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:43.060
seems remote, I think
right now, what that region

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.810
needs most of all is some of
that pragmatic solidarity.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.860
And they need
help-- material help

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.010
with rebuilding a health system
that could be more robust.

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:01.080
After all, these
are all areas driven

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.220
by conflict in recent
times, and those

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.525
are transnational conflicts.

00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:09.409
It's not like something
that happened just

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.239
in Liberia or just
in Sierra Leone.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.260
This is not like
blood diamonds--

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.540
like they're wearing them
on their hands, right?

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.960
So thinking about
that pragmatic piece,

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.380
and then link that
to organizations

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.678
that you have faith in.

00:34:27.678 --> 00:34:29.469
JACQUELINE FULLER: Like
Partners in Health.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:30.320
PAUL FARMER: Like
Partners in Health.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.770
I mean, we're proud
to be part of that.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:32.889
JACQUELINE FULLER:
Badge donate in back.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:35.347
PAUL FARMER: I'll just give
you an example-- something that

00:34:35.347 --> 00:34:40.110
gave me chill bumps
and moved me very much.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:47.300
An American actor named
Jeffrey Wright got it

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.780
that there's
something wrong here,

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.889
that we can't give up on
people and think they're all

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:53.454
going to die when
they have ebola.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.042
And exactly what
every doctor and nurse

00:34:57.042 --> 00:34:58.250
should have said, by the way.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.625
Wait, you're
telling me that it's

00:34:59.625 --> 00:35:02.480
because they have
hypovolemic shock?

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.520
JACQUELINE FULLER:
That's treatable.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.800
PAUL FARMER: And
that's treatable.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.155
Or they're losing electrolytes.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:16.010
And so he started a
public service campaign

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:20.740
about survival, and
to get the message out

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.860
that we've got to fight
for people to survive.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.665
Don't forget, when people
survive, they become immune.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.662
That's what it looks like to us.

00:35:29.662 --> 00:35:31.037
JACQUELINE FULLER:
And gives hope

00:35:31.037 --> 00:35:32.695
to everyone else observing them.

00:35:32.695 --> 00:35:34.820
PAUL FARMER: That they can
be part of the solution.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.070
JACQUELINE FULLER: That I
don't need to hide this.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.700
I can come forward.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.990
PAUL FARMER: And they
can help us in our work.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.635
I'm not immune.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.855
They are.

00:35:45.855 --> 00:35:47.980
Now, not everybody's going
to want to work on that,

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.720
but that's just an example.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.520
People think, OK, there's
somebody who's survived ebola.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.550
What if they're part
of the solution?

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.880
That's what happened
with AIDS activism.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.970
Let's have ebola activism.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:05.615
Let's make sure that there's
a place for them to help.

00:36:05.615 --> 00:36:08.910
And I know it sounds
kind of corny,

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:12.430
but I feel that way about
everybody about global health

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.280
equity is that everybody
can help somehow.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.821
JACQUELINE FULLER:
And I think that's

00:36:15.821 --> 00:36:17.850
part of the magic that
ignited the generation is

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.630
that every person
matters, and that we

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.910
need to do we can
do to save everyone,

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:24.000
because each life matters.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.360
So first question.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.520
I see Raquel, who's an
engineer with google.org,

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.890
and has helped leading our
crisis response on this.

00:36:32.107 --> 00:36:34.690
AUDIENCE: You said there's not
enough T in the ebola treatment

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.290
units, and that
we haven't really

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.570
reached the highest
quality of care possible.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:45.730
So what I want to understand
is if there aren't enough

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.330
actual physical doctors, enough
actual beds, enough capacity

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:50.515
in the treatment centers?

00:36:50.515 --> 00:36:51.890
Because in a lot
of conversations

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.530
we've had with various
people, all sorts

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.470
of health
organizations who we've

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:58.595
been talking with to
see how Google can help,

00:36:58.595 --> 00:37:00.970
one thing that we've heard--
and maybe this has changed--

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:02.770
is, well, we don't need money.

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:04.197
We need leadership
and direction.

00:37:04.197 --> 00:37:06.530
And maybe this is more around
some of the tech solutions

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.150
we were talking
about, but the sense

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.299
that the money's
flowing in, but we

00:37:11.299 --> 00:37:13.590
need people who know how to
execute, organize, connect,

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.860
deploy, train.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.630
All these things.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.280
It's people.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.950
But it seems like that may not
be the case, if it's really

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:26.475
that we don't have
enough actual physicians.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.360
PAUL FARMER: Well, I
don't think that it's true

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.970
that we have enough money.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.030
First of all, a pledge
is not the same,

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.480
as you know, as delivery.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.770
That's just the
beginning of a process

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.890
to get to the last mile.

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:47.120
So again, I would say
that is incorrect.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:47.960
I've heard it, too.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.240
It's just not true.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.590
We need massive resources
and a commitment to delivery.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.580
We've studied this now.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.705
In fact, we've used
IT platforms just

00:37:57.705 --> 00:38:01.180
to ask a simple question
after the Asian earthquake.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.770
How many of these pledges
are actually delivered?

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.910
And that's just delivered
to a place where

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.410
they could be
delivered as services.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.618
JACQUELINE FULLER: How of
it actually hits the field?

00:38:10.618 --> 00:38:13.230
PAUL FARMER: And that's just a
national capital kind of thing.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.720
We found out the answer
is not very attractive.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:25.080
So we basically need staff,
stuff, space, and systems.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.185
We don't have any of them.

00:38:26.185 --> 00:38:27.120
JACQUELINE FULLER:
What's the hashtag?

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.036
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:29.142 --> 00:38:29.975
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.830
PAUL FARMER: I like that.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:35.092
What's a hashtag again?

00:38:35.092 --> 00:38:36.175
JACQUELINE FULLER: Oh my--

00:38:36.175 --> 00:38:37.360
PAUL FARMER: No, I have
a teenage daughter.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.460
She explained it to me.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.120
JACQUELINE FULLER: We're gonna
do a little session afterwards.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.210
PAUL FARMER: I'm not done.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.920
I'm just getting warmed up.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.930
JACQUELINE FULLER: OK,
you're getting warmed up,

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:46.667
but we've got people
who it's going

00:38:46.667 --> 00:38:48.250
to be the biggest
moment of their life

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.970
that they get to ask
you a question, so--

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.136
PAUL FARMER: You should
just take one of my classes.

00:38:53.539 --> 00:38:55.330
JACQUELINE FULLER: But
go ahead and finish,

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:57.371
and then we'll turn it
over to our next question.

00:38:57.371 --> 00:39:03.690
PAUL FARMER: Well, I think we're
counting on your discernment

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:08.110
and everybody's
discernment, because first

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.925
of all, most of
that critical care

00:39:09.925 --> 00:39:12.540
is delivered by
nurses, not doctors.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.810
Go into the emergency room, the
urgent care center-- someone

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:18.550
needs an IV.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.155
It's nurses.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:26.100
And I think if you go in to
your nurse or a physician--

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.240
you go into an ETU
and you don't see

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.840
this happening for
all kinds of reasons.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.100
But the reason isn't
that it isn't needed.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:40.530
Then, you know, we've got
to be tougher on ourselves,

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.340
at least on the clinical side,
and say there's not enough.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.620
Again, if it were
you, I wouldn't

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.167
want you to have
that kind of care.

00:39:48.167 --> 00:39:50.500
If it were me, I wouldn't
want to have that kind of care

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.850
if I'm critically ill.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.530
If I've got a
hemorrhagic complication

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.410
and a blood product
will help me,

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.630
don't say it's
impossible to give blood.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.750
Let's say, instead,
we've got a long way

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:04.700
to go on staff, stuff,
space, and systems.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.450
JACQUELINE FULLER: And
Partners in Health,

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.908
along with a lot
of other orgs, are

00:40:07.908 --> 00:40:11.410
the ones who blew up
in this whole idea

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:15.080
when people said we can't treat
AIDS in a place like Africa.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.280
We can't treat TB.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.570
We can't treat
multi-drug resistant TB.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:22.010
Partners in Health has proved
that we can do it, and do it

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.370
in a very resource
effective way.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:25.400
Takes the mentality.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.640
PAUL FARMER: Yeah.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.440
And I think it takes
a different kind

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.000
of idea, again, of
who the team is.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.264
It's the community health
workers, but also the doctors.

00:40:35.264 --> 00:40:37.430
And if you go right through
that list-- don't worry,

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.320
I won't-- staff,
stuff, space, systems--

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.460
same things around AIDS.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.211
And again, just setting
our sights higher.

00:40:44.211 --> 00:40:46.460
JACQUELINE FULLER: All right,
we got another question.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.060
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.143
I was just wondering if
you'd go a little bit more

00:40:49.143 --> 00:40:51.380
into what you think the
sociological angle of health

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.940
care in West Africa
is, and how you

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.685
think Weber work
applies to that.

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:56.060
JACQUELINE FULLER:
Did you really

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.190
ask him to quote [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.600
PAUL FARMER: He did.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.490
I'm so happy.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.895
I've been waiting for this
since Google was founded.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:07.110
So Max Weber was this great
sociologist 100 years ago

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:11.270
who wrote some classics
like "On Bureaucracy," which

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.730
I use in teaching global health.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.360
Because-- and I'll just say
the short version, concision

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.280
not being my strong suit--
that his predictions

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.090
about bureaucracy,
policy, moving away

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:26.640
from charismatic authority
to bureaucracies,

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.254
all have come true.

00:41:28.254 --> 00:41:29.920
And the only reason
to keep that in mind

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.822
is that every time you fix
as policy a standard, what

00:41:35.822 --> 00:41:37.450
if something new comes along?

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.310
It's like a budget.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.170
You say, well, ebola's
not in our budget.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.920
Well, that means that
your budget's wrong,

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.210
not that the virus is wrong.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:49.410
And sociologically or
whatever, politically, this

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.260
is what happens all the time.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.690
This is why you get big
moral errors like, well,

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:58.060
we don't treat AIDS in Africa.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.830
And it's absurd.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.530
And it happens every time.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.170
And then you have
to fight like hell

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.070
to say, OK, what's the
global health equity agenda?

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:12.395
Forget about the
plan that we had.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.152
If it didn't have cholera in
it, and cholera smacks Haiti,

00:42:16.152 --> 00:42:17.360
you'd better change the plan.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.750
You'd better change the budget.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.350
And that, again,
is difficult when

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.780
you're socialized for scarcity,
and everything is about,

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.150
well, let's do more for less.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.790
Look at the budgets
of those countries

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:34.690
from the public
sector into help.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.740
They're at India
level per capita,

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.110
which is very, very low.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.580
China's up here.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.820
Rwanda's above China per capita.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.830
That's why Rwanda has
such a strong health

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.190
system is because
they invested in it,

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:52.710
and they brought partners
in to invest in their plan,

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:55.460
and they have to be
able to change it,

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.110
like I said, on a dime.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.630
And that's hard.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:00.300
That's where I
imagine we're stuck

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.401
in that part of the world.

00:43:02.401 --> 00:43:04.400
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
book you could recommend

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.040
or books about the
kind of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.123
PAUL FARMER: "Women,
Poverty, and AIDS," for sure.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:09.744
Say again?

00:43:09.744 --> 00:43:10.410
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:11.380
I was wondering if
you could recommend

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.826
a book that goes into the
kind of setting of priorities

00:43:13.826 --> 00:43:15.700
in a bureaucracy that
you were talking about,

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.949
whether Weber or other people.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.765
PAUL FARMER: Meet
me after class.

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:21.701
Yeah, I do.

00:43:21.701 --> 00:43:22.200
I do.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.770
I'll write some down for you.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.380
JACQUELINE FULLER: And we'll
publish it on Go Paul Farmer,

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.010
so people can have
access to it, too.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.820
So why don't I take
a Dory question

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.660
from one of our other offices?

00:43:31.402 --> 00:43:32.860
So what do you
think tech companies

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.240
like Google can do to aid the
efforts in building a better,

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.160
long lasting health
system in Africa?

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.400
PAUL FARMER: Well, again,
this issue of-- hi, Dory.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.344
I wonder where they are.

00:43:46.344 --> 00:43:48.260
JACQUELINE FULLER: Who's
asking that question?

00:43:49.357 --> 00:43:50.440
PAUL FARMER: Can you tell?

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.020
Ulan Bator.

00:43:55.146 --> 00:43:57.599
You know, it doesn't matter.

00:43:57.599 --> 00:43:58.390
I was just curious.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:04.950
I think one of the
things that you could do

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.570
is, again, this
accompaniment idea.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.090
Because if you look at
the way that business

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:13.120
is done contractually,
contractors,

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.080
a beginning, and an end,
that's not what we need,

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:17.750
I don't think.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.416
We need a long term
accompaniment model.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:24.424
Because it takes a long
time to build systems.

00:44:24.424 --> 00:44:26.340
You could say, well,
we're not in the business

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.990
of building systems,
but you are.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.120
That's what Google does, right?

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.130
And you do this in
settings where there's

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.340
extreme poverty,
no electrical grid.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.160
People tend to have their--
and this is true, again,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:39.790
of all of us.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:40.880
Remember what Jim said.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.055
You spend a lot of time
trying to talk people out

00:44:43.055 --> 00:44:46.935
of talking themselves out
of doing the right thing.

00:44:46.935 --> 00:44:50.870
Accompaniment is
a balm-- B-A-L-M--

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:53.860
for us from companies.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:59.870
And we just haven't had that
many experiences with companies

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:03.080
or with foundations, sometimes.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.050
And we need more,
because that's the kind

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.434
of fruitful relationship we
would seek with a tech company.

00:45:09.434 --> 00:45:10.350
JACQUELINE FULLER: OK.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:12.339
Let's take another
live question.

00:45:12.339 --> 00:45:12.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:14.164 --> 00:45:16.580
Correct me if I'm wrong, because
I'm not a medical doctor,

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.371
but a lot of the initial
symptoms for ebola

00:45:18.371 --> 00:45:21.430
are similar to the common
flu's initial symptoms.

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.660
Do you think the media
possibly drumming up

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.420
an ebola scare being
in the United States

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.370
could overwhelm the US
health system to a point

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:30.370
where the few ebola
cases possibly

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.540
get overlooked with
too many people

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.905
thinking they have ebola
when they just have the flu?

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:40.740
PAUL FARMER: That's
a possibility,

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.450
and it happens
every time there's

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.480
a big scare of one
reason or another, right?

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.940
I do think that with
better diagnostics-- let

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.500
me just put it this way.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:56.540
I bet you everybody who's
working in an emergency room

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.630
or urgent care center is
thinking ebola all the time

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.140
now, right?

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:07.190
And the day after the Texas
case, the next morning,

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:11.250
I was teaching in an
infectious disease course,

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:14.695
and I laid out a
typical presentation.

00:46:15.854 --> 00:46:17.520
And it would've been
malaria or typhoid,

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.030
and half the room went, ebola.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.590
It was ebola, actually.

00:46:23.006 --> 00:46:31.307
So I think having a
heightened suspicion,

00:46:31.307 --> 00:46:33.390
as long you're not forgetting
the other, much more

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.430
common and treatable
causes, I think

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:36.920
it's probably a good thing.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.900
And we need better
diagnostics, but right now, I

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.750
don't think it's a
bad thing to have

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.730
this ridiculously heightened
sense that what if it's

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:52.680
ebola, as long as we
know where ebola sits

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.240
in the burden of disease that
could cause a fever, weakness,

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.120
nausea, and vomiting.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.720
It's extremely low, for
sure, in the United States.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:05.540
And even in a place like
some parts of rural Guinea

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:10.020
or Liberia, it would
still be extremely low.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.360
It would be much more
likely to be malaria.

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:16.420
But it's good for everybody
to be worried about it.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:20.010
The problem is, as
Jackie pointed out,

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:25.200
is now that the primary health
care system has tottered

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.990
and fallen, getting it back
up again is going to require

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.320
linking that anxiety
about one problem

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.810
to linking that anxiety to all
the problems that are common.

00:47:35.457 --> 00:47:37.290
JACQUELINE FULLER: OK,
so we have a question

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:38.540
from one of our other offices.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.790
PAUL FARMER: Why five minutes.

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.560
I came all the way
from Monrovia, Sasha.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.540
I want another 50 minutes.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.110
This is your Friday.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:52.500
You guys-- I know your
famous work hour thing,

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.420
where you get a--

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:53.710
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.084
We've got to get
to our nap pods.

00:47:55.084 --> 00:47:56.412
No, I'm just kidding.

00:47:56.412 --> 00:47:58.040
[LAUGHING]

00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.790
JACQUELINE FULLER:
We're going to actually

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:01.590
have more time after
this with Doctor

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:04.140
Farmer and technologists,
because we specifically

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.800
want to spend some
time with engineers.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.632
So if your interested
in that conversation,

00:48:08.632 --> 00:48:10.340
we are going to stay
a little bit longer.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.160
But in the last
five minutes or so,

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.902
especially for our
remote offices,

00:48:13.902 --> 00:48:16.110
I'll just tick through maybe
some of these questions.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:16.943
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.900
JACQUELINE FULLER:
So you've said

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.290
that understanding poverty
and inequity requires

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.984
many disciplines-- economics,
ethics, loss, sociology.

00:48:24.984 --> 00:48:27.400
Oh my gosh, you're going to
quote Weber again, aren't you?

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.190
In your experience
in communities,

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:32.220
what disciplines are
missing, and what do they

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.160
need to focus on once
they come to the table?

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.660
PAUL FARMER: You
know, I think I can

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.360
answer that with
much more concision.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:42.930
I think history, because we
are a desocializing species.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:46.380
Like, we can't even remember
what happened last year.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.335
So an anthropologist
studying anthropology,

00:48:48.335 --> 00:48:51.580
a sociologist with sociology,
a psychologist-- forget it.

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.910
It's history.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:56.500
This is not the first
rodeo we've been to.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.560
It is, as you pointed
out, similar to HIV,

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:05.340
or similar to the previous
epidemics of hemorrhagic fever.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.520
And I think if only we were
a little bit more rigorous

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.630
with ourselves about
looking at what's

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:13.480
happened before-- not
everything is new.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.300
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.365
We're relearning some lessons
again and again and again.

00:49:18.365 --> 00:49:19.990
PAUL FARMER: By the
way, the prevention

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.485
versus care, quality of
care, when it's poor,

00:49:22.485 --> 00:49:26.460
thinking it's high-- none
of this seems strange to me.

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.397
JACQUELINE FULLER: OK.

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:27.980
Next question?

00:49:29.824 --> 00:49:30.365
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:30.365 --> 00:49:34.190
So I read your review on Rishi
Manchanda's book, "The Upstream

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:37.612
Doctor," and I had a
quick question about that.

00:49:37.612 --> 00:49:39.224
PAUL FARMER: How'd you like it?

00:49:39.224 --> 00:49:40.640
AUDIENCE: Your
review or the book?

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.598
PAUL FARMER: My review.

00:49:42.356 --> 00:49:43.480
"Women, Poverty, and AIDS."

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.325
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:44.325 --> 00:49:45.116
PAUL FARMER: Sorry.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:50.040
AUDIENCE: I'll add
that to my to do list.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.730
So given that upstream solutions
aren't the easiest sell--

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:57.310
they're long term plays to
tackle the source of a problem,

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:00.560
as opposed to the symptoms
that people in the media

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:06.250
focus on-- in your conversations
with world leaders, what

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:12.060
has been the data or the primary
factors that motivate them

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.490
to be catalysts for change at
the levels they operate in?

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.020
PAUL FARMER: Well,
I think it's better

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.640
to assume that their
motivation is something good,

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.365
and then entrap them
into decency, right?

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:29.460
You feel me?

00:50:30.955 --> 00:50:32.160
I'm serious.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:39.140
I think to approach leaders
with a hermeneutic of suspicion

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.920
and not engage them in a chance
to do something decent is bad

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:48.690
for people marginalized by
poverty and racism and gender

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:49.540
inequality, right?

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:51.860
Don't do that.

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.800
We shouldn't do that
on their behalfs,

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.750
to say it's not worth working
with so and so world leader.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:03.290
The upstream downstream
is another one

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.310
of those classic lessons, right?

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:07.619
Where there's a sort
of Luddite approach

00:51:07.619 --> 00:51:09.410
to upstream downstream,
where we're saying,

00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:13.970
well, the upstream
determinants are all important,

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:16.900
but if you're already
downstream-- if you already

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.590
have ebola-- like I'm
saying, I want someone

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:21.940
to be looking out for me.

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:27.010
And I was just saying, I
was at Stanford saying,

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:29.742
oh, I was stupid enough
to walk in front of a car

00:51:29.742 --> 00:51:30.950
when I was a medical student.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.340
And I didn't have my
M.D., and I looked

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.110
at my leg lying in the street
and thought, hey, broken leg.

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:40.385
I didn't even have my M.D.
What a great diagnostician.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:44.709
If someone had come over to
me, leaned over me, and said,

00:51:44.709 --> 00:51:46.250
hey, you should have
looked both ways

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:49.930
before you cross the street--
if an ambulance attendant did

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:53.750
that, I would be
really unhappy, right?

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:57.190
That's what we do to
poor people all the time.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:58.840
We're like, upstream downstream.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840
Should have used bednet.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.770
Should have used a condom.

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:01.530
Should have done this.

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:02.460
Should have done that.

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:11.350
History has shown us that
we do that way too often.

00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:14.320
And so we can do
downstream-- that is,

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:17.050
take good care of people-- as
we're doing upstream-- that is,

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.020
prevent people
from getting sick.

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:23.940
And that's an important thing
to get across to world leaders

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.650
as well.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:25.990
This is complicated, you know?

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:29.590
And they want something simple
or low cost or cost effective.

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:30.910
And all these things change.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.950
Something that's
complex becomes simple.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:37.460
Something that is costly
becomes less costly.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.120
Something that is
effective becomes

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.490
replaced by something
that's far more effective.

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:45.070
And again, the bureaucracies
can't move rapidly enough.

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:49.760
That's, again, why
we need room to move,

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.210
and that requires resources.

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:54.460
Against, [INAUDIBLE]
systems, blah, blah, blah.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:58.620
And that's very hard, I
think, for world leaders.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.800
They're being told, here's your
budget, or here's your plan.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.810
In fact, you get
derided for wanting

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:09.730
to change as fast
as the pathogens do.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:11.870
You get made fun of.

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:14.950
Which is imprudent, as
we're now seeing with ebola.

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:15.950
That's a great question.

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.449
JACQUELINE FULLER: Why don't
we have our last two questions?

00:53:18.449 --> 00:53:20.284
Just both of you
ask your questions

00:53:20.284 --> 00:53:21.950
one right after each
other, and that way

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:23.908
we can get them in before
[INAUDIBLE] take off.

00:53:24.799 --> 00:53:25.340
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:28.930
For those who are
surviving ebola,

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:31.160
there's obviously a
huge amount of stigma.

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.100
And I'm just wondering how the
health systems in West Africa

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.225
are treating the survivors.

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:40.540
PAUL FARMER: Well,
I don't know enough.

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:49.110
But, again, to quote Jim Kim, we
should hire every one of them.

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.900
I think that's exactly
the right logic.

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:56.070
And the health care systems
and the neighborhoods,

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:59.790
neighborhood organizations,
church groups,

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:01.777
whatever-- I think
that's really going

00:54:01.777 --> 00:54:03.360
to be an important
message to get out.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.790
And I'm quite sure that's why
Jeffrey Wright was working

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:10.850
not just to get people in
the United States or Europe

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:14.300
who might see one of his movies.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.242
And, again, I don't
know-- I guess

00:54:16.242 --> 00:54:17.700
that's a kind of
global phenomenon.

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.990
I messed up again.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.710
But also to get
the message of hope

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:26.820
out in areas facing big
burdens of ebola disease.

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.710
So I think that's just
unfurling right now,

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:31.840
and that we would
do well, all of us,

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.330
including those of us who
are going to be working there

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:39.470
for some time, to keep on
underlining how much we need

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:42.120
the survivors to be
part of the solution,

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.010
and that we're with them.

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:48.150
And I'm hoping that'll
change very rapidly.

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:50.230
And the health systems--
again, remember

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.900
the health systems are
underfunded and collapsed,

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:56.430
so they couldn't just say, OK,
we'll hire all of them, right?

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:57.342
But we could.

00:54:57.342 --> 00:54:59.800
We could help them do that and
strengthen the public health

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.762
system by a relatively
minor expense, right?

00:55:03.762 --> 00:55:05.220
One little happy
thing-- and I know

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.660
you wanted both
questions to be asked--

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.680
is that when I was
leaving Monrovia,

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.190
they were just opening up
a new ebola treatment unit.

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:19.809
And the they was the Liberians,
and working with colleagues

00:55:19.809 --> 00:55:20.600
mostly from Uganda.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:26.590
And it was the day
before the grand opening,

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:33.655
and there was a huge crowd in
front of the ebola treatment

00:55:33.655 --> 00:55:35.715
unit, and they were volunteers.

00:55:35.715 --> 00:55:37.735
And it was all Liberians.

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.670
People want to help.

00:55:43.303 --> 00:55:45.850
And we've got to help
them help, right?

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:48.777
Because they have
resources we don't have,

00:55:48.777 --> 00:55:50.360
but we have resources
they don't have,

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.080
and I think it's going to be
the same with the survivors.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.890
JACQUELINE FULLER:
OK, last question.

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:54.056
PAUL FARMER: Great question.

00:55:54.492 --> 00:55:56.450
AUDIENCE: I have a couple
of questions on the--

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.283
JACQUELINE FULLER: No,
you get one question.

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:02.340
AUDIENCE: On the
disease ebola itself.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.640
You mentioned that the
survival rate is very low,

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.430
because the treatment
options are not that good.

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:11.790
Do we know the growth room for
how much better the survival

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:15.105
rate could be if we had
good treatment options?

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:19.090
And the second
question is I've seen

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:21.690
all these pictures of
people in space suits.

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:23.460
Is that an overabundance
of caution,

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.380
or is ebola really
that infectious?

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.250
JACQUELINE FULLER:
That's a good question.

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:27.583
PAUL FARMER: Two good questions.

00:56:27.583 --> 00:56:28.261
He was right.

00:56:28.261 --> 00:56:30.260
JACQUELINE FULLER: And
you can answer them both.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.560
PAUL FARMER: Well,
I don't believe

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.935
it's an overabundance
of caution.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:41.120
And just to say one reason why,
and then I'll go to the other.

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:48.160
It's one thing to wear this gear
in an air conditioned building,

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:48.660
right?

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:52.840
And even in the New
York Times article

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.320
a couple days ago about
Nigeria's response,

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.590
they mentioned air
conditioned hospitals.

00:56:57.590 --> 00:57:02.730
And in Haiti, when
I'm about to pass out,

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:06.780
I go into the surgery wing,
because it's air conditioned.

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.770
I mean, really, pass out.

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:13.802
Now, there's no
electricity, so how's

00:57:13.802 --> 00:57:15.260
there going to be
air conditioning?

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:20.800
Here and there,
maybe, but how long

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.375
can you wear that
and be very careful?

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.575
The people I trust
most say about an hour,

00:57:30.575 --> 00:57:31.575
and then its disposable.

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:34.600
Now, there must be
other solutions.

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:39.230
We need to talk to manufacturers
who understand this.

00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:41.400
It's too hot, right?

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:44.880
And what does that
mean, it's too hot?

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.490
You make a mistake,
you get careless,

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:51.740
you don't have on
the right coverage,

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:55.180
it's because people look at
a video at how often people

00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.500
touch their eyes or their mouth.

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:02.820
It's not that it's suddenly
going through skin.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:06.320
So I don't think it's
an excess of caution

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.790
until we have the
staff and the stuff we

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:11.545
need to make it
go very smoothly.

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:18.430
So the other point, which I'm
very passionate about, is--

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:24.720
this is just me saying
live to the planet,

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.287
or wherever this stuff goes--

00:58:26.287 --> 00:58:27.870
JACQUELINE FULLER:
Live to the planet.

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:28.536
Thanks, YouTube.

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:32.730
PAUL FARMER: I
think that we should

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:38.270
assume that we are able to save
the great majority of people

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:40.630
already sick with ebola.

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:41.300
Why?

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:45.540
What's the risk in
saying, 95% survival rate?

00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.600
Risk that I'll look like a fool?

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.510
I don't care, right?

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.870
I would like, as a physician
and as a community health

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:57.910
activist-- I could care
less if that sounds

00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:00.980
foolish to any of my colleagues.

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:07.620
If we assume that 95% of
people could be saved,

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:11.640
and we-- pardon me, but bust
our asses to try and get them

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:17.320
diagnosed and cared for early
on and do everything we can,

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:21.910
what's the risk of having an
excess of zeal, as opposed

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:23.890
to an excess of caution?

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:30.240
So I think that message of
90% case fatality is damaging.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.620
I've heard it before.

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:35.210
What's the case fatality rate
of untreated pneumococcal

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.350
[INAUDIBLE] before we developed
antibiotics, or for those

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:42.412
who live outside of the
antibiotic realm even today?

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:43.370
It's probably the same.

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:44.900
It's probably 90%.

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.790
So I think we should
believe that we

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:50.180
can flip those
numbers on their head.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:57.540
This is a failure of delivery
of basic supportive care.

00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.570
And when we address that, and
we say, oh, you were wrong,

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:02.840
it's really 50%, that's fine.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.180
I can live with that.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.810
But until we address
the failure of delivery,

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:09.220
I'm just going to
assume, based on what

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:14.220
we know about the critically
ill from sepsis, whether it's

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:18.360
of bacterial or viral cause,
or hemorrhagic complication,

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.830
that we should be
saving everybody.

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:23.590
And if it's not everybody's
job to save them,

01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:26.790
it is the job of
doctors and nurses

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.540
and their family members, right?

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.211
That's what their
family members are

01:00:30.211 --> 01:00:32.460
going to care about-- their
mothers and their siblings

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.870
and their children.

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:36.980
And we've made
this mistake before

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.415
around every serious
infection I know of,

01:00:40.415 --> 01:00:43.025
or cancer like acute
leukemia in children.

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:48.430
We've got to fight to
do that part of our job.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:50.950
Thank you.

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:52.866
JACQUELINE FULLER: So a
very important message

01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:55.860
from Doctor Farmer, I
think, to all of us,

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.010
charging us on towards
pragmatic solidarity.

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.270
I think for Google
in particular,

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:04.720
thinking about how we can
lean in with our technology

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.559
for the long term with a
preferential preference

01:01:07.559 --> 01:01:08.100
for the poor.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.170
Gonna steal that, too.

01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:11.070
PAUL FARMER: I stole it.

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:12.210
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:15.309
So let's all thank Doctor
Farmer for coming here today,

01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:16.558
and his message for all of us.

01:01:16.558 --> 01:01:17.933
PAUL FARMER: Thank
you very much.

01:01:17.933 --> 01:01:18.978
Thank you.

01:01:18.978 --> 01:01:20.430
JACQUELINE FULLER: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:21.398
PAUL FARMER: Thank you
so much for having me.

01:01:21.398 --> 01:01:22.606
JACQUELINE FULLER: Thank you.

01:01:22.606 --> 01:01:23.818
Thank you.

01:01:23.818 --> 01:01:26.036
Our hero.
