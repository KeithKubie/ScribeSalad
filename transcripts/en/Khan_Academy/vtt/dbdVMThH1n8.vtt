00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.760
Let's think about what might
happen if we had a solution of

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.370
this carboxylic acid here.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.410
We might as well name it just
to get some practice.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.440
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.720
So this is heptan-, and then
we don't write heptane,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.380
because this is a
carboxylic acid.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.240
It is heptanoic acid.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.470
So let's see what happens if
we have heptanoic acid

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.380
reacting with-- this is one, two
carbons, and then it has

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.200
an OH group, so this
is ethanol.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.890
That's what the OH group does.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.260
It makes this an alcohol.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.750
And it's in the presence of a
sulfuric acid catalyst. This

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.120
right here is sulfuric acid,
one of the stronger acids.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.220
I'll actually draw its
structure, because I always

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.740
find it frustrating when people
just write just the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.950
formula here without the actual
structure, because the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.770
structure actually shows
you why it's so acidic.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.310
Sulfur has six valence
electrons, just like oxygen.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.310
So it has a double bond to an
oxygen, another double bond to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.410
an oxygen, and then it has a
single bond to an OH group,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.560
and then it has another single
bond to an OH group.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.640
And notice, it has one,
two, three, four,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.880
five, six valence electrons.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.220
Now, the reason why this is such
a strong acid, is that if

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.490
either of these oxygens take the
electron from this proton,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.480
so actually give away the
proton to the solution,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.130
there's a ton of resonance
structures here.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.230
And maybe I'll make a whole
video on sulfuric acid, just

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.720
to show you all of the
resonance structures.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.245
But, in general, whenever you
see a reaction when they say

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:45.960
it's catalyzed by an acid, all
you have to do is realize it's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.880
just going to make the
surrounding solution a lot

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.230
more acidic, just a
ton more acidic.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.676
Maybe we're in a solution of
ethanol, and if we are in a

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:57.990
solution of ethanol, it'll
just add protons to the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.165
ethanol itself.

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:01.390
So you can imagine this
guy right over here.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.440
Let me draw the sulfuric acid
a little bit differently.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.210
Let me draw these
oxygen-hydrogen bonds, so you

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.580
have this oxygen and it is
bonded to a hydrogen there.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.040
This is floating around
the solution.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.790
You have your ethanol that
looks like this, so two

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.250
carbons and then bonded to an
oxygen, and then that oxygen

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.040
is bonded to a hydrogen.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.680
The oxygen has two lone
pairs, just like that.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.800
And so this guy really is good
at getting rid of the protons.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.050
So you have a situation where
this electron can be taken

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.870
back by this oxygen, and then it
can actually be given here,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.080
and there's all these resonance
structures.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.280
But it's just very good at
taking that electron.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.080
And that can happen at the exact
same time that one of

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.235
the ethanols capture the
hydrogen proton, at the exact

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:55.490
same time that this oxygen
captures that hydrogen proton.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.130
And if you just look at this
part right here, this will

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.760
just result in-- this part alone
will just result in a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.590
ton of having these protonated
ethanols flying around.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.970
Actually, let me draw
it over here.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.760
I want to make sure
I'm using my

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.080
screen real estate properly.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.950
So this will result in a ton of
these protonated ethanols.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.510
So one, two carbons, it
has this original

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.940
hydrogen over here.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.950
But now it has one electron in
that original pair, and it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.350
gave the other electron to this
hydrogen, so it gave the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.850
other electron to that
hydrogen nucleus.

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.840
Let me do it in that
same color.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.900
So it took a proton.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.440
It gave away an electron, so it
now has a positive charge.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.930
And now what was a sulfuric
acid now has a

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.210
negative charge over here.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.380
So if I were to draw it, it
would now look like this.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.690
Plus sulfur, two double
bonds, two oxygens.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.330
You still have this OH group.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.470
Actually, it could
still donate.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.320
This is still acidic, but now
this oxygen right now gained

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.300
an electron.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.980
It now has a negative charge.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.960
Now, the whole reason I did this
is I wanted to give you a

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.820
tangible sense of what sulfuric
acid looks like and

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.830
why it's acidic.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.120
But really, you just have to
kind of internalize that

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.290
you're just going to have a
bunch of hydrogen protons

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.930
floating around.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.040
They could be attached
to an ethanol.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.070
If this was a water solution,
they could create hydronium,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.400
so you have a bunch of hydrogen
protons floating

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.410
around that will catalyze
this reaction.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.590
They will be used to facilitate
the reaction we're

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.380
going to explore, and then
they will be let go.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.310
So hopefully, this right here,
by having this right here, if

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.720
I start involving some of these
protonated ethanols in

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.160
our reaction, you won't view
that as a huge stretch of the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.740
imagination, because they would
have gotten protonated

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.270
by the sulfuric acid.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.100
Or if I just actually grab
protons in our reaction, that

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.630
actually might make it
a little bit simpler.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.170
So let's start with the
actual reaction.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.820
So let me read redraw
my heptanoic acid.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.990
So I have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.320
carbons, double bond to an
oxygen, and then we have an OH

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.010
group right over here.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.410
Now, the first step of this
reaction, this oxygen right

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.660
here, we have all these protons
floating around, very

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.330
acidic environment.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.580
We have sulfuric acid there just
giving protons away to

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.060
the ethanol or to
other things.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.270
So this guy can grab a proton
either directly from sulfuric

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.170
acid or maybe from one
of the protonated

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.580
ethanols, either one.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.720
So we could just draw
it like this.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.700
He just grabs a hydrogen
proton.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.190
The hydrogen proton might have
had an electron associated

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.540
with it that would then go back
to a sulfuric acid, but

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.010
just to make things simple, I'll
just say grabs a proton

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.490
from something else.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.530
So once he grabs that proton,
then it looks like this.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.480
So I'll draw my two, three,
four, five, six, seven

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.240
carbons, double bond to an
oxygen, single bond to an OH.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.370
This oxygen had two lone pairs,
but now one of the lone

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.400
pairs is broken up because it
gave an electron to this

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.730
hydrogen proton right
over there.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.700
Hydrogen proton, it was
positively charged.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.630
It gained an electron.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.810
Now it is neutral.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.160
But this oxygen right over here
gave away the electron,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.170
so it is now positive.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.570
Now, the next step,
we have all this

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.820
ethanol floating around.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.600
So let me introduce some
ethanol, and I'll do this in a

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.810
different color.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.200
So we have this ethanol floating
around, and this is

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.380
one, two carbons.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.140
This is our ethanol.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.600
You have two electron pairs
on that oxygen.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.250
And then you could imagine,
especially because this is now

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.430
a good leaving group, you can
imagine that this acts as a

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.100
nucleophile.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.040
It would do a nucleophile attack
on this carbonyl carbon

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.030
right here.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.120
And so what you could imagine is
that this electron attacks,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.560
or gets given to, this carbon
right here on the carbonyl.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.780
And at the exact same time that
this happens, this oxygen

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.120
is positively charged.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.130
It wants an electron.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.300
It wants to get neutral again.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.471
It's already hogging
these electrons.

00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:16.533
That's why you have
a partial positive

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:16.926
charge on this carbon.

00:07:16.926 --> 00:07:19.626
That's why this guy might
be attracted to this.

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:21.590
We've see this in Sn2 reactions
many, many, many,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.660
many times already.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.280
So this electron will
be taken up by this

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.890
top oxygen over there.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.420
So after that happens, what
does our newly formed

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.770
molecule look like?

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.850
Let me just scroll down and
have some clear space.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.880
After that, our newly formed
molecule will look like this.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.290
We have two, three, four, five,
six, seven carbons to

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.770
get to the carbonyl carbon, and
now it will have a single

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.180
bond to that oxygen up there.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.560
That oxygen had one
lone pair already.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.370
It had this bond to this
hydrogen that it nabbed from

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.990
the solution, that proton that
it nabbed from the solution,

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.190
and now it has another pair.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.170
It had this electron that was
participating in a double bond

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.190
with this carbonyl carbon, but
now it took the other side of

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.230
that bond back.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.490
So now it has that electron and
the other one that it took

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.770
from the carbon, so it has
two lone pairs again.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.070
It had a positive charge, but
now it took back an electron.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.330
Now, it is neutral.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.500
Now the rest of the molecule,
we have this OH

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.180
group right over here.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.730
We have that OH group
right over there.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.039
And now we have the actual
ethanol that has attached

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.289
itself, so it is no
longer ethanol.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.820
It's attached itself to
this larger molecule.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.390
So this oxygen right over here,
it still has one lone

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.980
pair, but the other lone pair
has been broken up, and it has

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.890
given an electron
to this carbon.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.690
It is now bonded to the larger
molecule, and then the rest of

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.360
it, you have these one, two
carbons right there, and then

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.460
you have this hydrogen
right over there.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.245
Remember, we have a bunch of
protons floating around.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.490
Actually, I should
make it clear.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.980
These are all reversible
reactions, so I actually

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.390
shouldn't even draw one-way
arrows here.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.460
Let me scratch that out.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.240
Actually, delete that.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.710
A better thing to do, instead
of drawing these one-way

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.870
arrows is to show that the
reaction could actually go in

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.530
either direction.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.030
It's just as likely to go from
here to here as it is from

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.900
there to there.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.890
So let me draw that.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:35.420
These are kind of in equilibrium
with each other.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.960
So you can imagine the next
thing that could happen is

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.600
another oxygen could grab a
proton from the medium.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.530
And actually, before I do that,
let me make sure this

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.700
guy can lose a proton
to the medium.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.000
Actually, this guy could take
the proton from that guy, but

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.390
I won't do it that way.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:57.550
So you could imagine a situation
where this proton

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.800
just jumps off.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.320
I should have pointed it out.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.100
This guy gave away an electron
to this carbonyl carbon.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.300
So this right here has
a positive charge.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.490
In general, the oxygen, very
electronegative, it's going to

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.750
be hogging the electrons
of this proton, so it

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.880
can take them away.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.210
So far, we gained a
proton, and now we

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.770
can give back a proton.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:27.320
So this electron right here can
go back to this oxygen,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.350
making it neutral.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.780
And the proton can be picked
up by anything.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.800
It could be picked up by another
molecule of heptanoic

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.250
acid through this first
protonation we saw.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.700
It could be picked up by another
molecule of ethanol.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.730
Let me draw it like that.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.275
Let me draw it as getting picked
up by another molecule

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:44.160
of ethanol.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.520
It just gets thrown back
in the solution.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.760
So this guy gives an electron
to the proton, but the end

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.240
result is the hydrogen leaves.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.820
The electron goes back
to the oxygen.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.040
It now has a neutral charge.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.090
And once again, these are all
reversible reactions.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.280
It can go in either direction.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.620
But we're now over here,
and let me redraw

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.940
my heptanoic acid.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.900
Two, three, four, five, six,
seven single bond now to the

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.580
oxygen, single bond
to this OH.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:17.290
And now we have this bond right
over here to this now

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:22.080
deprotonated, what was ethanol,
so you have O, and

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.270
then we have one, two carbons,
just like that.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:30.050
And this guy has a hydrogen
attached to it.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.770
And I won't even bother to draw
this protonated ethanol.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.080
The protons are flying
around everywhere.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.020
Now, the next step, this guy,
this OH group, and especially

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.890
the oxygen in it, he could
grab a proton from the

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:41.940
surrounding solution.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.930
So he's got these
two lone pairs.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.360
He can grab a proton from one
of these protonated ethanols

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.710
from the sulfuric acid, or maybe
from one of these other

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.760
intermediate molecules,
from anywhere.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.400
That's the whole point of having
this acid catalyst, so

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.460
he could donate an electron
to a proton and then

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.110
form a bond with it.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.420
I'll keep it in that color.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.850
And so if that happened, then
the next step in our

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.490
reaction-- and remember,
these can all

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.100
go in either direction.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.270
The next step in our reaction
will look like this.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:17.790
You would have your two, three,
four, five, six, seven

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:26.520
carbons, single bond to an
oxygen, and then you have your

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.360
bond to this oxygen, which is
bound to two carbons, one, two

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.110
carbons, just like that.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.830
And this guy on top is
bonded to an oxygen.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.650
He's got two lone pairs.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.980
And this guy over here
grabbed a proton.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.470
He gave an electron to
a hydrogen proton.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.480
He had two, but now he gave one
of them to this proton.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.440
And so he gave it to
that hydrogen.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.460
That hydrogen is now neutral.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.670
It gained an electron.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.300
This oxygen is now positive,
because it

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.170
gave away an electron.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.170
It still has this other
lone pair over here.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:13.790
It is now positive, and frankly,
it is now a good

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.530
leaving group.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.660
So, in the next step, you
can have someone else.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.460
Remember, other people
need protons

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.520
earlier in this reaction.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.150
So this proton might get lost,
maybe by one of the other

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.295
ethanol molecules, so
let me draw that.

00:13:25.295 --> 00:13:27.780
Let me do a color I
haven't used yet.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.110
I'll use orange.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.010
So maybe one of the other
ethanol molecules, or one of

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.685
the other intermediaries
in this whole reaction.

00:13:34.685 --> 00:13:36.250
So ethanol, I'll just
do ethanol because

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.530
it's easier to draw.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.440
It might give an electron
to just the nucleus.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.030
And then this guy can take
the electron back.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.700
This guy could take that
hydrogen's electron back and

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.300
give it to this carbon that
was the carbonyl carbon

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.460
several steps ago.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.690
And then since he's got that
electron, he can then give

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.520
back this electron to this, what
was an OH group, but now

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.510
it's got another hydrogen there,
so he can then give it

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.150
back to him.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.900
And then the resulting products
will look like this.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.180
And this is all in
equilibrium.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.650
We now have two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.670
Now, this guy has a
double bond again.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.010
So you have an oxygen
right there.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.100
It is now a double bond.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.130
I'll draw this newly formed
double bond in magenta.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:33.450
This guy has left as water, so
I can just draw that, so now

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.490
you have this other OH group
that is bonded to this

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:38.780
hydrogen over here.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.450
He has now left as water.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.250
And now you have this other
thing over here.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.360
You have what was that ethanol
group has now attached itself.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.180
That ethanol has lost
its hydrogen.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.390
It has attached itself to what
was a carboxylic acid, so now

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.000
it looks like this.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.750
It now is bonded to an oxygen
and is bonded to one, two

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.440
carbons, just like that.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.860
And this whole reaction that
I showed you is called

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.910
esterification, one of
those words that I

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.730
have trouble saying.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.640
This one in particular
is called the Fischer

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.890
esterification.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:26.290
And he won the Nobel Prize in
1902 generally for his work in

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.540
organic chemistry.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.320
And the reason why it's called
that is we started with the

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.000
carboxylic acid.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.810
We started with a heptanoic
acid, and

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.170
now we have an ester.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.230
An ester is something that,
instead of an OH group like

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.010
you have in carboxylic
acid, you have an OR.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.230
You have an oxygen with
an actual alkyl

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.870
group attached to it.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.160
And this ester right here, and
we'll probably talk more about

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.720
esters in future videos, this
ester right here, just to give

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.690
you a hint of how to name it,
you first start with the group

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.930
that's attached to this
oxygen right here.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:12.410
There are two carbons over
there, so we'll use ethyl to

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.900
name that over there.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.340
And then we have the rest of
this, and we already know that

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.070
that is one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons,

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.350
including the carbon in
the carbonyl group.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.785
And so that is hepta-,
heptan-.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.570
And you would be tempted to call
it heptanoic acid, but it

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.580
is no longer a carboxylic
acid.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.590
It is now an ester.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:39.886
So you call it heptanoate.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.230
And this is what tells
you that you are

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.410
dealing with an ester.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.590
And this tells you what's on the
other side of the oxygen

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.490
in the ester.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.360
This is telling you how many
carbons you have attached to

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.000
the carbonyl chain of
the actual ester.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.380
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.310
I just wanted introduce you
to a well-known reaction

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.970
mechanism of creating an ester
out a carboxylic acid.
