00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.160
INTERVIEWER: How do you
translocate a three ton rhino?

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.400
The answer-- with a small
army of people and a lot

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.220
of elephants.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.485
{MUSIC PLAYING}

00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:13.750
[ELEPHANT TRUMPET]

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.260
NILANGA JAYASINGHE: So
translocation of this magnitude

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.920
is a tremendous effort.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.530
We have seen a total of about 35
elephants and about 250 people.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.080
INTERVIEWER: That was Nilanga
Jayasinghe, a program officer

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.100
for the World Wildlife Fund US.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.270
She participated in
a conservation effort

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.840
to translocate five greater
one-horned rhinos for Nepal's

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.390
Chitwan National Park
to Bardia National Park

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.360
in order to establish new
breeding populations by 2018.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.920
But in order to capture
the vulnerable rhino,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.030
the animals have to be
coerced into an open clearing.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.120
That way the team
can get a clear shot

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.820
to dart and sedate the animal.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.920
According to
Nilanga's colleague,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.390
Dr. Shant Raj Jnawali, without
the help of pachyderms,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.364
this task would be
virtually impossible.

00:01:01.364 --> 00:01:03.488
DR. SHANT RAJ JNAWALI: Our
elephants are especially

00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:05.319
trained for general work.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.134
Without an elephant,
it is impossible.

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:11.090
The grasslands here in Chitwan
are the most tallest grassland

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.850
in the world.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.170
INTERVIEWER: But maneuvering
a rhino into an open space

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.150
in such dense vegetation still
takes some skilled coordination

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030
by the elephant-mounted team.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.100
NILANGA JAYASINGHE: When
a rhino is discovered,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.766
they will communicate,
the the elephants

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:26.300
will move in in a circular
formation around the rhino

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.590
to keep it from running away.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.320
The technician who
is darting the rhino

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.350
has to climb up on a tree
to get a steady shot.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.475
But once it's darted,
everything moves very quickly.

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:39.600
It's so rapid because you
want to make sure there's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.210
minimal impact to the rhino.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.400
Ideally, it should be
done within a half an hour

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.990
from the time the rhino's darted
until it's taken to the truck

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.627
and woken back up with antidote.

00:01:50.627 --> 00:01:52.210
INTERVIEWER: The
translocation project

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.390
is just another
example of Nepal's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.210
exceptional conservation
success story with the greater

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.850
one-horned rhino.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.320
Primarily found in the Terai Arc
Landscape of India and Nepal,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.880
and the grasslands of
Assam in North Bengal,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.160
today there are around 3,500
of these rhino in the wild.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.890
Nepal alone is home
to 645 individuals.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.830
And while this
number may sound low,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.160
it is a colossal improvement
on what the population was just

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.144
over a decade ago.

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:22.560
Concerned about the chance
that they could lose the animal

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.760
for good, the Nepal government
established the Wildlife Crime

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.860
Control Bureau.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.400
Aimed at cracking down
on illegal activity,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.250
the law enforcement task
force included the Nepal army

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.900
and the Nepal police.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.550
But the biggest
impact on conservation

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.570
has come from ordinary citizens.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.540
In 2008, the government
handed almost one third

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.510
of the country's forest to
local communities to manage,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.010
encouraging them to set up
their own anti-poaching units.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.970
Today there are around 400 of
these units across the country.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.880
As Anil Manandhar, the country
representative of WWF Nepal

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.190
explains, such programs
have fostered a nation

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.057
of conservation students.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.640
ANIL MANANDHAR: We
work with the army.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.200
We work with the intelligence
bureaus, with the police.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.450
And more than anything,
we work very closely

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.930
with the local communities.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.770
And also in the family
now, conservation

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.190
is paying back to
the people, improving

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.125
the quality of
life of the people

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:20.627
through ecotourism,
wildlife tourism.

00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:22.960
INTERVIEWER: Nepal's initiatives
have been so successful

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.630
that in early 2016
the country marked

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.350
their fourth 365-day period
of zero poaching since 2011.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.870
And with the translocation
of each rhino,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.790
there is hope that new
breeding populations

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.990
can flourish in Nepal.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.990
However, for the team that
helped coordinate the move,

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.750
that moment of release
can feel bittersweet.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.750
DR. SHANT RAJ JNAWALI:
Release is very emotional

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.990
because you have worked real
hard to capture these animals.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.760
And then, like in
24 hours, that rhino

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.240
gets into deep of your heart.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.290
INTERVIEWER: But these feelings
are usually short lived.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.220
What matters to the
team is that Nepal

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.290
continues to lead
by example when

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.336
it comes to rhino conservation.

00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:11.210
NILANGA JAYASINGHE: We
hear of doom and gloom

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.820
in conservation every day.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.585
Species being killed here,
habitat being lost there.

00:04:16.585 --> 00:04:18.210
But we have to
celebrate our successes.

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:22.820
INTERVIEWER: If you head over
to the brand new Seeker VR

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.630
channel, you can
experience what it

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.380
was like to be a part
of the rhino project.

video now by clicking here.

00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:33.590
NILANGA JAYASINGHE: Conservation
here has been very successful.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.520
There are more than
600 rhinos right now.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.880
The idea is to establish
new populations of rhinos

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.696
in places where they
are no longer present.
