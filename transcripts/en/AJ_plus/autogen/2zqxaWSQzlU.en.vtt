00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.420
 public hangings to remind him 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.800

 people who are sentenced to death 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.590

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.009
 homosexuals of free thinkers who 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.689

 [Music] 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.350

 holland goes the human rights there 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.230
 nothing to do with it all 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.640

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.640
