00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:18.012
It really makes a difference what we say.

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:20.970
I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.355
She went to Auschwitz when she was fifteen years old,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.496
and her brother was eight, and the parents were lost.

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:27.889
And she told me this,

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:30.215
"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:32.810
and I looked down, and I saw 
my brother's shoes were missing.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.455
And I said, 'Why are you so stupid?

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:36.063
Can't you keep your things together?

00:00:36.063 --> 00:00:37.306
For goodness sake!'

00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:39.811
The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother."

00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:41.725
Unfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:43.779
because she never saw him again.

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:45.638
He did not survive.

00:00:45.638 --> 00:00:48.610
And so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.170
She said, "I walked out of Auschwitz into life.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.247
And the vow was,

00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:55.151
"I will never say anything that couldn't stand

00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:57.663
as the last thing I ever say."

00:00:57.663 --> 00:00:59.263
Now, can we do that? No.

00:00:59.263 --> 00:01:01.688
But it is a possibility to live in to.

00:01:01.688 --> 00:01:02.441
Thank you.
