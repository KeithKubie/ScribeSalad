00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.760
Just like some of the earlier quizzes and due to the flexibility of both D3,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.270
CSS selectors, and JavaScript, there's many right answers to this quiz.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.680
To change the title of the course, all we need to do is figure out

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.640
what type of class or ID we can select the title with.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.050
In this case, I'm going to right-click and Inspect Element.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.455
As you can see here, it's in h1 with classes h-slim,

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:32.380
left-hand-nav-title, and another one, ng-binding.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.390
I'm going to assume that left-hand-nav-title is fairly unique,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.550
if I call it on a header tag.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.770
As you can see here, calling d3.select on

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.380
h1.left-hand-nav-title returns to me another d3 array.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.780
And if we open it up, we see the element hovering just to be

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.240
absolutely sure that we've selected the right element.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.770
Now when I just mentioned, we're looking for a header tag.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.980
There's a distinction between a header tag defined as so and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.020
the h1, h2 all the way to h6 tags.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.730
You may see and hear people talk about both, so

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.730
be sure that when someone is talking about a header tag, or an h1,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.320
h2, and so forth you know exactly which one they're referring to.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.140
To change the intertextual content of this h1 tag again,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.160
going to find my selection, store it in a variable, and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.760
try to auto complete any method defined in my selection.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.900
As you can see here,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.470
I'm going to scroll down and hopefully find something that I may think can help.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.150
As you can see here, there is an HTML, which might work.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.060
There's a property method.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.010
Which is also a possibility.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.880
And at the bottom here we have text.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.090
Let's see what text actually does.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.160
Again, if we run this or execute this statement here without parenthesis,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.890
we can see the inner definition of the function.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.110
As you can see here, this is actually somewhat complicated as d3

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.720
tries to be as general and applicable to any sort of value passed in.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.690
As you can see here, on my title selection, calling text with

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.820
Jonathan's Pretty Pictures, changes the title to Jonathan's Pretty Pictures.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.350
And if I open up what's returned from the .text method, I can see the DOM

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.770
node I called it on and hovering hovers over the correct title in the window.
