00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:15.642
Today, we are a country divided,

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.558
or at least that's what we're told.

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:23.193
We are torn apart
by immigration, education, guns

00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:24.574
and health care.

00:00:25.038 --> 00:00:27.863
Health care is ugly and it is loud,

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:32.583
so loud that it threatens
to drown out everything else.

00:00:32.607 --> 00:00:36.187
(Voice-over) Protesters: Health care
is a human right! Fight, fight, fight!

00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.913
Protesters: Hey hey! Ho ho!
Obamacare has got to go!

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:43.457
Rebecca Onie: But what if
underneath all the noise,

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.195
we're not divided?

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.876
What if the things that we don't ask about

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.248
are the things that we most agree upon?

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:53.485
It turns out that when we ask
the right questions,

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:55.978
the answers are startling,

00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:01.973
because we agree, not on health care,
but on something more important:

00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:03.720
we agree on health.

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:08.271
For 20 years, I've been obsessed
with one question:

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:12.410
What do we, what do all of us need
in order to be healthy?

00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:15.093
As a college student in 1995,

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:19.858
I spent months talking to physicians
at a chaotic hospital in Boston,

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:24.898
asking them, "What's the one thing
your patients most need to be healthy?"

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.222
They shared the same story
again and again,

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:31.547
one that I've heard hundreds
of variations of since.

00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:35.456
They say, "Every day I see a patient
with an asthma exacerbation,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.076
and I prescribe a controller medication.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.262
But I know she is living
in a mold-infested apartment.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.156
Or I see a kid with an ear infection,
and I prescribe antibiotics,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.218
but I know there is no food at home.

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:52.556
And I don't ask about those issues,
because there's nothing I can do."

00:01:53.586 --> 00:01:56.015
Now, it seemed that it shouldn't
be so complicated

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.401
to design a doctor's visit around
what people actually need to be healthy.

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:02.271
So I created Health Leads,

00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:07.080
an organization enabling thousands
of physicians and other caregivers

00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:08.866
to ask their patients,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.814
"What do you need to be healthy?"

00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:13.306
and then prescribe those things --

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.546
fruits and vegetables, heat in the winter,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.835
electricity to refrigerate
their medication --

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.218
and we then navigated
patients to those resources

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:24.777
in their communities.

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:26.740
The model works.

00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:31.549
A Mass General Hospital study found that
navigating patients to essential resources

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:36.000
is associated with improvements
in blood pressure and cholesterol levels

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:38.857
similar to introducing a new drug,

00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.745
but without all the side effects.

00:02:41.817 --> 00:02:45.060
So two decades later, what's changed?

00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:49.069
It's now widely recognized
that just 20 percent of health outcomes

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:51.093
are tied to medical care,

00:02:51.117 --> 00:02:56.177
whereas up to 70 percent
are tied to healthy behaviors

00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:59.676
and what's called the social
determinants of health --

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.815
basically, everything that happens to us
for that vast majority of time

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.842
when we're not in the doctor's office

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:07.406
or the hospital.

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.915
Health care executives
now routinely remind us

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.417
that our zip code matters more
than our genetic code.

00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:18.220
And one health care publication
even recently had the audacity

00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:20.423
to describe the social
determinants of health

00:03:20.447 --> 00:03:23.001
as "the feel-good buzzword of the year."

00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:25.476
Now, there's been some action, too.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.379
Over the past decade, six major
health care providers and insurers

00:03:29.403 --> 00:03:32.029
have committed over 600 million dollars

00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:33.754
to affordable housing,

00:03:33.778 --> 00:03:37.753
recognizing that it reduces
infant mortality

00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:40.149
and increases life expectancy.

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.762
But let's be honest.

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:47.272
Is our 3.5 trillion dollar
health care system

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:49.650
fundamentally designed to create health?

00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:51.825
Absolutely not.

00:03:52.468 --> 00:03:54.436
Take access to healthy food.

00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:59.116
Not long ago, a teenage boy shows up
at a hospital in Baltimore,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.659
losing weight.

00:04:00.683 --> 00:04:04.615
Just as his doctors are huddled up
figuring out which metabolic panels

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.721
and blood tests to run,

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:09.084
one of my colleagues asks out loud,

00:04:09.108 --> 00:04:11.191
"Do you think he might be hungry?"

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:15.233
It turned out that this kid
had been kicked out of his housing

00:04:15.257 --> 00:04:17.844
and literally hadn't had a meal in weeks.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.012
He said he was "... so relieved
that somebody finally asked me."

00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:26.742
Somehow, we've created
a health care system

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.642
where asking a patient "Are you hungry?"

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:33.637
is so far outside the bounds
of what counts as health care

00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:37.019
that we mostly fail or forget
to ask altogether;

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:42.566
where doctors lament a hospital's
"no third sandwich policy,"

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.460
meaning that if you're
a hungry patient in the ER,

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:48.295
you can have only two free sandwiches,

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.036
but as many MRIs as the doctor orders;

00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:55.299
where, in 2016 in the state of Texas,

00:04:55.323 --> 00:05:00.782
they spent 1.2 billion dollars
on the medical costs of malnutrition

00:05:00.806 --> 00:05:03.361
instead of on access to healthy food;

00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:07.100
where a Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services program

00:05:07.124 --> 00:05:09.547
stratifies hungry patients,

00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:14.796
so that some get access to food
and some get information about food,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.952
with the justification that
doing nothing for hungry patients

00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:20.865
is standard and usual care
in this country.

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:22.876
And that's just food.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.619
The same is true
for housing, electricity ...

00:05:25.643 --> 00:05:29.090
The bottom line is,
health care may be changing,

00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:32.295
but not by enough
and certainly not fast enough.

00:05:33.418 --> 00:05:37.359
We ask the wrong questions
of our doctors, of our patients,

00:05:37.383 --> 00:05:39.407
but also of our citizens.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:43.293
We ask about and argue about health care,

00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:45.252
but how do voters think about health?

00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:49.127
No one could tell us
the answer to that question,

00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:51.098
so we launched a new initiative

00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:54.493
and hired a polling firm
to ask voters across the country:

00:05:54.517 --> 00:05:56.408
What do you need to be healthy?

00:05:58.893 --> 00:06:04.183
What was so striking about this
was that no one has any clue

00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:06.659
what we are talking about in health care.

00:06:07.135 --> 00:06:10.071
Voters do not think
the social determinants of health

00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:11.708
is a feel-good phrase.

00:06:12.097 --> 00:06:13.720
They actually hate it.

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:17.169
"What uneducated person
came up with that language?"

00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:19.068
one of the voters said.

00:06:19.092 --> 00:06:21.131
Or my favorite was the guy who said,

00:06:21.155 --> 00:06:22.572
"You're killing me."

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.439
But when you strip away
all the ridiculousness

00:06:26.463 --> 00:06:28.341
of our language in health care,

00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:30.612
we know exactly what creates health.

00:06:31.165 --> 00:06:33.469
So take Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:34.980
We had two focus groups,

00:06:35.004 --> 00:06:39.205
one of African American Democratic women
and one of white Republican women.

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.050
And we asked them,
"If you had a hundred dollars,

00:06:42.074 --> 00:06:45.189
how would you spend it
to buy health in your community?

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:49.842
Turns out, they agree
nearly to the last percentage point.

00:06:50.537 --> 00:06:54.617
First, they agree that health care
only sort of impacts health.

00:06:54.641 --> 00:06:57.186
So they choose to spend
the majority of their dollars

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.033
outside of hospitals and clinics.

00:06:59.632 --> 00:07:02.768
And second, they agree
on what creates health,

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:05.017
spending 19 percent on affordable housing

00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:07.938
and about 25 percent
on access to healthy food.

00:07:08.868 --> 00:07:12.364
So I am sure you are thinking,
"This has got to be a fluke."

00:07:12.388 --> 00:07:13.579
But it's not.

00:07:14.112 --> 00:07:17.543
White and Latino male
swing voters in Seattle,

00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:21.458
white and African American
Democratic voters in Cleveland,

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:24.111
white male Republicans in Dallas,

00:07:24.135 --> 00:07:28.570
low-income white Democrats
in Hendersonville, North Carolina:

00:07:28.594 --> 00:07:30.837
their answers are strikingly similar,

00:07:31.498 --> 00:07:33.795
with all of them choosing
to spend more money

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:36.395
on healthy food and safe housing

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:39.244
than they would on hospitals
and health centers.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.678
When you ask the right questions,

00:07:42.702 --> 00:07:44.443
it becomes pretty clear:

00:07:44.974 --> 00:07:48.457
we may be fractured
on health care in this country,

00:07:48.481 --> 00:07:50.641
but we are unified on health.

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.999
The thing that I've been
struggling with is why.

00:07:55.023 --> 00:07:56.872
Why do we agree on health?

00:07:57.712 --> 00:08:00.869
We agree on health
because it is common sense.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.502
We all know that the things
we need to get healthy --

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.760
medicine and medical care --

00:08:06.784 --> 00:08:09.378
are not the things we need to be healthy,

00:08:09.402 --> 00:08:11.479
to not get sick in the first place.

00:08:12.255 --> 00:08:15.391
But we also agree because
of common experience.

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:18.604
In a study of 5,000 patients,

00:08:18.628 --> 00:08:22.912
24 percent of the patients
with commercial health insurance --

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.746
meaning, they had a job --

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.487
still ran out of food or struggled
to find housing or transportation

00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:31.518
or other essential resources.

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:33.057
Twenty-four percent.

00:08:33.505 --> 00:08:35.849
And we saw the same thing
in our focus groups.

00:08:35.873 --> 00:08:39.621
Nearly every voter knew
what it meant to struggle,

00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:42.390
either themselves or their families

00:08:42.414 --> 00:08:43.692
or their neighbors.

00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:48.634
One of those white Republican
women in Charlotte was a waitress

00:08:49.443 --> 00:08:53.556
struggling to stay awake
with an enormous Big Gulp soda.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.563
She just looked exhausted.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.747
And she was.

00:08:57.771 --> 00:08:59.748
She told us that she worked two jobs

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:02.761
but still could not afford
a membership to the Y,

00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:05.874
but it was OK that she couldn't go
to the gym, she said,

00:09:05.898 --> 00:09:08.585
because she also could not afford gas

00:09:08.609 --> 00:09:11.340
and walked 10 miles to and from work

00:09:11.364 --> 00:09:12.864
every single day.

00:09:14.212 --> 00:09:18.305
Listening to her, I felt
this familiar panic rise in me,

00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:21.386
the residue of my own childhood.

00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.035
When I was 10 years old,

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:26.633
my father lay on the living room floor

00:09:26.657 --> 00:09:29.768
in the grips of one
of his many depressions.

00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:34.348
As I crouched next to him, he told me
that he wanted to kill himself.

00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:39.804
My father lived,

00:09:39.828 --> 00:09:41.378
but he struggled to work.

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:43.532
And my family survived,

00:09:43.556 --> 00:09:45.264
but we teetered,

00:09:45.288 --> 00:09:46.765
down one paycheck,

00:09:46.789 --> 00:09:49.747
relying on my mom's schoolteacher salary.

00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:53.792
Even as a little kid, I knew
we lived in the shadow

00:09:53.816 --> 00:09:56.426
of financial and emotional collapse.

00:09:57.482 --> 00:09:59.720
This is really hard to say,

00:09:59.744 --> 00:10:03.673
because it's taken me 25 years
to be honest with myself

00:10:03.697 --> 00:10:05.989
that this is why I do this work:

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.442
knowing that my father
needed health care to recover,

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:14.028
but to be healthy, my family
needed something else,

00:10:14.052 --> 00:10:16.382
we needed a decent income;

00:10:16.406 --> 00:10:19.643
and knowing, as so many do more than I,

00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:22.999
that panic when the basics
threaten to slip away.

00:10:24.378 --> 00:10:28.562
To the voters in our focus groups,
the solutions were straightforward.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:31.842
As one of those white Republican
women in Charlotte said,

00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:34.582
"Instead of putting all this money
into health care,

00:10:34.606 --> 00:10:36.434
put it into affordable housing.

00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:40.145
You know, like, take it
and distribute it differently."

00:10:41.201 --> 00:10:43.852
It turns out that when you have
the right language

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:46.268
and you ask the right questions,

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:48.905
the answers become remarkably clear

00:10:48.929 --> 00:10:50.174
and unanimous.

00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:58.235
What we know is that,
despite all the noise,

00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:01.407
the plan for health care in this country

00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:03.011
is that there is no plan.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.176
But we have something more powerful
than any politician's bill,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.963
any candidate's platform,

00:11:10.987 --> 00:11:13.646
any think tank's policy statement.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.198
We have our common sense
and our common experience.

00:11:18.057 --> 00:11:22.148
So I ask, if you are
a health care executive:

00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:24.876
Do you know how many
of your patients run out of food

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.806
or struggle to pay the rent
at the end of the month?

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.206
Is that data on your scorecard,

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.019
shaping your business and your bonuses?

00:11:33.796 --> 00:11:35.716
If you are a politician:

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.019
Will you continue to fight
on the scorched earth of health care,

00:11:40.043 --> 00:11:42.488
or will you act on what your voters,

00:11:42.512 --> 00:11:45.402
what Democratic
and Republican voters alike,

00:11:45.426 --> 00:11:46.817
already know,

00:11:46.841 --> 00:11:50.193
which is that good wages,
healthy food and safe housing

00:11:50.217 --> 00:11:51.382
are health?

00:11:51.997 --> 00:11:56.107
And for the rest of us,
for the citizens of this country:

00:11:56.131 --> 00:12:00.457
Will we demand accountability
to what we know to be true,

00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:02.667
which is that our common sense,

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:04.511
our common experience,

00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:07.926
makes us the experts
in what it takes to be healthy?

00:12:09.123 --> 00:12:11.755
This moment, as it turns out,

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:13.877
is not about changing minds.

00:12:14.632 --> 00:12:16.789
It is about something more powerful.

00:12:17.205 --> 00:12:19.779
It is about changing the questions we ask

00:12:19.803 --> 00:12:23.730
and quieting the noise
to hear each other's answers.

00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:28.577
It is about the radical possibility
that we the patients,

00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:31.058
we the physicians, we the caregivers,

00:12:31.082 --> 00:12:32.498
we the health care executives

00:12:32.522 --> 00:12:34.586
and yes, even we the people,

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.013
that we agree.

00:12:36.642 --> 00:12:38.532
And it is now time --

00:12:38.556 --> 00:12:40.507
in fact, long overdue --

00:12:40.531 --> 00:12:42.685
for us to marshal the courage

00:12:43.409 --> 00:12:46.640
to hear those answers
and to act upon them.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.240
Thank you.

00:12:48.264 --> 00:12:52.383
(Applause)
