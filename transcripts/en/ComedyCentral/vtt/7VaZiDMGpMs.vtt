<i> - I'm really excited to bring
 this guy up.</i>

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:22.915
I've been watching him seven,
eight, ten years, every night--

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:24.483
every Tuesday at The Comedy
Store.

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:26.152
And you guys are gonna love him.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.988
Please give it up for my friend
and yours, Scruncho, everybody.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.323
Let him hear it.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.364
- My beautiful sister was in a
domestic violence relationship.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.366
As I got older, I realized by
brother-in-law was beating

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.468
the fuck out of my beautiful
sister.

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.370
So like a man, I pulled him
aside,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.374
I look him in the eye, and I
tell him, you know, I say,

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.977
"Dre," I say, "Now, you know,
you puttin' your hands on my

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:53.512
sister, and she continue to go
back to you," right?

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.381
Now, ain't nothin' more
disrespectful than when you're

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:59.185
telling a grown man what you
feeling in your heart and soul,

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.687
and in the middle of your
heartfelt conversation,

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:04.858
that other grown man gonna look
at you and "pssh" you.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.493
That's what I said.
I said did this bitch nigga

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.227
just "pssh" me?

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:11.998
Now, sometimes, ladies, you've
got to give a man exactly

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.899
what he been dishing out in
order for him to have

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.068
understanding of the fuck what
he been doing to you.

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:18.537
But here's the thing.
Whenever a man

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.873
go to discipline another grown
man,

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:23.142
the fight is no longer physical.

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:24.977
The fight is spiritual.

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:27.213
And my mother taught me when I
was 12, she was like,

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:30.549
"If you defended the honor of
your sisters,

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.921
"God would put a covenant over
you.

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:37.590
"The angels would covenant you.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.891
"Angels will protect you.

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.693
"The heavens will protect you.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.196
"And God will not allow you to
lose that battle, because it's

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.532
a spiritual, biblical battle, so
you cannot and will not lose."

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:49.702
So at that point, ladies and
gentlemen, I hung on my spirit,

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.205
'cause I knew there was gonna be
a day in time when I must give

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:55.741
Dre this biblical, spiritual
ass-whuppin' his body

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.776
so desperately desired.

00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:00.779
Two weeks later, the shit hit
the fan.

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.282
That same sister was having a
taco party.

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.017
And just for the record,

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:08.954
real niggas eat more tacos than
Mexicans.

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.123
And if y'all don't remember
nothing about my whole show,

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:14.860
remember this: don't y'all trust
no man

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.430
that eat less than three tacos.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.731
[laughter]

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.867
The fuck you nibblin' for?

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.801
Now, I'm sitting in the middle
of the living room

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:25.637
eating my six tacos, and I swear
to God,

00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:29.041
what I seen in the kitchen, it
breaks my heart to this day.

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:32.811
I see my beautiful sister that
raised me, walked me to school,

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:35.781
taught me my ABCs, my beautiful
sister.

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:38.117
My brother-in-law got my
beautiful sister in the corner

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.119
like she's some type of fuckin'
roach

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:44.056
stompin' my sister in the chest
as if she didn't come from the

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:45.792
womb of my beautiful mother,

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.227
socking my beautiful sister in
the eye as if she

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.229
didn't have brothers to defend
her honor.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.664
Immediately, ladies and
gentlemen,

00:03:52.664 --> 00:03:56.101
I disconnected from my physical
world.

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:57.803
I went into a spiritual world.

00:03:57.803 --> 00:03:59.739
And it was just like my mother
said.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.440
The heavens opened up.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.176
I seen my mother's face appear
with a halo over her head.

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:05.912
And I heard that biblical music
go...

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.480
♪ Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.982
And then the angels came around.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:11.416
And at that point, ladies and
gentlemen,

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:13.419
I feel the spirit of God come
through me,

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.022
and I did not run over there to
protect my beautiful sister.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.789
I did not walk aggressively over
there to protect

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.692
my beautiful sister.
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.527
I floated over there.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:26.265
I floated, and I rosed up on
that motherfuckin' Dre,

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:28.000
and guess what, ladies and
gentlemen.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.169
I was the big man.
He was the little man.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.004
And let me tell every woman in
here something.

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:35.541
I was to have revenge for every
woman that ever had her

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.377
hands
laid on by a man, for my mother,

00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:41.314
my sister, Tina Turner...

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.515
[laughter]

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:45.284
Rihanna.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:48.988
And as I rose up over him, the
spirit of Floyd Mayweather

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:50.889
shot through my body.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.027
My hands swoll up as if I was 50
and 0.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:57.029
It was the size of a Floyd
Mayweather boxing glove.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.031
With all the strength God gave
me,

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:03.970
right before I went to hit him
with these undefeated hands,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.806
Dre hit me so many times,

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:09.875
I thought I was getting jumped.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.344
At this point, I realized
something.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:15.080
This motherfucker Dre was gifted
from the shoulders.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.052
Ladies and gentlemen, his hand
speed was incredible.

00:05:20.052 --> 00:05:22.055
At that point, I realized
something.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.490
I've got to go get my best
friend.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.024
And I don't know--let me tell
you, there's some rules

00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:27.592
when you go get your best friend
in the hood.

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:30.896
Number one rule: ain't no rules.

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:33.065
I go get my best friend.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:36.235
We get to the point of location,
and I tell my best friend,

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.905
I say--I look him in the eye,
and he a gangster motherfucker.

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:42.774
I said, "Dulo--I said, "Nigga,
you ready to die?"

00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:44.343
He had me fooled like a
motherfucker.

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:47.213
He started Crip walking.
He said, "I don't give a fuck."

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:48.580
[laughter]

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.249
So we get to my sister's house.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.750
He got the 9-millimeter.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.252
I got the motherfucking handgun.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.953
And right before we knocked at
the door,

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:58.857
I looked him in my one good eye,

00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:01.093
and I no longer was on that
spiritual shit.

00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:03.629
Me and the devil was in cahoots.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.531
I looked at him with a wicked--I
said, "Motherfucker,

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.867
is you ready to die?"
He said, "I don't give a fuck."

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.201
So we knock at the door.

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.869
Now my sister come to the door.

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:12.104
She come to me and said, "What's
happening?"

00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:13.306
I said, "Whoopty-whoopty-whoo."

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:14.539
She said,
"Whoopty-whoopty-whoo."

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.443
I said, "Whoopty-whoopty-whoo."

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.913
"Whoopty-whoopty-whoo" means "et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera."

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:24.283
[laughter]

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:26.285
Now, at that point, she come and
open the door.

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.488
Now, the person y'all see now
did not exist.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:31.290
I'm telling y'all, I had a
spirit on me that was so

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.792
motherfucking wicked, when I
walked in there, I swear to God,

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:35.394
let me tell you how sick I was.

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:38.798
I was gonna shoot pictures,
wedding pictures, images,

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.299
ideals,
I didn't give a fuck.

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:42.501
Look, I got a little nephew
named little Dre

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.069
who looked just like big Dre.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:46.472
Little Dre is bad a
motherfucker.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.941
I would have shot him twice.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.009
I take four, five steps in the
house,

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.512
my sister jump her fat ass on my
back,

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:54.980
wrap her thigh around my waist,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.482
and tried to weigh a real nigga
down.

00:06:57.482 --> 00:06:59.685
Now, due to the obesity of her
weight,

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:02.021
a real nigga was going down.

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:03.656
But my trigger hand was free.
Who do I see?

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.991
I see motherfucking Dre, Dre see
me, and he grabbed my arm.

00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:08.194
Now, my sister, we begin to
struggle for the gun.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.162
Now, this bitch nigga Dre do
something

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:12.431
I think was kind of clever.

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:15.968
He come from the blind side of
my bad eye.

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:17.636
I thought he had some type of
magical skills.

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:18.971
He jumped on me like, "Ya!"

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.706
Trying to scared me,
and he did.

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:22.274
I was like, "Oh, shit."

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:24.977
Now, at that point, the gun
dislodges from my hand.

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:26.945
Dre picks up the handle of the
gun,

00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:31.350
begins to whup my ass for the
second time.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.187
Now, as Dre is whipping my ass
at a a rhythm pace,

00:07:35.187 --> 00:07:37.790
I couldn't help but to think,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.693
"Where is my best friend?"

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:42.161
[laughter]

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:44.797
Now, as I looked in the position
that I was in in my

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:48.000
fetal position, I looked toward
the window that I entered.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.869
To the left of the door was a
window.

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:54.840
On the outside of the window,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.077
there was my best friend
looking in at me

00:07:58.077 --> 00:07:59.745
as I'm get my ass really
whupped.

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:02.881
And I said, "I thought you said
you was ready to die."

00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:06.252
He looked at me, he said,
"Not like that."

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:07.520
[laughter]

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.156
And at this point, Dre's punches
was phenomenal.

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:13.059
I was two punches from death.

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:14.593
I had no choice.

00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:16.562
I had to give my best friend
encouragement.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:19.331
So I yelled back.
I said, "But, Dulo,

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.734
you got a gun, best friend."

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:24.036
And he yelled back,

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:27.406
"But you had one too."

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:31.077
And at this point, blood is
coming out my pores.

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:33.512
He had a wicked left hook.

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:35.748
He hit me in this ear and
knocked my hearing

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.249
completely out.

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:41.420
I seen Dulo running, and to make
a long story short,

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:47.193
the police came, and guess who
went to jail.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.027
Me.

00:08:49.027 --> 00:08:52.264
But I got good news, and I got
bad news.

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:54.766
The good news is, my sister was
fuckin' in court

00:08:54.766 --> 00:08:56.602
to fuckin' bail me out of jail.

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:57.970
How about that?

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.574
The bad news is, she brought Dre
with her.

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:02.708
[laughter]

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.609
And to make bad news worse,

00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:07.413
the judge put a restraining
order on me to stay away from

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.815
Dre and Dre to stay away from
me,

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:12.451
which was a blessing to me.

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:15.387
And my sister hit me with the
information

00:09:15.387 --> 00:09:17.389
that I would never, ever forget.

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:19.124
And these words make me--I would
never, ever

00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:21.260
defend my sister again.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.296
I looked at her with all the
compassion in my eyes,

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:27.466
and I said, "What the fuck is
wrong with you?

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:30.836
Don't you know blood is thicker
than water?"

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:34.639
And what she replied fucked me
up.

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:37.576
And she said, "Don't you know
come is thicker than blood?"

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:39.678
[laughter]
