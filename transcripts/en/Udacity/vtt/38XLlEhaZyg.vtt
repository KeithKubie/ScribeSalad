00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.375
&gt;&gt; Basically, all we have to do is once we have the map object, we go through

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:07.262
and cache width, height, tile width, tile height. And then, we actually compute

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:10.682
the pixel size of x and y by multiplying the number of tiles times the tile

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:14.331
size. Once this is done, we can actually set fully loaded to true allowing any

00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:16.486
external processing to work on this object.
