about time as much as space so I think

about time as much as space so I think
 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.600
about time as much as space so I think

if you think about what's probably the
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.790
if you think about what's probably the
first field of modern science let's say

modern science and why I think the

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980
modern science and why I think the
 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.940
modern science and why I think the
reason is is because the universe is a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
reason is is because the universe is a
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.090
reason is is because the universe is a

many ways is an illusion because color

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
many ways is an illusion because color

that we're seeing anyways so it's

that we're seeing anyways so it's
 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.400

reasonable to ask well maybe our sense

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410
reasonable to ask well maybe our sense

reasonable to ask well maybe our sense
of time our sense of flow of time is an

of time our sense of flow of time is an
 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.180
of time our sense of flow of time is an
illusion but I think there's an

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190
illusion but I think there's an
 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.940

important difference between those two

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950
important difference between those two
 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.860
important difference between those two
subjective experiences so our sense of

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
subjective experiences so our sense of
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.670
subjective experiences so our sense of
color correlates very tightly with

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680
color correlates very tightly with
 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.770
color correlates very tightly with
something in the external world with a

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
something in the external world with a

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720
physical property which is visible light
 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.170
physical property which is visible light
and that's why it's adaptive so color

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
and that's why it's adaptive so color
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.080
and that's why it's adaptive so color
evolved our perception of color evolved

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090
evolved our perception of color evolved
 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.199
evolved our perception of color evolved
because it was adaptive it was a

evolutionarily adaptive to provide some
 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.190
evolutionarily adaptive to provide some
information about the external world the

in the deepest sense meaning that it
