people in other countries face the way
for example North Koreans have hacked

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
for example North Koreans have hacked
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.420
for example North Koreans have hacked
South Korea and South Korean financial

whole notion of cyber conflict either as
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.230
whole notion of cyber conflict either as
a low level or high-level conflict has

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
a low level or high-level conflict has
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.510
a low level or high-level conflict has
become more and more important than more

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
become more and more important than more
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.970
become more and more important than more
and more top of mind and I think the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980
and more top of mind and I think the
 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.190
and more top of mind and I think the
most important takeaway is twofold one

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
most important takeaway is twofold one
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.860
most important takeaway is twofold one
is that quote unquote ordinary citizens

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
is that quote unquote ordinary citizens
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.709
is that quote unquote ordinary citizens
should be concerned about whether their

this in my view this is as true outside
 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.729
this in my view this is as true outside
of the borders of the United States as

of the borders of the United States as
 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.650
