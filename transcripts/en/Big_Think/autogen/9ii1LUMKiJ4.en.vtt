00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 align:start position:0%

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
mainstream behaviors and you'll be
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
mainstream behaviors and you'll be
included<00:00:38.550><c> and</c><00:00:38.760><c> so</c><00:00:38.940><c> it</c><00:00:39.090><c> puts</c><00:00:39.300><c> people</c><00:00:39.629><c> to</c><00:00:39.870><c> this</c>

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 align:start position:0%
included and so it puts people to this
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 align:start position:0%
included and so it puts people to this
tragic<00:00:40.620><c> choice</c><00:00:40.860><c> between</c><00:00:41.250><c> their</c><00:00:41.700><c> identity</c><00:00:42.239><c> and</c>

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 align:start position:0%
inclusion and that's where I think that
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.970 align:start position:0%
inclusion and that's where I think that
companies<00:00:45.120><c> have</c><00:00:45.480><c> missed</c><00:00:46.200><c> the</c><00:00:46.320><c> mark</c><00:00:46.559><c> or</c><00:00:46.800><c> need</c>
