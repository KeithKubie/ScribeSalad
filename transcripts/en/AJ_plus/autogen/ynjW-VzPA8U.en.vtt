00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.200
Portland, Oregon has a reputation.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.580
This is a city that's
seen as very liberal.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.440
So liberal,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.340
the sketch comedy show,

00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:18.230
"Portlandia" has pumped out eight seasons
of material based solely on mocking

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.080
its progressiveness.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.240
But there's another side to Portland,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.480
one that upends its perception
as some sort of liberal paradise.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.340
In the 1990s, this area was known as
"Skin Head City" and it was a part of a

00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:35.060
region from where neo-Nazis used to
recruit for their so-called "Northwest

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.900
Imperative."

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.770
Imaeyen Ibanga: You said you almost stabbed
a Black guy out here once.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.503
Why?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.950
Jason Downard: "Cause he was hitting on my girlfriend
at the time and it pissed me off and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.980
so then I pulled my knife out,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.240
and I was getting ready to stab him until
I looked up and there was a Portland

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.570
PD about 10 feet away."

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.770
The ubiquity of the internet and social
media in the United States has only made

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.200
the far-right recruitment process easier.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.400
Downard: "Social media is big on the,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.060
the recruitment nowadays, especially on Youtube."

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.140
But what is it about the far-right violence movement that lures people into it?

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.760
Shannon Foley Martinez: "I liked
being afraid of me.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.780
You know,it's very seductive when you feel
powerless to even the illusion of power."

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.340
David Newiert: "Right-wing extremism really is a
direct challenge to liberal democracy."

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.410
Hey fam.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.160
I'm Imaeyen, and for the third and final
part of our series on far-right extreme violence,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.140
we've traveled to one of the most
progressive cities in the nation,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.850
which also happens to be one of the whitest.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.330
And we're here to uncover why, even
when Donald Trump leaves office,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.390
the problem of far-right violence
won't end with his tenure,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.200
and how difficult it is to
escape a life built on hate.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:18.620
There are nearly 650,000 residents in
Portland and more than 77 percent of them are white.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.460
That makes this place the
whitest major city in the U.S.,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.180
and perhaps the perfect breeding ground
for people looking to enlist new white

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.910
people in the far-right
extremist movement.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.710

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.540
Downard: "We come down here and

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.700
look for young kids and vulnerable kids,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.820
teenagers running around and
that are white, obviously,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.390
and try to introduce them
to the neo-Nazi movement.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.660
A lot of times we give
them like literature,

00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:50.830
white power music."

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.750
Jason Downard knows a lot about trying
to woo white people to the extreme far

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.780
-right because he did it for years,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.920
and he says Oregon's history made his
job of selling white supremacy much easier.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.720
Ibanga:  How does such a liberal city have such
an active white supremacist movement?

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.370
Downard: "That's a good question.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.250
It's formed ...

00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:16.450
in Oregon,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.440
I think the biggest thing is Oregon
was founded a white state and back then

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.640
Blacks were banned from Oregon."

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.603
He's right.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.210
Oregon was established
as a white racist utopia.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.910
A former slave owner helped pass a law
in 1844 expelling Black people from the

00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:37.824
territory.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.280
This is 15 years before Oregon gained
statehood. And when it finally does become a state,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.880
it puts that exclusion of Black and
non-white people into its Constitution.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.830
And this made

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.780
Oregon an incredibly fertile
place for the Ku Klux Klan.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.650
In the 1920s,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.400
it had the largest Klan membership
per capita among any state.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.833
So yes,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.940
Oregon has given all of its electoral
votes to the last eight democratic

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.150
presidential candidates.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.040
But it's also a place with a
long history of anti-Blackness,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.240
which neo-Nazis have used as part
of their recruitment process.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.120
Ibanga: So we're down here on the Portland waterfront, and used to recruit people for the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.760
neo-Nazi movement here.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.160
How did you do that?

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.640
Downard: "We come down here and
look for young kids,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.980
vulnerable kids are ...

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.820
we recruit them and see
if it's even worth a shot."

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.020
Downard is a former neo-Nazi who first
got involved with the movement during his

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.680
2009 prison sentence for a drive-by
shooting involving the unlawful use of firearms.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.400
His body became a place
to enshrine extremism,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.620
a way to literally display his hatred.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.050
Ibanga: Do you have any tattoos
from your former life?

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.780
Downard: "No.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.880
They're all covered up.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.110
But you know you can still see
the 'WP' for the white power underneath."

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.200
Ibanga: Oh my God, yeah.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.720
Downard: "These little black lines right here

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.680
is this the 14 ..."

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.000
Ibanga: the 1488.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.101
Of all the things Downard

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.120
and I discussed, what resonated with
me most was just how covert far-right

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.120
extremist tactics are.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.010
And it's by design.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.090
Martinez: "There was a conscious shift away from
sort of this like street thug life

00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:31.650
gang-like culture.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.680
Dress nicer.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.960
Get your education and then
infiltrate jobs like law enforcement,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.080
military government policy,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.160
places where you could begin
to enact some real change."

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.930
Former neo-Nazi Shannon Foley Martinez
says she wasn't recruited into violent

00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:55.500
hate-fueled life by members
who infiltrated her community.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.680
Instead,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.100
it was her insecurity as a
self-proclaimed out-of-place,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.100
teenager in search of an identity that
started her on the path to extremism.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.900
Martinez: "Interestingly, like I started off with like hippie sixties,

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.810
anti-Vietnam culture.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.260
One of my very first favorite books was
actually "The Autobiography of Malcolm X.'"

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.971
Martinez says she was
a person already susceptible
to influence, and then a

00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:29.280
horrendous violation pushed
her toward a life of hate.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.080
Martinez: "And I ended up being raped
by two men at that party.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.910
They were white men.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.960
Within about six months of
being sexually assaulted,

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.460
I started hanging out with skinheads
who were always on the periphery of the

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.950
punk culture that I was a part of."

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.760
Between the ages of 15 and 20,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.120
Martinez was a neo-Nazi and hoped it'd
be a place she'd finally be able to belong.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.421
She thought being with the neo-Nazis
could allow her to release the anger about

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.440
her sexual assault.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.200
Martinez: "You know,my self-image and my self-worth just plummeted.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.560
In the wake of that rape, that I
just felt like a piece of trash.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.840
I felt worthless on a really
deep and inherent level.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.120
And you know,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.560
there's that part of me that was like, okay,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.871
well like who is
worse than the Nazis?

00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:25.520
Like they've gotta take me in, right?

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.460
Like it doesn't matter that I'm, that I'm worthless."

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.200
The community Martinez searched
for and talks about is also

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.310
a theme Downard echoed.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.440
It's the sales pitch the hate
group makes to potential members.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.960
It's all about this warped sense of unity.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.360
For Downard,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.300
the support was a group to belong to in
a radically racialized prison system.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.180
His story is a tale of recidivism and
getting deeply involved with the neo-Nazi

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.120
movement with each subsequent conviction.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.960
Ibanga: Have there been violent crimes of which
you haven't been associated with or

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.360
convicted with when you
were part of the movement"?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.640
Downard: "That's a trick question."

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.680
Ibanga: No, no.
It's not a trick question.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.800
Downard: "Well, if I committed?"

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.880
Ibanga: Yeah.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.740
Downard: "I don't talk about those things. I mean, I've,

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.580
I've done,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.320
I've done horrible things that
like I got to live with every day.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.460
You know,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.330
almost stabbed some people -

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.390
might've stabbed -

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.010
I won't go into those details.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.893
You know what I mean?

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.460
Just because it's a,

00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:33.461
it's a hard thing to live with." Downard's
and Martinez's neo-Nazi paths are one

00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:35.210
type of far-right extremism,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.910
which generally falls into two categories.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.400
Political and antigovernment like
the alleged MAGA bomber Cesar Seyac,

00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:47.900
a Republican and huge Trump supporter
accused of targeting the president's

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.680
political enemies with mail bombs.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.040
And then there are those on the
far right who are hate based.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.320
Like the Neo Nazis with whom
Downard and Martinez were once

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.240
affiliated.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.640
And though Downard says President
Trump's rhetoric has played a role in

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.120
reinvigorating far-right groups,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.440
Downard: "Donald Trump's

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.280
presidency has been a
victory for the movement.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.280
He's saying all the right stuff.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.680
So you get these neo-Nazis,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.100
like,

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.460
'We've got this president who's pretty
much giving us the okay to do whatever the

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.460
hell we want.'"

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.000
Author David Neiwert says even when
Donald Trump leaves the Oval Office,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.980
this type of violent extremism will still

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.880
be a problem.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.000
Neiwert: "This problem didn't
start with Donald Trump.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.500
When he leaves office,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.940
we're going to have
another generation before

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:44.340
we can really sort of corral these
forces of hatred that he's unleashed.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.610
What's happened is that the whole new
generation of young people who have been

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.640
radicalized into this belief system.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.560
Neiwert says

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.200
President Trump's favorite cable news
channel contributes to gassing up far

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.300
-right extremism.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.520
Tucker Carlson: "We believe in free speech,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.660
even when it's reprehensible,

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.200
maybe especially when it is."

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.200
Neiwert: "You'll see Tucker Carlson talking about
white nationalism or espousing white

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.301
nationalist views on national TV,

00:10:13.301 --> 00:10:15.340
on Fox and getting away with it.

00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:20.060
And people just kind of go and shrugging
your shoulders." Neiwert has followed

00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:21.130
the far right for 30 years,

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:25.360
first as a journalist
and later as an author.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.920
He says there's a reason far-right extremism movements are often unsuccessful.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:36.120
Typically right-wing extremists never get
enough momentum going because they've

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.640
never been able to stay cohesive for
very long because of their very nature.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.000
So, a lot of the people drawn to right-wing
extremists are really kind of

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.351
contentious and unpleasant people,

00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:48.870
they hardly ever get along.

00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:49.371
They're constantly fighting."

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.480
Ibanga: "What do neo-Nazis

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.510
think of Klansmen and people like that?

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.050

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.081
Downard: "The neo-Nazis don't like the Klansmen." Ibanga: Why not?

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.940
Downard: "They're a bunch of drunk hillbillies like to me and they're all,

00:11:03.941 --> 00:11:05.380
they're just weird.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.270
I don't know.

00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:10.440
I've never liked them from the get-go."

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.000
The birth of Downard's

00:11:13.001 --> 00:11:18.001
biracial nephew is one thing that helped
spur him to reject his neo-Nazi beliefs.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.170
The other was a recovery facility
he entered after another jail stint.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.680
Ibanga: So these are the doors you
went into that changed

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.080
your life.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.720
Downard: "I was facing another a year in jail,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.650
I was already in jail
and was facing two years.

00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:35.540
And so it's kind of like getaway.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.070
I had the chance to go to treatment."

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.580
But leaving a life you've
recruited people into is dangerous.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Downard: "It's really hard because you're dealing with a violent organization that's not

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.200
only in your city,

00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:55.540
but it's a worldwide,

00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:56.374
nationwide,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.350
they consider as race
traitors and stuff like that.

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.160
So ..."

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.900
Ibanga: Do you worry about that?

00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:02.800
Downard: "I did for a little bit,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.020
but I learned to get over it because
I feel like what I'm doing is now in

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.400
bringing peace to myself.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.631
But if I can tell my story,

00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:14.500
it can help somebody else that's maybe
struggling with like I was for a few

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.600
years if I wanted to leave the movement or not."

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.440
Downard now spends his time helping
others escape a life of hate that consumed

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.040
him until two years ago.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.840
He's hoping his transition from a self-proclaimed "hooligan" to "patience," like his

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.680
tattoo, will inspire others.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.151
Downard: "I know there's people that's in the movement that wants to get out of the movement

00:12:38.151 --> 00:12:40.550
but it's very violent thing to get out.

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:41.760
And some of them,

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:42.740
they don't know how to.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.550
What I'm doing is not only
bringing peace to myself,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.640
but if I can tell my story,

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.480
it can help somebody else that's maybe
struggling like I was for a few years."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.400
Like Downard,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.090
Martinez has dedicated her life to helping
others escape the neo-Nazi lifestyle.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.010
And her approach is informed by how
she felt when she left the movement.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.421
Martinez: I mean I was very,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.520
very lonely.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.821
You know,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.480
cause who do you go to?
Who do you say, 'You know,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.240
I'm really struggling because
I was a Nazi.' Like how do you,

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:17.700
how,

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.560
who do you say that to?

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.920
I remember exactly what I
felt like during that time.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.080
How alone I felt,

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.290
how confused I felt, how filled with
shame that I felt."

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.270
The mother of seven says

00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:36.390
even though she's been out of
the movement more than a decade,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.680
the work she does on herself is never ending.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.480
Ibanga: A lot of people are going to
see this video and wonder,

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:47.530
can you ever really be a
former white supremacist?

00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:50.230
Can you ever really be a former neo-Nazi?

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.080
Martinez: "Until I started sharing my story very

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.320
publicly,

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.320
I had no idea that so many people believed
that fundamental transformation is

00:14:00.321 --> 00:14:01.250
not possible.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:08.800
Now, I can categorically say I do
not believe that ideology at all.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.840
I see how flawed and broken and just how
harmful and have built a life on really

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.360
trying to, you know, make meaningful amends,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.640
do everything
that I can lending my voice to build a

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.760
genuinely, just and equitable society for us to,

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:34.860
to live in that my transformation
has indeed been an absolute one."

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.470
In the process of creating this series,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.640
I talked to people around the nation.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.200
One thing I heard from a couple of interviewees was a call for empathy for those

00:14:48.211 --> 00:14:50.010
participating in far-right hate.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.950
They say we shouldn't shut them out
because it could push them further into a

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.800
life of hate.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.720
Martinez: "Everyone is more than the worst
thing that they've ever done."

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.400
My question is and was,

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.360
what about their victims like the people
of color and bystanders that their hate

00:15:09.361 --> 00:15:10.194
targets?

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.240
Why should they bear the burden
of empathy or forgiveness?

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:22.280
Martinez: "I absolutely understand that calls
for any sort of empathetic listening or

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.880
compassion toward white
supremacists does not sit well

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.231
with segments of the population,

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.280
and I totally understand that.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.960
As a white person,

00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:40.881
it is my responsibility to dismantle
white supremacy. As a person of color,

00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:45.410
it is not your responsibility
to dismantle white supremacy."

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.461
Hey fam,

00:15:47.461 --> 00:15:48.510
thanks so much for watching.

00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:49.380

final part of our series.
