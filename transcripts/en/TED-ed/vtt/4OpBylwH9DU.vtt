00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.183
One of the great things about science

00:00:16.207 --> 00:00:18.745
is that when scientists make a discovery,

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.275
it's not always in a prescribed manner,

00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:24.419
as in, only in a laboratory
under strict settings,

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:25.864
with white lab coats

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:29.108
and all sorts of neat
science gizmos that go, "Beep!"

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:31.033
In reality,

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:32.486
the events and people involved

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.879
in some of the major
scientific discoveries

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:37.292
are as weird and varied as they get.

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:39.226
My case in point:

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.929
The Weird History of the Cell Theory.

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.762
There are three parts to the cell theory.

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:48.909
One: all organisms are composed
of one or more cells.

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.449
Two: the cell is the basic
unit of structure

00:00:51.473 --> 00:00:53.337
and organization in organisms.

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:57.484
And three: all cells come
from preexisting cells.

00:00:57.508 --> 00:01:01.548
To be honest, this all sounds
incredibly boring

00:01:01.572 --> 00:01:03.307
until you dig a little deeper

00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:05.976
into how the world
of microscopic organisms,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.014
and this theory came to be.

00:01:08.038 --> 00:01:11.049
It all started in the early 1600s
in the Netherlands,

00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:13.736
where a spectacle maker
named Zacharias Janssen

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.260
is said to have come up
with the first compound microscope,

00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:19.034
along with the first telescope.

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:20.871
Both claims are often disputed,

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:23.285
as apparently he wasn't the only bored guy

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:26.290
with a ton of glass lenses
to play with at the time.

00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:27.465
Despite this,

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:29.852
the microscope soon became a hot item

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:33.304
that every naturalist or scientist
at the time wanted to play with,

00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:36.195
making it much like the iPad of its day.

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.752
One such person

00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:41.280
was a fellow Dutchman by the name
of Anton van Leeuwenhoek,

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:43.566
who heard about
these microscope doohickeys,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.874
and instead of going out and buying one,

00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:47.729
he decided to make his own.

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:50.494
And it was a strange
little contraption indeed,

00:01:50.518 --> 00:01:54.485
as it looked more like a tiny paddle
the size of a sunglass lens.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.044
If he had stuck two together,

00:01:56.068 --> 00:01:58.847
it probably would have made
a wicked set of sunglasses

00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:01.844
that you couldn't see much out of.

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:04.756
Anyhoo, once Leeuwenhoek
had his microscope ready,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.935
he went to town,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.493
looking at anything and everything
he could with them,

00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:10.378
including the gunk on his teeth.

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:13.028
Yes, you heard right.

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:15.100
He actually discovered bacteria

00:02:15.124 --> 00:02:17.577
by looking at dental scrapings,

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:19.267
which, when you keep in mind

00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:23.644
that people didn't brush their teeth
much -- if at all -- back then,

00:02:23.668 --> 00:02:27.185
he must have had a lovely bunch
of bacteria to look at.

00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:29.285
When he wrote about his discovery,

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:32.061
he didn't call them bacteria,
as we know them today.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.246
But he called them "animalcules,"

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.857
because they looked
like little animals to him.

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:39.200
While Leeuwenhoek was staring
at his teeth gunk,

00:02:39.224 --> 00:02:42.320
he was also sending letters
to a scientific colleague in England,

00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:44.244
by the name of Robert Hooke.

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:48.774
Hooke was a guy who really loved
all aspects of science,

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:51.838
so he dabbled in a little bit
of everything, including physics,

00:02:51.862 --> 00:02:53.365
chemistry and biology.

00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:57.440
Thus it is Hooke who we can thank
for the term "the cell,"

00:02:57.464 --> 00:03:00.675
as he was looking at a piece of cork
under his microscope,

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.973
and the little chambers he saw
reminded him of cells,

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:08.682
or the rooms monks slept in
in their monasteries.

00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:10.698
Think college dorm rooms,

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:14.359
but without the TVs, computers
and really annoying roommates.

00:03:14.836 --> 00:03:17.349
Hooke was something
of an underappreciated scientist

00:03:17.373 --> 00:03:18.524
of his day --

00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:20.187
something he brought upon himself,

00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:22.085
as he made the mistake of locking horns

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.032
with one of the most famous
scientists ever, Sir Isaac Newton.

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:27.887
Remember when I said Hooke
dabbled in many different fields?

00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:30.293
Well, after Newton published
a groundbreaking book

00:03:30.317 --> 00:03:32.668
on how planets move due to gravity,

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:33.844
Hooke made the claim

00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:37.542
that Newton had been inspired
by Hooke's work in physics.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.275
Newton, to say the least,
did not like that,

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.634
which sparked a tense
relationship between the two

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.961
that lasted even after Hooke died,

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:49.978
as quite a bit of Hooke's research --
as well as his only portrait --

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:52.674
was ... misplaced, due to Newton.

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:56.027
Much of it was rediscovered,
thankfully, after Newton's time,

00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:57.313
but not his portrait,

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:00.123
as, sadly, no one knows
what Robert Hooke looked like.

00:04:00.776 --> 00:04:02.553
Fast-forward to the 1800s,

00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:05.088
where two German scientists
discovered something

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.776
that today we might find rather obvious,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.243
but helped tie together
what we now know as the cell theory.

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:13.819
The first scientist
was Matthias Schleiden,

00:04:13.843 --> 00:04:16.775
a botanist who liked to study
plants under a microscope.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.912
From his years of studying
different plant species,

00:04:19.936 --> 00:04:21.245
it finally dawned on him

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.740
that every single plant he had looked at

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.462
were all made of cells.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.051
At the same time,

00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:30.841
on the other end of Germany
was Theodor Schwann,

00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:33.835
a scientist who not only
studied slides of animal cells

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:35.077
under the microscope

00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:38.230
and got a special type
of nerve cell named after him,

00:04:38.254 --> 00:04:40.947
but also invented rebreathers
for firefighters,

00:04:40.971 --> 00:04:43.282
and had a kickin' pair of sideburns.

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:45.321
After studying animal cells for a while,

00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:47.232
he, too, came to the conclusion

00:04:47.256 --> 00:04:49.423
that all animals were made of cells.

00:04:49.447 --> 00:04:52.276
Immediately, he reached out
via snail mail,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.486
as Twitter had yet to be invented,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.655
to other scientists working
in the same field with Schleiden,

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:58.840
who got back to him,

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:01.928
and the two started working
on the beginnings of the cell theory.

00:05:01.952 --> 00:05:03.885
A bone of contention arose between them.

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.048
As for the last part of the cell theory --

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:08.680
that cells come from preexisting cells --

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:11.133
Schleiden didn't exactly
subscribe to that thought,

00:05:11.157 --> 00:05:14.726
as he swore cells came
from free-cell formation,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.611
where they just kind of spontaneously
crystallized into existence.

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.937
That's when another scientist
named Rudolph Virchow,

00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:25.570
stepped in with research showing
that cells did come from other cells,

00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:28.239
research that was actually --
hmm ... How to put it? --

00:05:28.263 --> 00:05:30.030
"borrowed without permission"

00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:33.131
from a Jewish scientist
by the name of Robert Remak,

00:05:33.155 --> 00:05:36.038
which led to two more feuding scientists.

00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:39.195
Thus, from teeth gunk
to torquing off Newton,

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:41.593
crystallization to Schwann cells,

00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:44.921
the cell theory came to be
an important part of biology today.

00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:49.515
Some things we know
about science today may seem boring,

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.198
but how we came to know them
is incredibly fascinating.

00:05:53.222 --> 00:05:54.976
So if something bores you,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.462
dig deeper.

00:05:56.486 --> 00:06:00.291
It's probably got a really weird
story behind it somewhere.
