TEJ CHAJED: I'm Tej, I'm a grad
student in computer science,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.056
and I worked with a team of
eight on a game called Snap.

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:16.610
All of us were course six
majors in computer science.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.100
We created a game called
Snap, which our client,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.910
who is from the Red Cross, he
presented us with this game

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.950
in class.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.520
The game works where
you both come up

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.370
with words, two players
come up with words,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.870
and whenever you
see the same word

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.000
you snap and you get a point.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630
So our task was to create a
digital version of this game,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.410
both to make the
game more engaging

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.015
and also to help them
collect data on what words

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:43.640
people were submitting, because
it's sort of a free association

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.840
game and helps them get a
sense of what people think

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.970
about a complex topic.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.040
So for Snap we actually
had a concrete game

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.750
that the client gave us
and we knew exactly what

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.567
project we'd be working on.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:59.150
Snap is also a little
bit different in

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.160
that it's a much more technical
game, because we're not

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.890
coming up with sprites, we're
not coming up with a story.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.600
It's quite bare bones
in terms of interface.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.420
And so we had a much more
standard coding project

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.890
for our game.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.120
But at the same time, there
were game design aspects

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.994
to what we had to do.

00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:22.090
We still had to think about
how to go beyond what we played

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.560
in class and port over the
game to a digital version that

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.850
will still be engaging
and didn't rely too much

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.800
on the human interaction,
the face to face interaction.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.170
So at first we actually
thought that our game

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.720
would be much more
restrictive, because we thought

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.780
that the clients had a lot
of existing ideas about how

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.640
the game should be played and
what works well for getting

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.259
good feedback out of people.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.050
As we went on, we were
pleasantly surprised

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.590
to find out that we actually
had a lot more creative freedom

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.427
than we thought.

00:01:50.427 --> 00:01:52.010
And really, they
just wanted something

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.380
that resembled the original game
and accomplish what we needed,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.400
which was to get
people to give words

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.410
and say what they were thinking.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.340
So that was really nice for
us to be able to really think

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.176
of what we wanted to.

00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:08.634
At the same time
though, the client

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:11.420
was interested in using the game
much earlier than we expected.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.040
The goal for all the
projects is that they

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.800
remain open and
available for people

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.870
to see over the next month.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.540
We've actually been running the
game in the past couple weeks.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.300
And that has also
required some effort

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.200
on our part to do exactly
what the client needs

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.190
for their specific
runs in the past week.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.120
So traditionally,
this course does not

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.880
allow people to use
networking, because it

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.010
tends to be very buggy.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.850
It tends to be something
that if it doesn't work,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.930
simply makes the whole
game fall over flat.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.880
And we decided to violate
this rule very early on.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.820
The rules are all
suggestions, after all.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.000
And we were confident in
our ability to do this,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.740
partly because we had
a lot of experience

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.320
with networking, with
distributed systems.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.860
I actually work in
distributed systems.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.070
And we also were experienced
with the technologies

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.060
that we were using,
which definitely helped.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.682
I think that the learning
curve for those technologies

00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:08.140
was a little bit
more than we could

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.431
have done in these eight weeks.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.050
So this course is nominally
about creating video games,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.190
but in reality, as the
instructors admitted,

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.870
it's about project management.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.240
And I think that the course does
a really good job of teaching

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.020
you project
management by example,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.887
by forcing you to
actually do it.

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:29.470
And I think that's
why it's structured

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.160
as four games as opposed
to one big game, which

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.750
is what you might expect.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.840
And I think that that
was really useful for us

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.460
to learn project management.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.397
Game development was
a nice side benefit,

00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:41.480
but I don't think we learned
a lot of game design.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.519
I think we just tried
it and mostly we

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.310
were learning, how do
you manage a project,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.260
how do you manage
a software project?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.680
Games are a little bit different
in that the goal is fun and not

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.080
so much coming from a client.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.270
The last project
notwithstanding, mostly games

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.590
are about you want to
create something fun.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.940
I think the biggest
challenge for us in Snap

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.790
was getting people engaged,
getting our team engaged

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.910
in the project.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.190
There's a lot of other
classes that people are taking

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.560
and this is not necessarily
the highest priority

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.850
on everybody's list.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.520
And that was something that
you really have to work around.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.079
You really have to find ways to
get people engaged in the topic

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.720
and get people to
contribute where

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.270
they can in the number of
hours that they have available.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.315
So I don't know how
completely successfully we

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:29.510
were at getting people to
contribute as many hours

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.890
as we needed, but
definitely part of it

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.200
was making sure the
tasks were very clear,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.150
so that not everybody was
thinking about the whole game,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.840
but instead could think
about their specific tasks

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.012
and what they need
to do on their part.

00:04:43.012 --> 00:04:45.220
And that was part of what
the project management was,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.570
was making sure that people
have the information they need

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.040
to do the tasks that they need
to get done without thinking

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.990
about the whole project.
