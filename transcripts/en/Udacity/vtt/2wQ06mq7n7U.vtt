00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.730
So here's my version of the filterPlayground method.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.350
You might have called your method something different,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.240
that's perfectly fine it doesn't matter what you

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.804
called it. So I return, list of type conference.

00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:14.000
And here I create the initial query where

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.290
I'm loading all the conferences sorted by name. And

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.950
then I add the filter. To filter on

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.370
city equals London. And I add the second filter,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.610
to filter on topics equals medical innovations. Then I

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.440
call list on the query and I return the

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.880
results. You can also string everything together into one

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.390
long statement like this, but I prefer the code

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.900
to be broken up into smaller chunks for readability.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.930
Now you know how to filter queries by property.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.190
Obviously this function we just wrote is very hard

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.560
wired, and you would more typically let user pick

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.720
which values to filter on. And you'll learn how to do that soon.
