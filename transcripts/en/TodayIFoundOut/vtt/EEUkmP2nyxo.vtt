00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.219
Why Don't Trains Have Cabooses Anymore?

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.290
For well over a century, cabooses, the cute
quintessentially red cars at the rear of trains

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.580
in years past, served an integral function
in train operations.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.880
Carrying a brakeman and a flagman back when
brakes were set by hand, when it was time

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.789
to slow the train, the engineer would blow
the whistle.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.720
This signaled to the brakemen, and one would
emerge from the caboose and work his way toward

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.620
the engine, while another would leave the
engine and work his way back toward the caboose.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.760
At each car, the brakemen would stop and turn
its brakewheel with a club.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.969
Once the train stopped, the flagman would
leave the caboose with a flag, lantern or

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.789
other visual display and walk back down the
track to warn any approaching trains.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.780
The caboose was also an office for the conductor,
who was responsible for managing the paperwork

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.600
that accompanied each freight car.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.250
Often assigned to a particular man, the interiors
of cabooses would be equipped as temporary

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.280
living quarters, and even decorated with personal
items like photos and curtains.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.860
Considered a home away from home, crews would
sometimes sleep in the cabooses, and many

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.440
conductors even prepared meals in them.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.530
Legend has it, the cupola on top of the caboose
was invented by a conductor who used to stack

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.750
boxes up, sit on them, and look through a
hole in the roof of his car.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.280
Regardless of its true origins, after about
1863, the cupola became a fixture on cabooses,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.030
and was used by all of the men to observe
the train and look for signs of trouble (like

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.610
overheated hotboxes).

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.360
Also called a doghouse, bone breaker, hack,
hearse, monkey cage, crumm, and snake wagon,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.880
the caboose, like the brakemen and flagmen
who used them, became unnecessary as technology

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.110
was developed that performed their jobs just
as well, and for less money.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.560
Air brakes were developed in the 1880s, thus
eliminating the need to turn a wheel.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.620
Electric-powered signals, triggered by track
circuits, made signaling other trains automatic,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.610
and improvements in bearings made the problem
of overheating a thing of the past.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.459
In addition, trains grew longer and the cars
became so tall that viewing much of the train

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.569
from a caboose became impossible.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.799
On top of that, computers eventually took
over the paper-handling duties, so there was

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.510
no need to store any such paperwork on board.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.180
Rather than a cheerful red car, todayâ€™s
trains have small boxes that fit over their

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.580
rear couplers to monitor operations.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.860
Tied into the trainâ€™s air brake line, these
End of Train devices (EOTs) transmit brake

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.189
pressure information to the engineer, who
can also adjust the air brakes with the device.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.440
This is helpful for emergencies, since even
if the train breaks in two, the brakes of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:03:11.209
the rear part 
can be activated.
