00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.820
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.069
In the video today, we're looking at how it
is that anyone has blue or green eyes despite

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.350
that those pigments do not exist in the human
eye.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:17.490
Eye color is a function of pigmentation both
at the back of the iris and in its stroma

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.070
as well as the density of the cells in the
stroma.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.170
In most cases these factors, and hence eye
color, are determined by genetics with potentially

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.919
as many as 15 different genes identified to
date seeming to affect the ultimate coloring

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.279
in some way.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.680
However, contrary to what you might think,
blue and green pigment do not exist in the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.550
human ocular fluid or iris.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.430
In fact, only a couple of pigments are involved
in eye color: melanin (brown) and lipochrome

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.430
(yellow).

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.450
Aside from potential extreme albinism cases,
all eyes have some amount of melanin in the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.450
back of the iris, although not all eyes have
lipochrome.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.079
For brown eyes, there is high concentration
of melanin in the back of the iris as well

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.250
as in its stroma.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.219
The result is the melanin absorbing both short
and long wavelengths of light from across

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.000
the visible spectrum, with the density of
melanin in these two layers ultimately determine

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the shade of brown, which in extreme cases
can appear near black.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.710
On top of the melanin, amber eyes get their
color from the added presence of lipochrome

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.920
in the stroma.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.200
As stated previously, blue and green pigments
do not play a role in human eye color.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.280
So how does anyone have blue or green eyes?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.250
It turns out the remaining human eye colors,
including blue and green, are in part a trick

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.250
of the light.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.880
With blue eyes, there is a fair amount of
melanin in the back of the iris, but relatively

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.369
little melanin within the stroma, making it
translucent, with light getting scattered

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.310
around when it encounters this layer.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.799
This scattering occurs more at the shorter
wavelengths of light, most relevant here being

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.020
blue, while longer wavelengths are typically
passed through and ultimately absorbed by

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.060
the melanin at the back of the iris.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.799
The net result is the eye appearing blue,
even though if you were to dissect the eye

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.040
in question, you'd see the person physically
had brown eyes based on the pigments.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.680
This same type of thing is more or less what's
happening in the sky when sunlight is scattered

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.360
in the atmosphere, making it appear blue,
even though if the light from the Sun was

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.920
not being scattered or absorbed in the atmosphere,
the sky would look similar to the way it does

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590
at night in the day time.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.759
Grey eyes work almost exactly like blue eyes,
with melanin at the back of the iris absorbing

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.440
the longer wavelengths, but little within
the stroma.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.860
One of the reasons these people's eyes don't
appear blue is partially due to larger deposits

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.750
of collagen that cause a different kind of
scattering that isn't as frequency dependent.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.110
This type of scattering is basically what
is happening when water droplets in clouds

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.910
cause them to look some shade of grey.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.470
Additionally, in contrast to blue and grey,
green eyes have far less melanin at the back

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.770
of the iris, so slightly less absorption;
they also have some lipochrome in the stroma.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.440
But as with blue and grey eyes, there is little
melanin in the stroma and so a bit of light

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.000
scattering helps impart a blue hue, the net
result of all of this being the eye appearing

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.390
some shade of green.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.470
Hazel eyes, which can shift from brown to
green, have more melanin in the front border

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.720
layer of the eye, and, like green, grey and
blue eyes, scatter certain wavelengths of

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.300
light resulting in a somewhat shifting eye
color.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.870
On that note, the fact that these latter hues
are largely dependent on a trick of the eye,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.460
rather than, for instance, blue pigmentation,
is why people with these eye colors sometimes

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.180
appear to have a different eye color than
they normally do.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.450
Nothing has actually changed physically in
their eyes, but changing the lighting may

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.260
end up changing the wavelengths and concentration
of light getting scattered and absorbed, resulting

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.480
in the appearance of, for instance, a normally
slightly green eye looking slightly blue.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.980
As to why some people have two eye colors,
multiple eye colors can be caused by a variety

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.040
of things from genetics to various medical
conditions, such as Horner's syndrome and

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.150
Waardenburg syndrome.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.840
Regardless of the underlying cause, the individual
in questions ends up with a non-uniform distribution

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.080
of melanin in one or both eyes.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.310
In some cases, the individual might have two
completely different colored eyes (complete

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.310
heterochromia).

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.960
Perhaps the most common cause of this is genetic.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.720
However, other phenomena can cause a single
eye to completely change color, such as inflammation

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.680
like that suffered by actress Mila Kunis,
which changed the color of one of her eyes.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.520
External causes include topical medications
used to treat glaucoma, potentially turning

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.820
a blue eye to brown.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.440
Another type occurs where only a portion of
one eye has a different color.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.550
As with more uniform eye coloring, in all
cases the resulting eye color is largely a

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.090
function of brown and yellow pigmentation
and its distribution and density in the back

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.820
of the iris and in its stroma.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.450
Bonus Fact:
The Haskell Free Library and Opera House has

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.650
a curious line painted through the building.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.050
What does this line signify?

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.150
One side of the line lies in Quebec, Canada,
while the other is in the state of Vermont

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.600
in the United States.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.410
Because of this, the building has two main
entrances on either side of the border.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.290
The building also has two different addresses
and telephone area codes.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.730
Further, because of the layout of the building,
it’s jokingly referred to as “the only

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.350
library in the U.S. with no books and the
only opera house in the U.S. with no stage”

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.700
(the library and the stage are on the Canadian
side, while most of the audience of the opera

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.000
sits in the U.S.).

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.840
If you’re wondering, people inside can freely
cross the line marking the border, but if

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.040
they then exit the building, they are required
to report to Customs, but otherwise are free

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.540
to traverse one side of the building or the
other without such notification.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.130
Intentionally built on the border in the early
20th century, the building was placed such

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.230
as Mrs. Martha Stewart Haskell and Col. Horace
“Stewart” Haskell wanted both Canadians

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:20.150
and U.S. citizens to have access to the library
and opera house.
