00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.276
Boy, I'm so excited about this
donor party, man.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:15.148
The Donald J. Trump State Park.
We gotta go Mike!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.850
Sir, I don't feel good about
this.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.318
There's some sort of
darkness here.

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.354
I hate the man in the mirror.

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:22.555
I have a bad
feeling about this!

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:23.790 line:92%
-Hey, you listen to me!

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.324
...cause he knows my secrets.

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:26.259
You don't know where we are!

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.394
I know where we are and you just
shuttup!

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:29.595
And he says,

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:33.199
“Find the way to destroy

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:35.468
as many people as possible.”

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:36.403
Look, look!

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.889
There's a monster
in these woods.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:01:02.095
[incantation]

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.864
Okay, what was that?

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:07.934
[scary distorted voice]
You are not special.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:13.806
[scary distorted voice]
I'm the same age as you!

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:15.508
[cackles]
[distorted sounds]

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.243
We are all the same.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:22.015 line:92%
We are all the same

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.183
They're gonna know
everything that we did!

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.651
We didn't do anything!

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:28.221
-We did it all!
-Stop it! Stop it, Mike!

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.455
Take me!

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.491
[screams]

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:36.462
[multiple voices]
We are all the same.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.198
We are all the same.

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:43.770
We are all the same.
