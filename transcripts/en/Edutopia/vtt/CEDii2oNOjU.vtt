00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:11.946
&gt;&gt;Tom: Today our activity will be you
all taking smaller congruent shapes

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:14.346
and building a larger similar shape.

00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:16.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teacher Tom Wolken worked

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:19.806
in the computer industry before
coming to teach seventh-grade math

00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:20.936
at Olmsted North,

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:23.896
and the career-change
culture shock caused him

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:26.496
to be physically ill
and mentally stressed.

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.446
&gt;&gt;Tom: Within the first week that I
was here, I approached my principal,

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.576
Mr. Perkins, and I told him that
I was having a really bad day.

00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:33.696
He said, "How bad could it get?"

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:36.516
I had described the worst
situation would be that I went back

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:38.876
to my former employer and they'd
already filled my position,

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:41.706
and I was jingling my car
keys as I said this to him.

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:44.356
So he said, "Well, we'll get you
some more help in your classroom.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:48.406
You hang in there another week,"
and I did that and I've had --

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:50.306
every year since then it's
gotten better and better.

00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:52.296
&gt;&gt;Guys, which of these
shapes can fit together

00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:55.546
to make a larger shape that's
similar to the original?

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:59.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Now three years into the
job, Wolken's classroom is a hive

00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:03.636
of active learning, partly because
he's learned some tricks of the trade

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:06.676
in dealing with Olmsted's
all-male environment.

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:09.556
&gt;&gt;Tom: In my three years of
teaching, I've only taught all boys,

00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:12.576
so I like that energy
in the classroom.

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.956
&gt;&gt;You have 20 seconds
when I say "go"...

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:16.186
&gt;&gt;We can be more competitive.

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:18.376
Boys respond to a competitive
environment.

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:20.456
I'd like to tie my classroom
to a lot of things we do.

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:22.256
&gt;&gt;Joe, there's 19 seconds left.

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:22.656
We need to...

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:25.756
&gt;&gt;Boys respond to different colors
and sound cues than girls do,

00:01:26.526 --> 00:01:29.146
so I try to use all that
in my classroom environment

00:01:29.146 --> 00:01:30.746
to get my boys engaged
and keep them learning.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:32.306
&gt;&gt;Divide up the work.

00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:35.086
Have one person work on squares
and sketch it, one person work

00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:36.806
on diamonds, one person
work on trapezoids...

00:01:36.876 --> 00:01:38.856
&gt;&gt;I could've have done this
less than three years ago,

00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:41.566
but I don't think the student
outcomes would've been as good.

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.166
I wouldn't have been cued
in to the boys' energy.

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:46.546
I probably would've stood and
lectured most of the time instead

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:48.726
of having them to hands-on
activities.

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:51.206
I probably would not have
given them as much structure.

00:01:51.306 --> 00:01:52.276
Boys need structure.

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.506
&gt;&gt;Guys, 10 more seconds.

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:55.626
&gt;&gt;These are the outcomes
that we're expecting.

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:57.276
This is the time you
have to do it in.

00:01:57.276 --> 00:01:58.896
You're going to have
time to work together.

00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:02.046
Then you're going to have time
to listen to your instructor,

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:05.136
and during that time you'll
also be asking questions,

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.066
but we raise our hands.

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:06.786
We don't shout out.

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:10.666
So, I brought a lot of different
structure and energy to my classroom

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:12.486
that was not there three years ago.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:15.266
&gt;&gt;Now, remember, let's think
about using our math words.

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:17.976
&gt;&gt;I created a PowerPoint
display to put

00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:19.686
up a special message during the week.

00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:21.066
It's usually an inspirational
message.

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:24.196
I also use the clock to show
pictures of the students doing things

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:26.786
that demonstrate school
spirit or having fun.

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:30.266
It's also classroom management,
because I'll tell my guys

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.696
that if they earn recognition
slips in my room

00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:35.796
that I can put their picture and two
of their buddies on TV for a week,

00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:37.036
and they get excited about that.

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:39.906
&gt;&gt;Quantel's going to show
us how he did a trapezoid.

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:42.256
&gt;&gt;I use the Web cam in my
classroom for two reasons.

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:45.146
First, the boys respond to be able
to show and demonstrate their work.

00:02:45.146 --> 00:02:46.896
They take a great deal
of pride in that.

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:49.426
And, secondly, I use it as
a classroom-management tool.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.196
I went out and spent $20.00
at the discount store.

00:02:52.196 --> 00:02:55.106
The camera is mounted on
Popsicle sticks with duct tape,

00:02:55.496 --> 00:02:58.366
and it gives the boys an area
where they can show their work.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:01.476
&gt;&gt;So, Dwan created a larger
version of that triangle.

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:04.266
&gt;&gt;As far as classroom
management, I use the camera

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:07.736
because if the boys want to come
up and use it, they need to show me

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:08.916
that they've gotten their work done.

00:03:09.096 --> 00:03:12.426
They need to have had appropriate
behavior during the lesson,

00:03:12.686 --> 00:03:15.226
and then they're eligible to
come up and use the technology,

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:17.756
so it's not just a whiz-bang
feature in the classroom.

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:19.736
It's also for their
learning experience,

00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:22.816
because if everybody's doing their
work, if everybody's being respectful

00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:24.286
in the classroom, then
everybody can learn.

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:26.866
&gt;&gt;What was our scale factor
to go from one to two inches?

00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:27.486
&gt;&gt;Student: Two.

00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:28.426
&gt;&gt;Tom: Okay.

00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:31.906
