00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.549
Oh sorry, didn’t see you there, I was just
doing my pre-DNews routine.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.250
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.500
A recent poll by the National Sleep Foundation
found that most parents understand that sleep

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.609
is important for their kid’s growing brains.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.550
Yet 90% of kids aren’t getting enough sleep.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.140
In order to get kids to sleep better, the
researchers encourage parents to adopt bedtime

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.140
routines.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.990
Reading before bed rather than letting them
play with a tablet device for example.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.860
Alright, yeah so going to bed and getting
up at the same time every day is good for

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.860
us.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.860
But this made me ask why?

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.100
Why are we so obsessed with habits?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.530
I mean, how many listicles are on the internet
about “habits of highly successful people”?

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.350
it’s like we see magic in routines.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.640
Writers often stick very strictly to their
routines, they feel it opens them to be a

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.690
conduit for creativity.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.219
Routines aren’t just for writers, how many
of us make the same cup of coffee in the same

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.719
mug and sit in the same chair.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.590
How many of you go through your morning routine
in a fog?

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.510
how many us drive to and from work without
too much thought?

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.870
Well thank your infralimbic cortex and the
basal ganglia for that.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.370
These two parts of the brain work together
to form our most cherished routines.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.920
The infralimbic cortex, which is located in
the prefrontal cortex, is the decider.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.500
the basal ganglia and the brainstem work together
to execute your actions.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.550
the basal ganglia are responsible for positive
reinforcement.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.970
While learning a new habit, this part of the
brain is influxed with dopamine, which reinforces

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.970
the behavior.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.990
These actions are then stored in the striatum
and its circuits.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.850
Over time, as your perform these habits, your
brain goes on autopilot mode.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.111
This nifty autopilot feature isn’t because
you need more caffeine but it keeps the brain

00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:46.380
from feeling overwhelmed.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.430
During the routine, the prefrontal cortex
isn’t as active, leaving you able to think

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.520
about other things.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.090
Imagine if you have had to consciously decide
where to put your feet or which side of the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.270
sink you should stand on.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.930
These small decisions would take up so much
brain space.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.880
Life would be very difficult.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.380
Writer Alva Noe suggests that habits are what
make daily life possible.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.560
That habits allow us the freedom to pursue
other thoughts or actions while getting stuff

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.560
done.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.349
He even suggests we design robots or AI with
habits.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.459
Habits, routines and rituals all play through
this positive feedback track.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.610
Rituals are just routines granted meaningful
significance.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.610
There’s comfort in routine.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.530
Indeed they apply some modicum of control
over our lives.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.849
When faced with anxiety we turn to the things
we can control.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.069
Faced with a big game?

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.730
Wear your lucky jersey.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.849
Faced with the illness of a loved one?

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.409
Go to the store, buy some soup and crackers,
turn on a favorite movie.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.230
To ward off nightmares as a kid I would kiss
my dream catcher every night before I went

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.230
to bed.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.150
A recent study shows that rituals boost confidence
and temper the effects of feelings of grief

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.939
or even less intense emotions like disappointment.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.739
Whether a large religious ritual or a small
bedtime routine, humans are creatures of habit.

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.599
And it’s not all magic and superstition.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.170
Some of it’s science.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.790
And switching gears for a second, our sister
show TestTube is getting super close to 250,000

hosted on whether or not vaccinations should

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.499
be mandatory.
