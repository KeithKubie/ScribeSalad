00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.389
Voiceover:When you first
learned multiplication

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:04.900
many, many, many years ago,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.767
you got exposed to the
idea that 1 times ...

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:10.102
I shouldn't use that symbol ...

00:00:10.102 --> 00:00:13.966
1 times some number is
equal to that number again,

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.701
and that makes intuitive sense.

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:17.766
You're just literally
saying one of this thing

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.114
is just going to be that
thing right over there.

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:21.900
And you could view it as 1,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.833
when you're thinking about
regular multiplication

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.233
or scalar multiplication,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.833
it has this identity property.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:32.166
It has the identity
property of multiplication.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.680
1 times some number is equal
to that some number again.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.766
Since we're now exploring matrices

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.033
and matrix multiplication,

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:42.306
the question arises is there some matrix

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:46.168
that has the same property
for matrix multiplication?

00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:48.566
To make that a little bit more concrete,

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.034
is there some matrix I,

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:54.366
and let me bold it as best
as I can in my handwriting,

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:58.032
is there some matrix I that
if I were to multiply it

00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:00.100
times any other ...

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.766
I think I over-bolded that one,

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.105
but I'll just go with it.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:07.233
If I were to multiply it
times any other matrix, A,

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:13.300
that the resulting product
is going to be matrix A again

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.166
by the standard conventions
of matrix multiplication.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.235
To make that a little bit
concrete, let's just imagine.

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:22.101
Let's just take an example for A.

00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:24.900
Let's say that our matrix A,

00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:28.400
let's go 3 by 3.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:37.201
Let's say it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:40.100
What I encourage you
to is pause this video

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.235
and try to think about
whether you can construct

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.233
some matrix I,

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:45.567
and first think about
even what the dimensions

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:49.566
of matrix I have to be in order to,

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.033
when you multiply the two this way,

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:52.633
when you multiply I times A,

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.333
you get A again.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.633
I'm assuming you've given a go at it,

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:58.904
so let's think this through.

00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:00.767
Let's throw matrix A down there.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:04.867
Let's say copy and paste.

00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:06.367
Let's first think about
what the dimensions

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:07.900
are going to have to be.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.500
When I multiply my matrix I,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.967
when I multiply my matrix
I times A right over here,

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:20.535
I get A again.

00:02:20.535 --> 00:02:25.501
I'm multiplying something times a 3 by 3,

00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:28.073
3 by 3 matrix,

00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:32.148
and I'm getting another 3 by 3 matrix.

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:34.633
There's a few things that we know.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.366
First of all, in order for
this matrix multiplication

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:39.434
to even be defined,

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:41.166
this matrix, the identity matrix,

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:46.013
has to have the same number
of columns as A has rows.

00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:49.100
We already see that A has 3 rows,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.435
so this character, the identity matrix,

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:53.600
is going to have to have 3 columns.

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.967
It's going to have to have 3 columns.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:03:01.366
We also know that the
dimensions of the product,

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:05.566
the rows of the product are defined

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.666
by the rows of the first matrix,

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:10.500
so this has to be also a 3 by 3,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.569
and of course, the columns of the product

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.467
are defined by the columns
of the second matrix.

00:03:16.653 --> 00:03:18.925
This is what defines this.

00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:20.566
These middle two have to match,

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:22.501
and then the rows of the first matrix

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:24.366
define the rows of the product,

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:26.233
and then the columns of the second matrix

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:27.634
define the columns of the product.

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:29.867
We know this has to be a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:32.366
Now what else do we know?

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:34.100
We know what the product needs to be.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:42.934
It also needs to be 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:44.566
Let's think about it.

00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:46.774
To get this first entry right over here,

00:03:46.774 --> 00:03:50.366
we're going to have to multiply this row,

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:53.100
this row times this column,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.235
since you take the dot product of it.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.435
I'm going to have to
multiply something times 1

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:01.434
plus something else times 4

00:04:01.434 --> 00:04:04.200
plus something else times 7 to get 1.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.039
Let's just think about it in the most,

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.438
I guess we could say, naive possible way.

00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:12.904
What happens if we just
multiply 1 times this 1 to get 1

00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:17.568
and then 0 times 4 and add to it

00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:19.234
and then 0 times 7.

00:04:19.234 --> 00:04:20.634
I think that works out.

00:04:20.634 --> 00:04:22.367
When you take this product,

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:25.601
this entry right over here
is going to be 1 times 1,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.734
1 times 1 plus 0 times 4,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.534
0 times 4 plus 0 times 7,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.534
plus 0 times 7.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:37.700
That worked out quite well,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.166
but let's just make sure
that that still holds.

00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:43.902
What happens when we multiply
this row times this column

00:04:43.902 --> 00:04:47.234
or times this column to get
this entry right over here?

00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:47.767
It works out.

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:51.833
It's 1 times 2 plus 0
times 5 plus 0 times 8,

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:52.633
so it makes sense.

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:54.267
You get 2 again.

00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:56.700
Same thing when you do
it for this 3rd column.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.666
1 times 3 plus 0 times 6 plus
0 times 9 is going to be 3.

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:03.700
Now what do we do in the second row?

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.300
Let's think about it a little bit.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.033
The second row right over here

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:09.700
is going to determine what
values we get over here.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.638
For example, to get this
entry right over there,

00:05:13.638 --> 00:05:16.600
we're going to multiply this row,

00:05:16.773 --> 00:05:21.066
we're going to multiply
this row times this column,

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:22.268
times this column.

00:05:22.902 --> 00:05:23.901
We want it to have the 4,

00:05:23.901 --> 00:05:24.834
so one way to think about it,

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:26.833
we just want this middle entry here,

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:34.101
so let's multiply 0 times 1
plus 1 times 4 plus 0 times 7,

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:35.433
and then we're going to get 4.

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:40.501
That works out for this
next entry right over here.

00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:46.100
0 times 2 plus 1 times 5 plus 0 times 8.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.566
We get 5.

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:50.141
It will work out the same
for this entry over there.

00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:52.505
Now, for this last entry,

00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:57.036
for this bottom row right
over here of our product,

00:05:57.036 --> 00:05:58.766
to do that, we're going
to have to multiply

00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:01.386
this row times these columns,

00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:03.640
or take, I guess you could
say, the dot product.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.166
To get the 7,

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:08.766
we want to multiply this
row times this column,

00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:11.901
or take the dot product of
this row and that column.

00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:15.017
If we want the 7, let's
multiply 0 times a 1

00:06:15.017 --> 00:06:19.602
plus 0 times a 4 plus a 1 times the 7.

00:06:19.987 --> 00:06:21.900
Just like that, you'll
see that that works.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.566
That gives us a 7 for this entry.

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:25.835
It gives us, when you take
the dot of this and that,

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:27.833
it gives you an 8 for this entry.

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:29.633
You take the dot product of that and that.

00:06:29.633 --> 00:06:31.500
It gives you the 9,

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500
the 9 for that entry.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.366
Just like that, we have constructed

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:38.433
a 3 by 3 identity matrix.

00:06:38.433 --> 00:06:45.433
The 3 by 3 identity matrix
is equal to 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,

00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:49.266
and 0, 0, 1.

00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:53.976
As you will see, whenever you construct

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:54.900
an identity matrix,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.833
if you're constructing a
2 by 2 identity matrix,

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:00.767
so I can say identity matrix 2 by 2,

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:02.233
it's going to have a very similar pattern.

00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:04.966
It's going to be 1, 0, 0, 1.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:12.233
If you have a 4 by 4 identity matrix,

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.306
it is going to be, you could guess it,

00:07:14.306 --> 00:07:23.500
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.703
You essentially just
have 1s down the diagonal

00:07:25.703 --> 00:07:28.139
going from the top left
to the bottom right.

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:30.303
What's neat about identity matrices,

00:07:30.303 --> 00:07:32.033
you multiply it times any matrix,

00:07:32.033 --> 00:07:34.266
and you're going to get that matrix again.

00:07:34.602 --> 00:07:37.366
Now another thing I encourage you to do

00:07:37.366 --> 00:07:40.967
is we've just shown that
I times A is equal to A,

00:07:40.967 --> 00:07:43.500
but I'll let you do this after this video,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.433
what about A times I?

00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:51.308
We've seen that matrix multiplication,

00:07:51.308 --> 00:07:52.700
the order matters,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.767
so what happens here?

00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:58.267
If you take A times I, do you still get A?
