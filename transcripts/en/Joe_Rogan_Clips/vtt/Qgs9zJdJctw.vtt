1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.490
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.230
So what was the motivation behind creating this book America before?

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.560
It's a curious mixture of things.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.620
I have been exploring the possibility of a lost civilization for more than 25

5
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:19.500
years.
That was the essence of my book,

6
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:24.240
fingerprints of the Gods that was published in 1995 that there has been a huge

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.920
forgotten episode in human history.

8
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.670
I continued to follow that in a series of other books and by the time I got to

9
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:34.671
2002 when I published a book called underworld that followed seven years of

10
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.310
scuba diving on continental shelves,

11
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:41.160
looking for structures that were submerged by rising sea levels.

12
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.820
At the end of the last ice age,
I really felt I'd done it.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.690
I felt I'd walked the walk,
I'd put put out to the public,

14
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:51.510
a massive body of information and I thought,

15
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:56.511
my role in this is over and I can breathe a sigh of relief because it's hot in

16
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.340
this particular kitchen and I can go do something else.

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.440
And I ended up writing a book about psychedelics.

18
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.890
I ended up writing supernatural meetings with the ancient teachers of mankind.

19
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.250
About the role of psychedelics in,
in the origins of the,
of the human story.

20
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:12.360
But then new information started to come out that touched on the lost

21
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:16.140
civilization idea and I couldn't just stand by and ignore that information.

22
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:21.141
That's why I published and magicians of the Gods in 2015 and then as I was

23
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.530
researching that book,

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.940
I became aware of something I hadn't realized before that there's a mass of new

25
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.150
information from the Americas,
specifically from the Americas,

26
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:34.800
which completely rewrites the story of human history that the Americas,
um,

27
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.250
have been misrepresented,
uh,
for a very long time,
uh,

28
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.170
by archaeology.

29
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:43.230
And archeologist will be annoyed with me for saying that they have a way of

30
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:47.430
forgetting their own arrows,
uh,
of saying,
Oh,
well,
we knew that all along.

31
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.540
It wasn't,
it wasn't the case,

32
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:52.680
but the fact of the matter remains that for best part of 50 years from the 1960s

33
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.600
through until about 2010,

34
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.870
American archeology was locked in a dogma that they actually had a name for,

35
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.130
which was Clovis first,
uh,
that they invented a name for a culture.

36
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.610
They call them the Clovis culture.
We don't know what they called themselves.

37
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.890
They were hunter gatherers.
Uh,

38
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.310
they first appear in the archaeological record 13,000,

39
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.360
400 years ago and they vanished from the archeological record 12,000,

40
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:19.320
600 years ago.

41
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.550
And for a very long time it was maintained adamantly that these were the first

42
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:28.551
Americans that no human being touched the soil of the Americas until 13,000,

43
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:33.270
400 years ago.
Just animals.
But no human beings present at all.

44
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.440
And any archeologist who attempted to dispute that dogma,

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.640
and I use the word deliberately,
there should be no room for dogma in science,

46
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.940
but any archeologist who challenged that would face severe problems with his or

47
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:48.414
her career,

48
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.740
they would be mocked and humiliated at conferences like an archeologist called

49
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:56.790
Jack's hunk Mars from,
from Canada who excavated in the,
in the,
in the Yukon,

50
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.380
humiliated at conferences,
insulted,
accused of making stuff up.
Uh,

51
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.650
their research funding would be withdrawn basically to challenge Clovis first

52
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.230
was the end of your archaeological career.
So naturally,

53
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.410
very few archeologists wanted to challenge Clovis first.

54
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.000
What was this gentleman in the Yukon?

55
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:17.380
What was is called Jack Sank Mars a and interestingly the Smithsonian,

56
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.370
just in 2017 uh,

57
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.930
did a big kind of mayor Kulpa big admission about this,

58
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.210
that everybody had got things wrong that Jack sank.

59
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.940
Mars had been ruined by the Clovis first lobby,

60
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.780
but he'd been right all along the site.
He excavated in the Yukon,

61
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:36.781
was re excavated in 2017 and every single thing he said was correct even though

62
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.250
they had just sneered at him.
And what was he,

63
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.980
he was activating in the 1980s in the 1990s he's still alive.

64
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.760
He's still alive.
Yeah.
Better.
Well,
I think he's been indicated,
you know,

65
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.750
and it's kind of,
it's kind of nice to be vindicated that,
that the,
the,
the,

66
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.290
there's almost a place in folklore,
folklore for the,
for the,

67
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.480
for the individual who is scorned and humiliated,
you know,
by,
by others.

68
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.720
But who turns out to be,
to be right.
And He,
and he was right.

69
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.740
But my point about this is that what it meant was,

70
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.190
since it was the dogma that Clovis was first,

71
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.220
that they oldest dates were 13,400 years ago.

72
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.210
There seemed to be no logic to archeologists in digging deeper.
You know,

73
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:17.810
how it is with archaeology,
that the,

74
00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:21.700
the upper levels are the youngest and the deeper you go,
the older it gets.

75
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:25.930
That's why we say Upper Paleolithic for the late Ice Age and lower Paleolithic

76
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:29.950
for the late stone age and lower for the older stone age.

77
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.720
And the feeling was no need to dig below the Clovis layer because we already

78
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.390
know that there were no human beings.
Then before that,

79
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.900
and then a few archeologists I've mentioned Jack Sank Mars,
but uh,
but uh,

80
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.900
another is I'll Goodyear from the University of South Carolina,
uh,

81
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.430
who excavated a site called topper in South Carolina now.

82
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.540
Now topper is an incredibly rich Clovis site.
It's full of their tools,

83
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:53.081
their points.

84
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:56.530
They made these special special Flint points that we used as arrowheads and

85
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.690
spears,
great Clovis site.

86
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.290
He finished excavating the Clovis level and then he did something that was

87
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:08.980
supposed not to be done.
He decided to dig deeper and he carried on deeping down,

88
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.551
digging down.

89
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:13.150
And there was a layer of about a meter and a half of of barren soil.

90
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.380
And then beneath that more human artifacts and they finally date those back to

91
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.510
more than 50,000 years ago.

92
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.370
And then in 2017 published in nature,
um,

93
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.450
by Tom Demorais,

94
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:29.380
who's the chief paleontologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum,
uh,

95
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:31.990
at a bunch of other very high level,
uh,

96
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.750
paleontologists published in nature magazine,

97
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:39.550
evidence for human presence in North America 130,000 years ago.

98
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.010
Now this is really put the cat amongst the pigeons.
Now,

99
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:45.610
if humans were oppressed North America 130,000 years ago,

100
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.210
and archeologists have been telling us for 50 years that they were only present

101
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:51.100
from 13,000 years ago,

102
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.990
that's 10 times as long that we've had humans in North America capable of doing

103
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:56.740
stuff.

104
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.680
And the archeological dogma has prevented any search for what they were doing

105
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.850
until,
until very recently.
What was the evidence from 130,000 years ago?
Okay.

106
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:09.050
So what,
it's not the,
let me be clear about this because,
because this is,

107
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.960
this is something that is often misrepresented in,
in my views.

108
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.990
It is not the evidence for an advanced civilization that we find a 130,000 years

109
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.764
ago in America.

110
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.090
The evidence that we find is evidence for human presence and what they were

111
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:28.060
doing was very much stone age stuff.
It's a Mastodon,
it's a mastodon skeleton.

112
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.410
Uh,
that was,
that was excavated,

113
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.940
was actually found by accident during road construction near CSR near San Diego.

114
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.140
Um,
and,

115
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.950
and an archeologist was attached to the road construction crew and immediately

116
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:43.100
stopped construction and they investigated it thoroughly.

117
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.340
And what they found was so much dynamite in the early 1990s when they found it

118
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.310
that they decided not to publish at the time because what they found was

119
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:57.110
evidence that those mastodon bones had been cracked open by human beings using

120
00:06:57.111 --> 00:07:00.200
tools and that the marrow had been extracted,

121
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.520
that one Tusk could be left standing upright in the ground and another had been

122
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:05.210
left beside it.

123
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.290
That femur had a femur of the animal had been taken away completely from the

124
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:12.250
site.
Uh,
and there was assemblages of,
of,
uh,

125
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.540
instruments that we use to smash and break the burns.

126
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:18.740
And the conclusion of the team was that only one kind of creature could have

127
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:23.450
done that work using tools on a mastodon.
And that's human beings.

128
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:25.550
That's classic,
classic human behavior.

129
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.660
So this sets the goalposts in a totally different place.

130
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:33.740
Suddenly we have to consider that humans have been in America for 130,000 years.

131
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.450
We already know that a dogmatic approach of archeology has rather refused to

132
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:41.030
look at anything older than 13,000 years ago.

133
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.210
And what it does is it generates an engine of demand that we need to be looking

134
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:49.730
at those missing hundred thousand plus years.
We need to be looking at it hard.

135
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:50.031
Of course,

136
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:54.950
the immediate reaction has not been to go looking for stuff in the other hundred

137
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.010
thousand years.
Most archeologists have responded by saying,
this is impossible.

138
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.660
It can't be.
It can't be.
So,

139
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:03.230
but that's precisely what they said to Jack Sanker Mars who said that humans

140
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:06.200
were in bluefish caves in the Yukon 25,000 years ago.

141
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:09.440
And it's precisely what they said to our Goodyear who said humans had been at

142
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:12.560
topper 50,000 years ago and they were both right.

143
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.500
And I believe that Tom Demorais and his team,

144
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.090
you don't get a big article published in nature unless it's already pretty

145
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:23.180
solidly based and pretty much peer reviews,
it has produced a reaction.

146
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.490
I would be wrong to say that it's universally accepted.

147
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.000
It's very much challenged.
It's intriguing.
What is the challenge?

148
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.770
The challenge fundamentally comes from we archeologists know that there were no

149
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:37.010
human beings in the Americas that far back.
To put it in perspective,

150
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:41.780
it's about 60,000 years before the first evidence of human beings in Europe.
Uh,

151
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:46.340
it's about 60,000 years before the first evidence of human beings in Australia.

152
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.730
And this is just evidence of the first human beings.
Yes,

153
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.810
we have to point out how difficult it is to find evidence,

154
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:52.580
extremely difficult to find.
You know,

155
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.280
sometimes we imagine that archeologists are working with masses of skeletal

156
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.920
material,
although they're not,
then they're not.
I mean the whole,

157
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.430
this is one of the ironies,
the whole Clovis first dogma,

158
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:04.830
you would think that they had masses of material to work with.

159
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.670
They did have the tools,
but in terms of skeletal remains,
just one,

160
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
just one single skeletal remains from one of the things that Michael Shermer had

161
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:14.491
sent me.

162
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:19.491
Was this a dispute that perhaps the bones had been cracked open by the

163
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.560
excavation material?
Yeah,
I saw excavation machines.

164
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.910
I saw Michael's email email last night and I,

165
00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:30.120
I appreciate that Michael wants to continue to,
uh,
in engage with this subject.

166
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.290
And that's his job.
He's a pro.
He's a professional skeptic and,
and it's his,

167
00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:35.840
his role to do so.
But what he,
what he misses out,

168
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.070
it's true that a new paper has been published,

169
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.670
which raises questions over the,
uh,

170
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.770
what's called the Cerruti Mastodon site,

171
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.970
which is the site that Tom Demorais at San Diego,
actually a museum,
uh,
excavated.

172
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.530
And what's interesting since I can send to Michael,

173
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:55.620
took the trouble to write the questions.
Can I just,
sure.

174
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.720
Can I just read you something that I responded to them this?
Sure.
Um,

175
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.370
which is that to the microphone?
Those,
yeah.
Yeah.
Basic.
Basically this,
this,

176
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.140
this paper,
um,

177
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.170
was in no way a refutation of the original paper in nature.

178
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:14.070
As a matter of fact,

179
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.320
the gentleman who wrote that paper never even looked at the archaeological

180
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:23.970
remains that are in that now in the San Diego Natural History Museum.

181
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.380
Um,
what it is,
what he based it on,
his reference,

182
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:31.890
I'm quoting from the abstract of the paper itself,

183
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:36.420
reference to a freeway right of way map and construction plans,

184
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.220
contemporary road building practices and work site photographs available on the

185
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:43.830
Internet.
In other words,
the site was not visited.

186
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.080
They simply looked at secondary references.

187
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:50.160
They did not look at the archeological material and they ignore the entire

188
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:53.700
argument of Tom [inaudible] and his colleagues who had already addressed that

189
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:57.630
issue.
They didn't look at the bones.
They did not look at the bones.
When you,

190
00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.670
when you break a fresh bone,

191
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.140
it has a characteristic kind of spiral fracture that does not happen when you

192
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:05.490
break a fossilized bone.

193
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.320
And Tom Demorais and his team specifically ruled out road making machinery as

194
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:13.500
responsible for this breaking pattern because they actually carried out

195
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:17.370
experiments on a modern elephants,
deceased elephants,

196
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:18.630
and they broke their bones.

197
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:22.800
And the kind of fracture that you get in a fresh green bone is completely

198
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:25.740
different from the kind of lecture you get in a,
in a,
in a fossilized bone.

199
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.130
So unfortunately this paper pays,
pays no attention to that.

200
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.530
It just looks at road plans and says there was roadwork there.

201
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:35.280
It must have been done by roadwork.
I think it's very sloppy,
very weak and a,

202
00:11:35.281 --> 00:11:39.180
it's certainly not the answer.
We can expect ongoing debate and that is,
uh,

203
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.850
that is healthy.
But this is not a strong case at all.

204
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.940
So this points to the first evidence that we found and is there any effort

205
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:51.240
underway to try to uncover more evidence that,
uh,
from a similar tone,

206
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.970
I'm going to cite to Tom,
Tom Demorais,
the chief pat intelligence,

207
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.360
the San Diego Natural History Museum.
That's what he would like to see.

208
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.490
He makes the point to me,
I interview him.

209
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.920
I spent a day with him at that actually still museum.

210
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:04.180
He was very generous with his time.

211
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:08.530
I did an extended interview and I quote from it in,
in America before,

212
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:10.960
and his wish is that archeologists,

213
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:15.730
instead of spending all their time trying to find ways to dismiss and get rid of

214
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:16.720
his findings,

215
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.190
his wish is that they would spend a little bit of that time looking at deposits

216
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.560
older than 13,400 years,

217
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.420
and even being willing to go back as far as 130,000 years.
That's,

218
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.000
that's would be a proper scientific response.

219
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:36.330
Here is a thera body of work put forward by a very senior group of scientists

220
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:38.500
who hesitated before they published it.

221
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.540
They had the information back in the 1990s,

222
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:45.541
but it wasn't until refined dating techniques later than in the 21st century

223
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.240
that they finally work sure what they had and that they published it in,

224
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:54.010
in nature in 2017.
It's a,
it's,
it's a,
it's an important study.
Um,

225
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.860
and,
um,
I think what's going to happen,
uh,

226
00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.210
is that we're going to find much more evidence of a very ancient human presence

227
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:05.230
in the America America's,
and that's what Tom Demorais thinks as well.
Um,

228
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.920
and as he points out,
if we don't look,
then we're never going to find,

229
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.350
if we allow dogma to stop us looking and saying,
oh,

230
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.740
it's impossible that humans were in the Americas 130,000 years ago,

231
00:13:14.741 --> 00:13:17.980
so we won't bother to look what a failure of science that is.
And,
and,

232
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.160
and to spend all the time instead of trying to get rid of the evidence that

233
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.160
doesn't fit the current paradigm.
Well,

234
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:28.300
it's so fascinating that just as fortuitous discovery during a construction site

235
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:30.310
could change the way people perceive things.

236
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.850
You just got to wonder how much of that stuff is.
And I mean,

237
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:37.060
how deep did they have to go to find these mastodon bones?
Well,
so this is a,

238
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:39.610
this is a road cut that's being made.
So those would be,

239
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:43.720
those would be pretty deep down in 10,
15 feet down.
The greater is going through.

240
00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:45.670
And um,
and flattening them.

241
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.020
It varies from place to place depending on soil deposition,
the stratification,

242
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.600
the stratification of the soil.
But what the key,

243
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:57.430
the key point is that what you need to do is go deeper than 13,400 years ago and

244
00:13:57.431 --> 00:13:59.170
you need to do so with,
um,

245
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.940
dedication and vigor and with some kind of funding at the moment,

246
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:08.380
archeology doesn't,
doesn't see the point of that.
If,
um,

247
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.190
the paper in nature,
uh,
by Tom Demorais was alone.

248
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.440
If there were nothing else than that,
uh,
I wouldn't place so much trust in it.

249
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.410
But I've spent a lot of time during the researching of this book with

250
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:22.180
archeologists who dig did,

251
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.870
Dick did dig deeper.

252
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.310
And what those archeologists all confirm is that there have been human beings in

253
00:14:30.311 --> 00:14:32.680
the Americas for tens of thousands of years.

254
00:14:32.681 --> 00:14:37.000
And it's not surprising that that can be pushed back to a 130,000 years ago.

255
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:40.690
Because part of the argument about the peopling of the Americas has to do with a

256
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:45.691
place that we now call the Bering straits between Alaska and Siberia,

257
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.600
which during the Ice Age where at times,
uh,

258
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.560
Landbridge they were exposed because of,
because of lowered sea levels,

259
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.980
but migrants who crossed that land bridge from Siberia on many occasions,

260
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.430
over periods of tens of thousands of years would find themselves confronted then

261
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.210
by the North American ice cap,
which oddly wasn't at the tip of Alaska,

262
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:11.780
but began further in.
So there was living space in a bit of Alaska,

263
00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:13.910
but you couldn't get through the ice mountains.
These,

264
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:18.260
these literally ice mountains to two miles deep covering the whole of North

265
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:22.770
America and preventing access to the and glaciated,
uh,

266
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.720
parts of America.

267
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.910
The thing is that what happened around 13,000,
400 years ago,

268
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:32.690
there had been a period of global warming and the ice sheets began to melt and a

269
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:36.350
corridor opened up between what's called the Cordelia and I sheet and the

270
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:37.370
Laurentide ice sheet.

271
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:40.910
The two major ice keeps in North America and it's thought that that migration

272
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:42.590
came through that corridor.
Well,

273
00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:47.591
the thing is that exactly the same thing happened between 140,000 years ago and

274
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:52.160
120,000 years ago there was an episode of global warming and ice free corridor

275
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:55.820
opened up and the same opportunity to enter the Americas was there at that

276
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:58.010
period than it was at the later period.

277
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.450
And Tom Demaris point in mind is that we have to pay much more attention to that

278
00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:06.780
air early appeared.
And that's really why I've gone ahead and uh,
and,

279
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.790
and written this book is to try to put before a broad general audience hopefully

280
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:14.330
in,
in language that,

281
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:19.190
that that makes sense and an assembly of all the latest information that casts

282
00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:21.590
doubt on the story we've been told.
Because my goodness,

283
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.270
if archeology is wrong about the story of the peopling of the Americas,

284
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:29.540
if it's radically wrong as it now appears to be,

285
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.840
then our whole understanding of human history has to change.

286
00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:37.070
It's not just the history of the Americas,
it's the history of the entire world.

287
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:42.071
It has been an absolute article of faith amongst archeologists that civilization

288
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.180
began in the old world.
And uh,
indeed,

289
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:47.690
I have a,

290
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.690
I have a book in my library called history begins at summa and it's by Samuel

291
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.680
Noah Kramer are very renowned archeologists.
Uh,
and it's a,

292
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.860
it's a good book actually,

293
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.540
but the argument is that this is where civilization began in the culture that we

294
00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:06.500
call the Sumerians in Mesopotamia between the Tigress and the Euphrates rivers

295
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.320
and that it began about 6,000 years ago.

296
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:13.520
And that civilization is entirely an invention of the old world and it has

297
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:17.600
nothing to do with the new world at all because the new world was populated so

298
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:20.120
late.
This has,
this has been the,

299
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.780
this has been the argument and this is the argument that now radically and

300
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:28.700
suddenly begins to change that the Americas,
this enormous landmass resource,

301
00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:33.560
rich bountiful in,
in every way south of Minnesota,

302
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:36.890
south of the ice cap,
vast land areas that are,

303
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:39.980
that are bad for get into South America,
Central America,
South America,

304
00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:44.270
the Amazon just to huge areas of land that were very,
very offered.

305
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:46.640
Great potential for,
for for human occupation.

306
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.560
Dogma has said there were no humans there.
Now,

307
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:53.430
the first bits of evidence are coming out that says there were humans there,

308
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.660
and if that's the case,

309
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:58.110
then we must consider the possibility that the story of civilization might've

310
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.540
begun in the Americas.
Not In the old world at all.

311
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.540
It might be a new world invention,
not an old wooden bench.
