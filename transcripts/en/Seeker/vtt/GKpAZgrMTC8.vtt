00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.439
Withdrawal is a painful process that happens
after someone stops taking a mind-altering

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:14.900
substance, but why exactly is it so miserable?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.330
Withdrawal of any kind of substance can be
harrowing and exhausting.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.019
Some of the most dramatic symptoms include
nausea, sweating, shaking, and even hallucination.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.949
So what’s going?

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.800
Why does withdrawal wreak such havoc on the
body?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.130
First, let’s talk drug addiction in general.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.730
There’s lots of different substances you
can become addicted too.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.100
While opioids are the most well known additive
substances, alcohol and caffeine addictions

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.570
are common too.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.330
You can get hooked on these substances because
they alter the release of neurotransmitters

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.160
and change the way the brain works...sometimes
with pleasing results.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.500
But after long term exposure to a drug, the
brain tries to restore normal functioning

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.250
through adaptations.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.210
This is what building up drug tolerance is.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.810
If this goes on for a long time, the user
becomes dependent, needing the drug to maintain

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.120
just normal functioning and avoid withdrawal
symptoms.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.640
When that user goes off a drug, the brain’s
compensation is still in place, leading the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.940
brain to be more active in certain areas.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.550
This leads to what’s called withdrawal syndrome.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.960
Withdrawal symptoms can develop in 24 hours
and last anywhere from a week to months on

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.960
end.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.080
There’s lots of different mechanisms that
create dependency and withdrawal.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.170
One example is how opioids affect a brain
chemical called noradrenaline.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.820
Opioids are known to cause drowsiness, slowed
respiration, and low blood pressure.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.930
This is because opioids suppress the neurons
that produce noradrenaline.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.750
Over time, with opioid dependence, the body
counteracts this suppression by releasing

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.130
more of the chemical to support these functions
at normal level.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.570
But, even if a user stops taking the drug,
the body still releases an elevated level

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.380
of noradrenaline...which produces withdrawal
symptoms like jitters, anxiety, muscle cramps,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.500
and diarrhea.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.909
Similarly to how opioids affect noradrenaline,
alcohol affects production of another brain

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.270
chemical called GABA, which governs neuron
activity.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.080
Too little GABA, and neurons fire rapidly.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.640
You feel excited, hyper, thoughts are flying
around a mile a minute.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.020
Too much GABA and neurons subside a bit.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.869
You feel calmer, more relaxed.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.450
Sometimes too much, like stumbling around,
slurring words kind of sedated.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.320
So you can guess which alcohol does, yeah
it increases GABA.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.209
Chronic alcohol use impairs the ability of
GABA to calm the brain down.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.540
So more GABA, and thus more alcohol is needed
to get the same relaxing effect.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.400
And once alcohol intake stops, GABA levels
drop dramatically.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.120
Which makes the brain overreact.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.020
And that can lead to things like teeth-chattering,
uncontrolled shaking, jumpiness, and even

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.580
seizures...that last one can even be deadly.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.290
While you might think withdrawal doesn’t
apply to you… put that coffee down.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.320
I know most of you probably drink it.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.650
According to New Scientist, it’s the world’s
most popular drug.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.240
But go without it for a day and you might
experience a headache, tiredness, feeling

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.560
low, foggy, less sociable, and even feeling
like you’ve got the flu.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.410
Caffeine works on the receptors for the neurotransmitter
adenosine.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.380
Adenosine facilitates sleep by calming the
brain down.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.390
Caffeine sneaks in there and binds to adenosine
receptors, so it blocks adenosine from doing

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.390
it’s job.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.040
That’s why you perk up with a morning cup
of Joe.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.550
Drinking caffeine regularly can also increase
the number of adenosine receptors in the brain.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.360
So you need more caffeine to get the same
effect, or in other words, you build up a

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.360
tolerance.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.580
But caffeine also causes your brain to release
dopamine, so you tend to feel good after your

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.750
morning coffee.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.480
Then once you stop drinking coffee, you crash
because suddenly your body is without the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.870
feel good boost and anti-sleepiness of the
caffeine.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.290
Thankfully, withdrawal from caffeine only
lasts a few days.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.400
One drug that’s incredibly addictive and
deadly is heroin, yet it’s use in the US

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400
is on the rise.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.490
What makes heroin so deadly?

00:03:40.490 --> 00:04:03.840
