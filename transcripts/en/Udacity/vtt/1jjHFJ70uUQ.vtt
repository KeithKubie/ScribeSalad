00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.190
&gt;&gt; So I'm Sascha Ellers, and I'm the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.110
Director of Clinical Operations. I'm from San Francisco, California.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.520
&gt;&gt; Alright, and what does a director of clinical operations do exactly?

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.800
&gt;&gt; So, I work with physicians and researchers to run

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.755
clinical trials. I take the ideas that the clinical staff, the,

00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:22.470
the physicians have with a protocol, and I work to implement

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.170
that protocol. So, I will go out to key opinion leaders,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.300
which are most likely physicians, try to recruit

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.150
them to participate in the study. I will

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.526
work with data that comes out of the

00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:37.334
study, so data that's from the patients that

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:40.461
enroll in the study. do monitoring which is

00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:43.516
basically verifying that the data that's recorded for

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.791
our study is accurate and matches what the

00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:48.674
data looks like in the patient's medical records.

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.268
&gt;&gt; I see. and then, you know, all of

00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:55.710
the, all of the work that it takes to oversee the study. it's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.338
a regulated environment. So it's regulated by the FDA, or if, if, in

00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:04.626
some cases research isn't regulated by the FDA, but it's always regulated by

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:07.954
good clinical practice and international guidelines on

00:01:07.954 --> 00:01:09.970
how to take care of patients, so.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.690
&gt;&gt; So you have to actually be informed of a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.240
lot different things to be able to carry this out.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.120
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.420
&gt;&gt; Now for those

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.180
people who may be slightly unfamiliar with how a clinical trial works or even

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.960
what one is, can you tell us briefly the significance of a clinical trial?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.980
&gt;&gt; Sure. So anytime you want to test

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.590
an intervention, be it a drug, a diagnostic

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.570
test or even just changes in behavior,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.670
you want to show that there's actually a difference,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.290
you want to run a clinical trial because

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.490
that's going to give you the gold standard, to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.030
show you that there is a difference

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.870
with your, with your drug or your intervention.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.330
So the, the clinical trial itself is a way to ask your question prospectively,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.880
design your, your experiment in humans, and then implement that study.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.200
&gt;&gt; I see, so this is sort of like

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.840
the, okay, prove that it works kind of thing.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.720
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.674
&gt;&gt; And this process you said itself is regulated by the government?

00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:03.578
&gt;&gt; By the FDA, correct.

00:02:03.578 --> 00:02:07.895
&gt;&gt; By the FDA. and must you pass a clinical trial

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:12.995
to carry out your test or your diagnostic or whatever you want

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:15.958
to do? Is that part of the requirement of ever selling your product?

00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:21.427
&gt;&gt; It, it depends. so, to, to back up, there're, there're three phases

00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:24.250
of clinical trial development for a drug.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.970
There's phase one, where you're looking for

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.580
your safety. So you've got to prove that you're not going to do undue

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.910
harm to people with your drug. And then in phase two, you're further refining

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.370
your safety data and you're starting to look at efficacy.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.830
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.350
&gt;&gt; And then phase three are your large

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.900
efficacy trials where you're treating a lot of patients

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.450
with the drug at that point. so that's

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.530
kind of the basic methodology. But then within that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.220
context, yeah, there is, it is regulated by the FDA. They do have a say in what

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.110
they're going to accept from the phase three

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.660
trials as something that they are willing to approve.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.260
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.210
&gt;&gt; And so a lot of effort goes into buil,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.930
putting together a study that's going to meet their requirements.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.000
&gt;&gt; It sounds like it takes a lot of time to do this.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.225
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:07.090
&gt;&gt; so it's sort of a big commitment from anybody interested.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.040
&gt;&gt; Big commitment for companies, a lot of resources go into these trials. And

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.510
academic settings a lot of resources will go into these, these studies as well.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.692
&gt;&gt; For the type of clinical operations that you manage, or that you're sort

00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:23.210
of the, that you work with, can you give us an idea of the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.803
time frame that you end up working on? Like how long

00:03:25.803 --> 00:03:28.355
from start to finish for any given project does it take?

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:32.560
&gt;&gt; no it's a good question. So it takes many, many years to go

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.120
from start to finish. So your looking on, order of seven to ten years.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.223
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:40.059
&gt;&gt; but within one study, a, a, you know

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:42.303
a big phase three study, that can take three years,

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:45.771
five years, sometimes when they're these longitudinal studies, they're,

00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:48.086
you know, lifetimes. So they do take a long time.

00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:48.466
&gt;&gt; Wow,

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:53.084
so your, your portfolio just keeps going on single project then.

00:03:53.084 --> 00:03:56.295
&gt;&gt; yeah. What can you give us an example of

00:03:56.295 --> 00:04:00.918
a specific, any kind of specific product, or diagnostic or anything

00:04:00.918 --> 00:04:04.092
that you're familiar with or that you've worked on at

00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:07.820
some point, that you know, sort of went through this process?

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.836
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, a recent example that's been approved is a drug called

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:18.817
Zelboraf, that looks at a mutation in the melanoma cancer

00:04:18.817 --> 00:04:22.660
Called V600E. So it looks at this mutation and says,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.970
if the patient is positive for this mutation, that if

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.060
the cancer is positive for this mutation, this would be

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.250
a good drug for the patient to try. And if

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.070
they don't have the mutation, they're probably not going to

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.250
respond to the drug at all. So this is a

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.840
great example of using genetics in in a clinical study to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.730
select patients. But you can also use

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.002
the genetic information to stratify patients. If

00:04:44.002 --> 00:04:48.080
you want to compare patients with the marker to those without. So it would just

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.840
be a marker that would be used to look at how you could break

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.390
apart those two groups to look at who did better or not, in that case.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.260
&gt;&gt; Right, and you said, so that's an example of

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.270
something that sort of went through this process, and has been approved?

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.940
Exactly.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.820
&gt;&gt; In general, for a lot of groups that, you know, bring products

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.870
through clinical trials, do you see an increase in the use of genetics to

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.890
actually either, you know, bring these products

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.790
through or to stratify groups like you

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.980
say, or just generally bring more possible

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.690
products to market by using genetic information?

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.660
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I think this is really the opportunity. Is part

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.740
of the problem with, with clinical studies is that you're confined

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.520
to the population that you're testing them in. So sometimes we'll see

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.080
a signal when we look at the entire data set. There'll be

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.300
a signal in a subset of patients, but you don't really know

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.340
why, and you've wasted a lot of money on a negative

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.450
trial. One of the opportunities that genetics provides is to help us

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.270
get the right patient on the right trial so that it increases

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.640
the likelihood that we're going to have a positive outcome for the trial,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.160
and decreases the risk to the patients or subjects

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.020
of being exposed to treatments that aren't going to help

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.520
them. So I think that that's one of the

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.399
most exiting things about the future of, of personalized genetics.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.940
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.200
&gt;&gt; In looking at developing drugs and treatments.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.830
&gt;&gt; So you, in general do you think there's

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.700
going to be a big increase in the number

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.790
of either individual companies that, you know, are sort

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.640
of doing this as well as the need for

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.962
people who understand and can carry out these, this kind of job?

00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:25.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think, I think that the, that

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.520
the old paradigm of, of the big pharma and having

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.810
these very large studies is going to shift towards running smaller

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.898
studies in targeted populations of people that have markers that.

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.290
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.568
&gt;&gt; That could indicate that the drug is going to work for them. So a

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:42.925
lot of that data can come out

00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:45.757
in early clinical trials or even pre-clinical trials.

00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:46.640
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.680
&gt;&gt; And it's just going to make it a much

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.090
more streamlined process to get those treatments out there.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.600
&gt;&gt; So tell us a bit more about your background. How did you get to be a

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.190
director of clinical operations. What did you study in

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.490
school, what did you do before you got here?

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah. so I have a bachelor's degree in biology. When I finished school, I

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.830
didn't really know what I wanted to do. I feel really lucky that I found

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.760
this this world of clinical studies. So I've, I

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.640
started out in a CRO, Contract Research Organization. So

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.200
these are companies that serve pharma companies by helping

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.335
to run the clinical trials. It's outsourced to that group.

00:07:25.335 --> 00:07:31.010
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. And so I I had my first job in, in a company like that, and from

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.250
there came into Biotech and Pharma and Diagnostics. And have found it to just be

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.920
a lot of fun. I like to solve problems.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.760
Right! So, it's, it's a great place to apply that.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like it's, it's a very

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.880
fun sort of problem solving or puzzle solving scenario.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.870
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.450
&gt;&gt; Tell me a bit more about the Methodology

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.980
of, of the study, how you set it up.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.880
&gt;&gt; So, in all studies we'll have a protocol. It's the

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.390
core of the study, it's the documents written before you even start.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.090
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.410
&gt;&gt; It has information

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.720
about the background of the clinical

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.540
question that's being asked. eligibility, so what

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.740
patients would be appropriate to enroll in

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.500
the trail. And then it has information

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.760
about things like the, every procedure that's going to happen and all the data

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.890
that's going to be captured. and finally,

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.110
it has a prospective data analysis plan.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.932
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:21.932 --> 00:08:25.051
&gt;&gt; So you know, when that data is available, how you're going to analyze it.

00:08:25.051 --> 00:08:26.070
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.630
&gt;&gt; All that's

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.150
important so that we're being really targeted, and

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.558
going after a clinical question that we've really

00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:34.530
thought through. So, yes, so once we have

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.240
the, the protocol complete, then that has to be

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.740
reviewed by an ethics board. So that's an

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.860
IRB, an Institutional Review Board, and they make

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.670
sure that the research is appropriate. So our

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:51.770
number one is protecting patients. that includes really pro,

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.750
not just protecting them from harm in the study, but also protecting

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.618
their privacy. So there's all kinds of HIPAA, the Health insurance. Oh gosh

00:08:59.618 --> 00:08:59.619
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:59.619 --> 00:08:59.622
Health In, Health Information Portability. Do you know, do you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:05.740
&gt;&gt; What HIPPA stands for?

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah and protection.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.059
&gt;&gt; And protection act, yeah.

00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:08.826
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:08.826 --> 00:09:09.696
&gt;&gt; Act, I think.

00:09:09.696 --> 00:09:10.574
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always get the.

00:09:10.574 --> 00:09:11.114
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:11.114 --> 00:09:11.892
[LAUGH]

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:16.692
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so so anyway, so there's all kinds of considerations that have

00:09:16.692 --> 00:09:21.425
to go into to, to that piece. With making sure that patients are protected.

00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:23.325
&gt;&gt; So in general you know let's, let's go

00:09:23.325 --> 00:09:25.500
back to sort of one of the examples you mentioned.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:25.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.050
&gt;&gt; You know for example that there is let's say a genetic marker in, in, in

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.270
an individual that says something about how they're

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.100
going to deal with this drug or that drug.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.130
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.686
&gt;&gt; Or something like that.

00:09:36.686 --> 00:09:39.170
when you go through your selection process

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.206
for the clinical trial, is that information,

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:46.691
I mean, how, how private is that information to, to you as you're trying to

00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:51.083
direct the clinical trial? Do you know the name of the individual, and you

00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:53.428
know exactly what genetic makeup they are

00:09:53.428 --> 00:09:56.270
that causes this, and then you, you know.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:56.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.970
&gt;&gt; You either use or don't use them?

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.110
&gt;&gt; Though it's a huge issue that the industry's really struggling with.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.230
we do everything we can to protect patient privacy, so when we are

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.760
looking at genetic information, it's de-identified. So,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.280
all of these identifying information is stripped.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.626
&gt;&gt; But that's challenging, because, what is identifying

00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:21.836
information and So, so it's been really an

00:10:21.836 --> 00:10:24.674
interesting thing to be part of this evolution

00:10:24.674 --> 00:10:28.238
in, in having more genetic information available, and trying

00:10:28.238 --> 00:10:30.152
to make sure at the same time that we

00:10:30.152 --> 00:10:33.918
protect patient's privacies as, as we go after these questions.

00:10:33.918 --> 00:10:38.447
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. so, yeah, de-identification is kind of at the core of,

00:10:38.447 --> 00:10:43.520
of how that would work. And we would as, in a role like

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.810
mine, I don't get patient names. There, there's a single de-identification step

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.130
that happens, where the patients become

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.690
a number. And then a second de-identification

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.170
step that happens where, with the genetic information.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.360
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.000
&gt;&gt; So, so Pete, we try, work really hard to protect patient confidentiality.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.950
&gt;&gt; What aside from the privacy issue, how is this sort of new

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.800
age of personal genetics and sort of the, the advance of, I guess,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.160
whole genome sequencing, whole genome information.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.120
How do you foresee that changing you,

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.340
the role that have you to go through in this sort of pre-selection or

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.550
selection process in in a clinical trial?

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.630
&gt;&gt; So the, the short answer is I don't know. But you can see so much

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:33.630
potential, Right? So there's this spit for science from 23andMe.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:33.991
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:39.860
&gt;&gt; So patients are self-selecting based on their, their history to participate

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.520
in that trial. And I can see a world where patients would look at their genetic

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.040
information and then be able to self-select into clinical trials based on,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.200
you know, the, the markers that they're seeing. We're not there yet,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.580
it's not happening yet, there are lots of ethical questions that have

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.250
to be addressed on that road, but, but I think it's really exciting.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.870
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like you really get to,

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.160
in, in your job, you really get to sort of

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.890
be exposed to a lot of ideas and subjects that

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.786
deal with genetics. But you also really get to sort

00:12:09.786 --> 00:12:13.210
of I, I guess I like the, the verb wallow, in

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:18.350
the, the ethics, too and really have to be concerned about procedure.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.620
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.570
&gt;&gt; You have to pay attention to detail.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:20.914
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:23.590
&gt;&gt; You got to sort of know technically what's going on, and,

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.840
but you've also got to be able to remember where you are

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.960
and what you're doing with regards to, ' kay, this is a

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.460
human study and these are all the things we have to go through.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.880
&gt;&gt; in general how would you

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.690
describe how difficult is this job do you think compared to other jobs, or?

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.600
&gt;&gt; It's difficult probably in a different

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.860
way then somebody who's actually crunching the data.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.330
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.720
&gt;&gt; We have to think through problems, like sometimes we'll have a

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.490
study that it's, it's well designed, it, it could yield great data, but

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:56.380
we just can't find the right subjects that want to join the study.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.980
So then a lot of effort goes into recruitment planning for the study.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.410
I've never worked on two studies that have the

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.260
same problems, they're always different, so. And then, you know,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.130
it builds on itself. You learn, okay, we gotta have

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:14.040
recruitment plans in place before we start the study. We've,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.330
we've gotta think through how we're going to ensure

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.860
quality data before we start the study. All of these

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.740
things that kind of become part of the methodology. But yeah,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.770
every study has its own issues, and the landscape changes.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.618
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:13:27.618 --> 00:13:30.130
&gt;&gt; So it's, it's interesting from that regard.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.218
I don't know if it's harder than any other

00:13:32.218 --> 00:13:32.508
[LAUGH]

00:13:32.508 --> 00:13:32.830
job.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:33.517
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:13:33.517 --> 00:13:34.479
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:36.255
&gt;&gt; What would you consider as probably your favorite moment

00:13:36.255 --> 00:13:37.840
so far in the kind of work you've done? Just

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.450
sort of, if you can describe like a, a great

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.082
moment or a really positive side of something you've experienced.

00:13:44.082 --> 00:13:46.390
Yeah, it's always exciting when you see something you've worked

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.610
on that's approved by the FDA. Early in my career,

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.562
I worked on a drug called Sutent. I've worked on

00:13:52.562 --> 00:13:57.410
a phase one study of Sutent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.720
and so when I saw that it was approved, I, that

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.799
was really exciting. I also worked on a drug called Pertuzumab.

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:03.250
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.938
&gt;&gt; that's called Perjeta, and it's approved

00:14:05.938 --> 00:14:09.710
for metastatic breast cancer. So that's been exciting,

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, wow! That's very impressive!

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.730
&gt;&gt; so they're just these little, you know, those

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.150
things happen. But of course, those drugs were approved many

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.990
years after I was done working on them. But

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.440
yeah. So you never know, when you're working on something,

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.650
where it's going. And you just deliver your little piece of the puzzle,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.360
and then other people take over. that's

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.470
both frustrating, and also kind of cool. But,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.420
because you can see in the end, looking back, oh yeah, this is

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.970
how the, the work I did on that, phase one or phase two study.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:36.430
&gt;&gt; It feels good.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, fit into the big picture. So, yeah.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.395
&gt;&gt; so equally, then.

00:14:42.395 --> 00:14:43.400
[COUGH].

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.604
Excuse me. What would you consider one of the, I guess,

00:14:46.604 --> 00:14:50.324
the hardest, or most frustrating aspects of your job that would be?

00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:53.422
&gt;&gt; I've also worked on studies that did not end well.

00:14:53.422 --> 00:14:54.310
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.673
&gt;&gt; Where we un-blinded data, and found that patients were being harmed.

00:14:56.673 --> 00:14:57.536
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:14:57.536 --> 00:14:59.310
&gt;&gt; Which is never a good thing. But I'll

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.490
say in, in that particular case the company and, and,

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.630
you know, the ClinOps group I was part of,

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.960
did a very nice job of immediately stopping the study.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.260
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.300
&gt;&gt; Notifying all of the physicians of the

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.160
problem and doing what we could to make sure

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.790
that the patients were no longer exposed to a

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.190
treatment that was not treating them, was hurting them.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.780
&gt;&gt; Right you know, I, I seem to remember in the

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.310
news, not that long ago, I only have a peripheral knowledge base.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.702
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:15:24.702 --> 00:15:27.262
&gt;&gt; Of certain clinical trials, but I, I do

00:15:27.262 --> 00:15:30.258
seem to remember one about statins that was a big.

00:15:30.258 --> 00:15:30.720
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.160
&gt;&gt; was a big study and apparently, I correct

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.200
me if I'm wrong here but like, if you, if you

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.480
know, but I think there was like a, a big benefit

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.560
to like people who are at risk for a heart attack

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.050
you know, if they were either on or off the Statin.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.370
&gt;&gt;

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.398
&gt;&gt; it really decreased their risk significantly

00:15:50.398 --> 00:15:52.462
and it became such an ethical impairment. It

00:15:52.462 --> 00:15:56.916
became so obvious so early in the clinical trial that this worked in this way.

00:15:56.916 --> 00:15:57.474
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:15:57.474 --> 00:15:59.256
&gt;&gt; That they stopped the trial early, and

00:15:59.256 --> 00:15:59.602
said.

00:15:59.602 --> 00:16:01.420
&gt;&gt; Right. And said, it's unethical.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.175
&gt;&gt; To continue.

00:16:02.175 --> 00:16:04.145
&gt;&gt; To not give the statin to everyone in this case.

00:16:04.145 --> 00:16:07.418
&gt;&gt; Yeah! That's a great story. it doesn't happen

00:16:07.418 --> 00:16:09.461
that often. And, I'm not familiar with that example.

00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:10.411
&gt;&gt; Sure, sure.

00:16:10.411 --> 00:16:11.220
&gt;&gt; but yeah, that's very cool

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.464
&gt;&gt; But what I think, what's nice is, I mean, you

00:16:13.464 --> 00:16:15.759
know, when we hear a story like that or others types of

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:19.144
stories, you're sort of a face behind all of that. Right? You

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:22.011
were in the process of planning that clinical op, that clinical trial.

00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:24.675
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and somebody in clinical operations

00:16:24.675 --> 00:16:27.411
was working very diligently to make sure that

00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:30.435
everybody was informed of the decision to stop the

00:16:30.435 --> 00:16:35.547
study, and that all of the you know, like I said, this is a very, in some ways,

00:16:35.547 --> 00:16:38.120
a very controlled methodology. So we would have

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.270
to like, let IRBs know that the study was

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.380
stopping, and, and make sure that all the, the

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.600
pieces were put in place to wrap it up.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.300
&gt;&gt; So how much of your job would you say is sort of, teamwork?

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.840
&gt;&gt; A lot

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.380
of it is teamwork. partnering with

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.430
physicians and researchers and colleagues doing the

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:01.510
same work I do. I I would work with people in a commercial organization.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:01.991
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:17:01.991 --> 00:17:03.510
&gt;&gt; of course there's the huge

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.680
financial components. You're working with people that

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.680
have budget responsibilities. Yeah, there's a lot

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.790
of team work that goes into it.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.280
&gt;&gt; Is there anything else you want to talk about related to clinical

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.510
operations or anything else that you think would be really interesting

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.240
or relevant to, you know, genetics or just the job itself?

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I think the what's interesting right now is the movement

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.200
towards personalized health care. I want to see

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.230
how this, how personalized genetics fit into that.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.400
so yeah, so I just think it's an interesting time to be in this field.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.950
&gt;&gt; If you, if somebody's watching you right now, and they're super

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.840
excited, they're like, wow that sounds like a really cool, kind of job.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.180
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.016
&gt;&gt; What advice would you give them to either learn more, or

00:17:50.016 --> 00:17:50.516
[COUGH].

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.870
What advice would you give them to learn more, or

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.700
to possibly, you know, become a clinical operations director themselves?

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.840
&gt;&gt; I think it's, I know it's a tough field to break into, because

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.350
lot of people are interested in, in getting into this type of a

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.114
field. So, I think it's really getting work experience. there are degrees, there

00:18:11.114 --> 00:18:15.272
are Masters degrees, and there are great programs, through, like, a UC Berkeley,

00:18:15.272 --> 00:18:19.114
or a UC Santa Cruz, that'll give you a certificate in clinical trial management.

00:18:19.114 --> 00:18:21.760
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. And, and those certificates are great.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.330
People learn all of the methodology behind how

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:29.120
to run the studies, but it really comes down to doing it and working on studies

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.280
which happen both in an academic and a

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.850
drug company, diagnostic company now, now personalized genetics

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.880
companies, so there's so many different places you

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.900
could get this experience. So I guess that

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.280
the main advice would be not to just focus on drug companies. To look across the

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.440
board for other places that are running studies

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.710
and, and see if there are opportunities there.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.030
&gt;&gt; Would you recommend anybody who's interested

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.360
to try to get work experience before school

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.450
experience in this? I think work experience is the foot

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.490
in the door that will help to land the job. Yeah.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.647
&gt;&gt; And what kind of work experience exactly?

00:19:02.647 --> 00:19:06.590
&gt;&gt; so, there are entry level positions running

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.990
clinical trials, they're, it's called a clinical trial associate.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.064
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:19:11.064 --> 00:19:15.842
&gt;&gt; but also background in a, in a physician's practice that

00:19:15.842 --> 00:19:19.450
are, where they're running studies is another great way to get exposure

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:24.940
to it. And yeah, I think that, that it's not,

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.680
a lot of people focus on getting into a drug company.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.110
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.400
&gt;&gt; And, I think that might be the wrong first step to take.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.610
It's definitely something to put on the list of things to do eventually,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.370
but just to break in and get the foot in the door working

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:43.280
in other capacities, it's probably easier to, to get that, land the first job.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.780
to carry out a job like yours,

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.250
they want somebody who's very knowledgeable, and I

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.423
mean, you gotta know the ins and the outs. And it sounds like you might

00:19:52.423 --> 00:19:55.585
gain that better by, like you say, you know, sort of getting your foot in

00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:58.898
the door. Maybe taking a lower level position

00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:02.140
on a clinical trial or clinical operations development.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.390
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.090
&gt;&gt; Program first.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.338
&gt;&gt; Right. I mean you have to be able, to interview for these bigger

00:20:05.338 --> 00:20:07.920
jobs, you have to be able to talk about the mistakes you've made. Right?

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.630
&gt;&gt; Mm, sure.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:09.565
&gt;&gt; And what you learned

00:20:09.565 --> 00:20:13.858
from those, which you can't get unless you're actually doing this work, so yeah.

00:20:13.858 --> 00:20:15.780
there, there are other angles to get

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.280
in than just going through the drug companies.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:18.760
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.335
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:19.335 --> 00:20:21.200
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much for joining us,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.434
and you know, wish you the best of luck

00:20:23.434 --> 00:20:25.557
&gt;&gt; Thank you,

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:26.350
&gt;&gt; Continuing your clinical operations.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.590
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
