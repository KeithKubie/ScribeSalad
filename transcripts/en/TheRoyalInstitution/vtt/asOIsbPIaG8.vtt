00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.379
To finish with I would like to show you
a measurement of a very short time

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.100
involving the time taken by a pistol
bullet to go between these two.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.580
Now my students here when they see this
series will think that I've chickened out

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.740
That I'm too worried to fire a
pistol in front of an audience on television

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.540
It isn't that at all, one of the most 
famous of physicists I've mentioned

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.110
Lord Kelvin used to demonstrate
an experiment in which as he

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.640
got older his sight became rather less good

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.040
And on one occasion he did miss the target

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.820
and it went clean through it was
an elephant gun he used,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.980
it went clean through and made
a hole in the backboard

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.600
of the lecturer next door.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.440
Lord Kelvin rushed in to see
what had happened,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.720
he found a white faced lecturer 
and the class promptly shouting

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.800
"Missed him, shoot him again Bill!"
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.660
Well we will do it by getting
Mr. Coates to fire the air rifle

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.400
I would like to have done this with a
pistol but public safety regulations forbid it,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.300
and so we have in fact done an
experiment when no one was here

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.440
with the pistol, and we can give
the answer for that too

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.540
but to demonstrate the method with the
slower velocity of an air rifle pellet

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.820
I'll ask mr. Coates to fire at the target once,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.760
We'll be very careful to try and fire on a line
parallel to the axis of course,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.860
like that.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.800
We've let the  motors rev up

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.840
[MOTORS WHIRRING]

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.180
[SHOT FIRED]

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.480
Then slow down.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.140
And then we can trace the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.420
bullet hole like that and you can see
that there is a big lag between the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.220
because this disk had moved all this way
round while the bullet was going across

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.080
now what we have to do is to measure
this angle.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.240
it's a bit complicated because
this protector was made for

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.120
the pistol which has a higher speed 
and therefore a smaller angle

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.160
and it only runs up to about 40 degrees
so we take the mark at 30

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:16.680
and then we move it round
to the 30 30 plus 14 so it's 44.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.200
- 54.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.160
- 30 plus 14, 44 so

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.280
and the speed we believe was,
well we measured it beforehand

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.960
as two thousand seven fifty was it?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.560
yes

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.580
twenty-two thousand 
five hundred centimeters a second

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.400
so dividing by roughly thirty
to get to feet per second

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.340
it's... what?

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.400
Around just between 750 and 800 feet
per second I think

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.080
If I've done the sums right

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.520
Now although this is very elementary
method it is very important one because

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.160
this was a way in which the speeds of
molecules was found,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.520
one could fire molecules
with a slit in the disk here

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.860
and find where they fell there.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.940
They gave molecular speeds
in this way and found

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.980
indeed that speeds of molecules
were in the order of

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.780
50 thousand centimeters a second

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.040
And also if you can imagine
this disc bent back on itself here

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.740
by sending light through the disc and
out to a distant mirror and bringing it back,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.500
this is in fact what Fizeau did to
determine the velocity of light

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.540
