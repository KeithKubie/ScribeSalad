00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.660
Well this is a very interesting and deeper

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.740
topical question.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.460
BRADY: If I put my hand in front of the beam at the Large Hadron Collider,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.620
(laughter)

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.900
what would happen to my hand?

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.840
PROF. BOWLEY: Don't know.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.480
Don't know.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.280
Don't know.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.220
PROF. COPELAND: Not a good idea.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.860
And wouldn't recommend it.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.540
And in fact, of course you can't.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.640
The beam is a hundred meters underground.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.400
PROF. BOWLEY: Well I really don't know. I mean you've got these things coming together

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.580
and you would have thought it'd be extremely dangerous.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.040
Somebody would yank you out of there before you could do that.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.060
PROF. EAVES: I th...

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.060
gosh ...

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.740
um ...

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.960
I don't think you'd feel very much.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.100
PROF. MERRIFIELD: That's a good question. "I don't know," is the answer.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.560
Probably be very bad for you.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.420
And they'd be very cross with you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.890
as well, I can say.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.780
PROF. MORIARTY: I don't know the total amount of energy that'd be distributed,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.100
and I don't know the energy density

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.460
PROF. COPELAND: The beam is sending protons in one direction,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.320
and of course there's a counter-beam going in the other direction.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.460
These protons are going to have an energy of the order,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.960
when it's reached its maximum,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.700
of order of 7 tera electronvolts.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.020
That's about the energy of a mosquito.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.460
So it's not a lot, right? It's of one proton.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.300
But the difference is this energy is like

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.540
concentrated into a volume a million million times smaller than the mosquito.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.180
So it's like a really sharp pin prick.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.520
But it's still only one proton.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.379
Unfortunately there are

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.060
something like 3000 bunches

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.160
going around the beam

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.680
around the accelerator.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.180
Each bunch has a hundred billion protons.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.980
PROF. EAVES: But by the scale of energies that we notice, it wouldn't

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.160
it wouldn't be that noticeable.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.080
I'd be ... interesting ... I'd ...

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.480
Would I put my hand in the beam?

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.320
I'm not sure about that.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.240
PROF. MORIARTY: 'cause the other thing, 'cause I've worked at synchrotrons

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.540
And the real problem with,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.380
if you're giving off synchrotron radiation

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.500
because you've got particles traveling very close to the speed of light,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.400
if they're accelerating then you're giving off synchrotron radiation.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.400
And synchrotron radiation is very nasty.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.580
PROF. COPELAND: When they collide them together there are something like 600 million collisions

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.580
per second.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.400
So there's a lot of collisions go on.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.340
The total energy stored in the beam,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.980
whereas the energy in the individual proton may not be very high,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.340
the total energy stored in that beam is about

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.600
300

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.020
mega joules.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.700
That's like the energy of an aircraft carrier moving at 11 knots.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.320
So now

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.020
that beam is going to come around.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.180
It's suddenly gonna hit your hand, or your body,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.800
however,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.220
whatever you put in. And it's got to deposit that energy.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.500
So it's like being hit by a massive object.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.260
And I don't think you'll survive very much.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.640
BRADY: Because it's just hitting such a small space

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.200
won't it just drill the ultimate hole through your hand?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.280
Why would it start affecting other parts of your body?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.300
PROF. COPELAND: And that's where I...

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.840
that's why I was hesitating of course at the beginning,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.900
'cause I don't really know

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.760
what will happen.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.200
When they collide

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.600
they

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.200
the beam has a ranges from a width of about a millimeter,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.340
down to a width of about

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.469
I think

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:02.249
um

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.289
like a fifth of a hair

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.580
hair's width, when they actually collide the beam.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.420
So they're really narrow when they collide them.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.800
When they're not being collided they're about a millimeter.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.140
So they're going to come in and crash in here.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.900
So I have thought maybe they'll just shoot through, but

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.660
but it seems to me that what's got to happen

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.380
is this energy is all got to be dumped.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.620
because it's now hitting a lot of matter.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.180
Normally it doesn't hit anything

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.100
it's a real, it's a

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.340
almost a total vacuum in in those things,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.960
in the accelerator ring.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.600
But now

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.560
there's this big high density region,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.020
and so all these particles, it seems to me, will just

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.320
hit in there and just start

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.140
bombing out. So that's why

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.400
I thought it might be a bit more dramatic

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.320
than a little pinprick going straight through you.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.620
PROF. EAVES: There's a vacuum there so that might have some unpleasant consequences

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.820
on the,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.960
on my hand,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.680
pressure

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.480
pressure change.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.880
But I don't think it would have a huge effect.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.240
BRADY: If there was a galaxy made completely out of antiparticles,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.380
would it behave the same way as ours?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.580
PROF. COPELAND: So the main thing that goes on in galaxies is gravitational

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.940
right? And gravity doesn't care whether you're a particle or an antiparticle,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.560
gravity cares about the fact you've got a mass.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.500
And so as far as gravity is concerned,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.560
as far as forming this antigalaxy if you like,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.960
I think that dynamics would be the same.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.700
With regard to the actual interactions,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.900
assuming that the antihydrogen can form,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.180
for example that's an antielectron and an antiproton,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.400
then I suppose the same basic processes can take place.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.520
They will emit light when they interact with one another

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.880
because the light is just an emission of energy.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.600
And as long as that's still taking place and energy is being lost

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.100
then you'll still have light.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.180
PROF. MERRIFIELD: The reason we know the universe doesn't have such galaxies in it

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.060
is that actually even the empty space between galaxies isn't completely empty.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.200
And so this galaxy would actually start interacting with its neighbors,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.500
and of course when the matter comes into contact with the antimatter,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.000
it would annihilate, there'd be a big burst of gamma rays.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.900
And the fact that we don't see a very large gamma ray background in the entire universe

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.620
tells us that the universe isn't actually full of antimatter galaxies as well as matter galaxies.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.860
BRADY: At the point when the universe came into existence

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.120
so did all the forces and physical constants

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.260
which affect the universe today.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.300
However if the universe was to come into existence again,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.900
like another Big Bang,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.260
would we have all the same forces and the same physical constants?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.500
PROF. MORIARTY: Ah, ok,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.820
so this is the sort of multiverse idea, and the fact that we have

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.840
we've got a wide range of different universes with different physical constants.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.640
PROF. COPELAND: Ooo, that's a good question.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.440
um ...

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.300
uh ...

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.940
PROF. MERRIFIELD: That's a difficult question to answer,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.240
'cause of course you can't do the experiment.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.020
You know physicists like to do an experiment

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.300
and we're not allowed to make universes,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.840
or at least we haven't figured out how to do it yet.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.900
PROF. EAVES: The idea now is that

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.040
little bubble universes can

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.540
can pop up everywhere.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.460
And it's thought that right in the early stages,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.040
the fundamental constants can be different.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.540
And the question then arises,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.980
what would it be like living in a universe

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.400
where the fundamental constant were different,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.220
where the mass of the electron is different,

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.020
or its charge,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.340
or Planck's constant were different, and so on.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.160
And this is a fascinating question.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.720
PROF. MERRIFIELD: So it's not clear, there's even

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.360
there are theories that actually say that the universe didn't come into being as a single universe.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.620
There's actually lots and lots of universes were created, a thing called the multiverse.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.940
And in some of them the kind of the laws of physics work, and in some of them they don't.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.480
And so the ones where the laws of physics work kind of thrive and take over.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.940
And so it could be that there may be other universes out there

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.420
that have very different laws of physics

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.120
different values for physical constants and so on.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.060
So it's ... but

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.020
but it's a sort of ...

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.320
again, it's sort of on the realms of philosophy rather than physics

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.700
because it's not something you can really do an  experiment to test.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.320
PROF. BOWLEY: (chuckles)

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.520
Would we get the same forces of physics?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.420
Now that's

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.600
that's really beyond anybody's imagination.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.590
PROF. MORIARTY: I think that the current understanding is,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.980
in terms of a multiverse situation at least,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.320
that there could be other universes with radically different physical constants.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.330
PROF. BOWLEY: I mean Dirac said that God thought that

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.980
God created the universe with beautiful mathematics.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.500
And you're asking the question,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.940
if He does it again, or She does it again,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.500
is it going to be the same mathematics,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.160
or is He going to twist it around in some way?

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.420
So I really don't know the answer to that question.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.200
I don't know that you could ever begin to answer that question.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.860
PROF. COPELAND: What we can't explain, even with

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.700
within the context of string theory at the moment,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.140
is the relative magnitude of those forces.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.400
We still don't know why

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.500
gravity is so weak compared, say, to electromagnetism. We

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.500
we can measure it

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.980
and we can understand in terms of the the constants,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.040
but we can't predict those constants.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.440
And the electric charge, why it's got value it has.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.040
The masses of the particles, why they have the values they have.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.120
So until we can do that

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.380
and definitively say, this comes from

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.480
this is a unique solution that can have no other values,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.200
then you can't say that if

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.540
if in a parallel universe it suddenly popped up

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.840
the universe popped up in it

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.040
that you would have all the same coupling.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.300
PROF. EAVES: But it turns out that

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.300
that we have to be very careful about how many of these constants

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.860
that we could imagine turning around.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.080
Because there are certain scenarios that if the constants were

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.140
very much different from what they are

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.820
we wouldn't be around to

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.780
to observe it.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.140
So certain values of the constants

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.880
are just not conducive to life, or

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.380
and certainly not to intelligent life.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.070
So for example,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.560
gravity has to be extremely extremely weak.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.620
BRADY: What would happen to the Earth

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.500
if one of the closest stars,

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.440
like Alpha Centauri is the example we were given,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.700
went supernova,

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.320
would the earth be protected by its magnetic field?

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.520
DR. BAUER: Alpha Centauri won't go supernova.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.800
(laughs)

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.400
If a close star went supernova, then there would be

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.540
radiation coming at all wavelengths.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.280
But

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.620
turns out our atmosphere does a very good job of

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.080
deflecting that radiation.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.080
I mean radiation comes from the Sun all the time

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.120
but we're not affected by right

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.820
by x rays, for instance.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.760
MEGHAN GRAY: Well this is a common doomsday scenario right?

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.780
Supernova explosions are some of the biggest

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.880
most catastrophic events that we know of in the universe.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.800
So it's very reasonable to say

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.360
"What would happen if one happened nearby?"

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.700
We know that the Sun will not go supernova.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.260
It's not the right type of star,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.500
it's not massive enough to go supernova.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.980
But maybe there are some stars in our neighborhood that might.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.200
We actually know that of the type of stars

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.660
that are likely to end their lives in a supernova,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.660
there aren't that many that are that nearby.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.400
So for something called a Type II supernova,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.320
which is when a star just gets really massive and blows itself up,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.350
one of the nearest candidates for that is actually the star Betelgeuse.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.960
It's a famous word, and it's also a famous star.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.640
It's actually the shoulder of Orion,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.960
one of the well known constellations.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.500
It's very red, and we know that it's actually

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.240
probably nearing the end of its life.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.320
Maybe not on the time scale of humans watching it,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.200
but it could be thousands,

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.880
it could be just millions of years away.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.200
DR. BAUER: Still, the main damage

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.860
we wouldn't get very much optical damage,

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.440
other than looking at it.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.220
So

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.900
if a star supernovas it'll get very bright

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.000
and it could affect our eyes,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.400
just as when you look at the Sun it will affect our eyes.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.030
MEGHAN: But even then,

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.080
Betelgeuse, which is about 400 light-years away,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.080
it's still too far away,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.460
luckily, to probably cause us enough damage.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.300
If it went it would be quite spectacular.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.240
We would probably see it with the naked eye in the daytime.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.140
That would be the visible light output.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.800
We'd have to worry about something like gamma ray radiation,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.940
but even then it's it's probably too far away,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.600
thankfully, to do much damage.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.160
BRADY: Do you have a favorite symbol and why?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.080
PROF. COPELAND: Oh, my favorite symbol?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.720
I don't know if we've done the favorite one yet.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.900
But my favorite symbol at the moment is probably

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.840
lambda, the cosmological constant,

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.260
because it's this enigmatic quantity

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.080
which could actually be driving the acceleration of the universe today.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.720
And no one knows why it's got the value it has.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.320
We should do

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.410
we should do a video on it.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.730
PROF. EAVES: Oh, the fine structure constant alpha,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.580
1 over 137.0599, my favorite.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.120
Look at our Sixty Symbols video on it,

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.460
on alpha.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.000
MEGHAN: I quite like the symbol for infinity

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.340
because it's a cool concept.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.280
It's a really hard thing to get your head around.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.800
But also it's just a nice symbol.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.480
And it kind of kind of packages

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.120
packages up what it means.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.500
You know you've got this infinite loop

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.200
that just keeps  going round and round and round,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.000
so it kind of does what it says on the tin.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.030
PROF. MERRIFIELD: I guess my favorite symbol is a slightly unusual one

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.860
which is a symbol called upsilon.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.180
Greek letter looks like a seagull,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.500
and it's used by astronomers

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.600
to measure the mass-to-light ratio of things,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.440
how much mass there is and how much light there is.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.640
BRADY: And you've discussed it on Sixty Symbols.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.060
PROF. MERRIFIELD: And we made a video, and

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.540
it's not one of the most popular ones I'm sad to relate, yes.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.680
DR. BAUER: I think my favorite symbol is the infinity symbol.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.700
I really like the concept of infinity.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.670
Even though I think about it a lot, it just

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.760
blows my mind every time.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.760
And I just like the little infinity,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.500
can just kind of go on forever.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.680
PROF. MORIARTY: So I guess aesthetically

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.420
or in terms of the background of the same,

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.300
but that's what the symbol actually means,

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.860
I guess those are two separate questions,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.320
aesthetically either psi, the pitchfork one,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.270
or big sigma, which is sort of this sort of

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.620
looks to me almost like a strange sort of Pac-Man type  thing.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.340
In terms of what the symbol means and related to my work,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.580
I guess it's gotta be Planck's constant.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.200
Largely because Planck's constant is fundamentally embedded

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.600
in quantum mechanics, the study of small things.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.600
PROF. BOWLEY: Well I've thought about this

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.700
and I will go for a "ket" ...

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.640
no, no for a "bra", because

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.400
Dirac invented this wonderful notation.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.220
There's something like that which he called a "bra",

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.160
and something like that which he called a "ket",

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.200
and the two together made a bra-ket,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.480
a bracket.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.900
And he was really proud of it

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.440
because this word "bra" is in the English dictionary.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.490
It is an actual word in English, and he invented it.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.200
And he's proud of it.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.280
He was proud of it because he was in the dictionary,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.520
not realizing it had other connotations.
