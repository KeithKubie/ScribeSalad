stock market would actually give them a
negative return and then you look into

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910
negative return and then you look into
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.680
negative return and then you look into
the question why that is the case it is

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
the question why that is the case it is
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.920

growth model driven so much by
investments and therefore yes earnings

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630
investments and therefore yes earnings
 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.680

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.900
and the capital base with which you
produce their earnings has been growing

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910
produce their earnings has been growing
 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.150

even faster because China has invested

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
even faster because China has invested
 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.640
even faster because China has invested
so much and therefore our o e or return

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650
so much and therefore our o e or return
 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.640
so much and therefore our o e or return
on capital and may be falling and if you

on capital and may be falling and if you
 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.490
on capital and may be falling and if you
don't understand it if you invest just

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500
don't understand it if you invest just
 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.410
don't understand it if you invest just
in economic growth you don't understand

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420
in economic growth you don't understand
 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.690
in economic growth you don't understand
that there's a bad economy with a lot of

overcapacity and there's a good economy
 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.630
overcapacity and there's a good economy
which is actually growing then you're

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640
which is actually growing then you're
 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.230
which is actually growing then you're
bound to make mistakes

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240
