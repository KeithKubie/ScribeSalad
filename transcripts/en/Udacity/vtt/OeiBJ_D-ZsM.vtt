00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.180
It's more likely that we would extract all the

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.200
author data from documents such as these. How would we

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.610
do that? Assuming this document was illustrative of the entire

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.660
biomed central schema, write a program that will use the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.870
element tree module to extract all the data for

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.780
a given research article. The data for each author should

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.320
be stored in a python dictionary, and all the dictionaries

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.190
should be stored in a list. By all the author

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.630
data, I mean all of the values stored here for each

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.710
one of the author tags in the author group that is part

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.880
of the front matter section. Now this is a lot like what

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.940
we did with CSV files, building python dictionaries to represent the data

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.050
we're extracting from, in this case XML files. Now, one thing to

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.070
keep in mind as you're doing this is that this is a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.360
lot like what we did with CSV data, building python dictionaries to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.230
represent the data we are extracting from. In this case XML files.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.400
One final point here is that you may ignore the

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.610
INSR tags, simply leave them out of your data processing
