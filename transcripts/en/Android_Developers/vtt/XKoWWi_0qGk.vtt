00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.380
RICH: Hey there.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.390
Welcome to this week's Android
Developer office hours.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.640
There was a glitch in the matrix
and it went ping twice.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.160
I'm joined here today by--

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.450
MATT: Matt Gaunt.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.690
NICK: Nick Butcher.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.420
RICH: And I'm Richard Hyndman.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.980
We're based in the London
office of Google.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.140
And we're here to take your
Android development questions,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.280
should you have any.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.100
So please join us in the Hangout
today, come along and

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.052
ask any Android relevant
questions you may have.

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:32.523
You can ask them in the
moderator, you can find that

00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:36.540
at developers.google.com/live,
or you can ask them on the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.480
comment thread to this
particular Hangout.

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:44.270
Maybe we'll just hang around for
a second, see if someone

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.170
joins us in the Hangout.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.420
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.560
NICK: It's always more fun
if you have some live

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.700
participants.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.750
Other than that it's--

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.779
MATT: It's the first time I
think I've ever done a Hangout

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:54.430
with you guys where it's just
been silent from the start.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.920
Too silent.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.210
NICK: Have we answered all
the Android development

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.700
questions there are?

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.150
MATT: Never in life.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.830
They're exhausted.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.981
RICH: Well let me see.

00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:03.231
Unfortunately clock--

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.110
Excellent.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.070
I'm going to open up the thread
for this Hangout and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.670
see if there's anyone
asking to join.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.250
Couple of views on YouTube.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.037
Maybe we should check the
YouTube comments.

00:01:20.037 --> 00:01:20.534
MATT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:23.250
RICH: That's really getting to
the bottom of the barrel when

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.990
we need to look for YouTube
comments for Android

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.580
development questions.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.060
NICK: That's a good point.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.690
We should say if you want to
ask questions and you don't

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.230
want to jump into the Hangout,
you're too shy, then feel free

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.930
to, as Rich says, either post on
the G+ thread where Android

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.635
developers says it's Hanging
out, you can post there, or

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:40.350
you can post comments on the
YouTube, or you can submit

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920
them to the moderator, which
you can find if you go to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.455
developers.google.com/live we
should be the top show on

00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:47.420
there saying live now.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.415
And you can post a comment
right there.

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:51.107
RICH: I may have mentioned
that already.

00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:52.420
MATT: It's fine, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.420
Now we are joined by Alex.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.160
RICH: Oh, we've got two people
in there, we've got Alex and--

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.410
MATT: Jerry McDowell.

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:02.125
RICH: Oh, we got Pete too.

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:03.030
MATT: Oh, and Dave.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.630
Oh, now we're taking off.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.875
RICH: People coming
into the right--

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:07.930
NICK: Welcome, [? how you ?]
doing.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.229
RICH: Rampant about
leadership.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.290
NICK: Do any of the people
who've just joined want to say

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.502
hello, introduce themselves,
and ask a question?

00:02:17.502 --> 00:02:20.790
ALEX: OK, I'm Alex.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.090
I did a few weeks ago did a
ticketing system on H2 Dev.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.358
I met Richard.

00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:27.120
RICH: Yeah, hey Alex.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.440
NICK: Oh cool.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.360
RICH: Did you get it working
on the Nexus 4?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.980
ALEX: I haven't got
any Nexus 4.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.380
RICH: No, I know--

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.936
ALEX: [INAUDIBLE] of an
era until I get one.

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:36.788
MATT: How's it going?

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:39.280
RICH: Thanks for joining
us today.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.600
ALEX: Well I have actually
a question on H2 Dev.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.040
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.830
around 30 devices linked into
one Google Play account.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.960
And we have sporadic sign-outs
on some of the devices.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.922
Is there a limit on the number
of active devices per account?

00:02:59.922 --> 00:03:02.890
RICH: Almost certainly.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.530
Here comes Giuseppe
with his echo on.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.820
You can hear straight out
of his microphone--

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.870
straight out of his speakers
back into his microphone.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.970
Yes, there is almost
certainly a limit.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.410
I've never come across
it myself.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.390
But if you're trying to share
one set of credentials with a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.910
large number of devices, I can
imagine there would be some

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.270
protection to stop that kind of
behavior, especially when

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.830
you're looking at paid
applications.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.750
ALEX: Yeah.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.230
I guess that for next
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.400
I'll need to find something
else, probably.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.860
RICH: One of the things that
works quite well is if you

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.680
have your own Google
Apps domain.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.420
You can create one for free
anyway, and you get 50 free

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.820
email accounts with that.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.330
I've seen people use that to
set up devices before.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.010
Because we're a bit more lenient
on Google Apps domain

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.000
because you're administering
the email accounts, not us.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.620
Whereas if you're using at
gmail.com addresses, it's us,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.240
it's Google that's administering
those accounts

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.350
so there's stricter guidelines
on them.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.120
ALEX: It was actually on an App
domain that the devices

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.437
were linked, and not
on a Gmail account.

00:04:02.437 --> 00:04:03.391
RICH: OK.

00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:05.530
Yeah, it's still
going to apply.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.840
That same limitation
would apply.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.830
But you could more easily create
a large number of email

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.070
addresses inside your own
domain, potentially, than you

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.590
would be able to
in our domain.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.020
ALEX: So we'll use different
email accounts

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.709
for X number of devices.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.010
RICH: I don't know if the real
names policy applies to people

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.240
inside their own domains.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.700
I imagine it don't know--

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.370
I guess it doesn't.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.690
Because you're not signing
up under conditions.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.980
It's your own administrators.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.385
MATT: Yeah, I wouldn't
have thought so--

00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:31.866
Why would--

00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:33.790
Yeah, Real Names wouldn't
affect it, would it?

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.271
RICH: I don't know.

00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:34.760
MATT: I don't think so.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.250
RICH: The account administrator
would have to.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.470
Anyway, I've certainly used that
approach before to try

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.690
and get round some of
these is issues.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.660
ALEX: Thanks.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.440
RICH: Not a problem at all.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.210
Hey, Giuseppe, good
to see you again.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.760
How you doing?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.120
GIUSEPPE: Hey.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.020
Good to see you as well again.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.800
How are you?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.090
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.480
RICH: Yeah, yeah, we're all
doing fine, thank you.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.710
Back from our travels in
Antwerp and Amsterdam.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.280
GIUSEPPE: I know.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.770
I watched all the
[? pictures. ?]

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.977
NICK: It feels like it
was since we've sat

00:05:01.977 --> 00:05:02.510
in this room, right?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.190
We've been on location
for a while?

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.170
Having crazy--

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.540
GIUSEPPE: I saw have very,
very short woman.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.120
There was not many,
many girls, right?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.840
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.880
I thought you saw
a short woman.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.840
I was like, what?

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.640
MATT: Yeah, where you going--

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.540
RICH: I saw a short
woman, yeah--

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.300
No, you're right. there weren't
many girls at DroidCon

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.260
Holland, I guess or--

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.571
NICK: Holland was a better
mix than some.

00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:29.062
GIUSEPPE: Yeah.

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.330
But the question is--

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.605
RICH: That's true.

00:05:30.605 --> 00:05:34.400
GIUSEPPE: The question is, there
was no girl because they

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.680
don't they care about Android,
or they don't they care about

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.208
the guys that was there?

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:42.660
Big question.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.750
RICH: We need to
ask that, yeah.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.180
NICK: I wish I knew
the answer.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.845
RICH: Tim Bray, he always does
in his Devoxx keynote each

00:05:47.845 --> 00:05:51.160
year, he just shouts at the
audience to employ more in

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.680
tech, and making it more
friendly for women in tech.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.748
he just has a complete rant .

00:05:56.748 --> 00:05:58.310
GIUSEPPE: I just waited
one week.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.676
Any chance to understand how
we can receive these

00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:02.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.840
directly into application?

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.970
NICK: I didn't hear that.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.620
MATT: I didn't.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.700
RICH: How to proceed with what
directly into application?

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.010
Yes,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.110
GIUSEPPE: I would like to
receive a Bluetooth file

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.880
directly into application.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.060
This was last question
of last week.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.495
RICH: He's got a good
point, it was.

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:23.810
But, I said last week you should
add into the moderator

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.180
for this week so we review it.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.920
But I don't see it there,
so it wasn't there.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.323
GIUSEPPE: I can put right
now if you want, or--

00:06:32.323 --> 00:06:34.910
RICH: I still don't
know how to do it.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.190
GIUSEPPE: [LAUGHING]

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.837
RICH: It doesn't change
the fact that I don't

00:06:36.837 --> 00:06:38.220
know how to do it.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.840
GIUSEPPE: I looked very well
through development papers and

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.960
I didn't find anything useful,
so I think that--

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.140
or there is no solution to get
the Bluetooth directly into

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.270
the app, or we must find
something [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.580
or group [? mirror. ?]

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.220
I used some [? root ?] code
from Motorola open source.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.640
They had some Bluetooth
[? adaptive ?].

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.180
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:14.790
But starting with 4.1,
I cannot anymore open

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.580
Bluetooth device.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.600
So the Bluetooth
[? adaptive ?]

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.290
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.680
is just a [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.220
cannot get it anymore
starting with 4.1.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.760
MATT: So what was the problem
with opening up a sub-kit and

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.938
getting the information
through that?

00:07:37.938 --> 00:07:38.770
Is that a problem?

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.713
RICH: I guess he wants to use
Bluetooth file transfer

00:07:41.713 --> 00:07:44.830
protocol so any other
application on any device can

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.150
send it without having
to be his

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.290
application on another device.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.550
MATT: Yeah.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.310
RICH: I know-- yeah,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.744
MATT: Yeah.

00:07:51.744 --> 00:07:52.980
That's my [? inexperience-- ?]

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.090
RICH: I don't know if the
foreground activity can

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.160
override Bluetooth file
handling or not.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.430
And I didn't check out because
it wasn't on the moderator and

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.550
I totally forgot.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.980
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.350
I will put in the moderator
for next one?

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.060
RICH: All I'm going to do is
look in the same places that

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.330
your developers would
look in, right?

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.610
I'm just going straight to the
Android developer documents

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.416
and Stack Overflow then repeat
which I find to you.

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:19.010
It may be quicker to search
those sources yourself.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.260
GIUSEPPE: You know very well how
Stack Overflow will work.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.970
If there is no answer your
question is left alone.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.700
No one--

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.950
anyone suggests.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.050
RICH: You know, there's quite
a few Android engineers that

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.840
answer questions directly on
Stack Overflow though.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.620
And members of our
team as well.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.440
GIUSEPPE: So you
are [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.740
the question, then.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.080
RICH: Yeah.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.700
Absolutely.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.120
Yeah.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.690
GIUSEPPE: I will do that.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.179
Thank you.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.200
RICH: Put it on Stack Overflow
in case the answer is there

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.320
already, of course.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.660
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.890
Thanks.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.620
NICK: It does that
for you, right?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.280
When you're trying to place
the question it

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.160
says, did you mean?

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.390
RICH: I don't know--

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.790
NICK: Has someone else already
asked that question?

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.480
GIUSEPPE: No, someone, somebody
else saying to you,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.705
paste your code here.

00:08:57.705 --> 00:08:59.570
But what code?

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.850
[INAUDIBLE] the writing.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.520
RICH: Excellent.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.320
Yeah, sorry, we totally
forgot about that.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.130
Does anybody else from the
Hangout have any questions

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.215
before we jump into the first
one from the moderator today?

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:15.907
JUSTIN: Oh, I have a question.

00:09:15.907 --> 00:09:17.338
RICH: Hi there.

00:09:17.338 --> 00:09:19.246
MATT: Justin, is it?

00:09:19.246 --> 00:09:20.200
RICH: Who said that?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.608
Did he say that?

00:09:21.608 --> 00:09:22.496
MATT: Yeah, Justin.

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:22.940
RICH: Go ahead.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.340
Shoot.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:30.530
JUSTIN: So my question is
actually Bluetooth related and

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.780
it is, the Google music gap is
somehow getting information

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:41.310
over like ABCRP 1.3, I think it
is and so users are able to

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.280
see artists and albums
on a car stereo.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.130
That's excellent.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.210
And so, I'd like to be able to
do the same thing, and one or

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.910
two other apps are also doing
it, but I can't find any

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.500
documentation, and
also can't find

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.800
anything on Stack Overflow.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.100
It's like a hidden
secret right now.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.090
NICK: Source code?

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.240
RICH: I was going to say, just
look at the source code for

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.240
the music app?

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.660
JUSTIN: You can get source
code to Google music?

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.820
RICH: It should under
the packages of

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.500
the open source project.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.970
JUSTIN: I think you can get the
source code for the old

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.306
music app but not like Google
music that streams music.

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:20.772
RICH: Fair enough.

00:10:20.772 --> 00:10:21.780
No, It's possible.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.350
NICK: Yeah, I think that's
right, actually.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.040
The old one's in--

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.590
RICH: OSP's got the old one?

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.602
NICK: [INAUDIBLE] music is the
old version, before it went

00:10:29.602 --> 00:10:31.440
Google Music, [? now it's ?]
just Music.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.006
RICH: Yeah, so it's possible
that those guys aren't using--

00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:38.256
[? [LOUD AIRPLANE NOISE] ?]

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:40.940
Ah, mute.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.640
It's possible that those guys
aren't using the high level

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.210
Bluetooth APIs.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.230
They may well be doing it using
the NDK or something,

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.180
opening Bluetooth connections
and sending the data across.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.710
I don't know.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.040
I haven't seen any high level
Bluetooth APIs for doing

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.130
anything like that.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.746
JUSTIN: OK.

00:10:58.746 --> 00:11:03.376
So I should just post
to Stack Overflow?

00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:05.425
RICH: Yeah, if no-one has
already written an

00:11:05.425 --> 00:11:07.410
implementation which can do what
you want, it may be quite

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.886
tricky to write that.

00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:12.380
MATT: I guess if you also get
then someone who might have

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.180
more experience at different
level Bluetooth or various

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.370
things on other sides of it
might be able to guide you and

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.060
might look for the answer.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.070
It may not be a case you get the
answer, but people might

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.470
be able to guide you, just
[? germinate, ?] start

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.630
thinking about it, looking about
it, other examples that

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.740
may be relevant.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.381
RICH: Over the last three weeks,
we've had quite a lot

00:11:29.381 --> 00:11:31.110
of Bluetooth questions
coming up now.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.720
So--

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.050
NICK: Didn't you promise
to set up a

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.070
Bluetooth focused Hangout?

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.580
RICH: I think promise is
a little bit strong.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.804
MATT: Submitted?

00:11:36.804 --> 00:11:38.800
RICH: Submitted, suggested?

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.620
Suggested that one
of us do it?

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.690
MATT: Threw it out there.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:42.985
RICH: On our--

00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:45.190
NICK: List of demands.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.700
RICH: It does seem to be--

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.745
something that we're either
lacking documentation on or

00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:50.460
something that we should
have a show

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.760
specifically dedicated to.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.370
We'll keep in a stronger
suggestion of getting that put

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.800
together in the near future.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.540
I know that we're traveling
again quite a lot until

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.970
Christmas so it's going to be
tricky, but it's going to have

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.270
to go to the top of the list
of things to focus on.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.410
Is either more Bluetooth
documentation or just more

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.860
information about
it generally.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.270
NICK: OK.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.786
Well looking in the comment
thread here on the G+ post,

00:12:14.786 --> 00:12:16.750
there's a couple questions
coming in.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.160
I guess we didn't really cover
off our normal disclaimer at

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160
the top of the show.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.920
RICH: Oh, [? stop me-- ?]

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.420
MATT: Is somebody asking
for a road map?

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.330
NICK: So, yeah, again this is
really focused on Android

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.100
development and chatting about
how to develop Android apps.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.350
And we're not going to be able
to answer questions such as

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.410
when is Google Now coming
to Argentina?

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.826
Unfortunately we're not going to
be able to make those kind

00:12:34.826 --> 00:12:36.290
of pronouncements.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.115
And someone else's asking when
he's going to get an update,

00:12:39.115 --> 00:12:43.160
to his Galaxy Nexus, again, I
don't know, is the answer.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.630
I know it's rolling
out slowly.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.890
Just keep on mashing that Check
For Updates button and

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.520
see what happens.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.075
There is one question which is,
Thomas asks if we're going

00:12:52.075 --> 00:12:54.160
to bring back a pragmatic
way to switch

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.750
flight mode on and off.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.300
It's an interesting question,
because this is one of the

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.480
changes I think we covered
briefly last week, in fact.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.120
Where with the changes to
[INAUDIBLE] the introducing

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.380
multi users, we moved some of
the settings into a global

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.860
settings, [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.220
device rather than a user
specific setting.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.650
One of which was the setting
for flight mode.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.990
So I'm going to take a bit of
issue with the question where

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.230
it says will we bring back a
pragmatic API for turning off

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.030
flight mode.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.870
I would actually argue that
there never was a pragmatic

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.840
API, explicit API, for turning
on and off flight mode.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.160
People worked out how to poke a
value into a settings table

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.810
and do something else for it to
take effect, but that was

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.540
never actually a documented
API, I'd say.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.520
People kind of working out
how to do it isn't

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.110
really the same thing.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.190
I'd say when we have an actual
API, like a connectivity

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.250
manager dot whatever, that's a
commitment for us to support

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.290
and say this is how you
do such a thing.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.850
so I think that's why we kind of
felt able to move where it

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.070
was and perhaps some
applications may no longer be

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.610
able to turn off flight mode,
that's just the way it is.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:10.130
So that's the long answer saying
that yeah, we're not

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.382
going to bring it back
because it never

00:14:11.382 --> 00:14:12.460
really kind of existed.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.910
But the second part of this
question asks is there a way

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.440
to ask for such improvements?

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.630
And the answer is yes.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.240
So if you go to b.android.com,
which is where you have

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.980
details on how to file bugs on
the Android platform, you can

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.040
file a bug with a type
feature request.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.090
And log a feature request.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.410
It may sound like you're
shouting into a black hole,

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.380
but we do actually
read every single

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.040
bug and feature request.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.470
We may not have time to respond
to all of them and

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.500
comments and get into
discussions, but we do

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.670
certainly read them all.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.100
Or the Android core, Android
[INAUDIBLE] team and product

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.640
managers read them
all and factor

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.430
them into next releases.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.630
So, yeah, there is definitely
log your feature request there

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.450
or search if there's an existing
one and get people to

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.400
star it to show how much
people want it.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.270
RICH: Absolutely.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.280
And for applications that were
setting flight mode,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.230
definitely they should be
sending users now directly to

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.800
the setting screen for that.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.130
The network settings screen.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.770
I know that quite a lot of the
home screen widgets have

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.400
already done that update.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.130
So pressing that widget now
just goes there instead.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.460
The issue is of course for those
applications that set it

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.065
automatically, Yeah.

00:15:17.065 --> 00:15:18.660
It's a bit tough for them.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.695
There won't be a way
of doing that.

00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:23.740
Yes, Giuseppe, you can ask
questions about the Developer

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.740
Play console.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.380
GIUSEPPE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.810
probably already famous, but I
would like to hear from you

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:33.940
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.130
what, and especially I want--

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.250
NICK: Giuseppe, we're having
some trouble hearing you.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.520
Can you perhaps move your
microphone a bit closer to

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.410
your mouth?

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.970
GIUSEPPE: Yeah.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.890
Now, better?

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.580
NICK: Yeah--ish.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.740
GIUSEPPE: Let me see.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.035
OK.

00:15:48.035 --> 00:15:49.190
I'm want [INAUDIBLE]
microphone--

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.140
RICH: The microphone's on
your headset, right?

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.165
GIUSEPPE: You like now?

00:15:53.165 --> 00:15:54.440
RICH: Oh, hello.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.490
GIUSEPPE: OK, very good.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.930
Sorry.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.690
I was using another
microphone.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.660
Anyway, I would like to know
about the search and the

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.270
position criteria.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.470
Let me make an example.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.800
I have an application that
the name is Giuseppe.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.980
OK, Giuseppe.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.840
If I search in the toolbar, I
search Giuseppe, I find the

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.760
first page with other
applications that have some

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.760
Giuseppe word inside of the
description and in the second

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.265
page I find my application that
have Giuseppe as name.

00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:29.630
NICK: Uh-huh.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.340
Correct

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.170
GIUSEPPE: So the criteria of
their search I think is all

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.910
wrong or something's
not working well.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.955
And second the position.

00:16:38.955 --> 00:16:45.970
How is it possible that in the
same category, there are from

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.710
the first to the 10 position,
there are applications that

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:57.320
have very low downloads, very
low review range, but they are

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.440
in the first 10 position,
and my application that

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.460
has every day good--

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:02.850
RICH: Yeah, yeah, we--

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:03.500
GIUSEPPE: Rating.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.599
Everyday, yeah what is it?

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:10.576
And just to finish, what this
is review now with,

00:17:10.576 --> 00:17:12.829
a Google user say?

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:13.550
A Google user.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:18.589
We don't see any more the
name of the user.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:22.369
Last week we were able to find
the name and to try to

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:25.650
understand what is the problem
and to reply to the user.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.470
But now we really lost the
contact with the user.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.880
So we are going to not get any
more any chance to reply to

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.270
these review?

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.880
RICH: You know, you will.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.180
Calm down.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.140
It's OK.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.600
It's getting better,
not worse.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.540
So the first one, obviously we
don't really comment on search

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.460
algorithms, things like that.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.250
But the search algorithms
are based on a

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.630
huge number of criteria.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.720
They are there to produce,
en masse, the best

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.430
results for the users.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.610
It may not be the best results
for when you're searching for

00:17:53.610 --> 00:18:01.270
your own personal application,
it's an iterated algorithm to

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.030
provide good results for
users in search.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.730
NICK: And just like our Google
search, we don't go into the

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.830
exact details of which factors
contribute to it.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.080
I mean that's kind of our secret
sauce, and also it'd

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.910
probably be wrong, because it's
changing every single

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.320
day, and we're always tweaking
these algorithms trying to

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.310
produce the best possible
search results.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.170
So we're not going to be
able to go into that.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.780
RICH: You'll find things in
there related to rate of

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.250
change as well as just
fixed values.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.790
the same when we're
ranking things.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.980
The rate of change of things
inside the application.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.050
and of the ratings, and the
number of installs, number of

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.360
uninstalls, all those sort of
things can affect it and the

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.411
rate of change of those things
can affect it as well.

00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:43.840
GIUSEPPE: Hm.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.600
RICH: As we say those things,
we're trying to search through

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.900
almost 3/4 of a million
applications and surface the

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.142
right one for your search term,
and the search team are

00:18:54.142 --> 00:18:56.210
constantly iterating
that algorithm.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.500
like the web search as well,
some people it benefits, some

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.130
people it doesn't, and they try
and make a good balance.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.300
The same goes for the category
rankings as well.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.440
NICK: I think it's doing
the right job.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.700
Just because it's the exact
match for the title doesn't

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.790
mean it's the best match
for the search term.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.880
RICH: I could very easily spam
the search results just by

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.390
putting exact matches for--

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.290
for car in there and hopefully
my app would go to the top.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.680
But actually, it should be at
the very, very bottom at

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.675
700,000 until it has some
traffic and some

00:19:21.675 --> 00:19:22.510
reviews and so on.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.730
I know it's not ideal
for some people.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.380
It works very well for
a lot of people.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.380
GIUSEPPE: Which of you know the
name of the application?

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.250
I will not say here because
it's not correct.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.470
RICH: Yeah, of course.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.910
GIUSEPPE: But if you try to
make the research on the

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.150
Google Play market, you will
understand what I mean.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.420
You will see many, many, many
applications that have nothing

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.730
to do with this name, and my
application is just in the

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.400
second and this for me
is very strange.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.480
It's like I'm looking for
someone that is named Richard,

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.730
Google and he'd return
to me Thomas.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.770
That's it.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:01.810
RICH: I see it down there.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.520
The issue with that is almost
the second word of the

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.415
application name.

00:20:05.415 --> 00:20:06.215
NICK: Yeah, it's a very--

00:20:06.215 --> 00:20:06.530
RICH: It's too generic--

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.480
NICK: Very, very common word.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.010
RICH: It's matching that
second word, the word--

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.794
GIUSEPPE: No, it's pretty
common words, but both

00:20:13.794 --> 00:20:16.710
together, only mine.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.300
The two words together,
just mine.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.820
RICH: If I put quotes around
the two words of the

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.350
application name--

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.840
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, but quotes is
for professional searcher--

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.480
RICH: No but the rest of it--

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.720
GIUSEPPE: Not for
people people.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.320
RICH: I mean, search is done
by individual words.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.650
And you can't hope to come in
the top for the word "pro",

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.525
unless you're--

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:34.950
NICK: I'd consider changing
the name.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.500
MATT: Yeah, I've had this in
one of my apps where I had

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.350
loads of people who had
kind of phony apps.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.475
So eventually the Play team
kind of adjusted things.

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:44.004
And I just made sure that all I
did was just make sure I had

00:20:44.004 --> 00:20:46.360
a good description, had
a good title, and

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.430
everything made sense.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.320
Beyond that I just left it.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.890
And eventually my app just
kind of filtered its

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.132
way up to the top.

00:20:52.132 --> 00:20:54.832
But I did notice that the Play
team, they were adjusting it,

00:20:54.832 --> 00:20:56.880
and changing the algorithm--

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.320
I don't think there's anything
you can do to force it, just

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.630
do what is right and just
stick with that.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.950
And like you say, pro is
kind of a generic term.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.100
It is a bit bad.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.390
RICH: Yeah, obviously we're
not going to be able to

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.760
influence that algorithm.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.420
We can let the team
know, but--

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.890
and then regarding
the reviews, yes?

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.690
Previously, anyone could
type any name they

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.350
wanted into that box.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.730
And they were unverified.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.830
So I could go in and put
Giuseppe [? Bocelli ?]

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.120
in, as the reviewer and say
whatever I wanted about your

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.170
application.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.400
So now we've put all those just
down to a Google user,

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.350
and all reviews from now on
are verified against the

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.230
Google+ account.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.233
So from now on, you'll be able
to see exactly who reviewed it

00:21:38.233 --> 00:21:41.190
and it'll be verified against
that Google account.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.950
Their real identity that
they're logged in with.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.995
NICK: It should be better for
conversations, going back to

00:21:45.995 --> 00:21:46.930
what he says.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.140
RICH: So you'll see--

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.260
GIUSEPPE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.260
RICH: The latest reviews--

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.800
GIUSEPPE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.790
MATT: I missed that--

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.140
GIUSEPPE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.470
[? verificate ?] what
will happen?

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:56.660
We will see the name?

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.412
RICH: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:21:57.412 --> 00:21:58.510
GIUSEPPE: Or we will see--

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.460
NICK: You can already
see it, actually.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.720
If you go to some popular apps
and sort the reviews by newest

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.540
first, say since this
change happened,

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.290
you'll see this result.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.580
So you'll see the real people
and their G+ profile pictures

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.070
pulled in even, so yeah, it's
forming a real conversation

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.970
with a real person.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.740
RICH: So in the review section,
you have to go and

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.620
see "See All", and then it
brings up a page of all the

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.550
reviews, and then there's a
filter the top where you can

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.580
say newest first, and on there
you'll see them starting to

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.290
come in with real
people's names,

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.980
verified accounts on them.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.030
Verified identities.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.905
Best to go for an application
that's getting thousands of

00:22:31.905 --> 00:22:34.140
reviews everyday and you'll see
them all with real names

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.560
and photographs next
to them as well.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.345
The G+ profile photo will appear
next to it as well.

00:22:40.345 --> 00:22:41.160
GIUSEPPE: Oh, yes.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.470
That's very good now.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.120
RICH: It was just a--

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.880
NICK: So worry not.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.480
It's getting better.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.085
RICH: It's getting better but
we have to do that before--

00:22:47.085 --> 00:22:48.824
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, it's getting
better, yeah.

00:22:48.824 --> 00:22:51.270
Do you think that in the future
there would be any

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.100
chance to reply [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.320
review?

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.330
RICH: Yeah, I'd hope so.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.840
it is in trial at the moment.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.460
Still in this trial phase.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.550
Trying to figure out how people
best use that feature

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.080
and make sure it's not
used for the wrong--

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.250
NICK: What I'm excited about
is when you remove the

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.210
anonymity of just being able to
put any name then there's

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.130
less useless comments
or hateful stuff.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.480
people are a bit more considered
in their comments,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.510
I feel, when it's your
name and photo.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.170
So hopefully it increases
the quality of

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.890
the discourse.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.940
GIUSEPPE: Correct.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.210
Yes.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.020
RICH: And following through,
hopefully the quality of the

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.970
applications because you can
really trust those reviews.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.910
Welcome to everybody else that
has just joined us in the

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.300
Hangout, including Yossi.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.633
Good to see you back
on again there.

00:23:35.633 --> 00:23:37.020
What have you got in your lower
third today, Yossi?

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.670
Say something so I can see it.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.990
NICK: I think you're
muted right now.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.880
YOSSI: Hi guys.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.962
RICH: There we go.

00:23:44.962 --> 00:23:45.650
Yossi.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.220
OK.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.220
Sometimes you can't find
your stuff down there.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.200
NICK: Proud father.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.160
RICH: Yeah.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.040
It's on my--

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.630
YOSSI: Still proud father today
and for the rest of my

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.040
life, also.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.010
RICH: OK.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:58.360
Does anyone in the Hangout--

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.060
anyone else in the Hangout
have a question, before--

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.380
PATRICK: Yeah, guys,
I've got one.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.570
This is Patrick.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.750
I have a question on the Android
emulator on Mac.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.130
Ever since updating the SDK,
if you close the Android

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.640
emulator on a secondary monitor,
you can't restart it.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.740
It'll crash every time.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:22.510
And you have to edit the
emuatoruser.ini to change the

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.152
window position so it's back
on the primary monitor.

00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:27.850
RICH: Thank you very much.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.930
PATRICK: It's really kind of
painful for my workflow

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.460
because I have three screens.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.840
And I typically have
the emulator

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.850
off the primary monitor--

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.330
RICH: The good news about
this is the Tools

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.130
team is super reactive.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.150
And if you go to
tools.android.com, you can

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.910
file a bug there and they will
read it the same day.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:49.010
NICK: Or probably place it
to ADT-Dev, actually.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.510
Quickest way.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.780
RICH: OK.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.973
PATRICK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:51.973 --> 00:24:54.310
NICK: Yeah, if you search for
the Google Group called ADT

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.950
dash Dev, that's Android
Developer Tools Dev,

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.670
PATRICK: OK.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.230
NICK: Post it in there, and
I'm sure they'll see it.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.480
RICH: Post any information you
have on there, and they'll get

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.690
it sorted out as soon
as possible.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.380
I do run a similar
system here.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.557
I haven't tested that use case
so I'll test it out myself

00:25:09.557 --> 00:25:11.540
after the Hangout as well.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:11.950
PATRICK: OK.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:12.420
Thanks.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.920
I'll give that a try.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.770
RICH: Thanks very
much, though.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:19.480
Really good to hear
that feedback.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.950
Anything happening in
the comments thread?

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.570
NICK: There's one question here
in the comments thread

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.350
from Alex, who asks if there
are any Miracast dongles

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.560
available yet.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.428
Not that I know of.

00:25:32.428 --> 00:25:32.906
[LOUD TYPING]

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:34.760
Miracast is very early days.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.760
It's only been ratified as a
standard very, very recently

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.240
we're kind of getting--
everyone's super excited.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.040
I'm really excited to try it.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.700
I haven't even tried out one
of these dongles yet.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.310
RICH: Yeah, there was one on
Amazon in the states- there

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.620
was one on Amazon US that said
that it supports both the

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.870
Intel and Miracast standard.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.850
But no one here is--

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.830
I haven't seen it yet.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.160
MATT: There's a couple of
questions after that one

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.350
that's just come in.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:02.520
RICH: Uh-huh.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.190
MATT: So Dmitri asks--

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.440
so basically, he's trying
to access the list

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.460
of files on an ADB.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.790
In the sense that he's using
the method environment.get

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.850
external storage directly,
and then on that

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.850
calling list files.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.590
And he's saying on an ADB that
will return no, whereas on a

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.340
device it returns
as documented.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.540
And he's doing a check to see
whether the media is actually

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.260
mounted as well.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.070
NICK: Theres no files on
the SD card on the ADB?

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.295
MATT: Yeah, that's what I'm
wondering, either it's not

00:26:32.295 --> 00:26:35.300
actually mounted, or it
could just be empty.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.830
Double check.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.620
NICK: So one way would be to,
in DDMS you can actually

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.372
explore the SD card, right?

00:26:41.372 --> 00:26:42.770
Of the emulator.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.400
[? What of ?] checking to see
if there are actually files,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.994
or just create a file and
see what it lists?

00:26:47.994 --> 00:26:49.930
MATT: All context.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.530
And then there's another
one from Tim Rose.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.770
Question about HTTP client
versus HTTP URL connection.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:00.140
Note, blog entry from 2011
states HTTP URL connection

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.430
should be preferred
above Android 2.3.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.690
Just had a discussion in
#android-dev on Freenode

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.720
that's about that.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.180
HTTP URL connections seems
from Android 4.0 to have

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.430
several bugs too.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.270
what's the current

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.800
recommendation about those two?

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.560
HTTP client's offers
some features HTTP

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.650
URL connection doesn't.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.380
HTTP custom HTTP methods are
acceptable to use or should it

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.630
be avoided?

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.900
So I guess it's which one?

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.245
NICK: The general advice is from
2.3 onwards, so that's

00:27:35.245 --> 00:27:37.990
from Gingerbread onwards, to
use URL connection because

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.140
that's the one which is
receiving active developments

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.390
and productization.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.450
You're very echoey.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.480
You might have to--

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.100
KENTON: Done.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:50.970
NICK: You've got headphones.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:51.560
Cheers.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.440
OK.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.620
So the current advice
is-- that's

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.020
still the correct advice.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.450
All the work is going on in URL
connections so things like

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.660
response caches and so on
are getting added to URL

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.780
connection, not actively worked
on in HTTP client.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.830
But then again, HTTP client is
a very, very rich and well

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.870
tested library from Apache.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.810
So it does offer a plethora of
options which I guess haven't

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:14.570
quite made it into URL
connection yet.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.830
So if there's something super
specific that URL connection

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.800
doesn't offer yet, I consider
it completely valid to use

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.600
HTTP client.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.240
I would say for, above
Gingerbread, use URL

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.450
connection where possible unless
you can't help-- it's

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.950
[INAUDIBLE] case that
isn't covered yet.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.390
MATT: Good advice.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.690
I completely agree, I think.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.520
I've probably used both of them,
and it's just completely

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.440
dependent on what
I needed to do.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.970
RICH: David Chandler is our web

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.390
the Android developer
relations team.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.980
So if you look for David
Chandler on Google+, he may be

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.440
able to provide more insights
into any specifics as well.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.832
NICK: And he also created a kind
of HTTP library, didn't

00:28:57.832 --> 00:29:01.340
he, which kind of sits above the
two and we'll do the right

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.270
thing and above nine it will use
URL connection and below

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.237
use client and have an
abstraction layer on top of

00:29:06.237 --> 00:29:08.650
the two, so take a look
for that as well.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:13.740
Rich is feverishly Googling for
it to post a link of as a

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.660

got any questions?

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:26.650

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.010
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.260
NICK: We got it.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.700
Ninja hand.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.710
GIUSEPPE: You got it?

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.240
I would like to see
if you got it.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.039
I would like to see.

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:05.570
MATT: If he caught it
or if it smashed.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.630
YOSSI: Can you hear me now?

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.468
RICH: Yes, hey Yossi,
sounds good.

00:30:08.468 --> 00:30:09.830
YOSSI: I have a question.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:13.610
RICH: No, go right ahead.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:16.950
YOSSI: My question
is about loaders.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:24.970
Since API 11, basically loaders
were added to simplify

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.870
the use and not use
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:35.110
or whatever, and use loaders
to fetch all the data.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:40.180
and then the lower level will
handle all the configuration

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.600
changes for us.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.640
But basically, if I have only
one entry point for data, say

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:52.940
I'll do an IM client, OK?

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:53.680
Not [? over. ?]

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.930
I'm saying--

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.990
OK, tell you what.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.680
Another thing.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.170
I'll do a phone dialer
app, OK?

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:07.690
But all the contacts
are on the server.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.180
So basically on the first login,
I'll fetch all the data

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.840
once and then I'll just store
that on the device or in

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.950
database or in memory and
basically do all the

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.790
manipulations on it.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:30.850
So how loaders can help me or
save me time because I still

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:38.300
need to use adapters for the
list view or basically switch

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.930
all the data from cursor
adapters to the list view and

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:46.760
loaders is just another way
to fetch the data, right?

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.580
Or is it more than
meets the eye?

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.580
NICK: No, that's
exactly right.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.620
It's an alternative to just
doing your own query on the

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.790
content resolver.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:59.160
But it's a bit smarter.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:07.000
YOSSI: So basically I don't
have an obligation to use

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.210
loaders if I can handle all the

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:12.235
configuration changes myself?

00:32:12.235 --> 00:32:14.230
NICK: Yeah, it's not [INAUDIBLE]
to be an

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.700
obligation.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.440
It's just convenience.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.290
It's there to help make
it easier for you.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.570
YOSSI: Yeah, but I mean in
performance wise, is it better

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:25.860
than using our own check for
configuration changes?

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.600
Because basically all I do is
fetch the data first time upon

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.560
log in to see if that contact
list has changed, and then

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.760
basically do all the
manipulations myself and

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:44.840
switch from our adapter to
another list viewer and so on,

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:50.350
so all the data is always
on the list view--

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.200
or an adapter.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.450
So--

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.180
NICK: You are seeing, it's
going to be a better

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:55.445
performance.

00:32:55.445 --> 00:32:56.460
Chances are [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.230
no.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.640
Because the joy of loaders is it
takes care of a lot of work

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.250
for you, right?

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:05.820
So it's just like the content
observer for you, for example.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.790
So for me that's one of the
joys, that you can decouple--

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.030
say you're querying
a rest service.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.690
You can just fire off to an
intent service, and have the

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.040
intent service retrieve
information and put it into

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.600
the content provider.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.460
and you don't have to worry
about then trying to touch the

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.060
UI because the loader's
implemented the content

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:23.870
observer for you.

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:28.960
It'll just see the change on the
content URI and re-query

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.700
and update your UI for you.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.835
So you don't have to then get
into the messy logic of result

00:33:34.835 --> 00:33:37.230
receivers and so on trying to
ping back from your intent

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:38.580
service back to your activity.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.850
And yes, the joy of it is it
kind of handles a lot of that

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.430
for you and like you say handles
configuration changes

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.190
gracefully for you as well.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:52.810
so if you don't need any of
that, then don't use it.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:57.520
YOSSI: I mean most likely every
app that uses fetching

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:02.230
from the internet and showing
list views, and so on, needs

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.320
it on different levels.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.110
Because I can do all
the configuration

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.179
changes handling myself.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:13.850
And basically if I use an array
adaptor, or a cursor

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:18.239
adapter to hold the data--

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.530
as a persistent data, as long
as the application is on the

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:26.609
foreground then I don't see
why loaders is better.

00:34:26.609 --> 00:34:28.090
That's what I mean.

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:31.130
That's what I wanted to
verify with you guys.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:32.830
RICH: Yeah, I concur.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:33.199
YOSSI: OK.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.940
Thanks.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:40.800
NICK: I guess that one argument
might be though, that

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.860
if it changes in the future that
you might want to watch

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.900
which content changes or things
like that, then you're

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.690
then going to have to change
all your code and write all

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.239
that stuff for you, whereas
loaders are pretty easy to

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.760
implement if you just do it from
the start then if your

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.885
requirements change on you then
you have that flexibility

00:34:55.885 --> 00:34:57.863
to react to it.

00:34:57.863 --> 00:35:02.140
But I guess you know your
requirements better.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.260
YOSSI: Thanks, guys.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.640
RICH: Hey, Kenton, How you
getting on, there?

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:12.280
How are your single
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.550
KENTON: Wow.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.750
There's something wrong with
this, isn't there?

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.400
I'm sorry.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.008
Can you hear me OK, or has it
just completely screwed

00:35:19.008 --> 00:35:20.442
everyone up.

00:35:20.442 --> 00:35:21.400
RICH: Seems good enough.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.740
Seems OK.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.140
KENTON: Yeah, the thing
yesterday, I was about to

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.430
reach out about it, is all.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.740
You wanted to know if it's the
same problem you've reported

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.062
to them already.

00:35:32.062 --> 00:35:33.014
RICH: Oh, interesting.

00:35:33.014 --> 00:35:35.490
OK.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:36.470
KENTON: I've got to
the bottom of it.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.890
It's basically single shot used
to give you about four or

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.270
five shots.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.482
And now it gives you a single
shot which is probably what it

00:35:44.482 --> 00:35:46.440
should have done in the
first place but--

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.810
it totally messed up what I
was doing with it, so--

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.210
NICK: [INAUDIBLE] single
shot [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:53.050
KENTON: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.720
Because it used to return about
four progressively more

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.240
detailed versions.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.110
So I'd just wait until I didn't
get one for 10 seconds

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.805
and then use that,
but I ignored

00:36:02.805 --> 00:36:04.190
the first one, because--

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.120
[LAUGHING]

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.920
And now you only to
get the first one.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.400
I don't think the first one
actually had the payload in

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.550
it, that's all.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:16.082
NICK: Now all the app's
relying on [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:16.082 --> 00:36:18.050
location, right?

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.960
KENTON: What, like Groupon.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.210
Yeah.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.850
Yeah, I know.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:28.930
That's all right, I've updated
it and it's been pushed out.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.470
Hopefully people will
see it change.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:35.920
RICH: OK.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.490
do we have any other questions
from the Hangout?

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:41.220
If not, we'll head into
the moderator--

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.030
ATAMA: I have a question.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.890
RICH: Hi there.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:44.320
MATT: Go for it.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.510
ATAMA: Hello, can you hear me?

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:47.620
RICH: Yeah, we can hear
you fine, Atama.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.200
ATAMA: OK.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.110
This is my first time
on the Hangout,

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.000
and I'm pretty excited.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.250
RICH: Well done.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.700
ATAMA: The question I have is
that I'm pretty new to Android

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.860
developments and I notice that
I had to learn Java first in

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.320
order to develop programs--

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.570
Android applications.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.110
just a week ago, two weeks ago,
I stumbled on a scripting

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.850
layer for Android
using Python.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.490
And I have a very good
background with Python, and I

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:23.170
was wondering wouldn't it be
cool if the Android developers

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:27.410
can also look into the area of
integrating Python into the

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:32.925
SDK or having a development
platform for Python for

00:37:32.925 --> 00:37:33.840
developing apps.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.200
That was the question I have.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.820
RICH: We've definitely had
internal conversations about

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.350
these things before.

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.950
I guess one of the limitations
is the size of the Tools team.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:46.260
We focus very much on
progressing the platform,

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.120
progressing the APIs,
progressing all that, and if

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.160
we were supporting two sets of
APIs, with two different

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.131
languages it would just slow
everything down require a lot

00:37:52.131 --> 00:37:55.740
more testing, and we are very
much focused on the single

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.120
language at the moment.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.360
Plus the issue of using a
scripting language on top of

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.720
Android is you're not going to
get all the benefits of the

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.923
responsive layout tools that we
have, the resources for all

00:38:05.923 --> 00:38:06.470
of the values.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:08.220
All of the things that are built
into the core platform

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.000
to be to enable you to write
applications that work

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.570
seamlessly across the device
ranges that we have.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.180
To port that all across another
language would be a

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.277
massive undertaking, I think.

00:38:19.277 --> 00:38:20.410
ATAMA: OK.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.970
RICH: But certainly there
are people who--

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:24.610
NICK: Well, and the platform's
moving so fast as well, right?

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:28.820
Like six month-ish release
schedule if not--

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.585
with a few sub-releases in
between, life 4.2.1, then it's

00:38:32.585 --> 00:38:35.750
pretty hard to keep up with
that let alone, then--

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.520
RICH: Believe me, I can totally
see the appeal of it,

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.520
and I know why a lot of people
are doing scripting layers on

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.590
Android and things like the mono
Library as well for .net

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:45.840
developers.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.080
There's definitely people who
would like to code in other

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.710
languages, but certainly
from our side--

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.730
ATAMA: Because today, Python
seems to have a lot of

00:38:55.730 --> 00:39:00.000
libraries to handle so many
tasks, and it would also be

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.370
cool to have the developers
also concentrate in that

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.880
direction as well.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.270
RICH: I'd say the Android
community also provides a vast

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:11.270
array of libraries for doing
almost anything you'd want to

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:12.385
do on Android as well.

00:39:12.385 --> 00:39:15.020
People seem almost entitled to
not write code on Android

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.020
these days.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.345
They can't find a library to
do it, they're a bit like--

00:39:18.345 --> 00:39:20.060
what, I actually write
some code for myself?

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.680
There's so many Android specific
libraries from the

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.940
community, it's one of
the most excellent

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.840
things about Android.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.056
ATAMA: I appreciate it.

00:39:28.056 --> 00:39:28.770
RICH: Yeah, cheers.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:29.770
Thanks for coming in, though.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.470
If you have any other questions
feel free to send

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.920
them our way.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.230
OK, let's take one of the
moderator then because we've

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.320
still got quite a few
to get through.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.380
NICK: We've done a couple
of them already.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.850
In RCLF.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.130
RICH: OK.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.420
Which ones haven't
we done, then?

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.550
NICK: From the top.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.250
RICH: How do you manage
view recycling?

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.390
NICK: OK, from the top then.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:51.300
So someone whose name I can't
pronounce in Colombia says,

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.110
how do you manage view recycling
when you have a

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.560
different layout from each
view on the list view?

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.130
I've tried using Get Ice and
View Type and then create a

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:04.020
holder class for each case, but
it does not seem to work.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.040
Can you provide a good
solution for this?

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.160
RICH: I think that's actually
not a bad solution.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.030
You are being asked
in Get Item for a

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.320
specific view to be returned.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.990
And you're given a view
that's now available.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.720
If they don't match, you're just
going to have to scrap

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.430
the one that's not available
that's come back in.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:25.170
Yeah, List View in the
adapter, you have--

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.133
I can't remember what the method
is called, but it's

00:40:26.133 --> 00:40:28.250
something like Get Item
Count, or something?

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:29.060
Number of items?

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.890
And then we try and
recycle the view

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.270
that is the same type.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:35.620
So it does try to do a lot
of these things for you.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.450
So when you're recycling you're
getting the right view

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.610
holder to then start
going forward.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.950
NICK: I don't understand
what he means [? by ?]

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.970
manage view recycling.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:46.210
There is a limitation there.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:50.160
We don't try and hold onto at
least one of each type in the

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.660
recycle bin so that there's
already a constructed--

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.450
what is it called--

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:57.100
view, I guess--

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:57.440
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.140
NICK: Get back to it.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:40:59.670
Conveyor view.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:00.780
That's the word I
was thinking of.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.410
And so we don't actually try and
call one of each type if

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.340
there's one--

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:09.370
RICH: I guess, if you do have
a large list of items with

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.410
many different view types in--

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:14.490
or a repeating set of view
types, specifically, and you

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:15.930
don't want to have to keep
inflating them and you're

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:18.850
getting handed them back in the
wrong order, there should

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.930
be a way of caching those
convert views that come back

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.580
in or somehow keeping--

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.230
NICK: Or you could simplify it
so you don't use different

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.440
item types but you just
use view stubs

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.700
within the item types.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.740
It's all the same type, so
you're always going to get

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.780
handed something, but
you might have to

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.100
inflate part of the stub--

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.310
RICH: And then you could
manage your own

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.140
view recycling yourself.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.220
You could keep your own array
of all the different views

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.650
that are going to be used and
use the right layouts as you

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:44.900
need them that are
pre-inflated.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.120
NICK: And also I should say,
Andrew Kelly's given a pretty

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.920
good answer in the moderator
as well.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.345
So check that out.

00:41:52.345 --> 00:41:53.896
RICH: Yeah, Andrew Kelly,
thanks for that.

00:41:53.896 --> 00:41:55.146
The one-man moderator machine.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.650
you should definitely find a way
of doing it without having

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.290
to re-inflate views that have
already been inflated.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:05.920
Which-- that's quite expensive
and it's going to start

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.800
freaking with your heap.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.660
MATT: Yeah, not that.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.040
NICK: Don't freak
with your heap.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.290
RICH: Don't freak
wiht the heap.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.910
NICK: Next [? my friend-- ?]

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:18.170
OK.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:22.240
So, DDR Boxman in Austin,
Texas asks--

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:26.540
he says that Android 4.2 and V11
of the spot library added

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.040
the ability to nest fragments
within other fragments.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.510
It did indeed.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:31.960
But it seems [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.250
to your result is broken for
these child fragments.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:35.760
Is this a known bug, or
is this by design?

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.090
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.740
RICH: I haven't tried
all activity

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.950
result in nested fragments.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.240
We were just talking about
this at lunchtime.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.660
NICK: So you're trying to set
result from within a nested

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.690
fragment and you're saying
you can't see it?

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.290
I need some more information.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:53.060
RICH: So, if a nested fragment
is starting an activity for

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.680
result, is it by design that you
should have to pass that

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.880
back to the parent fragment
before you start that

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.930
activity? can the fragment start
activity results, and

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.760
where does that activity
result come back into--

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.520
MATT: I mean, I know if you
start an activity for results

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.010
from a fragment, and then the
result is going to return to

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.272
the fragment, does it
get returned to--

00:43:13.272 --> 00:43:14.522
OK.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.240
RICH: From the fragment
activity, at least.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.650
Yeah.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.560
NICK: From the activity,
not the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.580
MATT: So if it's going to
activity then presumably you

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:27.002
could do a bit with [? root ?]
backwards, but then you'd have

00:43:27.002 --> 00:43:28.490
to be aware of--

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:29.300
RICH: That's a good point.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.720
Can you start an activity for
result from inside a fragment?

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.760
MATT: That's what I was
thinking, because I thought

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.170
you'd have to pass objectivity
[? until ?]

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:36.850
you've started the result.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.540
NICK: You mean you could start
from within the fragment but

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.630
then you'd have to catch it
from in the activity.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:42.070
MATT: And then pass it down.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.446
So maybe that's it.

00:43:43.446 --> 00:43:43.800
RICH: Yeah.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.080
Then it will be going back to
the parent fragment activity.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.580
MATT: You need to make sure that
you're routing it down

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.050
the right way.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:49.760
NICK: So, yeah.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.600
I guess it is a bit confusing
exactly what

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.520
you're trying to do.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.280
Can you post a follow up comment
with a link to Stack

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.270
Overflow or somewhere where we
can see some code, a test case

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:01.330
where it's failing and we can
take a look at it please?

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:04.280
That's my request.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:04.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:06.590
RICH: I need to turn off key
tapping noises on this

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.230
thing, don't I?

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.170
That shouldn't be too easy.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:11.460
If I hold down this button
here-- keyboard setting--

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.055
NICK: Anyway, while Rich does
that, let's crack on.

00:44:14.055 --> 00:44:14.490
RICH: Done.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:18.060
NICK: So Warlock in Prague asks,
if I have five fragments

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:23.710
in the back stack E G A B C D E,
where E is on top, and all

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:27.480
of them are instances of the
same activity class, is there

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.200
an easy way to navigate straight
from E, which is on

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.910
top, directly back to C?

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:36.575
I'm not using fragments
or Fragment Manager or

00:44:36.575 --> 00:44:39.370
anything like that.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.230
So I guess when he's saying jump
backwards, he means he

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:45.510
wants to pop off the top
two and to go back

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:47.300
to the C one there.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.160
So you can't use the activity
flags because they're all the

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.450
same activity class.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.170
So it's interesting is to know
why you want to do that

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:57.980
because it sounds like you're
trying to go straight from E

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.710
to C if it's a direct
navigation, it should be a new

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.820
one on top of the stack.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.570
If you are just trying to get
back to where you are, as in,

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.930
are you always trying to skip
D, is that the case?

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:08.940
Will you always skip that?

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.630
Will you never, ever want to
come back to that D fragment?

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.380
Then there is an activity flag
that you can start to say,

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.210
don't include this in the
back stack, right?

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:18.460
MATT: Yeah.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.580
There are a number of ways that
you can approach this.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.390
The right one, I guess, would
depend purely on what you're

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:29.206
trying to do.

00:45:29.206 --> 00:45:34.130
But my default instinct would be
to pick the right flag, or

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:36.205
if worse comes to worse, if D
you're actually done with it

00:45:36.205 --> 00:45:39.210
once you've gone past it, then
at that point finish it.

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:46.530
Check flags as well as try and
come back to us with a bit

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.870
more detail and perhaps
we can give you

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.510
more of a solid answer.

00:45:53.414 --> 00:45:55.210
Have we got any more
in the moderator?

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:56.570
We've got a couple
coming through--

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.590
NICK: And Yossi also helpfully
says use NavUtils, as well.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:02.020
So NavUtils is in the
[? class in the ?] support

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.552
library which will help you to
synthesize back stacks and so

00:46:05.552 --> 00:46:12.810
on, that helps you set where
to navigate to up and where

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.860
back will go, right?

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.120
YOSSI: Yeah, but basically it
can also edit think the task,

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.988
stack trace, and add task
or create new tasks.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.110
MATT: And--

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:33.360
muted.

00:46:39.005 --> 00:46:41.005
Do you have one off of the
moderator, or do you want to

00:46:41.005 --> 00:46:42.370
go to the G+?

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.750
NICK: I think that we're running
out of moderator ones.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:45.950
I think we've--

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.130
RICH: Working on trying out
that nested fragment one.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:49.410
I want to go and try out nested
fragments and closing

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.150
an emulator from my
second screen.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:53.140
NICK: The only unasked question
is just Tahir in New

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.330
Zealand says GPS help guide?

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:55.580
Question mark, question
mark, question mark.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.190
YOSSI: We can add
more a related

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:03.140
question to the loaders?

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:06.100
NICK: Yeah, sure.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:11.520
YOSSI: Say you'll have a list
of 1,000 people in your

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.030
contact list.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:21.040
Before and basically you have
a status for each member in

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.210
the contact list.

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:26.840
And if one of the users changes
the display name or

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.050
status or something, then
basically the loader will

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.670
fetch all the data again.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:40.570
And that's one big [? cons ?]

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:47.005
versus the adapter that we can
only change the specific data

00:47:47.005 --> 00:47:48.250
that was changed.

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:48.560
NICK: Right.

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.190
Exactly.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:52.460
We wouldn't want to change the
whole content URI, right?

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.400
So if anything in that content
URI changes it's going to

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.270
re-query the whole thing.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.646
YOSSI: So that's a big
performance issue.

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.670
OK.

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:05.300
Just to verify.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.550
NICK: Sure.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:10.410
MATT: So what was that?

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.295
It'll pull out all of
the data again?

00:48:12.295 --> 00:48:12.730
NICK: Yeah.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.060
It will re-query.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.315
MATT: If it requeries,
though, won't

00:48:15.315 --> 00:48:16.030
necessarily be pulling out.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.750
Just be returning a different
cursor, and then if you're

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:21.070
doing it to an adaptor, it'll
just pull up the data for

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.850
those views, would it not?

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:26.700
NICK: It's easier on
the screen, yeah.

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.850
MATT: Yeah.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:31.340
NICK: But yeah, it'll have to
query the whole database.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.590
MATT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.400
RICH: How is the G+
thread going on?

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.340
MATT: Yeah, just checking
[? it now-- ?]

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.650
RICH: I'm going to
+1 it myself.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.140
MATT: Number 3.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.130
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.670
Question about backup manager.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:47.300
How does it handle
multiple devices?

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.470
If I use the same app in
different devices, does the

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.940
developer need to do anything
special to handle it?

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:53.520
Can be used as a sync mechanism

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.712
between different devices?

00:48:56.712 --> 00:48:57.180
NICK: Nope.

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.100
RICH: Personally, no.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.671
MATT: Just a rigid no.

00:49:01.671 --> 00:49:02.130
RICH: No.

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:05.030
I would try and use something
like Google Drive.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.360
We did a code up on it recently
and its available for

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.425
G+ streams.

00:49:09.425 --> 00:49:11.220
I quite like the idea of giving
users control over

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.290
their own data anyway.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:14.170
So if you're using Google Drive
to sync your data, they

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:15.630
can see it, they know that
it's not in your servers,

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:18.510
they've got hold of it.

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:21.210
And it will definitely work
across all devices.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.750
NICK: There's a couple problems
with it as well,

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.330
because when you request
sync it doesn't happen

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:26.650
synchronously.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:28.615
It goes onto a task queue.

00:49:28.615 --> 00:49:30.810
It happens at some point
which we don't make

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:31.980
any guarantees about.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.420
So it's quite hard to guarantee
that the new state

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.650
has been synced up.

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:38.480
And then also, when you request
restore from Backup

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.220
Manager, That was kind
of broken on a

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.400
few versions of Android.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.925
So it's not the most
reliable thing to--

00:49:44.925 --> 00:49:47.925
RICH: It seems quite reliable if
you're on the same device.

00:49:47.925 --> 00:49:51.656
But across devices there
definitely seems to be issues.

00:49:51.656 --> 00:49:52.120
NICK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.980
RICH: We haven't seen much
uptake of Backup Manager.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.000
The actual use cases--

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.920
working use cases of it, are
quite limited at the moment.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.970
NICK: It works really, really
well for-- don't get me wrong,

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:00.700
I think everyone should
use Backup Manager.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.375
It works really well for the
case of I put a new device and

00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.820
I'm signing in, please restore
my app to how it should be,

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.300
you should definitely be backing
up things like shared

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.123
preferences or in any
configuration that the use has

00:50:11.123 --> 00:50:13.326
done to your application,
definitely use Backup Manager.

00:50:13.326 --> 00:50:16.100
But can it be used to make a
sync client between apps?

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.750
No, that's not really what it
was built for, and it doesn't

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:22.560
really work that way,
unfortunately.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.700
I'm with Rich.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.882
Giving the users control of
their own data, for syncing

00:50:25.882 --> 00:50:28.495
the data between devices, use
something like Drive.

00:50:28.495 --> 00:50:30.110
RICH: And that's--

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.670
we're just specifically talking
about using Backup

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:36.240
Manager to backup data
to the Play servers.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.870
Because Backup Manager's
actually a whole plug-in

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:40.910
framework where you can choose
to backup to SD card or your

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:41.740
own services.

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:43.890
You could write a Google Drive
Backup Manager or a Dropbox

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:47.310
Backup Manager plugin
if you wanted.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.550
Or do it somewhere else.

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:53.830
So the limitations on the Google
Play plug-in for are

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:56.080
that really, it's just designed
so that as people

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.410
reinstall the applications at
the Play store, the data will

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:02.003
then get restored with it.

00:51:02.003 --> 00:51:04.510
Yeah, you can choose just--

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:06.370
Something else to say?

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:06.600
NICK: Cool.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.040
RICH: What else?

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.650
I'll just put my device down.

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:11.870
MATT: So Eric says, I have an
image view that is rotated

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:14.220
using [? dot set ?] rotation.

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.100
And shows a card framed photo
by setting a background

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:21.190
drawable and a photo using
set image drawable.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:24.780
However only the outsides, the
background, is anti-aliased.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.490
how can I get the front
drawable, the photo, to be

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:28.915
drawn anti-aliased as well?

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.230
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.640
NICK: I know, isn't this?

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.153
MATT: So, how would you
anti-alias the actual photo of

00:51:40.153 --> 00:51:41.020
an image view?

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.170
Because I'm imagining the
background's going to be dealt

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:44.780
with by the actual
view itself.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.030
Whereas the image is going to
be drawn on top and actually

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.842
managed by the image view.

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:55.030
NICK: Only the outside
is anti-aliased.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:58.010
How can the drawables be
anti-aliased as well?

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.130
MATT: A little bit of me thinks
that there should be an

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:01.600
option to do that.

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:05.900
Or whether you could
wrap the--

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:14.488
so if it's a resource from the
system could you not--

00:52:14.488 --> 00:52:16.730
I'm trying to think about
there's an anti-alias option

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:21.680
when you wrap it in
an XML drawable?

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.200
No?

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.290
RICH: Not that I know of.

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.280
No.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.990
NICK: I'm most interested about
what the scale type

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.390
might be on it as well.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.180
I'm guessing the drawable's much
bigger than he's actually

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.770
displaying it on screen.

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:34.990
In which case that's why
he's worried about the

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:38.230
anti-aliasing stuff because
it has been resized down.

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:41.900
Can you set that with
the scale type.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.260
Can you provide your own matrix
to scale it, or can you

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.880
pre-scale the bitmap
before setting it.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.160
So you don't have to
set a scale type.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.100
RICH: This is what
I'm thinking.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.760
NICK: Yes, if you've managed
to pre-scale the bitmap

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.410
itself, you probably would have
the right flags in bitmap

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:57.150
manager when you scale it to do
the anti-aliasing and then

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:58.882
just set the scale bitmap.

00:52:58.882 --> 00:53:01.840
RICH: If you're leaving it up to
the image view to fit, then

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.280
you end up getting provided
with it--

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.495
MATT: Thinks is the
best option.

00:53:05.495 --> 00:53:08.480
RICH: Yeah, it's just
not going to do it.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.560
NICK: So that's something
I'd look into.

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.525
I'd certainly try scaling the
image yourself before and then

00:53:12.525 --> 00:53:15.210
setting the pre-scaled image
on the image view.

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:18.490
That's all I can think
of right now.

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:19.220
Any [? restrictions? ?]

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.451
anyone done this
in the Hangout?

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.010
Yeah, speak up, Giuseppe.

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:27.092
You're pointing at yourself.

00:53:27.092 --> 00:53:28.780
GIUSEPPE: Thank you.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:33.600
I'm using the Google Cloud
messaging successfully.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:43.140
And starting two weeks, I noted
that there are about 50%

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.850
of the users that they
[? choose ?]

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:48.620
to get the Google
ID, that fails.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.870
They don't get the Google ID.

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:56.820
Is there any insure on
the server side, or--

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.770
NICK: Ooh, I haven't even
heard that before.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:00.620
GIUSEPPE: Sorry?

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.620
NICK: No, I've never heard of
a failure rate anywhere near

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:04.470
that before.

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.470
GIUSEPPE: No issue
at the moment.

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:12.210
So I get about let's
say 1,000 users.

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:15.270
I'm getting 500 that don't
get the response

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:18.420
back from the service.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.130
NICK: You're just getting no
response at all from GCM?

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:22.890
GIUSEPPE: Yes they failed
to respond.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:24.670
Say no registered.

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:27.850
RICH: Did you used to use cloud
to device messaging and

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:29.160
then upgrade to GCM?

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.180
GIUSEPPE: Oh yes, I upgraded
to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.490
Yes.

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:35.990
RICH: Are you still supporting
C2DM as well as GCM?

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:37.270
GIUSEPPE: Yes.

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.320
RICH: And you're definitely
sending the right messages to

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.900
the right clients?

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.840
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, because I
think everything's right

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.180
because I get [INAUDIBLE]
the users with the

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.070
right Google ID.

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:49.660
So if I want something this
don't [? master ?]

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.810
it do nothing.

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:52.590
RICH: No, I'm just concerned
that you've still got some of

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:53.920
your old user base.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.600
I'm concerned some of your old
user base still has clients

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.910
that's using the old C2DM
format. and they'll make the

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:03.670
requests to your servers using
C2DM, but if you go to our GCM

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:05.810
servers, they will never
get the notification.

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:08.840
You have to send that request
through the C2DM servers to

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.655
get to those if you still have
clients that are using C2DM.

00:55:12.655 --> 00:55:14.610
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, this is
[INAUDIBLE] working now.

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.960
RICH: You sure?

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.100
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, sure sure.

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:22.030
Because with this kind of
failure rate, it feels like

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.490
there's something serious--

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:32.180
I just get the GCM intern
service, I get back

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:33.290
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:34.840
unregistered call.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.160
RICH: But for the older users
that are still using C2DM?

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:39.570
GIUSEPPE: No.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.830
There is no users that
is using the old API.

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:43.990
RICH: Are you sure?

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:45.420
GIUSEPPE: Sure, sure,
sure, sure.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.680
RICH: OK.

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:47.665
GIUSEPPE: If you want
I can share

00:55:47.665 --> 00:55:50.040
later the code somewhere.

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:50.370
RICH: Yeah.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:51.850
Yeah it's possible.

00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:53.910
Because there were some people
who had that issue that

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:56.600
assumed after they'd upgraded
to GCM, they only had to

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.490
support GCM.

00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:59.220
But actually, during the
migration period they

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:04.320
definitely still needed to
support C2DM and GCM.

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.020
GIUSEPPE: No no no.

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:11.065
Our application is just using
the last version, and--

00:56:11.065 --> 00:56:12.060
RICH: You never used
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.800
GIUSEPPE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.930
RICH: OK.

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:19.210
In which case, there's
definitely something wrong in

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:20.140
the pipeline.

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:23.903
We don't have any open issues
that I know about with GCM and

00:56:23.903 --> 00:56:29.010
all the messages are getting
delivered that I know about.

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:31.660
And 50% is a pretty
huge failure rate.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:31.970
NICK: Kenton.

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:34.100
You're a big GCM user, right?

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.350
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, you're right.

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:37.970
KENTON: Yeah.

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:42.270
And you sometimes get some
delays getting responses from

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.090
it, but they eventually
do all come through.

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:47.140
NICK: But it doesn't just fail
on the registration, right?

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:49.490
KENTON: Say that again?

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:51.393
NICK: It doesn't just fail
on the registration.

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.810
I do get sometimes in my log
saying GCM not registered.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:01.520
But it's already registered
anyway, so I'm not paying too

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:02.730
much attention to it
at that point.

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:05.050
And I'm not getting any
further failures.

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.890
I'm not explaining that
very well, am I?

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:13.540
At the moment every time the app
starts it goes through the

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.980
GCM registration process.

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:17.213
Which, I'm not sure that
it should do that.

00:57:17.213 --> 00:57:20.650
I need to check into that.

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:22.330
But half the time it'll come
back saying GCM not

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:22.850
registered.

00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:25.610
But it is registered form
the last time it run.

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:28.050
RICH: So I checked on known
issues, and we have no open

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:29.950
known issues regarding
GCM at the moment.

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:34.890
So it sounds more like it should
be something on your

00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:36.140
side, Giuseppe.

00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:37.460
GIUSEPPE: Yeah.

00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.380
I will double check and
as you said I will

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.090
share the code somewhere.

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:44.280
RICH: Yeah, if you get any debug
through from the thing

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.560
that's failing, we might be
able to help you out.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.730
Just mail it through and we'll
see if we can help you out.

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.195
If you can't resolve it.

00:57:49.195 --> 00:57:50.445
GIUSEPPE: Thank you very much.

00:57:53.248 --> 00:57:55.695
RICH: You'll find us in
the usual places.

00:57:55.695 --> 00:57:56.760
How are we doing for time?

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.290
Oh my-- what happened
to the time?

00:57:58.290 --> 00:57:59.510
Is it 2:59?

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:00.300
NICK: It is indeed.

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.100
RICH: One minute till close.

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:01.510
Is anything--

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:04.400
Anyone or anything-- you know,
it might not be a person--

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.590
have anything urgent to say?

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:08.010
Someone's just joined us in the
last closing seconds of

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:10.280
the Hangout it is--

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.070
Mark?

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:11.190
PAUL: Hello.

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:12.310
It's Paul here.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:12.790
RICH: Hey Paul.

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:14.440
PAUL: One quick question.

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.270
I was just wondering, I know
about the orientation in

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:18.370
landscape and portrait.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.120
It was quite a big
thing before.

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.810
Just wondering if--

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:24.030
do you think everyone is still
doing that today, or do you

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:27.620
think people are going for more
fixed orientations these

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.690
days on apps?

00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:29.350
RICH: Go for both.

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:31.010
Support landscape
and portrait.

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:32.990
I Get really frustrated.

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:35.970
PAUL: Depending on the
screen really.

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:38.200
RICH: If you can do it in all
cases go then doing it in all

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.340
cases would be best.

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.440
NICK: I think it's
[? deviating ?] purpose.

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.130
I think by default every app
should support both, unless

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:45.770
you've got a good
reason not to.

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:46.030
PAUL: OK.

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:47.280
Thank you.

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:50.581
MATT: Plus, it's kind of the
beauty of Android, you don't

00:58:50.581 --> 00:58:53.310
know what the next hit device is
going to be, and if someone

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:55.570
decides to do a completely
different form factor, then

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:58.185
it's going to be really painful
if you don't support

00:58:58.185 --> 00:59:00.500
both the landscape and they kind
of prefer it that way.

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.390
We've been talking about an old
school G1 coming back to

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:05.960
life as a new--

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.820
RICH: And a lot of people use
their Nexus 7s in portrait.

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.900
Because of the particular case
I have on mine, I usually use

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:10.985
it in landscape.

00:59:10.985 --> 00:59:12.890
It just happens to sit
that way on my desk.

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:14.500
So apps that don't support
landscape get annoying.

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.080
And you're always going to have
that section of your user

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.870
base that are on the devices
with slide out keyboards and

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:21.860
then they also feel excluded if
they don't have a landscape

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.290
support as well.

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:26.490
So I would wherever possible
always design

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:29.040
and code for both.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.740
PAUL: Just one question
on that.

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.160
How many people have physical
keyboards, or slide out

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.960
keyboards, do you know? or
what kind of percentage?

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.400
RICH: Sorry, I don't have
any statistics on that.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.700
I don't know all the
devices that have

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:41.570
the slide out keyboards.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.270
NICK: No, you probably want to
look at adding some analytics

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:45.160
to your applications, try
and get a feel for

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.080
that kind of stuff.

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:48.280
PAUL: OK.

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:48.640
Cheers, guys.

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:48.880
Thank you.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.830
RICH: Also, yeah, have people
do use external keyboards.

00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:53.200
Bluetooth keyboards
and other things.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.340
Who knows what they're up to.

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:57.340
Best to support both.

00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.590
[INAUDIBLE].

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:02.910
KENTON: I was just going to say,
I've got two clients now

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:07.480
and they both insist they just
want portrait, they don't care

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.140
about landscape.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.193
I know Google TV guy on the
left there obviously would

01:00:12.193 --> 01:00:15.998
love some landscape
stuff, but--

01:00:15.998 --> 01:00:18.177
RICH: Happen to be porting
iOS apps across to

01:00:18.177 --> 01:00:18.670
Android, by any chance?

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:21.090
KENTON: I might just be
doing that, yeah.

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:23.950
How do you convince clients that
it's worth spending money

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:25.730
on doing both?

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.210
RICH: Just take a D1 in.

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.890
And wait for them to slide the
keyboard out and try and type

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:31.910
that email address
in like this.

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:33.580
NICK: Could ask them if
they hate their users.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.320
RICH: Yeah.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.100
Just tell them default--

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.410
MATT: [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:40.620
NICK: One of the arguments I'd
say is, if you mean to or not,

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.460
you're already shipping an app
which runs on landscape

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.530
default phones, it runs on
landscape default tablets.

01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:49.850
It runs on landscape
default GTVs.

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:50.690
If you're not requesting
touch.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:53.307
So they're already shipping an
app that does this, they're

01:00:53.307 --> 01:00:55.990
just shipping a really, really
poor user experience.

01:00:55.990 --> 01:01:00.260
So either you go to loads of
effort to lock it down and

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.658
stop it from doing what it
really wants to do and fight

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:05.010
the user, stop them from using
it how they want to use the

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:07.320
app, or you have
happier users.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.590
It's up to them.

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:10.344
RICH: And if they're--

01:01:10.344 --> 01:01:14.270
KENTON: It is quite nice and
easy to sort of lock it to one

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.940
orientation.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.360
It's a lot less code as well.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.090
Is there any public thing that
we can say, statistically this

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:27.660
is a class of devices you
excluding if you lock it to

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.560
these orientations?

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.175
Because, you're kind
of preaching to

01:01:31.175 --> 01:01:33.170
the converted here.

01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:35.010
We've got to convert
our clients, the

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:35.960
ones with the wallet.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.220
NICK: I don't know
any hard numbers.

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.260
The only ones I can really
think of is the tablet

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.050
activations now.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:43.610
So the public number is we're
activating 70,000 Android

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:45.860
tablets every day.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.960
So they're already going to
not have a great user

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.580
experience with the app.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.627
Most tablets are pretty
landscape friendly.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.400
I don't have stats otherwise
for how many

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.970
more classic devices--

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:05.660
RICH: Whilst you're convincing
them, make sure they do a

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:09.035
tablet layout as well.

01:02:09.035 --> 01:02:11.460
I know they're often not easy
things to convince a client,

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.390
especially if they've just
finished their iOS app.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:23.900
KENTON: I find the Nexus 7 class
size device, actually--

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.102
upscale phone apps look
all right on that.

01:02:26.102 --> 01:02:27.350
RICH: Yeah.

01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:28.600
NICK: Uh, not really.

01:02:32.164 --> 01:02:33.090
RICH: Alright.

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:34.210
KENTON: They're not awful.

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:37.350
Not like they are
on 10 inches.

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:40.870
NICK: In portrait, quite
like a phone device.

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:43.660
In landscape, it is more like
a tablet device, I find.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.805
say you have to make a call,
like [INAUDIBLE] apps don't

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:50.770
work very well in landscape,
generally.

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:54.600
Is app to app, but still.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:54.970
RICH: OK.

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:57.830
With that, we're going to have
to finish for today.

01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:59.310
Before we get actually,
physically

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:00.890
kicked out of this room.

01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:02.320
Thank you all for joining
us again.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.970
Some great questions from the
Android developer community.

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:07.700
Giuseppe, we'll try and look
into that question, whatever

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.130
it was, by next week.

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:10.497
Please add it to next
week's moderator and

01:03:10.497 --> 01:03:12.800
we'll take a look.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.005
Cheers, guys, thank
you all very much.

01:03:14.005 --> 01:03:15.330
NICK: Cheers.

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:16.580
MATT: Bye.
