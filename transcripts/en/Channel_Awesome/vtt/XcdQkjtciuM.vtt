00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.500
Narrator: It's the Moviesquitoes!

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.980
The Nostalgia Critic characters you probably didn't think twice about!

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.380
Now, in this exciting prequel,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.900
We answer the question we know you've been dying to find out:

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.460
How did the Moviesquitoes meet?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.120
*squish*

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.460
Hello, I'm Buzzy-buzzy Squish-squish.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.620
I'm George.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.780
And I'm Number Three.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.520
Buzzy: It's great to meet you both.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.460
*canned laughter*

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.380
George: Well, I guess our thrilling backstory is finally revealed.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.980
Number Three: Let's do what we always do!

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.600
Watch stuff!

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.620
Buzzy: Okay!

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.960
*buzzing*

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.840
Ugh, I'm so glad that we addressed what was BUZZING around in peoples' minds!

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.340
*laughter*

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.600
Number Three: Yeah, I know it was really SUCKING the life outta them!

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.380
*laughter*

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.160
George: Mosquito-based pun!

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.620
*even more laughter*

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.040
Buzzy: 'Cause that's all we are, right?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.100
Puns for that small amount of children who aren't developed enough yet to know we're not funny.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.900
HI KIDS!

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.000
Number Three: We'll keep you busy while your parents get that much needed time alone.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.860
George: Just don't go in their bedroom for 15 to 20 minutes.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.820
Buzzy: Now, on with the show!

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.400
♪ *upbeat piano music* ♪

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.260
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.280
I remember it so YOU don't have to!

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.180
And a special hello to all the moviesquitos who most likely just revealed their backstory.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.460
By god, we've been waiting years...

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.560
YEARS to find that out!

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.260
And now, we can all rest easy knowing their riveting tale.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.200
Which, of course brings me to my review, which I'm sure in no way connects to any of this:

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.060
Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.800
Yep, after the critical crucifixion of the first film resulting in not nearly the profit the studio was hoping to produce,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.800
Universal Studios eventually said:

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.640
"Ehh, those sets were expensive; we've gotta use them for something."

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.700
Thus, we have this prequel we didn't know we wanted,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.820
with all new annoyances that we KNOW we didn't want!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.900
The film seems so disinterested in existing, they're not even facing the viewer all the way on the poster!

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.900
In fact, the movie cares so little of what impact it has on you, that it doesn't even care what it's RATED!

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.200
Yeah! The box says PG, but when you open it up, the disc reads G!

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.900
Ooooo, is the PG version the UNCENSORED cut?

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.200
The one where Fred FINALLY does Barn?

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.500
It's all as pleasant as passing a prehistoric kidney stone, and we're gonna find out why.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.040
So let's take a page right outta misery. This is Viva Rock Vegas.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.660
The intro again has the pun title "Univershell",

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.100
because lord knows I wouldn't want MY real company name attached to this either!

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.220
Though... Ah! The website gives the REAL name!

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.500
You're ruining the illusion, Viva Rock Vegas!

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.480
And we cut to the night terrors Marvin the Martian has when he falls asleep on ecstasy.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.500
Gazoo: Did anybody else see those big letters flying by?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.640
Critic: PG. This was DEFINITELY RATED PG!

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.580
Christ, why do Alan Cumming kids films always paint his face green and baste him in horrific horror?!

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.860
Leader of the Gazoo-Thingies: You are to document the earthlings' bizarre mating ritual...

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.300
Uhh, hey, I was just kidding! Don't let the plot actually BE Fred and Barney doing it!

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.100
Speaking of which, we cut to Fred and Barney, portrayed by Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin....

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.400
in, no joke, the role I think he was born to play!

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.600
Barney: Couldn't even crack his knuckles without my help!

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.460
Crane's got trouble?
Just call Barney Rubble!

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.040
*chuckling*

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.300
Critic: It's... actually kind of EERIE how well he gets Barney's cluelessness and lack of development skills!

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.200
Barney: You're welcome!

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.500
*guffawing*

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.000
Critic: Okay, he has "Essence of Shaggy Stoned-ness"...

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.920
but A) That's also a Hanna-Barbera character,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.720
and B) You'd be stoned too if you were on this movie!

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.200
You'd HAVE to be to allow THIS to be your first big joke:

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.100
*loud fart*

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.400
Dinosaur: I got three stomachs! Cut me some SLACK!!

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.400
Critic: Yeah, Flintstones was always known for its flatulent humor.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.200
Wilma: Put up the beds, and let's get some sleep.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.300
Fred: We don't have BEDS at camp, we use--

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.660
*wet fart*

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.660
Wilma &amp; Betty: OHHH NOOOO!!!

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.900
*fart*

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.400
Critic: While that's going on, Fred is trying to pass an exam to finally work with a real dinosaur.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.380
Buuut it doesn't exactly go great.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.660
*thud*

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.660
Fred: Oooooooohhhhh....

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.440
Graduation Host: Frederick Flintstone!

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.000
Critic (as Graduation Host): Despite KILLING a man, you still pass with flying colors!

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Hey, if we don't have any animal cruelty laws, why should this bother us?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.000
(normally): We then cut to the family of Wilma, played by.....

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.540
(confused): Kristen Johnston??

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.880
Okay, now this is particularly interesting, because while the casting in the first film was pretty spot-on,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.100
a lot of people had an issue with Rosie O'Donnell as Betty.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.320
Not that she was awful, but whenever you look at her, you don't see Betty, you just see Rosie O'Donnell.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.080
Even though WILMA was cast fine.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.000
Here, BETTY is cast fine, but you don't see WILMA, you just see Kristen Johnston!

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.880
She's a fine comedic actress, but tell me if you see Wilma or Sally [from 3rd Rock from the Sun]

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.300
trying to blend in by auditioning for Earth's favorite pastime of making shitty movies.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.900
Wilma: I was thinking about going someplace a little different...

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.900
Going into Bedrock... and going BOWLING!

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.200
*laughter*

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.800
Critic (as 3rd Rock's Sally): High Commander! I made the Chuck E. Cheese animatronics laugh,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.700
but this impression of Alice from Honeymooners ELUDES me!

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.800
(normally): Meanwhile, Barney and Fred continue to think about their futures.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.380
Fred: I guess I always figured by this point in my life, I'd have somebody special.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.000
Barney: Well, you always got me, Fred.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.900
Fred: Thanks, Barn.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.400
Critic: Okay, I am trying very hard to resist the "gay old time" joke, but YOU ARE MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT!

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.060
Fred: I mean it's not like something's just gonna drop out of the sky, land in front of you, and change your whole life!

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.040
Critic (as Fred): Oh my god! That thing I just said wouldn't happen just happened!

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.040
*explosion*

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.560
Dammit, couldn't that be the meteor to destroy all prehistoric life?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.520
Fred: What are YOU?

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.680
Critic (as Gazoo): I... am your DEATH!

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.100
Gazoo: I come from a planet too far for you to fathom, and a civilization too advanced for you to comprehend!

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.200
Critic (as Gazoo): Yet our effects are still pretty shitty.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.400
What, am I Photoshopped here? Pretty lame.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.600
Barney: We let you out of the fancy bottle, now we get wishes, right?

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.600
Fred: Yeeeah! Barney's right! Let's get this started! What do we have to rub?

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.020
Critic: Now I have no choice!

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.200
Flintstones theme song: ♪ We'll have a gay old time! ♪

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.400
Gazoo: I am of a highly evolved alien species!

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.600
Critic (as Fred): You look more like a creation of a TV show ratings slump!

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.040
*punch*

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.700
Critic (as Barney): Hey! I'm a born-again Christian! I'm gonna go create God's Club!

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.020
(normally): Later, Wilma meets Betty, played by Jane Krakowski, at a restaurant.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.060
Wilma: How much is a glass of water?

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.860
Betty: Water? Free.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.120
Wilma: Great! I'll have two!

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.780
Critic (as Betty): Perfect. Just one question: What's glass?

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.160
(normally): STONE age?????

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:17.640
Betty mistakes Wilma for being caveless, despite the fact that she's actually running away from her incredibly rich mother, because she hates her lifestyle.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.120
Betty: You stay with me 'til you're back on your feet.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.340
I know, you're not looking for a handout. You're just looking for your self-respect.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.000
Critic (as Betty): After that [Kimmy] Schmidt woman, inviting a complete stranger in seems perfectly normal!

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.740
Barney: G'night, Fred.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.820
Fred: G'night, Barn.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.800
*Gazoo teleport sound*
Gazoo: Goodnight, dum--

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.820
Critic: AAAAAHHHH!!!!!

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.420
Sorry, I will never get used to how freaky that is!

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.680
Gazoo: I am here to observe your species' mating rituals.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.780
So..... get to it!

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.480
Fred: *chuckling*

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.480
Oh, Barney and me don't, uh...

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.580
Critic: Okay, is my joke playlist just gonna be nothing but THIS?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.480
Gazoo follows them to a fast food joint, where Wilma gets her first serving job.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.180
But Fred seems to miss her, and instead gets the hots for Betty.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.180
Fred: Haaaaaaaaaa.......

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.220
Betty: Sorry, no substitutions.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.700
Fred: Homina homina homina....

Critic (as Betty): Uh, sorry, I don't speak Bill O'Reilly.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.820
Betty: You want a date?

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.700
Fred: Uh-huh.....

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.240
Betty: Well.....

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.300
I've gone out with men who said less.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.000
Critic (as Betty): Bill Cosby just got me a drink.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.020
Betty: Why not? You can take me to the carnival tomorrow.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.140
Fred: *babbling*

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.160
Critic (as Betty): Uh, sorry, I don't speak Clinton either--

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.140
(normally): Okay, bottom line: anyone named Bill is most likely an adulterer!

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.780
...some exceptions.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.160
Fred: *laughs*

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.240
Betty: *giggles*

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.280
Fred: *laughs again*

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.720
Critic: Well, now we know Fred's Kill Face!

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.260
We'll just add that to the list of everyone else's Kill Face!

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.880
I think Barney is up to FIVE!

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.540
Of course, Barney then gets a date with Wilma, which honestly is not a bad idea, and could be a little funny,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.200
but then you remember this was directed by the same asshole who directed

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.700
THESE

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.120

HOW the HELL is there a VIDEO CAMERA?!?!?!

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.700
I can surprisingly suspend disbelief through most of this, but a VIDEO CAMERA?!

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.180
NO!!! I'm sorry!

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.740
We see PICTURES are CHISELED,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.880
so we're just supposed to expect there's a bird chiseling A HUNDRED PICTURES PER MINUTE?!?!?!?!

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.180
It's like having a live audience in animation!

I'm just assuming most of the cast are gonna show up on CSI: Bedrock.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.900
They of course end up switching, and start getting along better with the other's dates.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.380
Wilma: *grunting with effort*

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.980
Critic (as Wilma): Ohh, this papier-mâché is so heavy!

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.860
Maybe a ride in an animal's rib cage will make me feel better.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.300
(normally): Flintstones is kinda disturbing when you think about it.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.600
Wilma: Wish I'd brought something to drape over my shoulders, y'know?

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.880
Mmmmm... thank you.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.040
*Gazoo teleport sound*
Gazoo: Nice--

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.980
Critic: AAAAAHHHH!!!!!

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.060
Okay, I'm gonna justify him in this movie by saying he's the big giant head checking in on Sally's mission!

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.620
He already did it once as The Hole!

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.700
♪ *romantic music* ♪

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.200
*crack*

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.020
Critic (as Fred): WHOA! I SWEAR that never happens!

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.520
(normally): Yeah, that's right, the prize they won at the carnival was Dino!

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.760
Y'know aliens, dinosaurs, and cavemen all exist at the same time; why should this bother me?

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.320
It doesn't. Next shitty scene.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.420
Wilma's mom drops by, played by Joan Collins...

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.720
Frank from Mrs. Doubtfire: Oh, I don't think I have the strength.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.080
Critic: ...as she interrupts her primordial blackface to ask Wilma to come home.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.700
Betty: I'm going to take my bath, now.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.040
Mrs. Slaghoople: Ugh!

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.340
Critic: Yeah, it's a cave!

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.140
There's gonna be dirt and dust-- it's a CAVE!

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.540
She invites her back to celebrating her father's birthday, while Fred thinks about proposing to Wilma.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.140
Seems a little fast, but to be fair, this movie DOES feel like years have gone by!

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.760
Fred: So Barn, whaddaya think?

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.980
Barney: Oh, Fred! You shouldn't have!

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.000
Flintstones theme song: ♪ We'll have a gay old time! ♪

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.780
Fred: It's not for you, nitwit! It's for Wilma!

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.800
Barney: Ohhh...

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.260
Critic (as Barney): Probably for the best.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.340
I'm saving myself for Pauly Shore.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.620
(normally): They meet at her mother's house to discover she's so rich,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.740
she can hire John Cho as a valet!

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.640
Fred: Trying to steal my CAR!!

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.340
Valet: No, sir!

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.960
Wilma: Fred, he's the valet!

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.920
Fred: I knew that!

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.680
Narrator: Harold and Sulu Park a Car!

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.360
Critic: Hey, don't tempt them; they might make that!

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.860
By the way, Wilma's dad is played by Harvey Korman.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.760
As you can plainly see, he never recovered after the Star Wars Holiday Special.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.580
Col. Slaghoople: Cavalry! Mount up! We're moving out!

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.920
CHAAAAAAAAAARGE!!!!

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.900
*clopping hoofbeats that sound like two coconuts conking together*

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.520
Soldier from Monty Python and the Holy Grail: You're using COCONUTS!

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.820
Critic: Fred is intimidated about his ring when he sees the family she comes from.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.640
And it doesn't help that Dino interrupts the party also.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.420
Dino: *yapping*

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:39.980
Mrs. Slaghoople: Aaahh!

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.640
Fred: Dino! NOOOO!!!

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.320
*crash*

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.260
Mrs. Slaghoople: *yelling in frustration*

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.520
Critic (as Mrs. Slaghoople): Well, this is a FINE how-do-you-do!

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.200
Surely, the chefs' desserts will make EVERYTHING better!

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.020
(normally): But Wilma sticks up for her party-ruiner.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.840
Wilma: That is why I like them, because they're not like YOU!

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.000
Mrs. Slaghoople: How dare you to talk to me like that, Wilma?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.320
*inhale*

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.820
No one has ever talked to me like that BEFORE!

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.620
Critic (as Mrs. Slaghoople): They usually just say "Glub-glub! You're a fish! Glub-glub!"

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.980
(normally): But Chip Rockefeller...

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.060
HA! CHIP! ROCK!

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.540
No, you were right not to laugh at that.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.200
...feels bad about how the family acted, and invites them to his casino at Rock Vegas.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.540
Wilma: I don't think now is such a good time--

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.640
Fred: Mmm, Rock Vegas, eh?

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.340
*slot machine spinning*

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.660
Critic: NO!! GOD no!!!!

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.580
God DAMN it! As if we didn't have enough KILL Faces in this movie,

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.800
now we have to have the one from Judge Doom at the end of Roger Rabbit?!

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.660
Judge Doom: When I KILLED your brother, I talked...

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.440
JUST...

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.280
LIKE.....

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.220
THIIIIIIIIIIIS!!!!!!!

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.300
Critic: Ignore the G rating! This is a PG when PG actually MEANT something!

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.860
Critic: So everybody is of course off to Rock Vegas.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.900
Say, I wonder what prehistoric law on prostitution is here?

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.400
Fred: Oooooh, there's a lot of BUSCH gonna be sold!

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.820
Critic: Hey, hey! He said it, not me!

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.280
He's a hard drinker AND a hard smoker; isn't this kinda like the next logical step?

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.360
Ann-Margret: ♪ Vivaaaa Rock Vegas! ♪

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:29.640
Critic: So, even though this movie is BAD, I will give it credit that it doesn't really have a predictable plot.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.280
It's just Fred and Barney meeting Wilma and Betty, and going to Vegas.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.580
Honestly, I'm not entirely seeing where this plot can go--

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.380
Chip: Soon, Wilma will see him for the pathetic primitive primate he really is.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.500
Critic: Ahhhhh, THERE'S our bullshit!

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.880
You see, Chip wants to marry Wilma, so he can inherit her fortune, to pay off some gangsters, and--

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.740
Shit, do I even need to SAY it? You've heard it a million times.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.520
But, hey, it does allow for the crossover we've all been waiting for: "The Flintstones Meets The Leprechaun"!

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.600
"And The..."

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.300
"Jolly Green Brad Garrett"?

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.900
Speaking of threatening, little green nightmares...

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.620
*Gazoo teleport sound*

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.340
Critic: AAAAAHHHH!!!!!

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.680
Gazoo: I know this will be difficult for you, but let's think!

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.220
Critic: He explains Rockefeller's plan, but it leaves little-to-no impression on our dumb-as-a-rock hero.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.780
Gazoo: Good luck, dum-dum!

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.380
You'll need it!

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.000
*Gazoo teleport sound*

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.540
Critic: I think that's what every ticket taker said when going in to see this movie.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.140
*rip*
Good luck, dum-dum! You're gonna need it!

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.740
*rip x2*
Good luck, dum-dum! You're gonna need it!

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.340
*rip x3*
Good luck, dum-dum! You're gonna need it!

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:23.840
*rip x4*

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.480
Meanwhile, Wilma and Betty get a massage from an unlikely cameo.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.940
Wilma: Could you get between my shoulder blades? That's where I carry all my tension.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.860
Rosie O'Donnell's Voice: HA! SHE'S tense! I just found out what calamari means!

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.220
Critic: Finally! A fitting role for Rosie O'Donnell in The Flintstones!

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.280
Not since casting her as a CHIMP has this felt so right!

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.820
Barney as well seems to be enjoying himself.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.400
Barney: Oooohh!

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.160
Look at the size of that pie!

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.360
Critic: Well, gee, I'm TOTALLY clueless to where this is going.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.660
I'm gonna say they all get cave-syphilis and die.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.340
Roxie: Waiter--

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.960
*splat*

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.800
Critic: ...or the pie goes in her face. One of the two!

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.600
Barney: Let me help! *chuckles*

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.020
Critic: Oh! Now we're doing THIS stupid thing!

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.620
CHRIST, this storytelling connects so much to our everyday lives!

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.940
How many cream pie misunderstandings will it takes before we learn??

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.760
(as Barney): No! It's okay! I was just wiping my white, hot cream off her breasts!

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.160
Mick Jagged: 'Allo, luv!

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.920
Critic: This leads to Alan Cumming in a DOUBLE ROLE...

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.580
Because... if I was in a Flintstone movie, I would want double the attention!

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.580
...playing rock star Mick Jagged.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.240
Mick: What d'you say we go meet me band mates?

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.780
And maybe go somewhere more QUIET, so we can, uh...

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.160
...talk a little bit more, yeah?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.960
Critic: Y'know, how bad is it that Flintstones Kids is a better prequel than all of this?

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.260
Fred, it looks like, is getting way too into his winnings,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.800
and Chip decides to sabotage him by pushing a lever that forces him to lose!

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.640
No, literally! He just pushes one lever, and Fred magically loses all his money to the casino.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.980
*evil laughter*

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.120
HOW THE HELL DOES THAT GUY OWE MONEY?!?!

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.380
He has a MAGIC LEVER THAT CAN FORCE PEOPLE TO LOSE EVERYTHING!!

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.460
Marry into money??? WHY?!?!?!

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.800
You have GOD'S PERSONAL MONEY TREE!!!!!

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.140
Th-th-there's not even any complicated controls! It's just...

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.300
WIN and LOSE!!

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.020
Is it only targeted to FRED? Can it be targeted to other PEOPLE??

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:14.440
Is there a... remote-controlled CHIP in everybody's MIND that he somehow has CONTROL over that can WIN or LOSE or--

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.000
This WHOLE MOVIE should be about HOW THAT LEVER WORKS!!!!!

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.580
But nope! We don't focus anymore on that!

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.520
Because he instead tries to woo Wilma by saying he'll put her priceless pearls in his safe...

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.300
which...

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.220
...for a casino, seems surprisingly SMALL!

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.440
AND IN OPEN VIEW FOR EVERYONE TO SEE!!!

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.140
But it's okay, because they rip off the dumbest subplot of Titanic!

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.360
Yep! They slip Wilma's pearls into Fred's pocket!

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.660
Jack Dawson: This is horseshit!

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.040
Critic: You said it, 1997-Leonardo DiCaprio. You said it!

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.160
Even when Chip seals off the casino asking the wrongdoer to come forward and confess...

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.140
I don't think there's anything that could possibly make ANY of this REMOTELY funny--

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.280
Confessor: I am systematically poisoning the dinosaurs' water supply!

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.060
In a matter of decades, their entire species will be EXTINCT!

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:01.800
Critic: Doyle?!

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.560
[a role that actor played in The Mask]

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.220
You actually had a funny line!

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.780
Good god-- I-I-I think that's like...

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.100
the ONE FUNNY LINE in the ENTIRE GODDAMN MOVIE!!!

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.580
Confessor: Doesn't anybody care about this whole "dinosaurs becoming extinct" thing?

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.860
Literally Everyone Else: NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.440
Critic: No, no, PLEASE! Can't we follow that other guy's story?

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.440
Why did he do it? HOW did he do it?

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.000
Can he save a couple so we can reenact Dino-Riders?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.180
Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park: That's-that's chaos theory.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.220
Critic: He of course reveals Fred as the culprit, and even works in Barney as an accomplice,

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.840
and Wilma, being as dumb as everyone else in this movie, believes it.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.920
This means Chip's plan is working, and just in the nick of time!

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.140
Little Rocko: See, a little birdie told 'im that you ain't even DATIN' Miss Slag--

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:37.800
*squeaks open*

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.220
Jive-talkin' bird: Hey, I might be out of a JOB tomorrow! Brotha's gotta have a little NEST EGG, ya dig?

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.020
Critic (nervously): Uhhhhh, that bird was goin' a little too DUMBO for my taste!

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.080
Little Rocko: But if the bride don't show...

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.120
You'll be spending your wedding night...

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.160
Big Rocko: WITH ME!

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.220
Flintstones theme song: ♪ We'll have a gay old time! ♪

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.400
Critic: Hey, what happens in Rock Vegas, STAYS in Rock Vegas!

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.920
Did I mention his name is "Rock Vegas"?

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.460
Meanwhile, Fred and Barney sulk in a jail cell.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.360
Fred: We'd be with them right now if I haven't been so STUPID!

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.540
*Gazoo teleport sound*
Gazoo: Now--

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.800
Critic: AAAAAHHHH!!!!!

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.260
Fred: So you gonna bust us outta here?!

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.100
Gazoo: Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.500
Do I look like the cavalry?

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.660
Though those outfits ARE adorable!

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.760
Flintstones theme song: ♪ We'll have a gay ol-- ♪

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.020
Gazoo: You two know I can't actually interefere!

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.120
Critic (as Gazoo): If you do, I'll make sure you'll NEVER do another Spy Kids!

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.380
(normally): But Barney finds a way to sneak through the bars, and get out.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:28.820
Barney: Blow.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.040
Flintstones theme song: ♪ We'll have a gay ol-- ♪

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.800
Fred: You can fit through the bars!

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.700
Barney: I CAN?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.120
Critic: Meanwhile, both Betty and Wilma think they were happier

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.600
with the people they're STILL UNDER THE IMPRESSION were cheaters and thieves!

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.960
Wilma (sobbing): O-o-o-o-o-oh, BETTY-Y-Y-Y-Y!!!

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.380
Critic (as Wilma/Sally): I'M LEAKIIIIIIING!!!

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.280
(exasperated): I dunno, SOMEHOW Fred and Barney dress in drag...

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.520
Do you really care HOW?

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.440
(normally): They eventually break in, and try to get Betty out of Mick's hands.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.440
Barney: I just had to come back here and tell you...

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.140
I love you. I don't think I ever told you that before.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.220
But now I did, so..... goodbye.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.780
Critic: You will believe Stephen Baldwin as Barney Rubble as a showgirl will win an Oscar!

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.180
...mostly because you were dropped as a child.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.360
...hard.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.480
...and repeatedly.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.300
Betty: Do you really mean it?

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.820
Barney: Of course I do!

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.120
I've never felt this way about anyone before!

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.420
Critic (as Fred): Oh, Barney, after all these years, I thought you were after MY Fruity Pebbles!

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.060
Mick: Not after I've gone to all the trouble of pinching her from him in the FIRST place!

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.160
RAAAAAAHH!!!

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.840
Critic (as Alan Cumming): You WILL forget I can do Shakespeare!

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.320
Barney: Take this, you FOREIGNER!

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.420
*bonk*

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.580
Critic: As Chip tries to force Wilma to marry him,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.040
Fred sneaks onto the stage, dressed like how babies are made!

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:51.080
Fred (singing flatly): ♪ This isn't love, this is ecstasy ♪

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.440
Critic (as Wilma): Oh, Fred, you sing horribly!

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.120
Fred: Wilma, I'd never forgive myself if I didn't give this one last try.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.120
Wilma Slaghoople...

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.740
Critic (as Fred): Will you walk off the set with me?

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.060
Fred: Wilma... will you mmmmm....

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.900
Will you maaaaa...

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.000
Will you mmmmm...

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.520
Critic: Yeah, she STILL thinks he stole from her, he's CLEARLY got a gambling problem,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.940
but he's SO IN LOVE with her, he can't even say the word "marry" when proposing!

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.980
CHRIST, I wish we were watching that guy who was gonna wipe out the dinosaurs--

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.200
Confessor: This is your last chance!

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.960
Critic: OOOH! There he is! Tell me your motivation! What's your PLAN?!

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.560
Confessor: Stop me, or all the dinosaurs die!

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.720
Pretty Much Everyone Else: SHUT UP!

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.240
Critic: DAMMIT!!! [It's] BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT WE'RE GETTING SEVEN TRANSFORMER MOVIES!!!

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.660
She of course says yes, and they're married in a church,

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.780
which raises so many religious questions about this world since A Flintstones Christmas.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.000
Minister: Do you, Fred Flintstone...

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.900
take Wilma Slaghoople... to be your wife?

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.720
Fred: I Yabba-Dabba-Do!

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.600
Critic (as Fred): I'm saying that line under protest!

00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:00.140
Chorus: ♪ We'll have a gaaaaaaaay oooooooold tiiiiiiiiiiiiime! ♪

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.360
Critic (as Gazoo): Goodnight, everybody! NO refunds!

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.900
(normally): And that was Viva Rock Vegas!

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.940
I think it's very obvious they came up with the title FIRST, and wrote a movie around it!

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.760
It's not even a very good pun! "Las"? "Rock"? They don't SOUND alike!

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.620
Much like the first one, it's got some good impressions and one or two neat setpieces,

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.980
but it's just pointless, unfunny, and.....

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.980
.....creepy!

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.920
When it's not unpleasant, it's boring.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.740
And there's literally NO reason to have this be a prequel!

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.060
Just take out the four of them meeting for the first time and keep everything else the same,

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.700
it's still just Flintstones being Flintstones!

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.540
It's catchphrases, bad puns, and awkward scene after awkward scene.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.040
This film is just one big Yabba-Dabba-Dump!

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.080
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so YOU don't have to!

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.240
George: Well that seemed TOTALLY unnecessary!

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.920
Number Three: But made somewhat of a profit!

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.220
Buzzy: Which means there'll be MANY MANY more Moviesquito adventures!

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.080

George: Hot BUZZ!

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.560
Number Three: INSECTion!

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.840
Buzzy: The Mask....SQUITO!

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.500
George: Out of PARASITE!

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.040
Number Three: BUGSmaids!

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.640
Buzzy: And Hamlet!

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.820
George: And don't worry, parents, we'll make them really crappy, so we can get them to you faster!

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.660
Number Three: And to all you adults who actually enjoy watching these films...

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.560
Go sleep with someone!

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.120
Buzzy: Please! Be kind to yourself!

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.500
Well, that's about it from the Moviesquitoes! See ya next time!

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.160
Fred Flintstone: Oooooh, there's a lot of BUSCH gonna be sold!

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.780
Hey, everybody! Doug Walker here doing the Charity Shout-out.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.700
Doing a REAL cool one this week! We are doing Team Rubicon.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:45.140
Team Rubicon unites the skills and experiences of military veterans with first responders,

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.360
to rapidly deploy emergency response teams.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:55.620
Their primary mission is providing disaster relief to those affected by natural disasters, be they domestic or international.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:03.060
By pairing the skills and experiences of military veterans with first responders, medical professionals, and technology solutions,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.940
they aim to provide the greatest service and impact possible.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.740
They seek to provide their veterans with three things they lose after leaving the military:

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.100
a purpose, gained through disaster relief,

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.280
community, built by serving with others,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.780
and self-worth, from recognizing the impact one individual can make.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.000
Coupled with leadership development and other opportunities,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.580
Team Rubicon looks to help veterans transition from military to civilian life, as well.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.700
If you look at their site and their YouTube page,
[http://www.youtube.com/user/teamrubiconusa]

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:38.280
you can not only see what an awesome idea this is, but also how incredibly helpful it is to so many lives.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.660
Check it out, and see how you, too, can help.
