00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
Hey guys, today I'm back with another liquid nitrogen experiment...

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.140
...and this time I am wearing safety glasses. Don't get too excited, because they're not gonna stay on for very long.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.320
Now, I just posted a video on filling up a balloon with liquid nitrogen, and when it exploded...

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.640
...some of you expressed concern that I wasn't wearing any safety glasses.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.800
What if the liquid nitrogen splashed into my face? Could it make me go blind instantly?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.440
Could it freeze my skin cryogenically? Some of you from the HAZMAT departments of other companies...

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.200
...recommended it wasn't the safest procedure.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.000
Now this is not one of those experiments that I would encourage you to try at home.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.160
This, I would classify as very, very dangerous, and what they say, "for experts only".

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.100
Now, the concern was, if a drop of liquid nitrogen hits somebody in the eye, would they go blind?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.380
So, I'm not gonna try it with one drop of liquid nitrogen. I'm gonna try it with a whole cup.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.520
This, my friends, is the real deal. This is liquid nitrogen, and this is going in my face right now.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.680
Aww, I missed! [laughter] We gotta do that again!

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.020
[exhales]

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.860
Okay, I think I got more of that in my nose and my mouth than I did in my face.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.860
Alright, I'm gonna try this again. This time I'm just gonna throw it straight at my face...

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.900
...because the side angle, I think my nose blocked off half of it to this eye.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.760
Now, you may be wondering what this feels like to get hit in the face, and honestly, it doesn't really feel like anything.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.340
It's almost like walking into a room with a cold draft. Things cool down a little bit, but water would stick to your skin...

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.340
...whereas liquid nitrogen just evaporates immediately.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.320
[exhales]

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740
A little in my ear, but that's not bad.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.180
Awesome! Well, I think that's good enough.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.160
So there you have it, guys! We dispelled the myth that liquid nitrogen contacting on skin...

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.020
...will instantly freeze or blind you.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.240
Now, I have to confess something here. I knew that liquid nitrogen wasn't gonna hurt me.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.700
Why? Because I play with this stuff. I've played with it for years, and I know the boundaries.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.560
I'm familiar with it. Liquid nitrogen hitting the skin reacts on a principle called called the Leidenfrost effect.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.220
It's almost like not touching it at all, because it is being repelled by an invisible barrier.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.140
When liquid nitrogen touches my face, the same thing, it basically just repels and sheds off like water.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.960
Well, that's it for this video, guys! If you're looking for some project you can try at home...

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.700
...I'll put some clickable links at the end of this video. Or you can find some others at thekingofrandom.com!

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.920
See you in the next video!
