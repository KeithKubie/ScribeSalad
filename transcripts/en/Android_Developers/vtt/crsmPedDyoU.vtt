DAVID EAST: You just finished
your app, and it looks great.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.060
So let's call it a day, because
you're ready to rest, right?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.897
Wrong.

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:08.730
I'm David East, and I'm
here to convince you

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.600
that you aren't done
yet, because you

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.160
need to build a widget.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.136
But first, what
exactly is a widget?

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:16.010
Well, a widget just
consists of a single view

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.650
that is passed to other apps,
such as the Homescreen app.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.430
And this view gets displayed
as a portion of their layout.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.320
And that single view has now
become a window to your app

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.650
from the home screen,
or even the lock screen.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.950
And this is where
the magic comes in,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.370
because you can use that
widget to display information

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.790
that your users will
care about and to trigger

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.810
actions that will bring
them back into your app.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.450
This means that you
have an opportunity

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.516
to become the core part of
your users' mobile experience.

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:43.360
And how cool is that?

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.490
Consider a simple,
non-interactive widget,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.680
like for a weather app.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.640
It can display the current
temperature overlaid

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.380
on a sunny sky to
show the weather

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.360
outside in a single
glance on the home screen.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.010
Now you just gained
a grateful user,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.410
because they don't actually
have to open up the app just

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.900
to check the weather.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.830
But widgets are about doing
things, not just showing off.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.580
So give that informative
view a job to do.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.680
A click on the view
should trigger a deep link

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.140
into your app, but don't just
open up your main activity.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.730
Instead consider, is there
a better point of entry,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.510
such as the view for
this week's forecast?

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.270
Another use for a widget
could be a control toggle.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.620
Perhaps you want to show how
strong the Wi-Fi signal is

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.440
right now.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.930
That's your view.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.560
And a click on that view could
toggle the Wi-Fi on and off

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740
without ever directing
the user into the Settings

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.090
app, which is super-useful.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.920
But these are
still only scraping

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.710
the surface of what widgets
can do for you and for users.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.230
Think about a calendar widget.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.780
The view can adjust
to fill whatever

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.780
size the user gives it, listing
out all the events for today.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.110
Clicking on an event can
open up its detail view,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.430
and scrolling through the
list can show you everything

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.300
that doesn't fit in the view.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.050
And just because
you're showing a list

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.000
doesn't mean you can't provide
space for a quick Add action

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.300
to easily create a new
event in a single click.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.100
Widgets are great,
because they empower

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.160
you to make your
app useful to users

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.400
even when they haven't
specifically opened it.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.370
And then you can easily get
users back into your app,

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.002
because you're enticing them
with completing an action.

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:10.710
So check out the
documentation on widgets

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.740
to learn how you can
get started and what

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.400
widgets can do for you.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.230
But most importantly, just
continue to build better apps.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.280
