00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.600
According to countless movies and TV shows,
sea captains, in addition to getting to wear

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.130
dapper uniforms and snazzy hats, have the
ability to marry couples aboard their ships

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.770
thanks to the power bestowed upon them by…
the sea we guess?

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.680
So can these captains actually perform marriages
that are then legally binding?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.280
As in most things in life, particularly when
the law is involved, it’s complicated.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.890
However, as a general rule, with a few exceptions
like Japan, Bermuda, and Romania, sea captains

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.310
do not have any inherent authority to officiate
weddings where the couple will then be considered

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.310
legally married.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.500
(Japanese sea captains are given such authority,
as long as they’re marrying two people who

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.590
are also Japanese, and a similar thing is
true in Romania, where interestingly Romanian

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.120
law also gives aircraft captains the same
power.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.090
Bermuda allows ship captains this same privilege,
so long as the ship they’re captaining is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030
registered in Bermuda.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.890
This was a not too subtle way to get more
cruise ships to register their boats in Bermuda-

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.690
and it totally worked, by the way.)

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.690
Despite this sort of authority not really
being a thing in most regions, it is entirely

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.289
possible, and not even terribly uncommon,
for sea captains to marry couples.

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.619
For example, one Captain Arnold Wonsever,
working for Skyline Cruises in New York, noted

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.890
he performs on average close to 200 weddings
per year.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.950
So how do all those sea captains who currently
do it get around the legality problem, and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.690
where did the ubiquitous idea that such individuals
had that authority come from in the first

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.690
place?

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.870
To begin with, because there is such a common
notion worldwide that sea captains are able

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.730
to officiate legally binding marriages, some
sea captains choose to go get the extra certification

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.750
they’d need to do so.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.350
It’s simply a great way to make a little
side money while otherwise performing their

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.310
day job of captaining the ship.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.180
It’s also in some cases a way to get more
people to come aboard your ship in the form

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.820
of wedding parties.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.280
Getting such certification isn’t difficult
in many regions, such as in the United States

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.000
where becoming ordained is absurdly easy,
with various organizations offering this service

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.220
online, in a few cases even for free.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.370
Moving beyond the certified, some sea captains
will simply officiate a wedding ceremony,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.920
but with it understood that said individual
does not have the ability to sign off on things

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.650
to make the marriage legally binding.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.100
However, there is even a caveat here in that,
depending on where you’re from, it may be

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.850
the case that declaring in front of witnesses
that you’re marrying someone that you also

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.140
then go and live with can qualify you for
a common law marriage.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.860
And, contrary to popular belief, it’s often
not required that you live with the person

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.730
for several years before said common law marriage
kicks in.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.120
In some places, it’s instant.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.670
In this case, it wouldn’t matter if you
had the guy who swabs the decks, or even a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.540
literal bilge rat, perform the ceremony.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.500
It could still be legally binding if you wanted
it to be.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.340
And, pro-tip- the bilge rat’s probably way
cheaper than getting the captain to do it.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.540
For all other cases where the captain has
no legal authority here, the individuals getting

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.400
married will typically just go get married
officially in front of a judge or minister

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.340
somewhere else either before or after their
wedding at sea.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.100
In fact, aboard some cruise ships where the
sea captain isn’t certified to officially

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.810
marry a couple, but said company offers some
sort of wedding service package, the company

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.510
will simply have an individual on board who
does have the required certification.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.840
This way the couple gets the sea captain wedding
ceremony they wanted, and the legally binding

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.980
side of things as well all in one place.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.880
This all brings us around to the question
of how this widely accepted trope came about.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.000
Well, nobody knows for sure…

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.289
But the general thought is that, as traveling
across the big blue was once a rather time

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.710
consuming process and potentially done with
many people packed aboard off to start new

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.500
lives, there was sometimes desire for marriage
while on the trip.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.500
Now with the occasional need established,
it’s also noteworthy that sea captains once

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.810
had near absolute authority over the vessels
they commanded.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.350
For example, captains from many regions historically
had the authority to do things like arrest

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.979
and jail those aboard their ships, create
birth and death certificates, more or less

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.729
function as a notary for official documents
like wills, and even in some cases were required

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.150
to note in their logs when weddings occurred
aboard their ship.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.780
Thus, it’s hypothesized that these types
of extra powers, particularly officially logging

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.850
marriages that happen on the ship and then
later reporting them to authorities, all perhaps

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.580
gave the general public the idea that captains
could legally marry couples.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.900
And, for whatever reason, sea captains seem
to have been happy to oblige such requests.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.710
In an apparent attempt to get their captains
to stop doing this, at least in the US Navy,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.560
in the early 20th century they included a
section tucked away in the Code of Regulations

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.880
dealing with this very phenomenon –

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.440
The commanding officer shall not perform a
marriage ceremony on board his ship or aircraft.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.820
He shall not permit a marriage ceremony to
be performed on board when the ship or aircraft

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.770
is outside the territory of the United States.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.200
According to the regulations, the only time
such marriages are allowed is if a registered

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.540
official who can perform a legally binding
marriage is aboard the ship or plane and all

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.740
relevant permits and permissions in accordance
with local laws of the couple being married

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.280
have been obtained.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.280
Outside of that, however, the first sentence
forbids captains from performing the ceremony,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.380
and the second sentence forbids them from
allowing others to do it when at sea, presumably

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.710
owing to the legal complication that arises
from marrying people when out in international

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.710
waters.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.960
But to sum all this up- no, as a general rule,
outside of the caveats previously mentioned,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.410
sea captains do not have the authority to
legally marry a couple.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.440
This, however, has not stopped them from performing
such ceremonies, nor Hollywood from promoting

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.730
the idea that they do have this power.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.710
This has all resulted in an almost world-wide
notion today that sea captains are able to

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.300
do this, in turn resulting in some captains
getting additional certification to be able

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:36.030
to marry couples looking for a sea based wedding
performed by someone in a snazzy uniform.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.290
The culmination of all of this has even resulted
in places like Japan and Romania granting

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.030
their sea captains this ability.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.470
And in recent years there’s even been a
push by shipping unions in the UK to likewise

00:06:46.470 --> 00:07:14.310
give sea captains this ability without having
to jump through an extra hoop of getting

00:07:14.310 --> 00:08:15.650
outside certification.
