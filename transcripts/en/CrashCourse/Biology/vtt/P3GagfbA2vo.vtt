00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.990
Congratulations! This is our last
episode of our section on

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.440
Evolution and Genetics,
which puts us at the halfway mark

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.180
of CrashCourse Biology.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.660
So far we've learned about DNA,
genetics, natural selection,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.620
how cells multiply, populations,
speciation, replication,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.039
respiration, and
photosynthesitation.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.130
I'm so proud of you.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.330
But I couldn't let this section
end without discussing the

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.840
iscussion that everybody can't
help but discuss these days:

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.430
Evolution.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.199
It's a thing.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.480
It's not a debate.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.869
Evolution is what
makes life possible.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.899
It allows organisms to adapt to
the environment as it changes.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.870
It's responsible for the enormous
diversity and complexity of life

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.679
on Earth, which not only provides
organisms with sources of food and

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:41.899
some healthy competition.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.879
It also gives us some truly
awesome stuff to marvel at.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.049
And even though evolution makes
living things different from

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:51.850
one another, it also shows
us how we're all the same.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.559
All of life, every single thing
that's alive on the Earth today,

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.969
can claim the same shared heritage,
having descended from the very

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.119
first microorganism when life
originated on this planet

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.089
3.8 billion years ago.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.219
There are people who will say
that this is all random-

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:08.140
It's not.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.200
And that this clumsy process could
not be possible for the majestic

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.799
beauty of our world.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.780
To them, I say, well at least we
agree that our world is beautiful

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.009
but, well you're probably
not going to enjoy

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:19.890
the rest of this video.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.310
To me, there are two sorts
of people in the world,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.850
those who are excited about
the power and beauty

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.289
and simplicity of the
process of evolution,

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.649
and those who don't understand it.

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.350
And somehow, I live in a country
where only 40% of the population

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.990
believes that evolution is a thing.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.140
The only possible reason for that
that I can accept is that

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.130
they just don't understand it.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.130
It's time to get real, people.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.880
First, let's understand what we
mean when we talk about

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.549
the theory of evolution.

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.329
Evolution is just the idea that
gene distribution changes

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.119
over time, which is an indisputable
fact which we observe all the time

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.179
in the natural world.

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.159
But the THEORY of evolution is a
large set of ideas that integrates

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.789
and explains a huge mass of
observations from different

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.900
disciplines including embryology,
paleontology, botany, biochemistry,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.290
anatomy and geophysics.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.920
In every day language, the
word "theory" means "hunch"

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.430
or even "hypothesis."

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.970
But in science, a theory is an
idea that explains several

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.159
phenomena at once.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.400
Thus, The theory of evolution is
a bunch of ideas that explain

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.760
many things that we, as humans,
have observed for

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.049
thousands of years.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.590
It's the theory that meticulously
and precisely explains the facts,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.790
and the facts are indisputable.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.849
So let's spend some time going
through the facts, and how

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.519
evolution explains them
all so well.

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.299
First, fossils:

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.439
The fossil record shows that
organisms that lived long ago

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.909
were different from
those that we see today.

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.420
Sounds obvious, but two
hundred years ago it seemed

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.379
a little bit crazy.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.430
When scientists first
started studying

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.519
dinosaur fossils in the 1820s,
they thought that all dinosaurs

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.060
were basically giant iguanas.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.489
That's why the first fossil
dinosaur was named Iguanodon.

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.870
It wasn't until the fossils of
two-legged dinosaurs started

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.239
showing up in the 1850s that
scientists had to grapple with

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.470
the idea that organisms of the past
were somewhat similar to ones today

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.180
like, dinosaurs were reptiles, but
many of them took on a diversity

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.879
that's barely recognizable to us.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.189
And of all those ancient
not-really-iguanas

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.930
were all extinct, either dying out
completely or evolving into

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.810
organisms that survive
today, like birds.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.120
Fossils make it clear that only
evolution can explain the origin

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.840
of these new kinds of organisms.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.900
For instance, fossils taught us
that whales used to walk.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.469
Whales are cetaceans, a group of
mammals that includes porpoises

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.980
and dolphins, and biologists long
suspected that whales descended

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.150
from land mammals.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.329
Partly because some modern whales
still have the vestigial remnants

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.340
of a pelvis and hind-limb bones.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.890
But it wasn't until recently,
the 1990s and 2000s, that

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.610
the pieces really came together.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.769
First, paleontologists discovered
fossils of DOR-oo-dons,

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.189
cetaceans that had different
skulls from modern whales but

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.409
still had the same
vestigial leg bones.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.629
Then they found even older fossil
remains of another cetacean that

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.459
actually had hind
legs and a pelvis.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.980
The pelvis wasn't fused to
the backbone like ours is,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.829
so it did swim like a whale,
but more importantly,

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.510
it still had ankle bones

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.440
And they were ankle bones that
are unique to the order that

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.250
includes bison, pigs,
hippos and deer.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.500
So by following these clues left
behind in fossilized bones,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.930
paleontologists were able to track
the origin of whales back to the

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.490
same origin as bison and pigs.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.120
This leads us to another series of
facts that evolution explains:

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.620
Not how animals were different, but
how they are incredibly similar.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.490
Last week we talked about
Carl Linnaeus and how he

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.680
classified organisms by their
structural similarities.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.430
Well he didn't know anything
about evolution or genetics,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.120
but when he began grouping
things in this way,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.180
he hit upon one of evolution's
most prominent clues:

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.590
homologous structures.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.090
The fact that so many organisms
share so many finely detailed

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.980
structures shows us
that we're related.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.460
Let's go back to the whale.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.660
Like my dog, Lemon, and me,
the whale has two limbs at the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.800
front of its body,
its front flippers.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.270
And so does this bat, its wings.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.370
Inside our limbs we all have the
very same structure: one longish

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.460
bone on top, connected to two thin
bones at the joint, followed by a

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.900
cluster of small bones called
the carpals, and then our fingers,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.660
or digits.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.450
We each use our forelimbs for
totally different purposes:

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.380
the bat flies, the whale swims,
Lemon walks and I...

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.350
you know,

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.220
jazz hands!

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.720
Building limbs like this isn't the
most efficient way to swim

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.320
or fly or walk.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.950
Our limbs have the same structure
because we descended from

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.740
the same animal, something like
this more-gan-uh-cah-don here,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.430
which, yeah, has the
same forelimb structure.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.570
In the first stage of
our existence, every

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.410
vertebrate looks almost
exactly the same.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.220
Why?

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.010
Because we're all descended from
the same initial vertebrates.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.020
So our structures are the
same as other mammals and

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.960
other vertebrates, sure, but it
also turns out that our molecules

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.590
are the same as, like, everything.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.190
In fact, if we were ever to
find life on Mars or something,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.390
the sure fire way of knowing
whether it's really

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.400
extra-terrestrial is to check and
see if it has RNA in it.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.480
All living things on our planet use
DNA and/or RNA to encode the

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.040
information that makes
them what they are.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.280
The fact that we all use the same
molecule itself suggests that

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.320
we are all related,
even if very distantly.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.020
But what's more, by sequencing
the DNA of any given creature,

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.240
we can see precisely
how alike we are.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.370
The more closely related
species are, the more of

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.250
the same DNA sequences they have.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.530
So the human genome is
98.6% identical to that

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.790
of the chimpanzee, our closest
evolutionary relative,

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.890
and fellow primate.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.440
But it's also 85%
the same as a mouse.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.950
And I wonder how you're going to
feel about this, about half of our

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.920
genes are the same as in fruit
flies, which are animals, at least.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.410
So, just as your DNA proves that
you descended from your parents,

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.540
your DNA also shows that you
descended from other organisms

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.350
and ultimately, from that one
prokaryotic microorganism

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.490
3.8 billion years ago that
is the grandparent of us all.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.220
Now when it comes to species
that are very similar,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.900
like say, marsupials, their
distribution around the world

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.490
or their biogeography, is also
explained extraordinarily well

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.920
by the theory of evolution.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.940
Animals that are the most similar,
and are the most closely related,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.780
tend to be found in the same
regions, because evolutionary

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.700
change is driven in part
by geographical change.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.750
As we talked about in
our speciation episode,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.680
when organisms become isolated
by physical barriers, like oceans

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.250
or mountains, they take their
own evolutionary courses.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.280
But in the time scales
we're talking about,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.590
the geographical
barriers are much older,

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.150
and are often even the
result of continental drift.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.210
So, marsupials.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.430
You know about marsupials.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.950
They can be found in many places,
but they aren't evenly distributed

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.930
around the world.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.830
By far the highest concentration
of them is in Australia.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.900
Even the majority of mammal fossils
in Australia are marsupials.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.210
So why is Australia rife with
kangaroos, koalas and wombats

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.290
while North America
just has, opossums?

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.410
Fossils show us that one of
marsupials' earliest ancestors

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.200
found its way to Australia before
continental drift turned it into

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.360
an island 30 million years ago.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.030
More importantly, after Australia
broke away, placental mammals like

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.240
us evolved on the main landmass and
quickly outcompeted most of the

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.880
marsupials left behind,
in what would become

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.580
North and South America.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.320
So, very few marsupials
remain in the Americas,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.470
while Australia has been drifting
around like some kind of

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.750
marsupial Love Boat.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.400
Darwin's finches are another
example of biogeographical evidence

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.529
As he wrote in The Origin of
Species, Darwin observed that

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:35.529
different species of finches on
separate Galapagos islands were

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:39.560
not only similar to each other but
were also similar to a species on

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.759
the South American mainland.

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:44.339
He hypothesized that the island
finches were all descendants of

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:47.620
the mainland finch and changed
over time to be more fit

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.149
for their environments,
a hypothesis that genetic testing

00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:52.050
has since confirmed.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.920
Now, you'll remember, I hope,
a few weeks ago, when I told you

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.220
about Peter and Rosemary Grant, the
evolutionary biologists/lovebirds

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.250
who have studied Galapagos
finches since the 1970s.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.920
One of their greatest contributions
came in 2009 when studying finches

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.290
on the island of Daphne Major.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.250
They discovered that the offspring
of an immigrant finch from another

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.990
island and a Daphne Major finch
had become a new species

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.079
in less than 30 years.

00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:19.829
This is just the latest example
of our fourth body of

00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:23.589
evolutionary evidence:
direct observation of evolution.

00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:27.910
The fact is, we have seen evolution
take place in our own lifetimes.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.100
One of the fastest and most common
changes we observe is the growing

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.779
resistance to drugs
and other chemicals.

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:37.399
In 1959, a study of mosquitos in a
village in India found that DDT

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:41.449
killed 95% of the mosquitos
on the first application.

00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:44.980
Those that survived reproduced and
passed on their genetic resistance

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.040
to the insecticide.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.649
Within a year, DDT was killing
only 49% of the mosquitos,

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:52.420
and it continued to drop.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.370
The genetic makeup of the mosquito
population changed because of the

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.009
selective pressures caused
by the use of DDT.

00:09:58.009 --> 00:10:00.230
But it's not just tiny
changes in tiny animals,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.910
we've also observed larger
animals undergoing some

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.420
pretty striking changes.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.879
In 1971, for instance, biologists
transplanted ten Italian

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:11.360
wall lizards from one island off
the coast of Croatia to another.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.550
Thirty years later, the immigrant
lizards' descendants had undergone

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.370
some amazing, fundamental changes
like, even though the original

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.120
lizards were mainly insect eaters,
their digestive systems had changed

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.649
to help them exploit the island's
most abundant food source: plants.

00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:28.209
They actually developed muscles
between their large and small

00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:31.649
intestine that effectively created
fermenting chambers, which allowed

00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:33.300
them to digest vegetation.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.249
Plus, their heads became wider and
longer to allow them to better bite

00:10:37.249 --> 00:10:38.689
and chew the grasses and leaves.

00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:41.620
These are all great examples of
microevolution, allele frequency

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.350
changes that happens rather
quickly and in small populations.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.170
Macroevolution is just that
microevolution on a much

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.389
longer time scale.

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:53.329
The sort of thing that turns
hippos into whales is a lot harder

00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:57.360
to observe for a species that,
200 years ago, thought dinosaurs

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.170
were big iguanas, but part of the
power of the human mind is being

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.879
able to see far beyond itself and
the time scales that our own

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:06.459
individual lives are limited to.

00:11:06.459 --> 00:11:08.569
And I for one, am
pretty proud of that.

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:10.540
Let's all at least agree
that the world is a beautiful

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.649
and wonderful place.

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:13.999
And life is worth studying
and knowing more about,

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:15.550
and that's what Biology is.
