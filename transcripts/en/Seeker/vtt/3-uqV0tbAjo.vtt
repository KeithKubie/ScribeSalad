00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:14.950
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.970
The tree of life is HUGE.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.970
HUGE.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.380
According to a draft described in the journal
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.949
The latest draft of the great tree named over
2.3 million species of animals, plants, fungi,

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:27.970
and bacteria.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.570
Previous versions of the tree of life only
charted about 100,000 species.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.440
But this new HUGE tree is truly an awesome
sight to behold.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.610
To get a close up look at the whole thing

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.910
There’s a link in the description.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.460
But that got me wondering, with millions and
millions of species on this planet.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.059
How do we tell them apart?

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.640
Evolution is a beautiful thing.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.870
The branches of life spread out in every direction
as life finds a way into every niche imaginable.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.960
A new species arises in a process called speciation.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.661
It’s when something happens to separate
it from all that came before, like a new trait

00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:01.890
or geological isolation.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.409
Naturalists like Charles Darwin used to tell
species apart the old fashioned way.

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.390
Just by lookin’ at em, which is called morphology.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.479
It’s telling species apart by their appearance.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.560
But there’s another way to define a species,
biologically.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.790
I’ve often heard a species defined as animals
that can reproduce and make a viable, fertile

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.070
offspring.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.810
Basically if two animals can make a baby that
lives and can later make it’s own baby,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810
then those two animals are the same species.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.800
Which is basically what the Biological Species
Concept (BSC) says.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.451
This concept was introduced by biologist Ernst
Mayr in the mid-20th century as "species are

00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:36.250
groups of interbreeding natural populations
that are reproductively isolated from other

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.250
such groups."

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.420
But both of these definitions aren’t perfect.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.850
Life finds a way.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.780
So sometimes creatures that look wildly different
can breed.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.130
Like take dog breeds for example.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.920
If you were an alien taxonomist coming to
Earth for the first time, you might be very

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.509
confused by how all these creatures, from
the smallest to chihuahua to the greatest

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.130
Dane could possibly be the same breed.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.950
On the other hand a group of animals that
look an awful lot alike can actually be different

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.950
species.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.719
In some cases different species evolved similar
traits because they’re in similar environments

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.380
like Fossas and cats, which cannot reproduce.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.500
Or different species might be closely related
and look a lot alike but can’t produce fertile

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500
offspring.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500
Like horses and donkeys.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.650
Sure they can produce a hybrid called a mule,
but they’re sterile.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.959
But even on a finer level, sometimes scientists
get a surprise and find that different species

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.870
might not be so different after all.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.170
And that’s just the trouble a group of scientists
in Australia ran into.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.110
In a study published in the journal Biology
Letters researchers found that different species

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.739
of Rock-Wallabys were swapping DNA!

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.370
Six different species of rockwallaby were
thought to be separate species because the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.800
way their genetic material package would stop
an offspring from being fertile.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.380
But upon genetic analysis the researchers
found gene flow between the species, suggesting

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.950
something else was going on, forcing them
to rethink their evolution.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.620
This finding suggests that these animals were
getting it on, making babies that could make

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.769
some more babies.

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.569
The rock-wallabies might not be “reproductively
isolated”, possibly meaning they were more

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.049
like a single species than previously thought.

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.090
Like in the case of these rock-wallabies scientists
could see a species’ history written in

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.120
its DNA.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.459
Thanks to modern technology, molecular genetic
sequencing changed the game in biology.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.049
By comparing the DNA of different animals,
scientists can see how they’re related or

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.049
not.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.069
This was a huge advance in the field of taxonomy.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.969
It’s how we know our closest cousins are
chimps and bonobos, if we went by morphology

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.390
alone, perhaps we’d think orangutans were
our next of kin.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.360
According to a study published in the Journal
of Biogeography we share more physical features

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.800
with orangutans, like beards on men and similar
shoulder blades.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.469
But molecular genetics revealed we share only
97% of our DNA with them and 99% with chimps

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:37.540
and bonobos.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.269
So it can help us not just learn about the
rest of world, but taxonomy helps us find

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.500
our place in the animal kingdom too.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.079
Some people think taxonomy and naming species
is dumb, because it does seem somewhat arbitrary.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.920
I mean humans are the ones deciding where
those lines between species are.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.579
But I think it’s really important.

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.900
Because humans need to categorize things to
make sense of this crazy, chaotic world.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.370
and it’s so important to keep track of all
the diversity of life on this planet, while

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.370
it’s still here.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.439
There’s a real risk we’re losing species
before we can even find them.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.599
So no, taxonomy isn’t perfect.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.500
But it’s the best we’ve got.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.069
Taxonomy helps us know our history, like when
recently scientists announced the discovery

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.489
of yet another human-like ancestor.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.019
So Julian asked the question, how do we determine
if they belong to the genus homo in this great

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.920
episode right here.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:35.280
