00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:01.257
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.257 --> 00:00:04.638
is get some practice writing
series in sigma notation

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:07.496
and I have a series in
front of us right over here.

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:09.304
We have seven plus nine plus 11

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:13.148
and we keep on adding
all the way up to 405.

00:00:13.148 --> 00:00:15.605
So first, let's just think
about what's going on here.

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:18.940
How can we think about what
happens at each successive term?

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.772
So we're at seven and
then we're going to nine

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:23.160
and then we're going to 11.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.467
It looks like we're adding two every time

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.714
so it looks like this
is an arithmetic series.

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:31.964
So we add two and then we add two again

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.109
and we're going to keep adding two

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.776
all the way until we get to 405.

00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:41.947
So let's think about how many times

00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.498
we are going to add two to get to 200,

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:47.975
sorry, how many times we have
to add two to get to 405.

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:50.975
So 405 is seven plus two times what?

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:53.700
So let me write this down.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.283
So if we wanted 405 is equal to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.960
seven plus two times,

00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:02.495
I'll just write two times x.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.329
I'm just trying to
figure out how many times

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.996
do I have to add two
to seven to get to 405?

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.757
And so that is going to
be equal to, let's see,

00:01:11.757 --> 00:01:13.393
so we subtract seven from both sides.

00:01:13.393 --> 00:01:15.810
We have 398 is equal to two x

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:21.155
or let's see, divide both sides by two

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:24.591
and we get this is going to be what?

00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:25.424
199?

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.787
199 is equal to x.

00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:34.344
So we're essentially adding two 199 times.

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:37.020
So this is the first
time we're adding two.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.111
This is two times.

00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:40.495
We're adding two times
one, adding two times two

00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:43.553
and here, we're adding two times 199

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:45.919
to our original seven.

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:48.899
So let's think about this a little bit.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.793
So this is going be a sum,

00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:52.710
a sum from,

00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:56.079
so there's a couple of ways
we could think about it.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.939
We could think about how
many times we've added two

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.816
so we could start with
us adding two zero times,

00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:05.506
the number seven is when we
haven't added two at all,

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:08.144
all the way to when we add two

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:08.977
199 times.

00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:13.461
And let's think about this a little bit.

00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:14.685
This is going to be,

00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:18.352
we could write it as
seven plus two times k.

00:02:19.524 --> 00:02:20.988
Seven times two,

00:02:20.988 --> 00:02:22.648
seven plus two times k.

00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:26.208
When k equals zero, this
is just going to be seven.

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:29.002
When k equals one, it's
seven times two plus one.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:30.191
Well, it's going to be nine.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.829
When k is equal to two,

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.113
it's going to be seven plus
two times two which is 11.

00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:39.254
And all the way when k is equal to 199,

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:43.422
it's going to be seven plus
two times 199 which is 398

00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:45.005
which would be 405.

00:02:45.872 --> 00:02:48.730
So that's one way that we could write it.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.504
Another way, we could also write it as,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.219
let me do this in a different color,

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.297
we could, if we want to start our index at

00:02:55.297 --> 00:02:56.714
k is equal to one

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:01.261
then let's see, it's
going to be the first term

00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:03.344
is going to be seven plus

00:03:05.214 --> 00:03:07.047
two times k minus one,

00:03:09.661 --> 00:03:11.539
times k minus one.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.060
Notice, the first term works out

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.674
because we're not adding two at all

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:17.424
so one minus one is equal to zero

00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:20.642
so you're just going to get seven.

00:03:20.642 --> 00:03:23.131
Then when k is equal to
two, the second term,

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:25.334
we're going to add two one time

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:28.158
because two minus one is two

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:29.836
so that gives us that one.

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:33.653
And so how many total terms
are we going to have here?

00:03:33.653 --> 00:03:34.744
Well, one way to think about is

00:03:34.744 --> 00:03:37.165
I just shifted the indices up by one

00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:40.729
so we're going to go
from k equals one to 200.

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:41.793
And you can verify this.

00:03:41.793 --> 00:03:43.680
When k is equal to 200,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.597
this is going to be 200
minus one which is 199.

00:03:48.838 --> 00:03:50.505
Two times 199 is 398

00:03:52.752 --> 00:03:54.835
plus seven is indeed 405.

00:03:55.675 --> 00:03:59.430
So when k equals 200, that
is our last term here.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.576
So either way, these are legitimate ways

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:04.263
of expressing this arithmetic series

00:04:04.263 --> 00:04:06.263
in using sigma notation.
