1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,490
The Joe Rogan experience. Are you
fully committed to the beard now? Yeah,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,930
I want to keep it as long as I
can. [inaudible] man, you know,

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,240
as trim to trim a little,
I trim it a little bit. Uh,

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:15,660
I just like the lady who cuts my hair
trims it every like four weeks when I go

5
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:17,910
in for a haircut,
but I don't touch it at all.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm afraid if I tried to trim it I
would just ruin it. But I've love,

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,740
love having a beard.
Why do you love having a beard is like,

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,220
it's like sunglasses for the bottom half
of your face. Ah. You know what I mean?

9
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:33,480
Hide from the world kind of. Yeah. Like
it's, it chills me out a little more.

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,390
Yeah. Especially on stage.
[inaudible] you're under the lights,

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,010
you know? Uh, and I'm, I,

12
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,880
my lip would study a little bit sweaty
and I'm thinking about my lip and I'm

13
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:48,300
like, should I wipe this? Should I move
it? And then I start to sweat more.

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,240
But now that I have the beard and
mustache, my lip gets a little sweaty.

15
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:55,950
You can't tell. So I don't get more
anxious. Uh, interesting. Yeah.

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,300
So you used to like think, boy, there's
a little couple of beads. The upper lip.

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,630
Yeah. And I'm like, can they see it?
Should I wipe? Is it like too much?

18
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:07,050
If I'm wiping, I drives me crazy.
You know, it gets me boogers.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,070
If I think I have a booger,
like, like what is going on
with my nose? What is that?

20
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,410
Is that a booger shit?
Can they see that? Oh,

21
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:16,820
I check for sure before I go on stage.
There's always approve your check. But I,

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,130
I'm so animated and I'm
always yelling and screaming.

23
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm always worried that something is like
hanging off the tip of my nose. Yeah.

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,700
And the people in the front row can't
even enjoy it. Like, what the fuck man?

25
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,990
Your nose, Bro. I've never had that. I've
had like definitely a fly down situation.

26
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,400
Oh, you never, uh, never, never
like a booger that ruin the show.

27
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,240
This is the two things that people
love to laugh at. Your fly down.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,350
And if you put a beer down on stage
and the foam comes over the top,

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,800
like your beard's coming.
Ooh,

30
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,440
those are those things. Right.
[inaudible] hi. Humor. Yeah. High Humor.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,970
Sweat. Like, like weird
sweat stains. Like, um,

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,890
when I've done specials speaking,

33
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:02,460
which Anthony Jessalyn looks new comedy
special comes out tonight. I here. Yep.

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,620
This evening. Midnight. I guess Netflix
does it. Yeah. Excited. Very excited. Wow.

35
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:10,200
I've been seeing your set. It's
fucking fantastic. Thank you. Thanks.

36
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,590
I think this is the best, uh, I've ever
done, so I'm uh, I'm pumped for it.

37
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,490
So beautiful thing about comedy, man.
Keep working, keep paying attention to it.

38
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:19,230
You get better at it,
you know, really. I mean,

39
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,630
Dom Irrera and I had this conversation
just a couple of months ago.

40
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,420
He looked Joe, he goes, I'm
never been better. He goes,

41
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:28,050
I'm fucking a thousand years old because
I've never been better at comedy. Yeah.

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,470
As long as you don't quit, you don't,
you don't, you don't ever get worse,

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,860
I don't think. Right. You don't,

44
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,870
as long as you don't give up because
some guys don't quit, but they give up.

45
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,160
Exactly. Yeah. They just go through
the same material every single time.

46
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,070
You're like, what are you
doing here? You're just like,

47
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,970
you're just trying to get out of the
house. You're not trying to get better.

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,250
I was a little of that. Yeah. Yeah.
It's like if you're not right, that's,

49
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,730
I guess that's a difference between
also guys who put out specials or I say

50
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:58,130
women too or, and people who don't. Some
people just don't put anything out. Yeah,

51
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:01,210
no. Yeah. Once you put it out, like
I put it out because I'm like, I'm,

52
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,870
I'm done with this now it's getting
boring. It's not going to get better.

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,210
It's good as I can make it,
but because of that,

54
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,000
then I have to come up with a new hour.

55
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,930
If I did any specific schedule you like
to fall too, right? If I'm correct, I try.

56
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:17,200
I did it. I did a year in La, like
at the store every night, you know,

57
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,860
and like once a month I do Largo
and try it all out at once.

58
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,160
And then a, at the end of that
year, I had about 40 minutes,

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,310
went to clubs for a year
every weekend for a year.

60
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,100
And then once that I
had the hour after that,

61
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,150
then I did a year of theaters and at
the end of that year I taped the special

62
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:38,440
and, and uh, and was done
with it. So you're on like a
three year plan? Pretty much,

63
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,370
yeah. And that might change, you
know, as I've gotten older, uh,

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,450
the idea of a four year plan sounds a
little bit nicer and you have other things

65
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:51,070
going on that, uh, that it's not
as, I'm not as worried. Yeah, yeah.

66
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,930
Yeah.
I was trying,

67
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,080
I think two years seems
to be right for me,

68
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:00,260
but it might be better to give
it a little more time. Right.

69
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:04,370
Just a little bit more time to tighten
things up and Polish and you know,

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,760
add layers and add extra punch.
It's like,

71
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,480
you know those guys like in
when I started out in Boston,

72
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,970
there was guys that had been
doing the same set forever.

73
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,540
There's pros and cons to
that and the pro is God damn.

74
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:22,070
They had that shit down tight where it
was just punchline, rapid punchline,

75
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:26,810
pause, punchline. They knew the,
the economy of words was perfect.

76
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,890
There was no, no fat in the bits they
had. They had tightened all that stuff up.

77
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,813
Yeah.

78
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,820
My one of my biggest fears is like taping
the special and then coming up with

79
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,130
like a great tag. You know
what I mean? Like that.

80
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:44,570
I want it to be done when I shoot
it because that feeling is awful.

81
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,640
It's the worst. Done that.
Yeah. So by sucks it sucks

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,480
back in. I once went back
in my last special thoughts
and prayers I ADR to line.

83
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,990
I like walked off stage and was like,
oh fuck,

84
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,270
I should use this word.
And I,

85
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:05,060
it just occurred to me in the moment
that I was using the wrong words.

86
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:09,410
So I went back and 80 yard and you can
obviously tell that it's like me talking

87
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:13,310
and then it's like clearly a different,
like a different voice. A just one word.

88
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,300
But I had to do ADR stand for, I know
what it means, but what does it stand for?

89
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,660
Jamie knows he's an actual audio guy.

90
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,700
Automated Dialogue Replacement and why
it's automated is lost in my head forever,

91
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,140
but that's what it means. Ah, okay.

92
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,460
I wouldn't have guessed
that in a million years.
