1
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,270
So I'm just want to go back
very briefly to Hemingway's.

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,980
Um, leather to dawn does pass.
It was just two reminders.

3
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,500
Um, what we, um,

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,430
are up against this claim
on Hemingway's pot. Um,

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,270
and there's this,

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,170
George Kaufman is here and she
claims they want to cut it all out.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,670
Indian Cam story because the
ENL time chapters, Jesus,

8
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,380
I view our sharp to how about it?

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,540
Of course they can do it because the
stuff is so tight and hard and everything

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,220
hands on everything else. So you know,
this is the um, very recognizable,

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,420
a pasture on the part of Hemingway
that everything is tight and hot and

12
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,140
everything hangs on everything else.
So,

13
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,630
but giving the publication history of um,

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,640
the various chapters and also the stories
published separately, um, you know,

15
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:06,870
whether or not there is in fact,
um, and organic unity among them.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,900
There's the big question.
And last time, um, you know,

17
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:14,901
we try to give him the benefit of the
doubt and we read the intro chapters and

18
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:20,040
the stories as they've, they
were indeed organically, um,

19
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,930
integral, um, to one another.
So today will, um, try that.

20
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,750
Try a, some other combinations. Uh,

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,840
but I found this picture of
Hemingway and those parcels.

22
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,690
Um,
so you know,

23
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,690
Hemingway is to the far right and
there's those parcels to the far left.

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,400
And, um, I was always loved this. Um, and,

25
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,650
and they actually both rolled about war.

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,660
Those parcels has a novel called
three novels, a three soldiers, uh,

27
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,080
very, very, uh, great novel
about war as well. So, you know,

28
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:59,470
you can sort of see that they
have a lot in common. Um, and um,

29
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,370
here's another input in a
leather, uh, two M and Wilson. Um,

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,260
this is, um, slightly earlier, um,

31
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,290
finish the book of 14 stories with a
chapter in our time between each to give

32
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:18,930
the picture of the whole
between examining it in detail,

33
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,110
like looking with your eyes as something,

34
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,470
say a passing coastline and then looking
at at it with 15 x binoculars or rather

35
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:35,481
than maybe looking at it and then going
in and living in it and then coming out

36
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,640
and looking at it again,
it has a pretty good unity.

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,680
So once again, that all important word
for having way, um, pretty good unity.

38
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:51,150
And that's a very strong claims, not
really pretty good. It's damn good. Um,

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,560
but in any case, uh, was all with
new about this, um, description,

40
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,990
um, is the idea of zooming
in, zooming out rate.

41
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,620
This is very much the approach
that we've been taking. Um,

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,180
and we've been thinking of it in
terms of micro and macro rate.

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,130
So this, um, the first set of
terms that we started out with,

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,900
um, and today I'd like
to add a few more terms.

45
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,760
There's also line up, um, in kind of
similar way, obviously not the same,

46
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,340
um, but they are kind of
interrelated. So micro, macro,

47
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,790
um, obviously up close from a
distance, um, before and after.

48
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,900
That's especially important when
the soldiers coming back home. Uh,

49
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,340
what happened during a war,
what happened after the war, um,

50
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,540
and going along with that intensity of
the experience when you're in the war and

51
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,910
as we know from the story.
So it was just home,

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,810
the staleness of it when you come back.
Um,

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,340
and then another pair of Toms is very
important to our class actually is trategy

54
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,820
and comedy. Um, since
this is all writing class,

55
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:05,350
I also wanted to stop for just one
minute and talk about this as a kind of a

56
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:10,270
useful, uh, analytic and
organizational structure to use,

57
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,220
um, in your papers. Um,

58
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,250
so start out with one pair of analytic
terms and then try out the various

59
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,780
variations of that term, um,
in the course of the paper. Um,

60
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,090
and that will give you a really
tight structure is that there's what,

61
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:28,810
how many weight ones? Um,
so I'll explain this more,

62
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:32,840
but just keep this in your mind. Um,
you know, thing of your papers, um,

63
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,380
as theme and very Asian use,
inventing different terms, um,

64
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,660
that would allow for that
theme and variation structured.

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,220
So we talk more about the
substance of implication of that.

66
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,980
But for now, I think that this is
really what Hemingway himself, um,

67
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,620
is doing because such a great writers,
good example to us. Um, so anyway,

68
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,220
um,

69
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,140
the for today we'll be looking
at for a possible clusters,

70
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:03,490
you know, want to emphasize that
these are just conjectural clusters.

71
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,210
Um, we can test them. Um,

72
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,140
the first one is a chapter
seven and soldiers home.

73
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,550
Uh, and then we'll be looking at
chapter nine and Mr and Mrs. Elliott,

74
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,840
hilarious story. Um, chapter
10 and cat in the rain.

75
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,820
And then chapter 12, um, and
bake two hearted river, part two.

76
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,160
Um, so first chapter
seven, um, once again,

77
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:35,050
we're back in wartime Europe.
The experience of combat, uh,

78
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,900
while the bombardment was knocking
the tranche two pieces f Asada,

79
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,860
he leave very flat and sweated
and pray, Oh, Jesus Christ,

80
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:49,240
get me out of here. Dear Jesus, please
get me out. Jesus, please, please,

81
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:52,480
please Christ
the shelling.

82
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,370
Move further up the line.

83
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,060
We went to work on a trend and in the
morning the sun came up and the day was

84
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,150
hot and muggy and cheerful and quiet.

85
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,980
Then that's night back at Maestra.
He did not tell to go.

86
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,940
He went upstairs with at
a villa Rosa about Jesus,

87
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,190
and he never told anybody.

88
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,880
So this is the suit of the class
dynamics of before and after,

89
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,330
and the intensity of the experience when
you're in the thick of the battle and

90
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,230
the sense that you really
have lost it all, um,

91
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,860
ones that experience is behind you.
Um,

92
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,830
so what Hemingway is exploring
here and that he would,

93
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,330
we'll see you also explore in
greater length in soldier's home.

94
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,230
Um,

95
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,230
is that in transitive relation of
emotions across time is a terrible thing.

96
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,331
Um,
you know,

97
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:57,800
we think so much about the question of
sustainability is important for things to

98
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:00,530
be sustainable across time.
Um,

99
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,620
and it seems that Hemingway is saying
they're basically intense emotions are not

100
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:09,380
sustainable across time.
And we'll see it as in a big way,

101
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,460
Ashley in Faulkner, in the sound,
the fury in the Quentin section,

102
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,180
whether or not we're even when
we're devastated by something,

103
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,930
whether or not that sense of devastation,
uh,

104
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,320
will be with us even a
short moment afterwards. Um,

105
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:29,270
so it seems that when he's
fearing, you know, in,

106
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,250
in this kind of more a fear
for his life, um, Jesus,

107
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,570
um, and that's really a kind of
a name for something. You know,

108
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:42,170
it's not necessarily Jesus, although
in this case it actually is Jesus.

109
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,970
But Jesus could also be a shorthand for
something that we really want just to

110
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:50,330
invoke. And it's very much a
presence for is that moment.

111
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,370
And then the meaning of
Jesus has completely lost
even the next night. Um, so,

112
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,380
um, was, was, was interesting
and I guess quite bleak about is,

113
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,150
um, is that we really can hold on to
our own experience. Right? You know,

114
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,580
we'd like to think that if
we've been through this,

115
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,390
that is ours for good is ours for life.
Um,

116
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,120
and it seemed snap to the case. So, uh,

117
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,640
let's move on now to soldiers
home. Um, and you know, we,

118
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,180
no, um, I'm just realizing that
Mike is all the way down. Um,

119
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,380
we know that there's crabs was a soldier
fighting in basically all the famous

120
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,230
battles in world war one. Um, and then he,

121
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,460
he comes home too late.
So by which time,

122
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:41,450
all the other people have been bad in
that Italian stories about war atrocities.

123
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,270
So, you know, there were these listening,
um, to him anymore. Um, and his mother's,

124
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,200
she was worried that he should
find a job. Um, so this is,

125
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,710
um, the, the very, um, near the middle,

126
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,440
just one line near the middle of
the story that having breakfast,

127
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,960
a craft is reading the papers and
learning about, um, you know, um,

128
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,340
his father not wanting to
people to be roughed up. Um,

129
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,380
and then meanwhile perhaps looked at
the bacon fat hardening on his plate.

130
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,030
Um,

131
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,030
and I think that that is in some sense
the most graphic metaphor for the

132
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,101
Hemingway has come up with material
emblem of our own relation to our own

133
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:30,540
experience. That this is the chemical
transformation, you know, is so natural.

134
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,720
I mean, last time we talked about the
naturalization of pain, right? You know,

135
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:39,170
childbirth is as natural as rain and the
pain that we inflict on all of this is

136
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,830
also as natural as rain. Um, and here, um,

137
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,740
for fresh experience to go stale,

138
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,190
it is as natural as the bacon
becoming stale on your plate.

139
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,740
Um, so that's just kind of, uh, you
know, using a very common object,

140
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,120
um,

141
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,920
to talk about the fate
of emotions across time.

142
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,780
Uh, and the fact that to go on living, um,

143
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,240
is not accumulative.
Um,

144
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,300
there's a loss and tell the longer you
live mean this is a terrible thing.

145
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:20,940
You know, we like to think that
some things can be cumulative,

146
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,770
but according to this paradigm,
um,

147
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,190
it's almost as if the longer you live,

148
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,240
the more you lose actually.

149
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:34,140
And we know that Hemingway actually
chose to end his own life, right?

150
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:38,110
So this is almost a kind of, um, I mean,

151
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,130
he wasn't thinking of suicide at
that point at this early point,

152
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,490
but it's almost a justification for
suicide that you want and it at the moment

153
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:51,270
of greatest intensity and prayers,
emotional satisfaction,

154
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:55,020
you don't want to lose
that. Um, so there's that.

155
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,460
The Bacon fat hardening on his plate.
Um,

156
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,250
and then the very,
and of the story,

157
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,150
well that was all over now anyway,

158
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:11,330
he would go over to the school yard and
watch how and plate indoor basketball.

159
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,300
Um, no detail is trivial.
No detail is random. Well,

160
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,230
not always, but quite often, I mean, you
know, this is very significant is how, um,

161
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,050
in Hemingway, um, and is once,

162
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,350
it's almost the kind of, um,
uh, kind of a larger, um,

163
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,080
slightly larger view of moving away
from the bacon fat on the plate to the

164
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:37,290
larger family situation.
Um,

165
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,220
craps was a very good
soldier during World War One.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,980
He's not a very efficient player
instead of Lillian life, right?

167
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,330
Helen is the players just
in the early the basketball,

168
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,360
basketball player,
but she's also a player in a bigger sense.

169
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:59,620
It's just more consequential in
life than Krebs ever would be.

170
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,570
Uh, and it's the sadness of being
consequential, been Ali consequential,

171
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:05,141
important,

172
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:10,141
very good at what you're doing in
one context and being terrible being,

173
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,790
you know,
not attended to and not listen to,

174
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,830
uh, being completely on
the side lines once, uh,

175
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,700
you put in a different kind of situation.
So crabs is on the sidelines,

176
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,750
a mere spectator,
um,

177
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,820
as Helen plays both the indoor basketball
and also the game of life that he's

178
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,890
probably not going to be very good
at. Um, so obviously that these,

179
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:43,150
I think these two stories, um,
the connection between them very,

180
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:46,300
very tight. Um, you know, they
are in two different settings,

181
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,230
but they really are making
your sadly the same point. Um,

182
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,520
so let's move on now to more interesting,

183
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,830
kind of not so quite so clear cut,
uh,

184
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,450
between chapter nine. Um,
and Mr and Mrs. Elliott. Uh,

185
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,500
so it's,
um,

186
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,850
in many ways the kind of Hemingway
that we're very familiar with,

187
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,880
the Hemingway in the sun also rises to
Hemingway who talked about bar fights and

188
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,460
he also does it in a death in the
afternoon. Um, so this is, um,

189
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,660
the kind of classic
Hemingway. Um, the first,

190
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,980
except there's a twist here.
Um,

191
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:30,030
the first matador got the horn through
his sought hand and the crowd who did

192
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,014
him,

193
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,180
the second matador slip and the
ball court in through the belly,

194
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,690
he hung onto the horn with one hand and
how the other tight against the place

195
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,660
and a ball rammed him
where am against the wall.

196
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,990
And a horn came out and he lay in the
sand and then got up like crazy drunk and

197
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:56,860
tried to slug the man carrying him out,
carrying him away and yeah, offers,

198
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:58,180
sought the,
he fainted.

199
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,960
The kit came out and had to kill five
balls because you can't have more than

200
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,470
three. Matadors. Um, you know,

201
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,340
this is the emotion I think that actually
is the dominant emotion in, in no time.

202
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:14,320
This isn't exactly tragedy.

203
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,190
It doesn't rise to the level of tragedy,

204
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,490
but it's not exactly funny eater.

205
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,220
And this is really the combination
of the tragedies, lash, comedy, um,

206
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,860
that is so important to having way.
Um,

207
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,870
nobody gets killed except for
the ball five of them. Um,

208
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,640
but that's supposed to happen.
Um,

209
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,370
the first would be to completely
incompetent and matadors.

210
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,760
Um, they're making a fast,
really of the ball fight.

211
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:43,870
Um,

212
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,870
and meanwhile it's also farcical in a
different way that you have to split by

213
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,680
the roofs.

214
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Even the two first two matadors
and a complete mess of everything.

215
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,840
Um, you still have to go by the rules.
So he can have more than three matadors.

216
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:04,490
And so one single person is to kill five
balls because after Roe, um, so, you know,

217
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:09,200
this is the kind of the combination.
We don't know whether to laugh or to cry.

218
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,070
Um, and, um, I guess we laugh, uh,

219
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,400
because it's not worth crying over,
but it really is not that funny.

220
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:20,930
And this is the nature of
the kind of very complicated,

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,290
dark,
um,

222
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,340
kind of comedy that we get in Hemingway
and that will be getting in Fitzgerald

223
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,080
and Faulkner as well. So this is really
the common ground. Very interesting.

224
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,010
Um, compounding of Java is usually, uh,

225
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,100
we used to thinking of tragedy and comedy
as two discrete John is quite Sanford,

226
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:45,340
right? But in American literature, um,

227
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,700
I mean this is really goes back to the
19th century in American literature.

228
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,530
Quite often there's the kind
of a mixing of John Arras, uh,

229
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,970
with tragedy,
uh,

230
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
been energized Ashley by comedy
and producing really interesting,

231
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,080
a kind of experimental
Jara. Um, so, okay, so that,

232
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,120
keep that in mind as
well. Both fighting, um,

233
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,290
and in competent matadors and then
the kid having to clean up the mess.

234
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,260
So it's with seem on the face of it,

235
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,290
it was seemed that that really couldn't
have any relation to Mr and Mrs.

236
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,020
Elliott,

237
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,620
which has nothing to do with or fighting
about a poleward or someone who's

238
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,720
trying to be a poet and
his wife and stuff. Uh,

239
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,360
but this very interesting
history behind this story. Um,

240
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,510
and Mr Mrs. Elliott with the story was
first published in the little review last

241
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:46,070
time. We talked about how um, a lot of
the pieces came out in little magazines,

242
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,580
right? So this is the
little review, um, 19,

243
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:53,480
24 and 25 edition.
Um,

244
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,490
and then it came out again in our time,
obviously,

245
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,680
um, the liver right addition,
uh, the American edition 1925.

246
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,700
Um,

247
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,700
and it turns out the Hemingway actually
has written very telling leather to

248
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,110
Horace liberal rate. Um,
can see it here. I mean,

249
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:20,111
actually I think that if you go to classes
for you to look at the image online,

250
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:24,260
you should be able to zoom in and actually
look at all the words. But anyway,

251
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:28,000
this is the transcript of
one of the paragraphs. Um,

252
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,420
as you will see,

253
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,870
I have revised the Mr and Mrs. Elliott
Story and entirely eliminated the obscene

254
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:40,760
image. It is a shame.
It had to be a change,

255
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,410
but as you say,

256
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,590
it would be a very silly play to get
the entire first book suppressed for the

257
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:52,860
sake of a few funny cracks.
In one story, Jamie,

258
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,780
he ran it in this original form.

259
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:58,830
This is still a little review
editor of a little review. Uh, Jane,

260
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:03,831
he ran it in original form and
did not get into any trouble.

261
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,940
Okay. So with talking about
a libel suit that looks like,

262
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,530
um, that, um,

263
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,360
legal action could be visited upon
Hemingway because of the story.

264
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:20,361
So what could be the cause for this
legal action against Hemingway?

265
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,700
Um, the title of the story
is suggestive, right?

266
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,010
You know,
Allie,

267
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,000
there's a kind of very important
name and both American division,

268
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,860
British literature, very, very
important name. Um, this is,

269
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,370
ts Elliot obviously are known
to having way they were, they,

270
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,700
they were in the same
circles. And um, and um,

271
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,220
both in England and also
in, uh, in France. Um, and,

272
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,120
um, ts Elliot with one of
the most important poets,

273
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:58,140
20th century poets, best known
for the pump, the wasteland, uh,

274
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,160
would go on in 1948 to win
the Nobel prize. So, you know,

275
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,360
major poet, um, and uh, he,

276
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,540
um, this is a picture of,
um, of his first wife,

277
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,780
Vivian and hourly this on the far
right and Vivian is on the far left.

278
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:19,800
Um,

279
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,800
and it was the marriage that ended in
divorce and with Vivian having lost the

280
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:30,420
loss of mental problems. So in
this kind of very, uh, public, uh,

281
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,180
dissolution of the
marriage were very painful.

282
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:38,010
Ashley when she was clearly
going crazy. Um, so, um,

283
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,300
it, the, the Hemingway story
isn't really about that,

284
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:47,301
but it's really making fun of something
that really didn't end up being all that

285
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:50,920
funny. I mean, there was a
candidate who ran this episode, uh,

286
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,010
into this alley is live.
Um,

287
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,050
but the way that having way
is talking about it initially,

288
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,500
um, is, um, is this, uh,

289
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,360
this is his version and as you will see
is actually changed the spelling, right?

290
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:09,180
Ts Elliot, just one hour. Um,

291
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,010
and so it was just to remove the
threat of legal action from himself.

292
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,670
I has changed the spelling of Elliot.
Um,

293
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,760
and this is the story that he tells.

294
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,970
Mrs. Elliott and a girlfriend
now slept together in the big,

295
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:28,710
muddy,
evil bad.

296
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,450
They had many a good cry
together in the evening.

297
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,750
They all said at dinner together in a
garden on the plane tree and the heart

298
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,120
evening when drew and Elliot drank
white wine and Mrs. Elliott and the

299
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:50,560
girlfriend make and they were
all quite happy. Once again,

300
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,600
you know, this is the happy ending
in quotation mouth in Hemingway.

301
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,400
Um, so, but you can really see
why this would, that, that,

302
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,750
that Ellie is at least ts Elliot,
um,

303
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,140
with contemplate legal
action, um, against, um,

304
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,730
Henry obviously the suggestion of
a lesbian relationship. Um, not,

305
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,430
um, really, uh,

306
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,460
there was nothing actually
in the actual life of Vivian.

307
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,670
Elijah suggested there was
a lesbian relation. Um,

308
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,410
she did have an affair very soon after
she was married to ts Elliot. Um,

309
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,100
but with a man, um, Bertrand Russell
actually a famous philosopher. Um,

310
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,050
so, um, there was this, this,
this is complete fabrication
on a par that Hemingway.

311
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,280
Um,

312
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,280
but I think that this actually possibly
something else there's mixed into this

313
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:46,551
story is the less than relationship
that starts this from being a tragedy.

314
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,680
Right? You know, it really would
have been quite tragic. Um, you know,

315
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,270
if the girlfriend had not been there,

316
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:57,271
but it's really this re triangle or
relation that enables Mr Elliot to drink

317
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:02,530
white wine and to spend all
night writing poetry. He doesn't,

318
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,730
especially wanting to be in the
same room with his wife, um,

319
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,760
and misses alley and the girlfriend have
many a good cry together in the Beckman

320
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,760
that you've all bear. Um, and
they were all quite happy. So, um,

321
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,980
Hemingway really, um, is in one
sense thinking of the historic,

322
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,560
uh,
ts Elliot and Vivian Alec.

323
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:28,250
But I think that he was also
actually thinking of another couple,

324
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,800
very good friends of his,

325
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:34,801
at one point he talks about a great
length in the Moodle or fees and other

326
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,740
iconic figure in American and the ratio
of Gertrude Stein and her companion.

327
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,600
Um, lifelong companion,
Ashley, uh, Lsb Tacos desk,

328
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:49,720
Gertrude Stein on the right and aloes,
um,

329
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,500
on the left. Um, and um,

330
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,390
Hemingway also makes fun of them in
the movie blow fees, but, um, he,

331
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,370
if I'm actually, if you guys have
seen Willie Allen's midnight in Paris,

332
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,180
um,
you haven't seen it,

333
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,170
try to see it on DVD, but that
goes through the, is very,

334
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:15,640
very important there as it's
really a mentor, um, to,

335
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,050
to have anyway, I'm sorry. Um, you
know, where actually thought of,

336
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:23,380
I'm showing this but it's still running.
So you know, we don't have it on DVD.

337
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:27,370
You show it. Um, but in any case,
if you see that Woody Allen movie,

338
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:30,420
you will see the go to Stan was crucial,
um,

339
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,110
both to other young writers, but
also the Hemingway. Um, and so,

340
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,410
uh, very, um, long lasting.

341
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,630
This was actually a
sustainable relationship,

342
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:44,290
the lesbian relationship FALive really,
um,

343
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,970
and happy as much as any
relationship can be happy.

344
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,540
Those were very,
very happy.

345
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,080
So I think that we'll have in
way is as is done actually, um,

346
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,920
to produce this, um,
tragedies slash comedy,

347
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,740
um,

348
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,740
is to compound the very unhappy ts Elliot
a marriage to Vivian with much happier

349
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,720
companionship between Gertrude
Stein and Lsb told us. Um,

350
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,760
and, um, he really wasn't thinking
of, um, live or from Gertrude Stein.

351
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:23,720
She was not mentioned by
name, uh, but she could not,

352
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,410
not have been on his mind. So it
was just a really interesting, uh,

353
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,790
kind of a capsule summary, actually
have a lot of American literature, um,

354
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,680
in there. Um, so I think that
that's really the connection,

355
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,240
uh, with, uh, chatter, NY, um,

356
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,600
Nelson most of the subject matter and
there's no ball filing in the story. Um,

357
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,850
but the kind of the tragedy,
uh, narrowly averted, uh,

358
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,900
turning into a comedy of kind of a farce,
uh,

359
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,700
halfway between comedy and saw us,
um,

360
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,750
that is the ultimate outcome of
their kind of unusual arrangement.

361
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,670
Um, and, but still, you know,

362
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,820
it doesn't rise to the level of tragedy.
Um,

363
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,700
and that's the most important
point for him in weight. So, um,

364
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,800
less move on now to the next cluster.

365
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,300
Um, and I should stop
here for a moment. Um,

366
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,470
and talk a little bit about,
um,

367
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,530
the kind of the straw analytic structure
that we'll be using for the next,

368
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,190
um, next set, uh, of,
um, stories and chapters.

369
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,270
Um,

370
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,120
but actually beginning with chapter
nine and Mr and Mrs. Elliott, we,

371
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,280
we're beginning to see a kind of a logic
of substitution so that Gertrude Stein

372
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,520
Alice be tacos a relationship
taking the place, the,

373
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,610
there's relatively happy relationship
taking the place of the unhappy historical

374
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:04,001
relation between Vivian and hears Elliot
so that Hemingway you can get to a

375
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:09,500
place where he wants to be.
Um, and so taking the place,

376
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,160
um,

377
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,160
substitution is a good
thing in their chapter and,

378
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,740
um, in their story, um,

379
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,550
we'll explore the many,

380
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,360
the meaning of substitution in the
other clusters. Um, sometimes it's good,

381
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:30,590
sometimes it's not so good. Um,
it's always kind of a mix mixture.

382
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,340
Um, but, um, on the whole,

383
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,770
I would say that Hemingway's is,

384
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,590
is much more interested in
comedy than, than tragedy. Um,

385
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,400
and I'm sort of going against Aristotle
and in fact, the whole tradition,

386
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,990
uh, western thinking about
Jaras tragedy is the high,

387
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,250
a dignified, very dignified
are a Greek tragedy. Um,

388
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,140
and that's what really ever sallowed
hotspot in the poetics is his attention is

389
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:05,640
really all given to tragedy. Comedy
gets about two lines in the poetics.

390
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,830
Um, so, you know, I think that, um,

391
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,390
tragedy just has the different
kind of sensuality to,

392
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,020
uh, to the entire western Canon. Umm,

393
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:21,050
but comedy arguably is actually just
as interesting and just as complex.

394
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,500
So,
um,

395
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,240
in the rest of the course we'll be
thinking about the ways in which comedy

396
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:31,200
Ashley is right next door
to Chaz today. Um, you know,

397
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:33,720
we have to rethink the landscape,
um,

398
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:38,350
rather than thinking of these two as being
on opposite ends of the spectrum, um,

399
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,680
to think about kind of,
um,

400
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,960
almost kind of like emotional
proximity between tragedy and comedy.

401
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,130
I'm not,

402
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:51,060
because this is a natural trumps dimity
but because the riders that we are

403
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:52,070
looking at,
um,

404
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:56,880
they tend to have that really kind of
interesting kind of thinking and mixing of

405
00:27:56,881 --> 00:28:00,940
genres. Um, so in the next, um,

406
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,640
cluster chapter 10 and cat in the rain,
uh,

407
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,370
well first of all, look at, um,

408
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,570
one kind of substitution
taking place in chapter 10, um,

409
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,460
the horse and pick a door,
uh,

410
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,010
and then the cat and the cat in the rain.
Um,

411
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,210
I should mention that,
um,

412
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,550
there's a difference between
the picador and um, matador. Um,

413
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,910
this is a distinction that I didn't know
about before I started reading about

414
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:35,000
having way, um, is that the matador is the
one who actually stinks. You know, who,

415
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,910
who actually kills the ball, the ball. Um,

416
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,090
the picador his function
is to weaken the ball.

417
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,140
The picador never actually kills the bull,

418
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:48,420
so it was always a kind of a three step
ceremony ball by the time he comes up

419
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,790
Bullis weekend already, uh, by very
few sticking knives into him. Um,

420
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,380
and then they'll pick, the dog tries
to do major job of weakening the ball.

421
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,210
Um, and then the matador comes out
and actually kills the ball. Um,

422
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,800
and the, the picador doesn't actually
come out on foot. He's always,

423
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,820
um, on a horse. And, um, and we, um,

424
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,980
find out how Hemingway
feels about that practice,

425
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,170
um, about a picador coming out on a
horse and fighting with the ball. Um,

426
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,030
they web where the white horse on
the legs and he kneed himself out.

427
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,930
The picador twisted the stirrup straight
and Paul and hauled up into the saddle,

428
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,860
the horses and trails and down in the
blue bunch and swung backward and forward

429
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,320
as he began to cantor.

430
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,840
The Ma knows whacking him on the back of
his legs to Abrazo some terrible thing.

431
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:56,200
Ashley, this has been bad. It's been
banned in many Spanish cities, um,

432
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,410
because it's just so,
um, incredibly cruel.

433
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,630
And here are two images, uh, of, um,

434
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,680
that kind of substitution,

435
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,770
shameless use of the horse
as a shield against the ball.

436
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,560
Um, and um, we can see, um,

437
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,820
the expressions on the, I mean,
you know, they used to it, I mean,

438
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:23,080
this is done all the time.
This is not exceptional.

439
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,490
Colanders on part of the pig a door.
That's the, that's part of the game.

440
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,230
Um,
and uh,

441
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,880
but still it's very hard to take when
you're looking at it and, um, to,

442
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:37,690
to see that Andrea was actually
coming up right at that moment. Um,

443
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,510
and here's another image. There's
just countless images. Um,

444
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,250
all you have to do is to type in
pig the doors, Hawes on Google,

445
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:49,710
and you find all these
images. Um, so, um, is, um,

446
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,560
Hemingway, even though he's
a big, uh, Aficionados, um,

447
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,630
of the matador coming out and we'll
see his celebration of this one on one

448
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:03,430
battle, the train, the
matador and the Horse, um,

449
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,850
just finds this practice. Oh,
they're despicable. I mean,

450
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:10,120
this is really substitution at its worst.
Um,

451
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,500
and so he's talking about,
you know, this kind of, um,

452
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,840
just just kind of, um, you know, it's,
it's hard to wrap our minds around. Um,

453
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,620
you know, there's kind of completely
ritualized, uh, practice. Um,

454
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,270
and so that's what he talks about.
Um,

455
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,340
in chapter 10 and then in
cat, in the rain, once again,

456
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:34,350
there's no thematic
continuity, right? Between, uh,

457
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,440
the chapter 10 and the cat in the rain
about when that young American couple in

458
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:42,100
the hotel completely nonviolent,
um,

459
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,360
setting. Um, and it doesn't
seem very dramatic either.

460
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,220
In some sense it seems as if nothing
happens in that story. Um, but, uh,

461
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,690
there is a kind of interesting,
um,

462
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,760
way in which we can create that story,
um,

463
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:03,180
as a story about substitution as well.

464
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,030
Um,

465
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:09,030
in the sense that the young way
does have one very emphatic desire.

466
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,030
Anyway, I want a cat. She said,
I want a cat, I want a cat.

467
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:20,380
Now if I can have long hair and the fun,
I can have a cat.

468
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,490
So the cat obviously is a
shorthand for something else.

469
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:27,961
Right?

470
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:32,961
And she's actually looking at this kitty
in the rain trying to hide from the

471
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:39,490
rain under the table and
thinking of the cat, uh,

472
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,460
and she says, okay, you know,
if I can have anything else,

473
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,690
I can know my own silver at a table.
I can have new clothes,

474
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:52,250
I want a cat.
But even those things,

475
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,210
eating at the table with my own silver,
even bad,

476
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,170
it's probably just a metaphor
for something else as well.

477
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,160
Um,
and so the wanting a ACAT,

478
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,310
the fact that it's such an artificial and,
um,

479
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:11,780
persuasive substitution for something
that she doesn't have in the life,

480
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,070
um, suggest that there is something, um,

481
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:21,110
this very peaceful story,
um,

482
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:26,440
does have something in common
with a very violent episode, uh,

483
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,630
in chapter nine,

484
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,390
and it really has to do with,
um,

485
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,260
with, with, with the way, uh,

486
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,760
we think about what is adequate, um, to,

487
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,940
you know, what we could call a good life
or a good marriage or, you know, good.

488
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,240
Anything. I mean, you know,
having ways and really thinking,

489
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:49,790
especially if this story is about,
you know,

490
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:54,260
what constitutes a good marriage of
what is absent that would make for a bad

491
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:57,640
marriage. Um, but it really is, um,

492
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,680
thinking generally and abstractly about
what counts as a good life or what kangs

493
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,160
as being a good a player in a bowl five,

494
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,850
um, and coming out and using your horse
as a shield that doesn't count as, as, as,

495
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,290
as married. Um, for
Hemingway. Um, so um, in,

496
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:23,410
in this case, um, is in the,

497
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,690
the wives,
if we think about the configuration,

498
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,900
she goes out in the rain and umbrella
opens up behind her and it's a whole hotel

499
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,460
made that opens up their umbrella
behind her. Um, she says,

500
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:40,850
I want to care, I want a cat. Um,

501
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,090
and in fact I'll just read
you the ending of that story.

502
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:51,130
Um,
someone not on page 94,

503
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,550
someone knock at the door,

504
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,210
Avanti George said he looked up
from his book in the doorway,

505
00:34:57,211 --> 00:35:02,211
stood the made to how the big tortoise
shell cat press tight against her and

506
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:06,080
swung down against her body.
Excuse me.

507
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:11,081
It's just that the [inaudible] asked
me to bring this person in Europe.

508
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,111
First of all,

509
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:16,580
there's kind of a very slight substitution
going on cause I don't think it's

510
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,670
actually the same cat,
this big tortoise shell,

511
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,350
cat public isn't the same kitty
that she saw earlier in the story.

512
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,330
So there's one kind of almost
comical substitution going on,

513
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,700
but the more important stuff diffusion
in the story other than just wanting to

514
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
care for something else to stand for
something else is also that instead of the

515
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:46,890
husband being the emotional
support for the wife,

516
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,060
it is the hotel apparatus
that has substituted,

517
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,260
has stepped in and
fulfilling that function.

518
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,350
The hotel may is the one who
opens them rela when she,

519
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,660
the wife steps out into rain.

520
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,940
She wants a cat is the hotel
staff that brings the cat.

521
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,740
So it is, this is, this is, uh,

522
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,480
for me this is one of the best and most,
um,

523
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,670
memorable portraits of, uh, of,

524
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:22,470
of what's missing in a
marriage that is just done,

525
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,870
you know, in a couple of pages, um,

526
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,930
and done completely
through a third parties.

527
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:33,900
Right? I mean, so this is his
story about supposedly about,

528
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:38,550
has been the web as almost tow completely
through the parties to the cat through

529
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:41,120
the hotel may, through
the petrol money. Um,

530
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,790
and so it says something
about having ways, um,

531
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,010
strategy as well.

532
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:52,011
And this is really something to think
about for all of the riders is how to

533
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,510
frame the story and how
to populate the story. Um,

534
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:02,270
and the population, uh, of
what is in the foreground, um,

535
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:07,260
in the story isn't necessarily, uh,
the, the, you know, the center. I mean,

536
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:09,600
the housemate is front
and center in this story.

537
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,320
This story isn't really
about hope, the hotel me. Um,

538
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,520
but nonetheless she is in the foreground
as is the cat. Uh, so, you know,

539
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:20,380
what is really, what is
this story about? Um,

540
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,710
this was a good question to ask actually.

541
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:27,600
This is another question that is
related to writing papers. Um,

542
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,460
start out by thinking, you know, what is
this particular paragraph about? I mean,

543
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,370
you know, certain things I know
for graph, but it could be,

544
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,650
there's something much more marginal,

545
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,900
could actually be the real subject
of that paragraph. So, you know,

546
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,140
it's always a good analytic strategy,
um,

547
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,890
to go out. Um, you guys never thought

548
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,230
isn't mine. Is that my
right? Is that, yeah,

549
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,100
for some reason I just
thought, um, you know,

550
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,330
that would be really a big
embarrassment. Um, but, um,

551
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,640
in any case, um, so, uh,

552
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,950
well I mean, here's a little ag with
substitute or whatever. Um, but um,

553
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,530
so far we've been, um, talking about, um,

554
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,280
the clustering of the stories
and the chapters, um, you know,

555
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,890
really kind of going in and kind of
oblique direction. Right. You know,

556
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,500
it's not this,

557
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:33,360
the lack of emotional satisfaction seems
to be the main point in artist stories.

558
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,770
Um, that's really the, um, the,

559
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,510
the kind of the tragedy
comedy slash comedy, um,

560
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:46,570
is the lack of adequate emotional
resolution. There's just no emotional,

561
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,970
uh, resolution at the
end of the calendar rain.

562
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,010
There's no emotional resolution
at the end of soldiers home. Um,

563
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,140
there's maybe a little bit of emotional
resolution at the end of mister and

564
00:38:58,141 --> 00:39:02,110
misses alley, but really
not, not that great. Um,

565
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,000
so the question is, um,
you know, is, is, is this,

566
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,890
um, uh, kind of a natural
resting place for Hemingway,

567
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,180
you know, is, is that the kind
of the emotional landscape,

568
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,340
um, that he feels most comfortable
with and that will be completely okay.

569
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:25,440
You know, I think that is, is a,
is a Bible way of writing. Um,

570
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,600
and you can have great literature
resting on precisely that very precarious

571
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:34,870
state of lack of emotional,
lack of full satisfaction,

572
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,120
lack of full resolution,
a black thing that Hemingway actually is.

573
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:43,560
It's a slightly different kind
of writer. Um, so he, he is, um,

574
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,180
quite, um, unashamed of, of going, uh,

575
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,380
to, um, to kind of, uh,
sometimes almost embarrassing,

576
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:54,310
extremely sensitive.

577
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:56,650
You don't want to show that this
is really what you believe in.

578
00:39:56,651 --> 00:40:00,100
So it's embarrassing in this
sense. Um, but he's, he's, he's,

579
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:03,070
he's not especially
embarrassed, uh, about, uh,

580
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,960
about making it very clear,
um,

581
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,820
what he believes in and
what he finds satisfying.

582
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:14,720
And I think that's really what makes
Hemingway, um, what he is a very,

583
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,490
in many ways have very emphatic about
believe in about emotional space that he

584
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:23,950
would affirm and celebrate.
Um,

585
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,270
so let's look at chapter 12.

586
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,040
This is the combination that
shows, uh, that sigh of Hemingway.

587
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,470
Um, and, uh, it's, uh, not surprising
as back trouble fighting. Uh,

588
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,440
but this time it's not
the picador on his horse.

589
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,150
When he started to kill it
was all in the same rush.

590
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,810
The ball looking at him straight in front,

591
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,520
heating the ball charge
and Vallarta charge.

592
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,940
And just for a moment they became one
filotto became one with the ball and then

593
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:03,580
it was over falafel,

594
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,600
standing straight and a red hill
of the sword sticking out deli,

595
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,850
betraying the balls,

596
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,970
shoulders filotto his hand up at the
crowd and the ball rolling blood looking

597
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:21,600
straight at him, looking straight
over the lotto and easily legs caving.

598
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,570
Um, so some of us with
final glory, you know,

599
00:41:25,571 --> 00:41:30,470
I don't think that I work and sing
the praises of bullfighting. Um,

600
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,520
but I think that just to think in terms
of what Hemingway is doing for him,

601
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,980
this is truly um,

602
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,680
sublime and satisfying moment for both
the matador and follow ball because the

603
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:52,490
repeated line is that they
became one. Right? So,

604
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,420
um,

605
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,180
they became one that is the
supreme ideal for Hemingway.

606
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,560
Um, instead of having
this, uh, she'll, um,

607
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,080
of the horse showing you from the ball,

608
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:11,120
you are in direct contact with
the ball and whatever you do,

609
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,220
um, you do it in other lack
of distance. So you know,

610
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:21,110
this is the contact close up that
the diminishment of distance,

611
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,040
um,

612
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,040
and the two of them really bonding so
tightly that it really becomes a kind of a

613
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:32,420
single unit. Um, and that, that this could
be a matter of, of any kind of thing,

614
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:36,220
you know, can be a mannerable, can be
a man and a woman can be two women, um,

615
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,990
can be you and the project you become
fuse with. Um, but for Hemingway,

616
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:41,810
um,

617
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,430
this kind of comes theat
lack of emotional insulation.

618
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:51,200
We've talked about, uh, the question
of insulation in Indian camp,

619
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,740
but the complete lack of emotional,
uh,

620
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:59,270
insulation between yourself
that and suddenly you feel
our way passionate about,

621
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,610
um, bad for Hemingway is the, is,

622
00:43:02,611 --> 00:43:04,760
is the place that he
really wants to get to.

623
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,600
And all those times where he doesn't
get there, you know, you can see that.

624
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,200
Why is the kind of a frustrating,
a resting place?

625
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:16,580
And he wants us to be frustrated when
we can get beyond those places. Um,

626
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,510
so this is, um, kind
of, um, uh, a very, um,

627
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,250
the kind of the classic Hemingway,

628
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,330
a moment of epiphany of
achieving this union, uh,

629
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:31,320
where the thing that the ball that you're
going to kill and the fact that you're

630
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,980
going to kill this creature
doesn't cling to him.

631
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,560
It doesn't really matter because you've
achieved that union at that critical

632
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:43,130
moment. Um, so, um, this is, um,

633
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,010
we are not reading the Sun also rises,

634
00:43:46,011 --> 00:43:49,400
but this is a almost completely parallel,
um,

635
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,350
moment in the sun also
rises, uh, Pedro Romero,

636
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,420
um,
killing the ball,

637
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,590
the ball charge as Romero of charge.

638
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:06,100
Romero's left hand draft the letter over
the balls and muscle to blind in his

639
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:12,161
left shoulder when forward between the
horns and sort of went in and for just an

640
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:17,040
instant he and the ball, we're one, right?

641
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:22,041
So you can see that that was one is of
critical importance to Hemingway way two

642
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,900
entities becoming one.
Um,

643
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,410
even though that the moment
of death and killing, um,

644
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:36,300
it's still important to achieve
that oneness with the world. Um,

645
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:40,040
so, you know, it's, I'm sure it's
romanticizing bullfighting um,

646
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:45,140
but it's actually one of the rare
public demonstrations of that happening.

647
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,530
You know, it's actually very hard.
I mean, if we think about this,

648
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,850
it's very hard to see two
things becoming one in public.

649
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:59,040
So for fighting is actually one
of the rare instances when, uh,

650
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,690
when everyone can be there
and watch. Um, so, um,

651
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,630
Hemingway probably was looking
for something like this, um,

652
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,030
and it's really more like
a band, uh, than, than,

653
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:13,790
than actually the killing of the board.

654
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,980
Then you can see why he would want
to romanticize something like that.

655
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:19,020
It was really completely,
uh,

656
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:24,110
choreograph in such a way so that
the violence becomes completely,

657
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:26,400
you ritualize.
Um,

658
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,600
and we don't almost don't see them
plot and there's no blood, um, in,

659
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:35,510
in this moment. Um, so anyway,
so for, for Hemingway, uh,

660
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:40,480
completely on desire to
get to this state here,

661
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:45,300
we're one. Um, so let's move on now.

662
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:48,810
And I have to say I've actually
like the big 200 river,

663
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:53,300
much more that than the bull
fighting scenes in Hemingway. Um,

664
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,360
this is a great story. Um, in
many ways the kind of a rewrite,

665
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,050
two part story, a rewrite of
crafts coming home, right?

666
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:05,480
So this is also a soldier's
home. Um, he's not a man,

667
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:08,190
his family, um, but uh,

668
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:11,810
he is on this trip, um, you know,

669
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,380
through a country that is not
really disclosed to us landscape.

670
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:18,330
We don't really know where it is.

671
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,030
We don't know where he's going
or why he's on that trip,

672
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,480
but it's a fishing trip.
Um,

673
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,760
and this is what happens. Uh, uh,

674
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,980
at the moment when,
uh,

675
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,770
Nate catches and nick this is the
same neck that we see growing up,

676
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,710
the young nick and Indian Cam and the
doctors and the other's way of now he's a

677
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,450
full grown man, obviously
and haven't been in war. Uh,

678
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,780
but coming back and going through,
um,

679
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,170
what appears to be a healing process,

680
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:57,290
but having great so and soldiers home
is about a non healing of perhaps,

681
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:01,560
you know, the trauma of war and the trauma
of being completely margin Olympian,

682
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:06,360
sideline of those things. Um,
we'll just keep hurting him.

683
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,580
Um, in, uh,

684
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,950
the case of big too hard at river is a
rewrite of that and it's very different

685
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,750
outcome coming out from that story.
Um,

686
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,770
and it has to do actually with those
similar dynamics to the bullfighting.

687
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,320
Um,
so nick cleaned them,

688
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:28,680
slitting the trout and they cleaned them,

689
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,870
slipping them from the vent to the tip
of the jaw audit in size and the gills

690
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,720
and a tongue came out in one piece.
They were both males,

691
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,740
long ray, white strips of
mill, smooth and clean,

692
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:50,370
all the insides clean and
Compaq coming out all together.

693
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,970
So this is his, uh, justice,

694
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,150
emotionally satisfying
as the bull fighting.

695
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:02,890
Not in the sense that we don't have to
choreograph moping the quite as dramatic

696
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:05,750
and beautiful as an eyeball five.
Um,

697
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,280
but to be able to expand,
uh,

698
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:15,000
the ritual of dying in one
piece to the trial, um,

699
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,760
that is, you know, we do have to
kill the travel. I mean, you know,

700
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:23,560
unless we're going to go without
any kind of, um, animals routine.

701
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,710
Um, so, um, the, um, the, the,

702
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,590
the travelers speed kill, uh, but, um,

703
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:38,220
the way the man of killing is everything
that there should be no degradation,

704
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:43,150
um,
in death that the Ashley,

705
00:48:43,151 --> 00:48:45,550
the measure of a good life,
um,

706
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,640
is first your ability to offer
a good death to someone else.

707
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,130
Right? Yeah. We do this all the time. Um,

708
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,170
it makes all the difference in the world,

709
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,000
whether we kill Brulee or
whether we kill ceremoniously,

710
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,600
uh, with full respect for
what we call, um, and, uh,

711
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:10,420
it also makes all the difference in
the world. Uh, if you die a good death,

712
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,530
um, there's really no other
conclusion. So, you know,

713
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,610
it has to,

714
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:20,790
it has to be a completely
clean and satisfy and,

715
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,593
um,

716
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,620
both to the person who's going or the
art to add the creature was going through

717
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:30,790
it and to the person who's
performing that operation. Um,

718
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:34,390
so there's actually, um,
as far as I can see, um,

719
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,090
Hemingway is actually a very
affirmative, uh, writer, um,

720
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,300
at the end of, in our time, um,

721
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,310
in the sense that he's also revising
his long story. Right. You know, is not,

722
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,180
he doesn't get to where he
wants to be in crab story in.

723
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:53,380
So just home he comes back and tells
the story one more time and there's time

724
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:58,080
kicked gas to where he wants
to do so. Well, um, uh,

725
