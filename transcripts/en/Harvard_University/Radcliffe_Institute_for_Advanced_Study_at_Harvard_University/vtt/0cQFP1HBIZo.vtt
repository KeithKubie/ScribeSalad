00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:04.356
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.970
-So thank you all for coming.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.330
This is a good turnout.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.110
And I hope you've been able to
join us for some of the earlier

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.930
parts of our DNA series.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.460
And know that there's
some more to come still.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.350
It's my pleasure to
introduce Dan Barouch tonight

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.900
for his talk-- as you can
see-- prospects for a vaccine

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.390
and cure for HIV.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.950
Dan is a professor of medicine
at Harvard Medical School,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.550
and-- as you can see--
director for the Center

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.480
for Virology and Vaccine
Research at Beth Israel.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.490
He is also part of the Reagan
Institute of Mass General, MIT,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.880
and Harvard.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.550
He's going to talk
tonight on how

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.620
molecular sciences revolutionize
the approach to vaccine

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.550
and drug development.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.210
The goal of the lecture is
to describe the current state

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.800
of the HIV epidemic
and the prospects

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.100
for developing a vaccine
and a cure-- a real cure--

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.720
for this disease.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.360
Dan's laboratory has explored
a series of novel vaccine

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.240
technologies, advancing in
particular series of novel

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.060
adenovirus-- I have
to read this because I

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.059
know none of this stuff.

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:14.650
I may be an epidemiologist,
but I do heart disease.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.580
Novel adenovirus
vector-based HIV-1 candidates

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.830
from concept and design,
to preclinical testing,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.420
to phase one clinical trials,
currently underway both

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.150
in the US in South Africa.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.650
His laboratory is
part of the Bill

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.170
and Melinda Gates Foundation
Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.420
Discovery, the NIH Center
for HIV and AIDS Vaccine

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.410
Immunology, and-- as you can
see here-- the Regan Institute.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.778
So please join me in
welcoming Dan Barouch.

00:01:39.778 --> 00:01:43.271
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.574 --> 00:01:46.740
-Thank you very much, Janet.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.360
It's a pleasure
to be here today.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.710
Thanks for coming on
this beautiful afternoon.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.610
What I'd like to try
to do is to give you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.970
an overview of a
research topic that I've

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.920
spent a lot of thinking about
over the last 10 years really,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.750
which is on how do we tackle
the HIV/AIDS pandemic in a most

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.860
definitive way,
which, as I'll argue,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.360
is the development of a vaccine
and/or a cure for this disease.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.990
We currently have
many drugs that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.830
can control this
disease, but currently

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.310
no method that can
either reliably

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.280
vaccinate against this disease
or be a definitive cure.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.350
Also, it's a pleasure to
be part of the DNA series.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.370
And I think that
from my talk you'll

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.360
see how we use
molecular science, which

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.370
of course involves
recombinant DNA,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.310
to both think about the
problem and attack the problem.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.880
So I'd like to try to keep
this as informal as possible.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.330
So feel free to interrupt,
raise your hand,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.480
or just speak out
questions along the way.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.150
I know there is time for
discussion at the end,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.100
but I'm happy for this to be
a dialogue for the first half

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.450
of the session as well.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.310
So don't be shy and
feel free to interrupt.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.417
Also if you don't
understand something

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:08.250
or if you want to discuss
something further,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.540
then feel free to ask
at any point in time.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.090
I've tried to keep
the technical jargon

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.040
to a minimum in
this talk and I'll

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.750
try my best to explain some
actual scientific concept

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.330
of what we're trying to do and
the way we think about this

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.490
in as understandable language
for a non-specialist as

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.140
possible.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.290
If I lose anyone,
then let me know.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.194
And also hopefully things
will be brought back together

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:35.735
periodically.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.540
OK.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.420
So first, I think many
people will remember

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.650
in the 1980s-- and
even early 1990s--

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.830
how HIV was at the centerfold
of newspaper headlines on a very

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.320
frequent basis.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.350
Over the last five,
10 years-- largely

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.040
due to the advent of therapies--
then HIV has, to some extent,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.970
partially receded
from public view.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.210
And to some extent that's
also one of the dangers,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.230
that it's not imminently in
the public mindset as much

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.595
as it once was.

00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:15.530
It doesn't mean the
problem is less severe,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.399
it just means that it's not
in the headlines every day

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.690
the way, say, for example,
the Ebola epidemic

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.390
was in the headlines-- you
couldn't have missed it

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.300
if you were awake for any
portion of this past year.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.870
But I think it's
important to keep

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.940
in mind the scope of the
HIV epidemic to start with.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.440
In other words, how
much of a problem is it?

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.050
These are some data
graphics that we borrowed

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.730
from an article in
National Geographic that

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.140
looks at the estimates
of fatalities

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.910
for major epidemics
of infectious disease

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.600
throughout the world
throughout history.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.830
So for example these
are different epidemics

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.870
that have occurred in
the world over time

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.950
with the size of the
red circle essentially

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.180
reflective of the
number of fatalities

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.820
of different infectious disease.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.640
So you can see at the bottom
the SARS epidemic, which

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.750
was very much in the
headlines about 10 years ago--

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.400
or 2002 to 2003--
claimed almost 800 lives.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.080
Clearly something of
substantial magnitude.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.650
The Haiti cholera
epidemic starting in 2011

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.530
has claimed over 6,000 lives.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.860
The Ebola epidemic-- these
numbers are a bit outdated.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.110
I think the complete counts
for the Ebola epidemic,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.770
the 2014-2015 Ebola
epidemic in West Africa

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.180
is about 11,000 people--
so, substantially larger

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.150
than the 8,000 here.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.110
This was prepared
a few months ago.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.870
But still about the
same size dot-- maybe

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.820
between this size and this size.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.870
So a very substantial
epidemic that

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.940
clearly captured the world's
attention, huge resources,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.270
and a massive global response.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.550
The great plague of
London 100,000 people.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.810
These cholera epidemics were
several hundred thousand

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.470
people.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.410
The swine flu outbreak in 2009
claimed about 300,000 deaths.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.410
But if we keep going up to even
the more significant epidemics

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.320
in history then you can
see that all of these

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.160
actually are relatively small.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.960
So in terms of the scope,
say of the Ebola epidemic,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.520
it was actually
fairly small compared

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.770
with some of the other
epidemics that you'll see.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.950
For example, if
we keep going up--

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.970
and this is just to
show a few of these--

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:40.640
the plague around 1900 was
about 10 million deaths.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.000
The Asian flu in the 1950s
was about two million deaths.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.270
The 1918 flu claimed
almost 20 million lives.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.620
And just for comparison,
the HIV/AIDS epidemic so far

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.970
has claimed 39 million lives.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.690
So really a very
substantial epidemic

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.610
that takes its place in
history as one of the defining

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.380
infectious disease
epidemics of all time,

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:12.510
superseded only by the Black
Death in the Middle Ages,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.860
which claimed an estimated 50
million lives and the plague

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.840
of Justinian during
the Roman Empire

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.530
that claimed roughly
100 million lines.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.880
So that's where the HIV/AIDS
AIDS epidemic falls in terms

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.610
of historic proportions.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.700
More discretely, the number
of adults and children

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.270
living with HIV is approximately
35 million currently.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.550
And there's approximately
two million new infections

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.357
per year.

00:07:39.357 --> 00:07:41.190
And these numbers over
the last couple years

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.610
have remained largely constant.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.270
So the mortality
rates have starting

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.510
to drop, which is a good thing.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.750
But the number of
people living with HIV

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.639
has actually continued
to increase over time.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.180
But to some extent
that's good news--

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.820
that means that people are
actually living longer.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.820
But that also means that
the total global burden

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.070
of the disease is growing
and not shrinking.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.170
In addition, globally
HIV disproportionately

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.510
affects young women.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.320
This is data from South
Africa in which you

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.540
can see that the greatest
burden of this disease

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.960
is in young women, essentially
as early as age 15 and going up

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.740
to the early 30s.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.950
And you can see that throughout
Africa, really-- this

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.440
is data from South
Africa, but this

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.680
is the same in many
other regions in Africa--

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.570
that the burden of this disease
is much larger in young women

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.679
compared with young men.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:46.180
And currently in South Africa
in early adulthood about 35%

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.020
of women are HIV positive.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.750
These are some data in
a hyperendemic region

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.510
that so we do some
clinical research with.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.190
And this is one of our sites
for our vaccine trials.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:05.550
These are data from Salim
and Quarraisha Abdool Karim--

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.820
recent data-- showing really
still a stunning HIV prevalence

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.140
and incidence rate
in this community.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.560
So this is a community
outside of Durban,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.340
South Africa in which
over the last few years

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.230
the HIV prevalence
rate really has not

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.760
declined much at all,
despite the introduction

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.760
of antiretroviral
drugs to the region

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.350
and massive behavioral
and educational campaigns.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.180
Then essentially
those do not seem

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.230
to impact the transmission
rate of HIV in this population.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:42.260
By age 16 about 8% of women
are already HIV positive.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.370
In this community by age
20 about 25% of these women

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.370
are HIV positive.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.950
And by age 24 over 40% of
these women are HIV positive.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.350
So that between the 18
to 35 year time frame

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.810
is about a 9% incidence
rate per person per year.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.050
And this is with
the availability

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.040
of antiretroviral
drugs for prevention

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.640
as well as behavioral
interventions.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.050
So clearly something
more needs to be done.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.330
This is also a
clinical research site,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
a site called CAPRISA,
that we were working with.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.940
And it's a challenge doing
research in the developing

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.160
world, but this is actually
a very well established

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.660
clinical research
site that has made

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.270
some of the most seminal
advances for both HIV and TB.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.080
And so this is a township.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.040
And they're associated
with the Nelson Mandela

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.630
School of Medicine.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.560
And this is one of our
sites for our vaccine

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.320
and therapeutic trials.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.200
So that's globally.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.330
Clearly the vast burden
of the disease is global.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.900
And the largest
percentage of HIV cases

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.130
is in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.340
But how about the US?

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.030
It's still a major
problem in the US.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.000
In the US there's about 50,000
new infections per year.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.240
And about 2/3 of these-- 64%--
are in men who have sex with

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.060
men.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.940
Also there's a certain level
of complacency in the US.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.450
In young people
the incidence rates

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.250
are increasing, not decreasing,
particularly in individuals

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.870
13 to 24 years old-- there's
been a 15% increase in HIV

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.480
incidence rates.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.730
And you can see that there's
a geographical maldistribution

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:35.610
of cases with the most HIV
cases in the US in the south

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.180
as well in the Northeast--
including here in Massachusetts

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.330
as well in Washington DC.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.660
So Massachusetts, New York,
and Washington DC areas

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.540
as well as the South is
where there's the majority

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.370
of HIV cases in the US.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.890
In fact some cities-- such as in
certain areas of downtown DC--

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.830
have such a high
HIV incidence rate

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.120
they would actually
qualify for US PEPFAR

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.100
if they were in Africa.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.300
So people don't
realize that in the US

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.410
in certain regions
in certain cities

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.130
the incidence rates actually
are still very high.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:19.110
Also, I think most people know
that the mortality for HIV very

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.410
thankfully plummeted in
the mid 1990s as a result

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.450
the introduction of combination
antiretroviral therapy, which

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:30.710
is, as we talked about, is
lifesaving but not curative.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:35.550
However, from the late 1990s--
so for the last 10 or 15

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.380
years-- the mortality
rate in the US

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.240
has largely remained constant.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.240
So despite continued
medical advances then,

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:49.720
we haven't made a lot of
headway in HIV therapy

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.900
in the US the last
10 or 15 years, which

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.450
is a surprise to many people.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.070
And that's not entirely
due to the lack

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.790
of medical interventions.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.280
It's due to many
societal, and social,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.210
and economic issues
associated with this disease.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.320
Another thing that is a
surprise to most people

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.470
is that the majority of
HIV-infected patients in the US

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.170
actually are not
adequately treated.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.540
So these are recent data
from the CDC showing

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:24.770
that only about 3 in 10
people with HIV in the US

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.000
are actually receiving
suppressive antiretroviral

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.132
therapy.

00:13:28.132 --> 00:13:30.590
This was actually a surprise
to me as an infectious disease

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.200
clinician.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.680
So I wear two hats-- I'm
trained as an infectious disease

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.350
and internal medicine
trained physician, as well

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.280
as a basic scientist
as an immunologist.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.100
And so for me, HIV
research is really

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.020
a merging of my clinical
interests and my basic research

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.630
interests.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.230
But despite all my background,
I was actually very surprised

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:55.170
to see this, that in the US
about 15% of people with HIV

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.280
are not diagnosed.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.350
Of course if you're not
diagnosed you can't be treated.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.245
But only about
half of the people

00:14:02.245 --> 00:14:06.140
who are diagnosed actually
are in a stable medical care

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.090
situation, which really speaks
to the socioeconomic side

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.790
of this disease.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.330
And then of those,
a small percentage

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.840
are not prescribed ART and
a small percentage are not

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.020
adequately biosuppressed.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.460
But when you multiply
all these things up--

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.380
it's called the
cascade of care--

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.845
the actual total number of
people who are fully suppressed

00:14:25.845 --> 00:14:28.640
on antiretroviral
therapy, it's not 100%--

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.630
like some people think--
it's actually about 30%.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.360
And of course the 70%
of people in the US

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.840
who are not adequately
treated are the ones

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.580
who have viral loads
that can continue

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.930
to transmit to other people.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.700
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.910
we've made little progress
in HIV care in the US

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.440
in the last 10 years.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.920
So how do we end
the HIV epidemic?

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.580
Clearly antiretroviral
therapy is the backbone,

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.520
and that's absolutely necessary.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.520
But we also believe
that is not sufficient,

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.870
that antiretroviral
therapy alone is not

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.310
sufficient to cure disease.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.910
In fact, if you look at
history, then therapeutics alone

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.980
are usually not
sufficient to eradicate

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.220
an infectious pathogen.
So what we need to do

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.510
is we need to find
a cure and we need

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.477
to find a way to
prevent the disease.

00:15:17.477 --> 00:15:18.850
-I have a question.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.210
-Yes

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:26.410
-Can you compare the geography
of America with Europe and Asia

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.874
with the prevalences?

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.980
-So in Western Europe and in
the industrialized countries

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.969
in Asia, it's
relatively similar.

00:15:39.969 --> 00:15:42.260
I don't know the exact numbers,
because this was really

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.940
a US-based study.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.150
But it's not felt
to be hugely better,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.880
although there are more social
supports in other countries.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.660
And there's more universal
health care in other countries.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.310
There's still a substantial
cascade of care.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.909
I don't know the exact numbers.

00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:00.700
I don't know that the
studies have actually

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.620
been done to be quantitatively
precise about that.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.210
But the concept of
a cascade of care,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.050
that on each step on the
pathway to actually having

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.090
suppressed virus that you
lose a percentage of people,

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:12.940
still holds.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.721
Of course in other areas
of Europe and Asia,

00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:17.845
then it's vastly different.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.100
So what I'm going to do for
the next five minutes or so is

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.540
I'm going to digress and tell
you a little bit about HIV

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.970
as a virus.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.620
So if I lose a few of
you, then don't worry.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.360
I'll tie things up
in a few minutes.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.790
So this is a picture
of an actual virus.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.260
This is a cell-- the
pink thing is a cell.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.800
And these green
blobs are viruses

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.720
that are budding off the cell.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.890
So this is a cartoon of what
an HIV virus looks like.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.680
It involves nucleic
acid core-- an RNA core.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.371
So I know we're in a DNA series,
but this is RNA, it's similar.

00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:03.890
It goes through a
DNA intermediate,

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.000
so it still qualifies
for this lecture series.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.540
It is an RNA virus.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.750
There's proteins that
around the RNA that

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.890
make the viral
capsid-- essentially

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.150
it's almost the ball
that contains the RNA.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:22.650
And then at the very
surface is a lipid

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.869
membrane-- it's sort of
a detergent membrane,

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.670
that sort of floppy surface.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.340
And stuck in the membrane
are the coat proteins,

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.669
a single protein called HIV
envelope, also known as gp120.

00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:37.960
So don't worry about the names.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.180
Just remember that on
the surface of the virus

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:45.230
there's a single protein that's
called HIV envelope or gp120.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.490
And that has to be the
target of antibodies.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.700
So whether it's
antibodies induced

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.780
by the disease or antibodies
induced by a vaccine,

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.930
then that's the target.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.520
If we look at the life cycle
of how does HIV actually infect

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.140
a cell, that is shown here.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.430
This is the virus that I showed
you before, little smaller.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.920
And this is, say,
one of your cells--

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.070
if the virus is
going to infect you.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:16.195
It enters the cell by
attaching to a surface protein

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:19.260
on the cell called CD4.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.050
You probably have heard
that in HIV infection

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.530
your CD4 counts go down.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.725
What that actually means
is that the number of CD4 T

00:18:26.725 --> 00:18:28.820
cells in your body declines.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.270
This is a CD4 T cell.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.350
And it's critical,
because CD4 is

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:37.680
the molecule on the cell that
allows the virus to go in.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:44.800
So once the virus enters,
then the RNA genome

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.240
is reverse transcribed
into a DNA template.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.670
So basically, a carbon copy--
almost a photocopy of the RNA--

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.200
is made as DNA.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.170
This uses a viral enzyme
called reverse transcriptase.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.950
And this is something unique
to this class of viruses.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.710
So DNA is then
made from the RNA.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.880
And the DNA goes into the
nucleus and integrates

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.830
into your host chromosomes.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.330
That's a critical event
in the HIV's life cycle,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.950
because that event
of integration

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.420
of the viral DNA
into your host DNA

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.080
is the reason why
we can't cure HIV.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.630
So that's maybe one good
take-home lesson from this

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.070
lecture, is that that is the
single most important reason

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.515
why we cannot cure
HIV infection.

00:19:32.515 --> 00:19:35.280
It's because the virus
integrates into your host

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.390
chromosomes and then a subset
of those cells, essentially

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.290
the virus goes to sleep.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.940
If the virus is not actively
producing viral proteins,

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.770
it can't be targeted by drugs.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.970
And therefore the cell
essentially lives on for years.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.746
And if you stop therapy--
if you're HIV infected

00:19:52.746 --> 00:19:54.120
and you stop
therapy-- then virus

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.786
starts to replicate
in those cells again

00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:57.380
and the virus comes back.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.740
So it has the potential
of repopulating

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.280
a whole other cycle
of viral replication.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.105
Yes?

00:20:04.105 --> 00:20:06.540
-I recently heard
a lot of our DNA--

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.690
the introns are retrotransposons
from other viruses, not

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:15.360
necessarily HIV, but
have been suppressed.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.010
-That's true.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.460
So what this gentleman
is referring to

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.650
is that in every
single person's cells

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.680
there are pieces
of retroviruses--

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.030
those viruses that are cousins
of HIV-- that presumably

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:34.570
viruses have lived on with
us for millions of years.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.052
And those pieces of viruses
don't cause a problem,

00:20:38.052 --> 00:20:40.260
because they're not intact,
they're not full viruses.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.530
They can't actually
reactivate to make a virus.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.890
So they're essentially
pieces of DNA

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.930
that are largely
almost irrelevant.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.440
They're just sort
of sitting there.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.030
I mean in your genome only a
small fraction of the genome

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.790
actually is genes that are
relevant for your cells

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.750
to live.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.650
And so within the cells
a lot of the junk areas

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.250
contain sequences
that reflect portions

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.320
of genes that look like HIV.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.480
And that's just a normal
part of being human.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:08.980
Yes.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.960
-I've got a question.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.920
In theory, in our
wildest dreams,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.370
could we use a technique--
a gene editing technique

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.780
like a CRISPR-Cas9
to excise the HIV?

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.900
-Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:25.350
So actually a gene therapy
is one of the strategies

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.819
for HIV cure strategies now.

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:29.610
And I can get to that
maybe towards the end

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.610
of the talk more.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.870
But people can do that.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.310
It turns out it's
probably easier

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:39.270
to target the co-receptors,
such as CCR5 disruptions, which

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.500
is the actual strategy
that people are using.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.291
But absolutely that's
one of the strategies

00:21:43.291 --> 00:21:45.290
that people are using.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.880
So this integration
event is mediated

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.030
by a viral enzyme
called integrase--

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.390
it's not terribly creative.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.500
But again, I'm emphasizing
it because this

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.740
is the molecular event
that is the reason why

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.260
we can't cure the disease.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.630
Then the integrated DNA, as you
probably know from previous DNA

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.710
lectures, transcribes RNA.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.500
And the RNA can either
translate viral proteins--

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.000
and the proteins
in the viral RNA

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.360
get packaged at the cell surface
and then new viruses bud off.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.449
So one infected cell can
have many different outcomes.

00:22:23.449 --> 00:22:25.240
It can either go to
sleep-- and essentially

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.480
the virus just stays
latent potentially

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.820
for months, maybe even years.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.972
Or it can actively produce
virus, in which case

00:22:31.972 --> 00:22:33.430
it can produce
hundreds, thousands,

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.830
or millions of virus particles.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.490
So the reason why
I went over this

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.450
is because this is
critical for therapies.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.510
So all of the HIV
therapeutic drugs

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:49.570
target these very unique
aspects of the viral life cycle.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:54.950
So there are currently more
anti-HIV anti-viral drugs

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.800
than anti-viral drugs for all
other viruses put together,

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:03.160
just to show you the impact
and the pharmaceutical effort

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.250
to develop HIV
drugs, which has been

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.560
one of the biggest
pharmaceutical successes

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.820
of our generation.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.430
So initially-- a large
number of HIV drugs

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.520
target this reverse
transcription step.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.020
They're called reverse
transcriptase inhibitors--

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.600
AZT, you may have heard of,
is one of those type of drugs.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.530
The drug class that really
transformed the AIDS epidemic

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:32.220
in the mid 1990s were called
protease inhibitors that

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.595
target this protease enzyme.

00:23:33.595 --> 00:23:35.220
I didn't talk about
this much, but it's

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.940
an enzyme that cleaves
this initial protein

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.000
into the individual
structural proteins that make

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.850
a viral particle infectious.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.460
And more recently
integrase inhibitors,

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.980
which target this step.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.490
And so these three steps--
some fusion inhibitors

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.350
and other receptor antagonists.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.960
But for the most part,
the vast majority

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.660
of HIV patients who are
prescribed antiretroviral drugs

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.384
are prescribed some combination
of reverse transcriptase

00:23:59.384 --> 00:24:01.800
inhibitors, protease inhibitors,
and integrase inhibitors.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.730
And this is the
backbone of HIV therapy.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.750
So in an untreated
individual what

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.490
happens is that an untreated
individual is infected,

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.260
virus in the first few
weeks-- shown in red--

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.370
goes up sky high, and that
it's controlled partially

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.040
to a so-called viral set point.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.530
The virus usually doesn't kill
the host in the first few weeks

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.110
and the host can't
clear the virus.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.350
So they sort of end
up in a stalemate,

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:32.900
where the host is essentially
killing a very large number

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.440
of viral particles per day
and the virus continues

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.580
to replicate every day.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.250
And this is an
analogy of a faucet

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.950
in a bathtub ongoing
but the drain also open.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.380
So a lot of water is being
poured in but a lot of water

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.340
is being drained out
at the same time.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.475
Eventually if the
individual is not treated,

00:24:51.475 --> 00:24:54.420
then in more than 90% of
people after a period of eight

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.920
to 10 years develop
constitutional symptoms,

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.720
opportunistic infections,
and death due to the disease.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:07.680
So there's a substantial
benefit to bringing

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.390
antiretroviral drugs to the
developing world, shown here.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.430
And it's one of the most
lifesaving interventions

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.680
that the Western world has
done for the developing world

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.660
and is led by the US,
as I think people know.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.290
In the absence of
antiretroviral therapy

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.940
there would have
been about two to 2

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.770
and 1/2 million deaths per year.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:33.520
And now it's down
to about one to one

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.150
to 1 and 1/2 million
deaths per year.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.400
So really a substantial
number of lives

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.190
saved by antiretroviral therapy.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.550
But it's not perfect.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:45.060
As we talked about, limitations
of antiretroviral therapy--

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.400
it doesn't cure the infection,
it doesn't eradicate virus.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.620
There's problems of compliance,
toxicity, drug resistance.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.829
There's still inadequate
access in developing countries.

00:25:56.829 --> 00:25:59.120
Only about half the individuals
in the developing world

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.170
who need the drugs
are able to take them.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:05.180
And these drugs can also
be used for prevention,

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.912
for preventing HIV.

00:26:06.912 --> 00:26:09.120
But there's a lot of challenges
to actually implement

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.330
that on a societal level.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.190
So let's talk for
a few minutes more

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.870
about HIV vaccines
in particular.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.970
Is an HIV vaccine necessary?

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.140
Certainly history is
on the side of vaccines

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:25.240
to prevent or to rid the
world of viral epidemics.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.500
And this is an opinion
piece by several leaders,

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.890
including Tony Fauci, who wrote
this editorial about a year ago

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.360
and said, "Ultimately, we
believe, the only guarantee

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.430
of a sustained end
of the AIDS pandemic

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.204
lives in a combination of
nonvaccine prevention methods

00:26:43.204 --> 00:26:44.620
and the development
and deployment

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.994
of a safe and
effective vaccine."

00:26:45.994 --> 00:26:50.850
So clearly we need a vaccine
to end the AIDS epidemic.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.600
But until we have
one, then we need

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.950
to implement all
the other nonvaccine

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:56.340
prevention methods that we have.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.490
So why is there no
AIDS vaccine today,

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.300
despite over 30 years of
concerted worldwide research

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.616
on the subject?

00:27:07.616 --> 00:27:08.490
It's a good question.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.010
I mean it's not due
to lack of trying.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.280
It's actually one of the
large biomedical research

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.550
enterprises.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.560
So far it has not
been successful.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.590
So before trying to
answer this question,

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.400
how did Edward Jenner
develop a smallpox vaccine

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.810
200 years ago without the
benefit of our knowledge of DNA

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.740
and modern molecular
biology and immunology?

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.540
Clearly the development
of a smallpox vaccine

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.440
was predicated on several
aspects of the virus.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.950
There was a clear clinical
correlative protection

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.720
for Variola virus,
which is smallpox.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.420
It was limited
antigenic diversity,

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.010
which means that smallpox
is a virus that DNA

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.540
sequences of the virus from
one person to the next person

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.000
were pretty much the same.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.290
So you're dealing with a
single virus as opposed

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.030
to many different
strains of a virus.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.610
And broad immune
responses could be

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:03.587
induced by attenuated viruses.

00:28:03.587 --> 00:28:05.295
So a classic method
in developing vaccine

00:28:05.295 --> 00:28:07.770
is making a weakened
version of that

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.240
that doesn't cause the disease
but is sufficient to raise

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.620
immune responses that can then
target the real infection when

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.600
it arrives.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.940
In contrast, the challenges
in the development

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.620
of a prophylactic
HIV vaccine are

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.200
unprecedented in the
history of vaccinology.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.560
Unlike the smallpox
virus, for HIV

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.950
there is extensive viral
clade and sequence diversity.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.480
In fact, the amount
of genetic diversity

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.250
of HIV within a single
infected individual

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.930
is greater than the diversity
of global influenza,

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.080
just for comparison.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.324
So if you need a new
flu vaccine every year,

00:28:47.324 --> 00:28:49.490
then how are you going to
make a vaccine against not

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:55.739
just the strains of virus in one
person, but HIV for the world?

00:28:55.739 --> 00:28:57.780
The second thing is what
we talked about already,

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.470
that HIV integrates
into the host genome.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.890
So it establishes
latent viral reservoirs.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:08.000
Also, not a single person
has cleared HIV infection

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.510
through immune responses.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.160
There's been one
person who probably

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.992
has been cured by a series of
bone marrow transplantations,

00:29:14.992 --> 00:29:16.450
but there isn't a
single individual

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.106
that we know about
that's cleared HIV

00:29:19.106 --> 00:29:19.980
from immune response.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.230
So we don't know exactly what
immune responses to induce.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:27.460
The virus can mutate rapidly
and evade both antibody and cell

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.200
or immune responses.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.890
And antibody responses can be
induced to target that one host

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.770
protein that I mentioned
at the beginning,

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.600
but typically those
antibodies are not

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.870
broad-- they don't target
many different viruses.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:46.210
So there's no method that exists
to induce broadly reactive

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.390
neutralizing antibodies.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.920
And as we mentioned,
attenuated viruses

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.130
are often used for vaccines for
things like smallpox, measles,

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:58.140
mumps, rubella-- that
some of you may have had.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.070
But for HIV, attenuated
viruses are too unsafe.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.480
So currently there's
no safe way of making

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.300
an attenuated version of HIV.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.370
In addition, there's no small
animal model of disease,

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.560
thus requiring the use of
more expensive and cumbersome

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.420
non-human primates for
preclinical vaccine testing.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.810
And there would need to be
some level of animal testing

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:25.040
before the FDA would allow
clinical trials to be done.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.540
And there's also--
a reality is there's

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.750
much less pharmaceutical
interest in developing vaccines

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.145
as there is, say, for
developing HIV drugs.

00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:36.020
Ken Kelley and I were
talking about that just

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.340
before the start
of this lecture.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.090
So there's many
different challenges--

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:41.510
I'll just highlight two of them.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:45.930
So is a schema showing
the extensive global HIV

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.720
genetic diversity.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.260
So here you can see in
different areas of the world

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.580
different pie charts.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.440
And essentially the different
colors on the pie charts

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.059
reflect different strains
of HIV, called clades.

00:30:58.059 --> 00:30:59.600
Don't worry about
the specifics, just

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.490
notice that there's
many different colors

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.240
all over the place in the world.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.950
And that just highlights the
diversity of virus strains

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.220
worldwide.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.990
The second problem is
the envelope protein.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.420
I mentioned that
at the beginning

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.440
there's a single protein
called HIV envelope that's

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.570
on the surface of the
HIV envelope-- again,

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.380
not terribly creative name.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.980
But this is the one
and only protein

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.000
that can be targeted by
antibodies to hopefully prevent

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.790
the disease.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.990
So just to illustrate
the problems

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:37.630
of generating antibodies against
this protein is shown here.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.980
This is a real structure--
so this is not fiction,

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.340
this is not a model, this
is the actual real structure

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.710
of the HIV envelope protein.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.380
That was solved just
a year and a half ago.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:52.890
You can see that these are
the different protein chains.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.517
The green is the gp120
protein and the red

00:31:56.517 --> 00:31:57.870
is the gp41 protein.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.140
Imagine that the viral
membrane is here,

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.520
and this here is
the external world.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.960
So basically antibodies
that you would

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.900
need to make by vaccination
to block this disease

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.150
would have to come in from
a direction such as here

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.570
or here and essentially bind
to some of the green protein

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.580
chains.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:20.490
This is a space filling model in
which you see what the globular

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.260
protein actually looks like.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.700
But the key thing
is that the virus

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.520
has devised a way
to almost become

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.230
invisible to the immune system.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:33.570
And it does this by covering
almost its entire coat

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:37.510
with sugars, also
known as glycans.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.360
By covering the protein
coat with sugars,

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.660
then it's much less
reactive to antibodies.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.800
Because most people's
antibodies bind to proteins

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.300
and not sugars.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.770
And so a model of what those
sugars look like is shown here.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.370
So you can see the
sugars are shown in blue

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.580
and are probably
floppy like this.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.259
And this is about the number
and dimension of sugars.

00:33:01.259 --> 00:33:02.800
So you can see if
you're an antibody,

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.280
and you need to bind
to the green stuff

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.950
to actually
neutralize the virus,

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.710
and you're coming in here,
then the virus is going

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.670
to be almost invisible to you.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:15.600
So this is another reason
why developing an HIV vaccine

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.529
is so difficult.

00:33:17.529 --> 00:33:18.820
So how have we done as a field?

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:27.840
In 30 years there's only been
for HIV vaccines that have been

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.957
tested for clinical efficacy.

00:33:29.957 --> 00:33:30.790
So think about that.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.790
In any other field of
medicine-- cardiology,

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:36.980
oncology, even
HIV therapeutics--

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.020
at any point in
time there's tests

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.620
of dozens of different
concepts for activity

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.120
in human clinical trials.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.520
But for HIV vaccine
development there's

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.130
only been four
concepts that have

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:51.620
been tested for clinical
efficacy in over 30 years.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.520
So I would argue that
that is essentially

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.870
insufficient for the global
magnitude of the epidemic.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.400
And it really is an
entirely another talk

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.700
that would last a whole
afternoon to really discuss

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.674
why this is the case.

00:34:03.674 --> 00:34:05.090
But as you can
imagine, it's going

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.040
to be a combination of
scientific challenges,

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.480
funding/logistic issues,
and many things put together

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.139
is really a barrier for
developing more HIV vaccine

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:14.790
candidates.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:19.550
I won't go through the
technical aspects of these four,

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.239
but let me just tell you that
three of these failed and one

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:23.920
was a partial success.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.560
So that's not a
great track record

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.550
for 30 years of global
research on something.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.020
But it does show some
hope that at least one

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:37.109
of these trials-- shown
here-- with different vaccine

00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:41.940
and mutagen components did
show a 31% protective effect.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.909
So it's too low to be
licensed-- so it's not

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:48.000
relevant to the populations.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.219
But it is a proof of concept
that developing an HIV vaccine

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:53.610
is possible.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.250
And so here is the actual
data from this clinical trial.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.810
The number of HIV
infections is on the y-axis

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:04.790
and the time of the
study is on the x-axis.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.190
The placebo group
is shown in red

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.060
and the vaccine group
is shown in green.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.730
And you can see that early on
in the first year of the study

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:16.260
these curves separated,
indicative of a vaccine effect.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.266
But then after time these
largely look parallel.

00:35:19.266 --> 00:35:21.140
So the interpretation
is that the vaccine had

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.880
some early efficacy and
that it was lost quickly,

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.840
which is the parallel
lines after that.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.050
But it did lead
to some insights.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.480
A large statistical
immunologic analysis--

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.320
don't worry about the
actual numbers here--

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.320
but after this trial was done
people looked very closely

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.000
at what types of
immune responses

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.300
were associated with
a protective effect.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.910
And not surprisingly,
it came down

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.990
to envelope-specific antibodies.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.840
So if you made certain
types of antibodies

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.120
against particular regions of
the envelope protein-- regions

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.420
that were a bit more
exposed than others,

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.600
that weren't impeded
by all those blue dots

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.308
that I showed you in
the previous slide--

00:35:58.308 --> 00:36:00.910
then you were able
to be protected.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.060
So where do we go from here?

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.020
So there is a
signal of protection

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.040
with one candidate HIV vaccine.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.170
This efficacy was marginal,
transient, insufficient

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:10.070
for licensure.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:13.050
And so the emphasis now is
really a two-pronged approach

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.950
to develop improved vaccine
strategies-- either a mimic

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:20.130
of what was done before,
which involved a pox virus

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.970
vector with a gp120 protein.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:26.920
A vector is an attenuated
or harmless virus,

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.210
such as an adenovirus
or a pox virus that

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.330
doesn't cause disease
itself but you

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.990
can stitch in through
recombinant DNA pieces of HIV

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.210
to make it into a vaccine.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.800
Or to develop entirely
different vaccine platforms

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:46.270
that have various benefits.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.990
So this is a study
that we published,

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:52.010
and I'll just mention in a
couple slides what we're doing.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:58.350
We're using an adenovirus as
an initial vaccine strategy

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.920
followed by an envelope
protein to specifically boost

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.210
antibody responses.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.680
And in a preclinical
study we've shown

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.140
that this vaccine, which
is here shown in blue,

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.540
gives about a 50% protection
compared with control

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.140
vaccines shown in black.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.480
So this is the number
of challenges required

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.970
to achieve infection in this
[? animal ?] model and this

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.890
is the percentage of
uninfected individuals.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.050
And these data were
published just recently.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.820
So the vaccines that
we're taking forward

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:30.630
involve priming with
these viral vectors--

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.250
so a harmless or attenuated
virus that's unrelated to HIV,

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.470
in this case it's an
adenovirus, a virus that causes

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:41.950
the common cold-- with HIV
antigens stitched inside,

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.150
followed by a boost with
different viral vectors

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.760
combined with soluble proteins.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:54.080
And we're currently finishing
phase IIA clinical trials

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.230
in the US, in East Africa,
South Africa, and Southeast Asia

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:01.350
to look at safety and dose
confirmation and regimen

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:02.220
selections.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.270
And if things look good, then
in the next probably two years

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.540
we should be able to start
efficacy trials together

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.900
with our academic and
industrial partners.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.750
But assuming that
things go well,

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:17.270
then this will actually
be only the fifth concept

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:21.330
tested in 30 years in the
history of the epidemic.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:22.152
Yes?

00:38:22.152 --> 00:38:24.915
-I don't know why we
don't license things which

00:38:24.915 --> 00:38:28.448
have-- is it 31% efficacy,
if I understood correctly--

00:38:28.448 --> 00:38:33.360
and that's the male circumcision
prevention efficacy, right.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:40.900
The [INAUDIBLE] is also far
from 100%, it's in the 40%, 50%.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.715
If it's cheap, maybe it's a
matter of cost effectiveness.

00:38:43.715 --> 00:38:45.771
But if it's cheap,
why not use it?

00:38:45.771 --> 00:38:46.770
-It's a very good point.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:50.570
And so there's been extensive
modeling on how effective

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:56.980
does an HIV vaccine have to be
to be of public health utility.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.400
And in general the
public health authorities

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.850
in various parts
of the world say

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.710
that they would endorse
use of an HIV vaccine

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.890
if it were about 50% effective.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.990
And there's everything
from cost of goods

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.280
to incidence rates
and public health--

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.240
basically the cost of
a roll-out, et cetera.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.590
The tipping point would be
a vaccine that's about 50%

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.090
effective.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.340
Of course in the
developing world

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.250
it's a very different
calculus than, say,

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.790
in the developed world,
where you would probably

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:31.030
demand a much higher
efficacy of a vaccine.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.170
But it's a very good point.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.720
And mathematicians, and
public health authorities,

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.440
and governments argue
about that all the time.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.870
This particular
vaccine could not

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.480
be licensed because it was
more of an academic experiment.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.520
There wasn't actually a
pharmaceutical company

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.910
behind it.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.160
So there was just
no logistic way

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.190
the vaccine could be
brought to market anyway.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.740
And so there are practical
considerations as well in

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.440
addition to.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.497
So even if that vaccine
were 100% effective,

00:39:58.497 --> 00:40:00.830
the way it was tested it could
not actually be licensed.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.350
Because it would have to be
transferred to a company who

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:06.490
was willing to take it on
and other non-scientific

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.820
issues as well.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.950
So I'm going to close
in the last five minutes

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:15.110
or so just with some
thoughts about a HIV cure.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.785
It's to some extent the final
frontier of therapeutics.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.630
As long as we
capture HIV patients

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.790
in clinical care and the
country has the resources

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:30.680
to support it, then we can treat
most HIV patients very well,

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.790
to the point where their
virus is suppressed

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.800
and their life expectancy
almost approaches

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.200
an uninfected individual.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.340
But they have to
be on therapy daily

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.770
for the rest of their life.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.600
Because currently
there is no way

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.850
that we can cure this disease.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.360
We can just hold it in check.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.335
So why do current
drugs fail to cure HIV?

00:40:53.335 --> 00:40:54.460
We talked about it already.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.970
It's because HIV integrates
into the host genome.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:03.170
HIV establishes a latent
reservoir and long-lived CD4

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.040
cells during acute infection.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.920
Essentially, HIV integrates
into the host genome

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.400
and a certain number
of those cells

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.000
go to sleep-- that's
called a latent reservoir.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.230
The viral reservoir
is not eliminated

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:19.255
by antiretroviral drugs
because drugs only target virus

00:41:19.255 --> 00:41:22.459
that is actively replicating.

00:41:22.459 --> 00:41:23.292
-Just a quick point.

00:41:23.292 --> 00:41:26.244
So the HIV is unusual
in its dormant phase?

00:41:26.244 --> 00:41:27.720
-Yes.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:33.560
Most viruses do not integrate
and do not go into latency.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.120
And that's one of the
cardinal features of HIV.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.620
Yes?

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.500
-Why would the virus
stay asleep for so long?

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.380
So you suggested it
was like 9 years or so.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.010
What is happening
in that period?

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:51.680
-So another unique
aspect of HIV compared

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.920
with many other viral
infections is that it actually

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.460
is an infection of the very
precise immune cells that

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.970
fight infection.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:03.580
So it's an infection of
CD4 T cells primarily.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:12.630
So human T cells have
certain properties.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.710
They can be many
different states.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.070
One state of human T cells is
called central memory cells.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:23.450
And those cells by their
nature stay fairly quiet

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:25.690
in lymph nodes for years.

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:28.070
The purpose of those
cells is a good thing,

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.140
that if you
encounter a pathogen.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:37.970
If you've had smallpox once
then you'll never get it again.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.770
And that's because T
cells and antibody cells--

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:46.120
B cells-- retain
memory for a lifetime.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:50.345
And that memory is retained
through central memory cells,

00:42:50.345 --> 00:42:53.560
in other words, specific cells
that have particular antigen

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:59.530
receptors that are able to
recognize smallpox virus,

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.180
or other viruses,
or other bacteria.

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.310
And central memory
cells, they're

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.440
designed to live for years.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.730
So the same cell can live in
your lymph nodes for years.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:13.430
And that's a property of
the human immune system.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:16.180
So HIV to some
extent hijacks that.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:20.199
And the long-lived
property of those cells

00:43:20.199 --> 00:43:22.240
is conferred upon the
virus, because the virus is

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.150
part of the cell now.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.044
Because the viral
genome is integrated.

00:43:25.044 --> 00:43:26.460
So whatever is the
natural history

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.110
that cell is the
history of the virus.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:34.780
So if those cells have a
half life of five years,

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.810
then you can actually do the
mathematical calculations,

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:41.510
that it would take 60 to
80 years for those cells

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.037
to essentially die off.

00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:45.370
And that assumes that those
cells are not self-renewing,

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:46.510
which they are.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:50.119
So the translation is that
those cells persist forever,

00:43:50.119 --> 00:43:51.535
for the lifetime
of an individual.

00:43:51.535 --> 00:43:53.852
-But what brings it out
of that latency period?

00:43:53.852 --> 00:43:55.060
-That's a very good question.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.330
It's not completely known.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:58.250
Certainly some stresses do that.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.710
So at any point in
time a percentage

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:03.550
of the central memory
cells get activated.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:06.150
And when a cell gets activated,
it starts producing the virus.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:07.608
And it can set off
a chain reaction

00:44:07.608 --> 00:44:09.260
of new virus replication.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.510
But the precise
molecular details

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.810
of how a cell goes into
latency and come out of latency

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:19.060
is actually the cutting
edge of research.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.460
So one strategy for a
cure is not a cure at all.

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.150
But if you could lock those
cells in permanent latency,

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.592
if you could prevent them
from becoming activated,

00:44:29.592 --> 00:44:30.675
then you don't need drugs.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.765
So one consideration
for a cure is--

00:44:36.765 --> 00:44:38.140
what you would
think about a cure

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.830
is-- finding a way to actually
eliminate all those cells.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.460
But a second approach
to a so-called "cure,"

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.220
or at least a
functional cure, would

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.277
be if you could somehow
lock them in latency

00:44:48.277 --> 00:44:49.485
and prevent that reemergence.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.620
So only one person
in the world we think

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.880
has actually been cured of HIV.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.030
It was an HIV
patient with leukemia

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:04.200
who had not one but two
bone marrow transplants

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.770
from a donor.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:09.950
And the donor was selected to
have specific mutations in one

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:14.610
of the receptors that
resists HIV infection.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.350
Unfortunately, that's
not translatable.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.930
The next six cases,
those patients all

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:22.630
died from complications of
the bone marrow transplant.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.610
So it's certainly
not something that

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:29.429
can be done for HIV patients
unless they have acute leukemia

00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:31.470
and need the bone marrow
transplant for treatment

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.240
of leukemia.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.760
And even so, it's incredibly
rare and incredibly difficult

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.620
to do.

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:42.100
-Was it a different donor
for the other six cases?

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:45.130
-They were different donors,
but the same mutations.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:50.430
So it's just that allogeneic
bone marrow transplantations

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:54.000
carry about a 25%
upfront mortality rate.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.490
And then we think that
this particular person

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:00.760
was cured because he actually
had a very rough course

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.500
post-transplant and required
a lot of immunosuppression,

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.370
and therapy, and reinduction,
and a second bone marrow

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:07.120
transplant.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:11.480
So basically
complete replacement

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.631
of essentially every single
immune cell by a donor.

00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:16.130
Yes?

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.520
-Yeah.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.144
Just to be clear,
those subsequent five

00:46:18.144 --> 00:46:20.358
were being treated for
some other leukemia,

00:46:20.358 --> 00:46:22.220
not just for HIV?

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.080
-Absolutely.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.810
I mean no physician would
ever do a bone marrow

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.300
transplant just for HIV.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.960
It just wouldn't be ethical.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:32.740
But all those patients required
the bone marrow transplant

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:37.610
for treatment of leukemia,
and they happened to have HIV.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.720
So of course other cure
strategies are being evaluated.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.820
So this is a list of
strategies that people

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.060
are pursuing for HIV cure.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.860
So it is thought
that the earlier

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.280
you start antiretroviral
drugs the better.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.390
But early therapy is
probably not sufficient.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:56.180
Animal studies and human
studies have shown that.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.850
You may have heard
in the popular press

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.950
the story of the
Mississippi baby.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:05.290
And starting therapy within
hours of infection at birth

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:09.060
appeared to cause a long-term
remission after therapy

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.240
was stopped in that baby.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.920
But then after a period
of about two years,

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.030
then the virus came
resurging back, showing

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:20.080
that at least one cell was
still infected with HIV

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.590
and was sufficient to cause
a full-blown infection.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:28.190
There's drugs being developed
that can activate those cells,

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:30.640
the latent reservoir cells.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.740
People are also using vaccines.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.360
I talked about vaccines to
prevent infection-- people also

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.870
are using vaccines to
boost immune responses

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.530
in HIV-infected
individuals, with the idea

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:45.180
that if you can increase a
person's own immune system

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.020
that their immune
system might be

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.980
able to either control or--
ideally-- eliminate the virus.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.680
There's also various
immunomodulators

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.950
that try to increase the quality
of those immune responses.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:59.530
We talked a bit
about gene therapy.

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.880
That would essentially either
potentially excise the HIV

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.740
from cells or
disrupt the receptors

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.860
needed to sustain an infection.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.150
We talked about bone
marrow transplantation--

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:17.580
it's the one success in the
world in 60 million infections,

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:21.000
and is not something that
could ever be expanded.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.300
And our own concept,
which we helped

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.570
develop over the last two
years, is could we actually use

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.771
the rare but definable broadly
neutralizing monoclonal

00:48:30.771 --> 00:48:32.270
antibodies, could
those be developed

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:35.727
as drugs to help target HIV.

00:48:35.727 --> 00:48:37.310
So I told you that
it's very difficult

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:40.190
to raise broadly neutralizing
antibodies by a vaccination.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.700
But there are very
rare individuals

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.180
that develop these type
of antibodies naturally.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.640
And those antibody
genes can be cloned out

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.950
and can be developed essentially
as a pharmaceutical drug.

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:56.360
So this is a schema of
an HIV envelope protein.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.570
This is the viral membrane.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:58.980
The virus is down here.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.120
And this is the
external world out here.

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:07.030
So there are a small number
of neutralizing antibodies

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.750
that have been cloned out
of HIV-infected people that

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.730
are very, very good and can
neutralize the vast majority

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:16.220
of viruses very effectively.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.320
Now these are not
raised by vaccination.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.670
Is are very rare B cells
in very rare individuals,

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.140
essentially pulling
needles out of haystacks.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.290
So I just don't want people to
be confused by vaccination-- so

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.890
far it's impossible to
raise this type of antibody.

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:35.470
But by molecular techniques one
can pull occasional anybodies

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:36.350
out of people.

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:37.870
And the best
antibodies potentially

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:40.030
might be used for
pharmaceutical reasons.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.700
So we published a
study two years ago

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:47.648
in which we showed that--
again, in a pre-clinical study--

00:49:47.648 --> 00:49:51.220
in animals that infusion
of these antibodies

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.990
can be remarkably effective.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.570
You can see in animals that
have high viral loads we

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:59.050
can suppress virus to
undetectable levels

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:02.160
within seven days
for a period of time.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.960
And in animals that start
off with low viral loads then

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.560
we fully suppress
the virus, and that

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.920
appears to be sustained
over time for over a year.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.930
Monoclonal antibody
infusions can also

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.250
deplete virally infected cells.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:20.410
So this is essentially one
measure of the viral reservoir.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:23.025
And you can see with antibody
infusion it doesn't reduce this

00:50:23.025 --> 00:50:25.700
to zero, but it certainly
reduces it substantially

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.270
compared with
uninfected animals.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.170
So I'll conclude
briefly, and then

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.550
happy to take more
general questions.

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:35.642
The HIV epidemic is, I
think, unquestionably

00:50:35.642 --> 00:50:37.600
one of the most important
biomedical challenges

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.880
of our time, both
locally in the US

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.050
and even more importantly
globally in the world.

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:46.335
Molecular science and
molecular-based thinking

00:50:46.335 --> 00:50:49.390
of the pathogen and
the immune response

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:52.590
has revolutionized the approach
to both vaccine and drug

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:53.740
development.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:57.692
And certainly novel HIV
vaccine and cure strategies

00:50:57.692 --> 00:50:59.400
are going to be tested
in clinical trials

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.740
over the next few years.

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.160
I should emphasize that
these are aspirational goals,

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.460
and there is no HIV
vaccine, and there's no HIV

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.390
cure that's around the corner.

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.140
I can assure you that
neither one of these

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.930
is going to be a licensed
product in the next few years.

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:18.670
But by harnessing modern
immunology and virology,

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.170
we think that we have an
unprecedented opportunity

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:23.410
to impact not only
the HIV epidemic,

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:25.080
but this way of
molecular thinking

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.980
will also likely be very
effective to develop

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.320
strategies against other
infectious diseases

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.681
as well as cancers.

00:51:31.681 --> 00:51:34.180
So I'll stop there, happy to
take more discussion questions.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.280
