00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.100
When I was waiting for Black Panther to come
out, everything had me hyped.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.790
The trailer with a killer soundtrack and Michael
B. Jordan, who I did not know I needed in

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.790
my life.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.730
The posters with the whole cast serving looks.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.700
The glowing reviews that all ended with a
resounding “Wakanda Forever.”

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.400
Now, we can’t make the job search as fun
as the release of Black Panther.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.790
But we can help you make some eye-catching
promotional materials for yourself, like

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.760
a resume and cover letter that will get employers
hyped to hire you.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.800
I’m Evelyn from the Internets.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.960
And this is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.420
[INTRO]

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.260
Let’s say you’ve been scrolling through
job boards for days on end.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.610
You’ve found a bunch of decent options…
and then there it is: the perfect gig.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.540
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just call
and get hired on the spot?

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.010
Unfortunately, the job search doesn’t work
like that.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.180
Remember trust?

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.570
The hiring process is a way to make sure that
you’re a good fit for a company, and have

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.290
the competence, intent, and integrity to do
the job well.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.530
The best way to start gaining that trust and
land yourself an interview is with a resume

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.320
that demonstrates your work history and potential.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.540
Sure, like Amy Santiago, you could build
a binder with cascading tabs of all your skills.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.290
And if the job posting asks for a C.V., you
have a bit of extra space.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.650
C.V.s should be about two pages -- unless
you’re in academia, in which case, go wild.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.350
They should list your publications, speaking
engagements, and additional side work.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.770
But a well-tailored resume shouldn’t be
more than a page long.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.560
Don’t try to squeeze in your entire job
history -- just the qualifications that make

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.690
you a great fit.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.409
If your life is a movie, the resume is a trailer.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.190
Even though formatting can vary, there’s
a basic structure to a resume.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.990
And you should pick whatever pieces tell the
most cohesive and enticing story.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.740
For structure, many people break up their
resume into experience and education.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.520
If you’ve just graduated or don’t have
much work experience, list education first.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.450
Otherwise, lead with experience.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.030
Grades and standardized test scores show you
were good at school, but a resume should show

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.420
you’re good at learning.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.290
List each experience under its own header
with the time you worked there, and summarize

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.870
your work in clear, concise bullet points.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.200
A good movie trailer gets people hooked.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.840
Whether you liked the movie or not, The Girl
with a Dragon Tattoo trailer gave me chills.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.780
So your resume should always paint the most
flattering picture of who you are.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.450
If your grades weren’t what you would’ve
liked, you could leave your GPA unlisted.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.420
Or if you’ve been out of school a while,
start with your most recent work experience,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.730
like your latest hosting gig on Crash Course.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.950
Then, list other relevant positions.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.069
You’ll want to describe your previous responsibilities
and achievements concisely, and use keywords

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.040
related to the job posting.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.680
Recruiters are busy people.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.530
Sometimes, they only have time to quickly
scan each resume, or they use software that

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.810
filters through resumes based on those keywords.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.060
Showcase the important things you accomplished,
not just your basic job description.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.739
Good movie trailers include genre-specific
exciting moments, from a meet-cute to a flashy

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.990
action sequence -- so tailor your resume to
the job and make it memorable!

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.400
If possible, you can also quantify the impact
you had.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.989
And to save space, try to keep each bullet
point under two lines.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.540
So if the job you’re applying for wants
an ‘independent worker’ who’s a ‘creative

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.430
problem solver,’ you could say you “independently
wrote, directed, and hosted over 500 YouTube

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.150
videos that involved creative storytelling
and generated over 180,000 subscribers.”

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.910
[It’s me, y’all!]

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.459
You can showcase non-work-related things that
set you apart in optional sections like volunteer

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.349
work, activities, or interests.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.950
But make sure everything is relevant to
what you’re applying for.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.480
Playing a didgeridoo might be impressive,
but it won’t make you seem like a good lawyer.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.490
Under Qualifications or Skills, you can list
specifics that set you apart, like financial

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.099
literacy, softwares, or languages.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.960
Avoid broad terms like “communication”
because they won’t help you stand out.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.599
Or meaningless buzzwords, like synergy.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.660
[No one knows what synergy is.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.350
Every businessperson says it.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.650
But WHAT is it?!]

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.139
And only include an objective statement, which
states your goals for employment, if the job

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.580
posting asks for it.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.110
My objective statement might be: content creator
with 10 years experience looking to make engaging

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.960
new media for diverse audiences.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.110
But I probably don’t need to list it, because
it takes up precious real estate.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.870
And honestly, employers know we all have
the same objective: be employed.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.289
Now if a resume is your movie trailer, the
cover letter is your poster.

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.210
If you looking for a rom-com, you’ll know
to avoid The Expendables because of the poster

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:57.640
with a skull, guns, biceps, triceps... is, is that a trapezoid? Just
way too much testosterone.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.900
A cover letter is a long-form, descriptive
letter.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.770
But like a good movie poster, it’ll quickly
show you’ve done your research to appeal

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.720
to a specific organization.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.439
The content and format of cover letters can
vary depending on the industry, as well as

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.520
your own writing style.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.159
We’ve listed a couple resources in the description.

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.660
In general, you should go into some detail
about experiences that would make you an especially

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.860
good fit for the job, and tie it all back
to why you value this company.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.879
But stay concise.

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.219
It’s a letter, not a book!

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:32.039
So, if you’re applying to help organize
a women in media conference, you could talk

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:38.120
about your passion for storytelling and your
dedication to promoting equality, intersectionality,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.710
and of course Black Girl Magic.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.029
Now that you have your trailer and poster,
you need some critical endorsement.

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.759
This is where references come in.

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.979
You should always have at least 3 references
lined up that you have asked to help you

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.439
out, and who will give you a glowing review.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.529
You want that 100% fresh rating on your personal
tomatometer.

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:01.149
They should be professors or previous coworkers,
not your friends and family.

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:05.099
And once you’ve got your endorsements, you
need to set up a few preview screenings.

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.099
That’s networking.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.839
One of the most effective ways to find a job
is to be personally referred to someone.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:15.490
The idea of, “It’s not what you know,
it’s who you know” can be scarily accurate.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.509
But luckily, anyone can build a professional
network with time and effort.

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.740
Stay in touch with former managers, teachers,
coworkers, and professors!

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.369
And remember to build a strong reputation,
both inside and outside of work.

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:33.789
Now, just like we judge celebrities by what
they’ve said online I’m looking at you,

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.189
Kanye - what’s goin’ on?!.

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.749
make sure your movie isn’t tarnished by
social media garbage fires.

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.839
Just like you’d Google a best friend’s
Tinder date, a potential employer is going

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.789
to be checking up on you.

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.500
So even if you’re not in the middle of a
job search, make sure to check your profiles

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.960
pretty often for red flags.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.780
But that can be tricky, so let’s go to the
Thought Bubble.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.160
Let’s say you went on a fantastic vacation
to Roswell, New Mexico.

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.969
You hiked a bit, went on a planetary pub crawl,
and maybe you thought you saw a UFO in the

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:05.199
field by your Airbnb.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.599
You really want to post some trip highlights,
but you’re searching for a job.

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:10.659
What should you share?

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:16.599
Obviously, discriminatory comments about race,
gender, age, or other groups are never okay

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:19.349
[-- on social media… or in life.

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.349
Come on, people.]

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:24.349
But beyond that, there are no hard and fast
rules about what is or isn’t appropriate

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:26.409
-- it all depends on the recruiter.

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:28.479
Probably keep any curse words in check.

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:32.979
And it’s better to avoid references to alcohol
or drug use -- so photos of that beer-chugging

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:34.439
contest are out.

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:38.819
Like any written communication, even a tweet
with poor spelling or grammar could knock

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.939
your reputation down a few points.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.969
Some positions scrutinize more than others,
so mistakes could haunt you like a “No Ragrets”

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:46.969
tattoo.

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:49.830
It’s also important to be wary of context.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.439
Someone scouting for a top-secret paranormal
project may like your insta-worthy photo of

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:55.969
a possible UFO.

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:59.229
A recruiter for a scientific journal may not.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.729
Plus, the people reading your posts likely
don’t know you.

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:06.809
You can’t always predict how your inside
jokes will look to someone who stumbles across

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:07.809
your feed.

00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:10.979
So, double-check what seems appropriate with
a trusted friend.

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:14.570
And remember that just because you’ve
set your profile to private doesn’t mean

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.240
that it’s 100% safe.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.740
Like, you could be tagged publicly in friends’
photos or something.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.149
So the safest bet is probably posting a picture
of you hiking in a cute alien t-shirt and

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:26.260
calling it a day.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.499
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:31.509
Networking can happen online, like with portfolio
submissions or chatting on social media.

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:36.120
Or it can happen offline… where people
aren’t constantly judging your tweets.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.130
Career fairs are good tools to meet representatives
from lots of companies at once, and talk about

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.740
careers face-to-face.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.100
They’re most common at high schools or colleges,
but there are career fairs for people who

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.100
are out of school too!

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.500
You can also request an informational interview
to talk with someone about a position you

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.260
may want to have.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.140
It doesn’t need to be formal.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.950
It can be as simple as asking to grab coffee.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.800
And it’s super important to avoid making
it sound like you’re fishing for a job.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.210
It’s in the name: this interview is for
information.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:11.200
So ask questions about their company, their
role, what makes them feel fulfilled, and

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.740
what concerns you may have about the field.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.160
It’s a great opportunity to get ideas for
your resume, or help you figure out if it’s

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.190
even a job you want.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.690
There’s always a chance that internship
with your professor won’t be quite what

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.690
you bargained for.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.220
And I know that networking, writing cover
letters, fine-tuning your resume, and scanning

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.100
job boards can get a bit overwhelming.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.930
That’s why it’s important to stay organized.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.160
Bullet journal or something!

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.630
Keep records of the people you’ve contacted
for informational interviews and who they’ve

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.630
referred you to.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.930
Make a spreadsheet with details about where
you’ve applied, and save the job descriptions.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.900
Sometimes, job postings get taken down when
candidates are contacted.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.370
And if you don’t hear back right away, don’t
get discouraged.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:56.520
It’s really tough out there and can take
over 50 applications to hear back from 1 place.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.260
Take the job search one day at a time, and
set goals.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.640
Your persistence will pay off.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.510
Once you’ve built a great promo package
for yourself, you’ll be sure to find an

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.160
audience that wants to see your movie!

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.450
I mean... hire you.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.570
I’ve taken the metaphor too far.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.210
So, if you remember nothing else from this
episode, make sure to:

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.210
Make a trailer.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:20.770
