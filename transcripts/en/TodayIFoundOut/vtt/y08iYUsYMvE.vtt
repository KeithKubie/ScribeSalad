00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.310
Described by medical professionals as bogus,
“a solution in search of a problem,” and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.340
“a triumph of ignorance over science,”
the method of removing earwax that employs

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.520
heated beeswax, known as ear candling, is
a staple treatment for many when their ears

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.730
get clogged up.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.970
But does ear candling actually work?

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.120
Adherents of the practice claim that ear candling
was a part of traditional medicine from across

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.290
the ancient world, including supposedly used
by the Egyptians, Chinese, and Native Americans,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.500
with one manufacturer of the wax tubes, Biosun,
going so far as to refer to their product

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.180
as “Hopi Ear Candles,” despite that the
Hopi Tribal Council has come out and stated

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.140
“[ear candling] is not and has never been
a practice conducted by the Hopi tribe or

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.609
the Hopi people.”

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.589
Whatever its true origins, for those unfamiliar,
the process of ear candling is relatively

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.589
straightforward.

00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:10.130
First a sheet of cotton is coated with beeswax
(and sometimes a bit of honey and/or other

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.440
herbs as well).

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.340
Sturdy enough to roll into a narrow cone shape,
the narrow end of the cotton cone is set in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.979
the patient’s ear, and then the other end
is set on fire.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.970
As it burns, adherents often claim that the
flame creates a heated vacuum that pulls earwax

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.810
from the ear into the tube.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.570
Others go further and note that the negative
pressure produced by the flame via the cone

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.750
also draws out “toxins” from the bloodstream.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.770
After about 15 minutes, the flame is doused
and the cone removed.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.060
To view the result, a stick is shoved through
the cone, which pushes out ash and a fair

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.070
amount of melted wax that is darker than the
original beeswax, and generally claimed to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.979
be a mixture of ear wax, beeswax, and ash
from the cotton.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.820
So does ear candling actually work?

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.820
To begin with, Dr. Lisa M.L.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.079
Dryer notes that ear candles don’t actually
create any real suction and that, “Since

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.880
wax is sticky, the negative pressure needed
to pull wax from the canal would have to be

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.679
so powerful that it would rupture the eardrum.”

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.120
Travis Berry, director of marketing and sales
at Wally’s Natural Products, a maker of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.350
ear candles, actually concurs with this assessment,
noting that the earwax removal does not happen

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.250
while one is being treated with an ear candle,
but, he claims, after: “The smoke particles

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.820
seem to bond with ear wax particles, and allow
them to fall out as flakes.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.280
They fall out naturally while you’re sleeping,
showering, driving to work.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.610
Your body does this anyway.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.410
Ear candles merely aid the body in removing
excess ear wax.”

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.770
So what does the hard data from research say
about ear candling?

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.160
Studies to date have definitively shown that,
apart from the more obvious outlandish claims

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.890
of this method purifying blood being categorically
false, ear candles don’t remove any earwax

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.030
from the ear save perhaps surface wax that
may get stuck to the tube.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.230
For example, in one such study, researchers
first performed the technique correctly then

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.050
separately burned the candles without placing
them in an ear.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.080
The result?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.790
The composition of the clump of melted wax
was identical and no change in the state of

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.790
wax within the ears in question was observed,
with the researchers concluding, “The wax…

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.660
from an ear cone is not from the ear . . . but
rather is a product of the candle itself.”

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.930
In a 2007 paper, Cerumen Impaction, published
in the American Family Physician, Dr. Daniel

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.700
F. McCarter et al. summed up the method’s
effectiveness based on their research stating,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.010
“ear candles neither created suction nor
removed wax and actually led to occlusion

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.010
with candle wax in persons who previously
had clean ear canals.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.950
Primary care physicians may see complications
from ear candling including candle wax occlusion,

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.390
local burns, and tympanic membrane perforation.”

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.420
In another 2007 paper, Ear Candling: Should
General Practitioners Recommend It?, published

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.470
in the Canadian Family Physician medical journal,
the researchers concluded:

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.290
Ear candling appears to be popular and is
heavily advertised with claims that could

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.200
seem scientific to lay people.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.070
However, its claimed mechanism of action has
not been verified, no positive clinical effect

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.320
has been reliably recorded, and it is associated
with considerable risk.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.640
No evidence suggests that ear candling is
an effective treatment for any condition.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.449
On this basis, we believe it can do more harm
than good and we recommend that GPs discourage

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.520
its use.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.610
As these researchers noted, more than just
ineffective, ear candling can be dangerous

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.659
due to the flame burning so closely to the
patient and the heat of the dripping wax.

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:39.199
As a result, facial burns and other injuries,
particularly from burning wax inside the ear

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.970
canal, are occasionally noted, though as far
as we could find no widespread study has definitively

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.740
reported what the injury rates are for ear
candling.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.080
But as an example of the type of injury sometimes
incurred, in the aforementioned 2007 study,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.880
it was noted that in one case the practitioner
accidentally allowed a significant amount

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.139
of hot wax to enter the ear canal of the individual
she was performing the method on.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.759
Seeking medical attention, the patient ultimately
had to be put under general anesthesia to

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.250
remove the wax that had flowed deeply into
her ear.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.349
Beyond burns, a perforation of the woman’s
ear drum was discovered once the wax was removed.

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:22.169
Subsequent tests revealed that she had hearing
loss in that ear; at her one-month follow-up,

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.740
her hearing had not improved.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.590
So how should a person with an ear clogged
with earwax remove it safely?

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.080
First – don’t use Q-Tips!

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.789
Physicians (and even the makers of said product)
have advised- and been completely ignored-

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.690
for decades that Q-Tips, like other long,
thin objects, can easily puncture an eardrum.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.830
Beyond this, regular use of Q-Tips, while
doing a decent job of cleaning the surface

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.580
of the ear canal, has a tendency to result
in a buildup of wax deep in the ear from the

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.340
Q-Tips pushing some of the wax further in.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.669
Instead, for cleaning the outer surface of
the ear canal, soft tissue paper rapped around

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.289
the finger can suffice.

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.469
As for cleaning out a build up of earwax deep
in the ear canal, assuming one doesn’t have

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.950
a perforated ear drum and your shower pressure
isn’t too strong, lightly rinsing your ear

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.370
with near body temperature water (too cold
or hot can cause dizziness) for as long as

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.610
necessary is a relatively effective method
of ear wax removal.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.630
Alternatively an even better water method
is the somewhat overpriced, though still a

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.249
lot cheaper than a doctor’s office visit,
Elephant Ear water bottle sprayer that many

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:26.680
doctor’s offices use for cleaning ears.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.139
The general method here is to fill the spray
bottle with warm water, tilt your head slightly,

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.060
partially insert the tip into the ear canal,
and begin vigorously spraying at various angles

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.029
until the built-up ear wax is flushed out.

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:43.379
For extreme blockages, it may take several
minutes of spraying to completely remove the

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:45.949
ear wax, but this will eventually get the
job done.

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.761
To speed the process up, over-the-counter
ear wax softeners may help soften the wax

00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:53.389
up before spraying, though these aren’t
strictly necessary.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.069
Just plain warm water will do the trick eventually.

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:01.690
All this said, for most people the majority
of the time manually removing ear wax from

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.210
the ear canal is not necessary and can even
be harmful if done too often as earwax serves

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.939
a few useful purposes, such as working as
a lubricant and helping to stop your ears

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.060
from becoming too dry and itchy.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.169
Its stickiness also helps trap dirt and other
such foreign invaders to your ears.

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:23.039
In the end, most of the time for most people
ear wax is naturally pushed out on its own,

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.659
with mere surface level cleaning in a bath
or shower being sufficient to tidy up the

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:28.659
ear.

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:32.699
Of course, ultra-dry climates, ears that produces
excessive wax or are oddly shaped internally

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:37.360
or other such abnormalities may make it so
the occasional buildup occurs, resulting in

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.169
diminished hearing or even full blockage of
the canal.

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:44.120
For those times, rather than reaching for
the Q-Tips, which long term will exacerbate

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.159
the problem, or attempting the useless ear
candling method, (assuming you don’t have

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:52.850
a perforated ear drum) try something that
actually works like the Elephant Ear sprayer,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.880
your shower head (with pressure turned down
to a comfortable level), or simply head to

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:11.370
the doctor’s office and they can clean 

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:26.869
your ear 
out in short order.
