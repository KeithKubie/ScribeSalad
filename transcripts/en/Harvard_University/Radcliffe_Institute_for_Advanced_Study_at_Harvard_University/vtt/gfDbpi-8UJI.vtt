00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.890
- As I mentioned, this
is the concluding section

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.030
of our Undiscovered annual
Radcliffe's science symposium.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.650
And there is a
reception afterwards.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.500
But we have just
a single speaker

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.167
for this session, who needs
almost no introduction.

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:20.750
But I'll give her a
tiny introduction.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.240
And then you can read her
incredibly impressive bio,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.210
or you can read Carl
Sagan's book about her,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.354
but only the first part of the
book has actually happened.

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:31.520
So for those of you who
have read the book, Contact,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.340
you know that there is the
success of Jill Tarter's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.310
character in the book, Contact,
where contact with aliens

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.230
is actually made.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.250
And that could happen.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.950
But it hasn't happened yet.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.550
OK, so Jill is
well-known for her work

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.820
in essentially creating the
SETI Institute, from which she

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.820
is now the chair emeritus
of SETI research at the SETI

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.720
Institute.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.270
SETI, by the way, stands for
Search for Extraterrestrial

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.110
Intelligence.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.610
But I think Jill
will have something

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.700
to say about what she
means by "intelligence."

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.924
And her whole life, her
whole professional life,

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:10.590
essentially has been
defined by this one

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.580
question of, are we alone.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.070
And you just heard a wonderful
session about the possibilities

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.980
for establishing an
environment for life.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.690
But again, as you
probably know, Jill

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.570
is trying to go much
farther and actually

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.140
find evidence and
communication from life.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.480
And I'll just tell you that
Jill and I were reminiscing

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.260
a little bit yesterday.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.940
And she reminded me
that she started--

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.837
I knew she started
in radio astronomy.

00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:36.420
And I knew that her
work had something

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.240
to do with star formation,
which my own work does too.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.927
But she started out looking
for brown dwarfs, which

00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:44.010
are the kind of stars now
that are a dime a dozen.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.330
But they were another
one of these things

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.205
that people thought,
well, that should exist,

00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:49.470
but I'm not really sure,
and nobody's ever found one.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.480
And now that's
just, like, old hat.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.490
And when I stand here, and we're
talking about 4,000 exoplanets,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.770
not only when I was born, but
when I was in graduate school,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.120
there were no planets beyond
those in the solar system.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.360
And then you look at Nate's
thing about the difference

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.310
between a telephone in 2007--
sorry, in 2017, or now--

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.330
it's astonishing how well
people can accept change.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.700
And so as Jill talks,
I want you to all think

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.150
about how we would
accept it if the search

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.525
for extraterrestrials is
successful in our lifetimes.

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:29.150
And we'll come back
to that at the end.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.960
And I just want to thank
Jill very, very much

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.980
for making the trip here.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.390
And I'm very excited
to hear what she has

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.639
to say about the undiscovered.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:35.639
So thank you, Jill.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.513
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.908
- Thank you.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.530
So thank you very much, Alyssa,
for inviting me to participate

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.120
in this symposium.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.310
And I do need to start
with a disclaimer.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.410
I work on SETI, the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.510
However, I can't
define "intelligence."

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.840
I don't know how to
find it remotely.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.800
What we have done
historically is use technology

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.150
as a proxy for intelligence.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.600
And if we find evidence of
someone else's technology

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.260
out there, we will infer some
intelligent technologist,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.220
at least at some point.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.810
And so that's what I'm talking
about, "The Undiscovered,"

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.870
looking for technosignatures.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.590
All right?

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.960
You've heard about biosignatures
in the last session.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.460
But technosignatures also
fit under that umbrella

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.140
of astrobiology.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.470
And it's really finding
habitable worlds

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.120
through the deliberate
actions of the inhabitants.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.060
And we had a question
about big numbers,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.590
and how do astronomers
deal with them.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.030
And I'm going to talk to you
now about the necessity of all

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.010
of us dealing with them.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.790
Because we are intimately
related with far away

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.740
events and long ago times.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.290
So we really have to think about
what we mean when we say here

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.340
and now.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.940
And I am on a mission to
change your perspective.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.470
I hope by the end
of the afternoon,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.660
maybe I'll have
done some of that.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.890
All right?

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.960
So here-- obviously, we're here.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.650
Right?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.980
At the Radcliffe Institute
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.480
Right?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.260
And from the altitude of the
low Earth orbiting satellites,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.070
we would see ourselves here.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.470
And since 1968, when Bill
Anders, on Christmas Eve,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.930
took this Earthrise
image as he was

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.740
coming around the limb
of the moon on Apollo 8,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.400
we've been able to
visualize ourselves here,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.080
as a body in space.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.250
This is a really
potent image and one

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.220
that we do need to internalize
and change our thinking.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.320
We're also here.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.160
Right?

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.290
There is, somewhere up
there, a little white dot.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.289
So this picture was taken
a few years ago by Cassini.

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.330
And we sent out an email,
and I hope that you all

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
went out on the lawn and
waved to Cassini when

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.530
we were taking this selfie.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.380
And before that, you've
seen this Pale Blue

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.100
Dot from the Voyager spacecraft,
as it was heading out

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.900
of the solar system,
past Neptune,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.450
and turned around and
looked home and caught us

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.720
in a mote of light and dust.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.290
And our Sun is here, right
at the edge of this Milky Way

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.220
galaxy.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.160
Now, that's not a picture
of the Milky Way galaxy

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.960
because nobody's gotten
outside to look back and take

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.820
that picture.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.920
But it is a galaxy
very much what

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.140
we think the Milky
Way would look

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.060
like if we could get outside.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.830
So our Sun is one of 400
billion stars in this galaxy.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.330
And our galaxy, which is here--

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.340
again, that's not us.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.210
We're not outside.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.370
But this is representative.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.480
This is the Hubble Deep
Field, a thumbnail of dark sky

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.340
that we didn't think
contained anything

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.450
until we spent hundreds of hours
staring at it with a fantastic

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.740
space telescope.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.350
And now, we see all
of these hundreds

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.580
of billions of galaxies within
the observable universe.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.280
And we note that some
of those galaxies

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.130
are smaller and fainter.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.910
And that's because they're
farther away, which reminds us,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.120
as we look out in space,
we look back in time.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.810
So we now need to
think about our now

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.400
in the context of
13.8 billion years

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.980
of the evolution of the cosmos.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.040
And that's a big long timespan.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.280
But really, humans can
trace their lineage back

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.700
a lot farther than you might
think in this long history.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.970
So humans trace their
lineage not just back

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.580
through the centuries
of our families,

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.910
and not just back through the
millennia of our architecture,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.840
and art, and many experiments
with different forms

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.550
of governance, we
trace our lineage not

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.000
just back the millions of
years since we branched off

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.270
from the great apes, not just
back to the 2.4 billion years

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.790
ago when cyanobacteria
oxygenated the Earth's

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:48.540
atmosphere, and not just
back 4.6 billion years

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.240
to the formation of
the solar system,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.730
but back a few hundred million
years earlier than that, where

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.300
a giant molecular cloud
was polluted with the winds

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.490
of [INAUDIBLE] stars and the
detritus of stellar explosions,

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:11.460
such as this beautiful
modern supernova explosion.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:19.860
Because the atoms, the iron
in the hemoglobin molecules

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.940
of your blood, the
calcium in your bones,

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.810
they were, in fact, cooked up
in the center of massive stars

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.789
that exploded and polluted this
cloud, this molecular cloud,

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:40.039
which eventually collapsed
into our solar system

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:45.710
and our planets, just as this
supernova may be providing

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.980
raw material for future
generations of stars

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.600
and planets.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.050
And the message here is that
you really are intimately

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.880
connected all the way back.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.380
It takes a cosmos
to make a human.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.330
We've been on this journey of
exploration and understanding

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.960
for millennia as we've
pieced together this story.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.570
And the journey still has lots
of potential in the future

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.160
as we try and understand
the undiscovered.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.680
And we're asking
questions about who

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.140
we are, why we are, where
we are, when we are,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.250
and, of course, is there
anybody else out there.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.420
That's yet to be discovered.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.630
But in my career, a long one
and a very enjoyable one,

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.460
there have been two
real game changers.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.130
And you've heard
about those earlier--

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.520
extremophiles and exoplanets.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.450
Right?

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.050
Extremophiles are life
as we didn't even know it

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.210
until a few decades ago.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.330
They're thriving in places
that we once thought

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.220
completely hostile to life.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.750
But of course, that
was our mindset

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.490
about thinking about we as life.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:09:59.990
Right?

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.930
These organisms are
beautifully adapted

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.410
and can live in the
most amazing conditions.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.850
We can find them almost
every place on the planet.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.540
Perhaps there are regions
of the Atacama Desert

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.400
that are too dry to
support this sort of life.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.470
Or perhaps our instruments are
not yet sensitive enough to it.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:29.090
Or perhaps those regions
are populated by weird life

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.760
as we haven't yet discovered it.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.330
So we are now considering a lot
more environmental conditions

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.500
as being conducive to life.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.520
And we now know that
there are more planets

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.800
than stars in the Milky Way.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.610
We've heard that today.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.530
And that means
that there is more

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.680
potentially habitable real
estate than we ever imagined.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.140
And I agree with Lisa that
this is such an exciting time

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.520
because we are on the
threshold of deciding

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.730
whether any of those
potentially habitable worlds

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.220
are actually inhabited.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.250
And so you heard the
story about looking

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:20.770
for biosignatures in the
atmospheres of exoplanets

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.290
around other stars.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:28.660
We are also conducting a
very significant program

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.630
of searching through
our own solar system

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:37.870
to find biomarkers that we can
actually observe and study up

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.413
close and personal.

00:11:40.413 --> 00:11:43.870
But microbes are wonderful.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.662
We're beginning to understand
how bacteria dominates

00:11:47.662 --> 00:11:51.130
the life on this planet,
rewriting the tree of life,

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:56.770
where the two branches
become minuscule compared

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.200
to the branch that is bacteria.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.430
But some of us are interested
in not only the microbes,

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.550
but the potential for the
mathematicians out there.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.290
And that's what we're doing
when we think about plans to try

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.120
and detect technosignatures.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.830
So these
technosignature searches

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.430
will have exactly the
same kind of problems

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.740
that biosignature searches have.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.440
We're going to have to
deal with false positives,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.750
with false negatives.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.180
Often, it's going to
be absolutely essential

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.410
that we understand the
context in time and space

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.210
for what we are observing.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:51.160
And the progress forward
in this field has been--

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.970
it's been very much of a roller
coaster in terms of funding

00:12:54.970 --> 00:13:00.650
because where microbes
don't necessarily

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:07.210
pose any ethical or
religious questions,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:13.190
technosignatures, technologists
out there, certainly do.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.560
But it is true
that the technology

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.700
that we have in the 21st
century is, in fact, detectable

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.950
over interstellar distances.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:26.330
And so it's a perfectly
reasonable question

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.550
to ask of the universe--

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.950
is there anybody
else's technology

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.460
that we could detect
with sufficiently

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.400
systematic and
sensitive explorations?

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.230
So this work began in the
modern era, with a paper

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.610
by Phil Morrison and
Giuseppe Cacconi in 1959.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.820
And although there
are many things

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.090
that you could consider
to be technosignatures,

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.770
the first ones that we started
looking for were signals,

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.160
were electromagnetic radiation.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.190
So we started our search a
little more than 50 years ago

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.110
with radio telescopes.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.420
At the beginning
of this century,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.760
when technologies allowed,
we took that into the optical

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.900
as well.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.500
And now, the frontier for
these searches for signals

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.110
are in the near infrared.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.070
So what are we looking for in
these different wavelengths

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:30.970
regimes?

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.920
We're looking for patterns,
patterns in frequency and time,

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.560
patterns that nature cannot
produce, but engineering can.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.220
And if we were to
find these patterns--

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.660
and oh, my goodness-- actually,
nature did produce that,

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.190
well, that's new physics.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.330
That's not such a
bad booby prize.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:50.830
Right?

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.150
So for example, this
is a waterfall plot.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.970
Frequency is along
the horizontal axis,

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.250
and time is on
the vertical axis.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:05.440
And each dot gives an indication
of the intensity of the signal

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.230
at that frequency time unit.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.130
Lots of snow.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.750
Lots of noise.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.090
But your eye sees
patterns there.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.680
And those patterns
are not natural.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.410
This is, in fact,
the way the planet

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.160
Mars often looks to
our radio telescopes

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.420
when both Mars Express and the
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.050
are on our side of the
planet and their carrier

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.250
waves are being beamed back
to the Deep Space Network.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.370
So this is what we're
looking, for patterns

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.610
in frequency and time
that indicate engineering

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.530
versus astrophysics.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.400
And in the radio, we use
frequency compression.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.630
We look for signals that
occupy only one channel

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.420
on a 9-billion-channel radio.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.650
And in the optical, we
look for time compression,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.910
pulses of light that last
a nanosecond or less.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.270
Both of these kinds of signals
we have reasons to believe that

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.980
nature cannot produce.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.660
So we need to build our own
equipment because astronomers

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.890
are studying the
natural universe,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:20.120
and they're not interested in
building the kinds of detectors

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.510
that would find engineering
as opposed to astrophysics.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:29.390
So whether or not
SETI succeeds will

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.740
depend upon whether there
are any other technological

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:41.090
civilizations out there and what
the distance between them is.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.990
And that's not just
distance across space,

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:49.700
but it's distance across
time, because longevity

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.760
of the technological
civilization, or at least

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.470
the technology, is
required if we're ever

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.950
going to be successful.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.970
We may be looking for
exactly the right thing.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.410
And there may be another
technology close enough

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:13.180
in space for us to detect,
but at the wrong time.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.960
They have to be coeval,
co-temporal with us

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.790
in this 10-billion-year history
of the Milky Way galaxy for us

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.910
to successfully detect a signal.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.690
So longevity is key to success.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.440
Now, turn that around, as
Philip Morrison has done,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.820
and he has called SETI the
archeology of our future.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.970
It's archeology because of
the finite speed of light.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.060
So should we ever
detect a signal,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.710
and should it have any
information content,

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.380
as one of the students was
questioning earlier, it

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.710
will be telling us
about their past,

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:57.160
because it took the light
a long time to get here.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:03.100
But if we detect a signal,
if we have a success,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.930
then we know that, on average,
technological civilizations

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.940
are long-lived.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.090
It couldn't work any other
way for us to be successful.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.350
And therefore, we know
that it's possible for us

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.140
to have a long future.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.100
So you talked about these great
filters, the great barriers.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.040
Are they in our
future or in our past?

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.890
Well, I think SETI is
one of the only ways

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.520
that we might get to know
that, in fact, technology

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.544
is stabilizing and it is
possible to have a long future.

00:18:38.544 --> 00:18:40.210
That's one of the
reasons that I get out

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.610
of bed every morning to
work on this project.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.590
I think it's
incredibly impactful.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:50.110
So I've said we've been
doing this since 1960.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.360
And if you take the
nine dimensional

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.380
space that an electromagnetic
signal, the nine properties

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.280
that the signal might have to
be detectable, and you say,

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.740
I'm going to set that
volume, that search volume--

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.440
I'm gonna set it equal to
the volume of all the Earth's

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:11.210
oceans, and how much have we
searched in 50-plus years?

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.970
Well, when I did
that calculation

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.720
on SETI's 50th birthday,
I said, you know,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.740
we've searched one glass out
of the ocean in 50 years.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.530
Last month, Jason Wright at
Penn State and his students

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.470
published a reexamination
of the calculation.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.911
And it turns out, by now, it's
more like a small swimming

00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:29.410
pool.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.450
But the thing is that
we are on the cusp

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.840
of an exponential improvement
in our capabilities,

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.540
and the tools we can build,
and the computing that we

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.530
can use to search this
multi-dimensional space.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.870
And so it's a
very, very exciting

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:53.740
to see how rapidly our
abilities are progressing.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.160
So we have often used the
tools of the astronomer.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.660
But at the turn
of the century, we

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:03.130
decided we needed our own
telescope to be on the air

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:07.000
all the time,
looking for signals.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.220
And so at the Hat
Creek Observatory

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.700
in Northern California, in
partnership with UC Berkeley,

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.460
we built the Allen
Telescope Array.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.790
We'd wanted to build
350 telescopes.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.485
But, you know, the technology
development took longer.

00:20:21.485 --> 00:20:23.500
It was more costly.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.790
The telescopes are inexpensive
but not as inexpensive

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.080
as we would have liked.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.265
So if you've got to stop
between somewhere short of 350,

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:35.942
it seems like 42
is a good number.

00:20:35.942 --> 00:20:37.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.360
Life, the universe,
and everything.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.130
And this is the
first time that we

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:46.870
have built a large
equivalent telescope out

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.180
of a large number
of small dishes.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.450
And that means, for us,
that silicon and computing

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.910
is as absolutely
important as aluminum

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.360
and steel in these fixtures.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.010
And we hope that
eventually we will

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.490
be able to expand this
fantastic instrument.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:12.850
And starting in 2011, when
the Kepler spacecraft began

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.990
releasing data on exoplanets,
we combined the data on they're

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.970
known exoplanets with the
radial velocity exoplanets.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.490
And we used those
as our targets.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:28.000
And we did that up until
about a year and a half

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.560
ago, when it became
obvious that every star has

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.930
a planet, at least one.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:39.190
And so then we switched over
to another mode of observing,

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.390
which is, our targets are
now the 20,000 nearest

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.640
red dwarf small stars.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.090
Because if we look nearer, we
can detect fainter signals.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.500
And as you heard
earlier, there is really

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.000
a question about whether
planets around a red dwarf

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.900
can maintain an atmosphere,
whether the flares

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.920
from the first billion years
of these active small stars

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.880
are inimical to life.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.169
But we haven't looked at
this class of stars before.

00:22:13.169 --> 00:22:15.710
And so that's what we're doing
with the Allen Telescope Array

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.940
right now.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.060
And you can see an
indication of our technology.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.900
You can see this blank strip.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.930
This is right ascension
and declination.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:26.480
So that's an astronomer's
map of the sky.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.430
You can see this
strip right here.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.770
There are no observations.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.460
That's because that's the
geosynchronous belt, where all

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.210
of our satellites are orbiting.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:45.060
And those signals are so much
stronger than the faint signals

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.550
that we're trying
to detect that when

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:51.180
we point our telescopes
in that direction,

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.710
the receivers clamp down.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.840
It's just too loud.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.170
And so an analogy
that I like to say

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:02.790
is if you took one of our
cellphones, 1 watt transmitter,

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:07.650
and put it on the moon, it would
be the second loudest radio

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.840
signal in the sky.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.430
So we're looking for
very faint signals.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.310
And if you want to
follow this search,

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.790
there's a website
called setiquest.info

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.710
that will show you
the stars that we

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.780
are observing currently.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.470
We observe three at a time.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.640
It helps to distinguish between
terrestrial interference

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.980
and a distant possible signal.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.260
And we do our signal
processing in real time

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.230
so you can see what happens
to signals that are found

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.960
and how we follow up on them.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:45.950
So the other large SETI
program that is now in action

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.060
is the breakthrough--

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.290
I'm now having a hard time.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.100
All right, we can
do this this way.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:55.800
All right.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.480
The Breakthrough
Listen initiative,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.460
which started in 2015 with a
pledge from Yuri Milner of $100

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.280
million over 10 years.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.780
And their intention is to look
at all the stars within five

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.290
parsecs, 1,000 stars
of all spectral types,

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.060
out to about 50 parsecs--

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.520
that's a 150 light years--

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.750
look at a million nearby stars,
look at the center regions

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:26.730
of at least 100 nearby galaxies,
and throw in exotic objects

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.390
as they come along, like
the 'Oumuamua object

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:34.020
from a distant solar system that
came through our solar system

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.300
a few months ago.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.590
So what are they doing?

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.550
They are not building
their own telescopes.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:44.000
They are renting time on
existing large telescopes.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.660
And they are building
spectacular back end

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.760
digital signal
processing systems

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.650
to work with those telescopes.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.070
So this is the Green Bank
telescope in West Virginia,

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.020
at the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.110
They are also using the Parkes
Telescope in New South Wales,

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.710
in Australia.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:05.180
They are using the Automated
Planet Finder Telescope

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.590
at Lick Observatory in San Jose,
California to do optical SETI.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.100
And they have recently signed
a memorandum of agreement

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.460
with the FAST, the very,
very large telescope that's

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.770
just coming online in China,
with the MeerKAT Array of 64

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.310
dishes in South Africa,
with the Jodrell Bank

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.710
telescope in the UK.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.850
And we can look forward
to observational programs

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.250
on these telescopes
with new back end

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.140
equipment in the near future.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.610
So that's the big city projects.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.530
But there is more SETI on the
telescopes around the world

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.450
today than those.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:48.750
How many of you have ever had
SETI at home on your computers?

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.490
Yeah?

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.300
OK.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.570
Well, it's still running.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.210
It's 12 years on.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:58.820
And it was developed
by UC Berkeley.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.820
And I think this is what
put distributed computing

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.860
and citizen science on the map.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:09.590
So you can use a
screensaver to look

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:15.420
through data recorded
Arecibo, or at Green

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.070
Bank in the same way that we do
at the Allen Telescope Array.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.950
In real time, you can
work on recorded data

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:28.820
to try and help process these
data for finding SETI signals.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.420
There's a new array spreading
over Northern Europe

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.490
and the UK called LOFAR.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.460
And they are beginning to look
for transient low frequency

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.750
radio signals.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.520
There's a small
group in Italy that

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.850
used the Medicina, a
32-meter telescope, and now,

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:49.810
are switching to trying to do
SETI on a new radio telescope

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.560
at 64 meters.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.360
And there is a sky
survey being done

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.800
by students at the Goldstone
Apple Valley Radio Telescope

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.790
down near the Deep Space
Network in Southern California.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:08.390
And this is a sky survey that
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.930
was proposing to do
when we were a NASA

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:16.070
project, before the funds
were terminated in 1993.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.889
NASA was able to move--

00:27:17.889 --> 00:27:18.430
I don't know.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.260
I think they moved the
fence, not the telescope.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.260
But now the telescope
is outside the fence.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.490
And it's been incorporated
into this research, student

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.780
educational facility.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.710
And the students are conducting
that sky survey today.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.800
This is the Mileura
Wide Field Array,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.740
a lot of very interesting
dipoles in the deserts

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.240
of Western Australia.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.290
And they've begun to look
for transient SETI signals.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.300
In the optical part
of the spectrum,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.510
Harvard has been leading
the way for a long time.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:54.200
The students built their
own optical SETI telescope.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.000
And it takes about--

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.580
let me see.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.750
They can look at
about 80% of the sky.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.350
And I think it takes
about 280 clear nights

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:10.670
to scan the entire sky, looking
for these bright optical

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.270
flashes.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:16.670
And they re-observe the
sky a number of times.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.730
The data from the
Keck Observatory,

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.850
from the high-res
spectrometer, which

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:28.430
is used to find exoplanets with
the radial velocity technique,

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:32.570
those data have been
reanalyzed, looking for lasers,

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.360
looking for, actually,
continuous lasers

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.790
or bright flashes of lasers.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.620
There's an amateur
optical SETI observatory

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.140
at Boquete in Panama.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.640
And they are looking at
some interesting new signal

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.470
processing techniques.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:56.720
And as I said before, the
near infrared and optical part

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.340
of the spectrum is being
explored at Lick Observatory

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.880
in San Jose.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.620
And we've begun doing
some serious data mining.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.250
This is a project that Jason
Wright and his students

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.650
at Penn State have undertaken.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:15.940
The WISE spacecraft
explored the entire sky

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.740
at infrared wavelengths.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.130
And they're now going
through that data

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:26.050
to look for very advanced
kinds of technology--

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.600
a Dyson sphere,
something that captures

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.780
all the energy of
its star and would

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:36.580
have an infrared excess
radiation from the back side

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.950
of the panels of
the Dyson sphere,

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:43.750
or even more extraordinary,
a civilization of Kardashev 3

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.990
type that could control
all of the energy

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.650
from all of the
stars in its galaxy.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:59.480
And we are, right now, beginning
to prototype and deploy

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.570
some different optical
SETI detectors.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:07.220
So on the left is one
of the four VERITAS

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.300
detectors, which are actually
looking for high energy

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.280
cosmic rays, gamma rays.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:18.890
And they are being
retrofitted, or the software

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:24.570
is being retrofitted, to find
those events which are not

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:31.350
long trails on the sky, but our
individual pixels that turn out

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.830
to be the same pixel on the
sky from all four telescopes.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.800
And we'll see if we
can use these Cherenkov

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.140
detectors in a new way.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.800
And then a project
called PANO-SETI

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.030
being developed by a
collaboration between Harvard,

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:52.815
and UC San Diego, and Berkeley,
and the SETI Institute.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.610
If you come from Berkeley,
you gotta Buckminster Fuller

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.050
geodesic domes.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:05.200
Well, imagine a geodesic
dome with 126 sections,

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.900
each one of which is filled
with a Fresnel lens that's

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.060
a half a meter across.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:16.980
And that can capture light from
a very large area on the sky

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:23.730
and focus it onto very fast
optical arrays of detectors.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:30.150
And a couple of those
will also focus the light

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.270
onto much more
expensive and much newer

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.030
technology that works
in the infrared.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.640
And this way, you
can build something

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.050
that looks at 10,000 square
degrees on the sky at one time.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.310
And then as the
sky turns overhead,

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.940
you get to look at the
whole sky eventually.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.730
And because you're
looking for transience

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.450
and you want
confidence, of course,

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.970
you'll build two of these--

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.790
one in Northern California,
one in Southern California.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.230
They overlap where they're
looking on the sky.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.350
And when you get
coincidence detection,

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.230
you have a very
strong indication

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.780
that that was a real
transient signal.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.810
And then at the SETI Institute,
10,000 square degrees

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:10.570
wasn't enough.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.320
We wanted to be able
to look at all the sky

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.650
all the time for bright flashes.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.570
And so we're
building something we

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:23.520
call Laser SETI, built on
very good quality astronomical

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:29.010
cameras with high resolution
gradings and fast readout.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:35.100
And so if we can manage to
put eight cameras at each

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.370
of 12 sites around the
globe, then we really

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.320
will be looking at all
the sky all the time.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.790
So the first prototype of this
goes up at the ATA next month,

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.430
we hope.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.370
But in terms of the
astronomical future,

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.100
we need to think about how to
use the tools of the astronomer

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:53.880
again.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:59.790
And we have these great pieces
of telescope coming on air.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:04.710
So the JWST, which you heard
about, WFIRST, which we hope

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:07.740
will be the next one that
flies with a star shade

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.820
to block out the bright
star, and finally, something

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.820
that we're beginning to
think about and design, two

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.230
options, one called
HabEx, one called

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:21.390
LUVOIR, the large ultraviolet,
infrared telescope.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:27.450
And we need to figure
out how we can get access

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:32.550
to the data or instrumentation
on these telescopes

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.110
to look for optical SETI.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.210
And it's not only from space.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.890
But here's a weird
telescope that's

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:43.420
been proposed to look at
only one star system--

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.460
and that's the Alpha
Centauri star system--

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:52.540
and perhaps be able to make
an opacity map of Proxima B,

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.820
the planet around the
very nearest star to us.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.400
The devil is in the details.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.030
We'll see if this
gets supported.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.300
We know that these telescopes
are coming on the ground--

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.260
the 30-meter telescope, the
Giant Magellan Telescope,

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.730
the extremely large
telescope at 40 meters,

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.850
downsized from the
overwhelmingly large telescope

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.110
of 100 meters.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.330
We couldn't do that one
with this current generation

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.560
of technology.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.020
And finally, the LSST, Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope,

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.179
which, every few
days, will give us

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:29.770
a new picture of the heavens.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:33.080
And for SETI, FAST
will come on the air.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.330
Hopefully, the
MeerKAT Array will

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.960
grow into the Square Kilometer
Array in South Africa.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.520
And we might even
get an equivalent

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.010
in the US of the
next generation VLA.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:50.000
We want to be doing SETI
on all these instruments.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.900
And for me, whether
or not SETI succeeds,

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.820
I think it has a really,
really important message.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.790
And that's what I'm
trying to do today,

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.470
to change your perspective.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.060
Because if you sit
and listen to me

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.280
talk, or anyone talk,
or think about SETI,

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.890
you've got to realize that
it's putting a mirror up

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:13.080
to everybody on the planet.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.550
And the message is,
you, you're all the same

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:21.150
when compared to
something else out there.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.840
And I think that this
is the perspective,

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:30.510
the cosmic perspective, that
we need globally in order

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.630
to attack the challenges
that we heard about

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.290
earlier with respect to
energy, and water security,

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.850
and food security.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:45.010
We need to think and
act as one species.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.020
We are Earthlings.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:51.970
And I'll leave the last
word to Caleb Scharf,

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.430
who's the chairman of the
astrobiology department

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:55.750
in Columbia.

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.030
And he says, "On
a finite world"--

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:02.810
that's us-- "a cosmic
perspective isn't a luxury,

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.390
it's a necessity."

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.360
And so you all have a
homework assignment.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.580
When you get back to your social
media, go in to your profiles

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.480
and change the first thing
that you say about yourself

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.120
to the fact that you
are an earthling,

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.524
and then act like it.

00:36:22.524 --> 00:36:23.492
Thank you.

00:36:23.492 --> 00:36:26.396
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:32.204 --> 00:36:34.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.060
OK.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:41.690
- So we are honored that Jill
will answer some questions now.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.790
And so we'll use
the same procedure.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:46.520
If you could come to the
microphone at the center.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.990
And again, try to keep your
question as a question.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:55.170
And we have time for about
maybe 10 minutes of this.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:56.266
I'll come get you.

00:36:56.266 --> 00:36:56.980
Thanks.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:57.480
- Yes.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:57.980
- Thank you.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.750
Really enjoyed the talk.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:00.890
I had a question.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:05.280
You said that detecting
a signal would suggest

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.570
longevity of the civilization.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.100
And I'm confused by that.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:16.730
Isn't the fact that you
have such a large sample

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.690
and that they span so
much distance and time

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:24.890
that statistically you
could get a signal--

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:29.780
you have a whole range of worlds
from which that could emerge,

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.920
even if they've had a
very short lifespan.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.290
- Well, if they had a short
lifespan, we would have to be--

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:42.630
let's make it ridiculous.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.700
Let's say that somehow
the technology arose,

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.840
and 10 years later, it did
itself in, it blew itself up,

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.850
destroyed its world, whatever.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:56.450
We would have to
choose and be very

00:37:56.450 --> 00:38:01.610
lucky to be looking at
that particular world

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.260
during those 10 years.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.574
- So just the fact
that we're looking

00:38:05.574 --> 00:38:07.230
at a very small sample--

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.080
- No, we're going to
look at a large sample,

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.750
but the fact that you
would have to hit them

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:17.120
in just the right 10
years, it makes it much--

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.150
statistically, what
you're going to detect

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.051
is the long-lived civilizations.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:27.710
- Hi.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.680
My name's Siobhan.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.340
I went to Barnstable
High School 10 years ago.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.220
- Oh, OK.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.700
Did you have the same
fantastic teacher?

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.930
- I did.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.490
And Caylee's my sister too.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:41.340
So I have to brag about that.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.470
But my question is
maybe a little silly.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:49.080
But in media, in
certain television

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:54.480
series like The X-Files,
in movies, a lot of them

00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:02.280
perpetuate this idea that if
contact had been made already,

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.180
our government would
hide it from us.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:12.190
And I was just curious
about hearing from you,

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.640
one of the people that
would be the first to know--

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.436
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.550
Do you think that
if contact was made,

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:29.190
you guys would be allowed to
tell the public right away?

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.470
Because people would panic.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:35.250
Surely some people would
panic and get upset.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:38.280
Do you trust the general
public with this information?

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.800
- Yeah, actually, let's
start with that piece of it.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.870
And the social
scientists have done

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.530
a number of research protocols.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.840
And they've asked the question.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.800
And they find that already,
an overwhelming percentage

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.784
of the people on the planet
feel that it's quite likely

00:39:57.784 --> 00:39:58.950
that there's life out there.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.680
Some of them feel it's visited
us already, some of them.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.020
But it's not new news.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.860
It's really not the
kind of news for which

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.490
you would panic at this point.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:14.180
This idea has seeped
out into the culture

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.950
enough so that we don't
really think that there's

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:18.240
an opportunity for panic.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.930
As to whether the government
would try and shut it down,

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:26.230
it's really going to be a hell
of a difficult secret to keep.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:27.120
We are privately--

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.260
- Blink once for yes.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:28.760
- Hmm?

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.260
- Blink once for yes.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.675
- Yeah, right.

00:40:31.675 --> 00:40:32.175
Exactly.

00:40:32.175 --> 00:40:32.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:33.720
It's not quite that.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.650
But there is a--

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.300
we do have a false
faith that when

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:40.770
we observe that,
yes, we don't expect

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.750
that that will be an issue.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:47.120
Certainly, the government,
almost any government,

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.970
but current example,
probably, is not

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:54.060
good at doing these
sort of things.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.360
So we intend to tell the world.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.280
And we'll tell you what we know.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:08.160
And it may be something
that completely comes back

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.560
with a lot of
baggage of caveats.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.390
We think this, but
we can't prove it.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.510
It's possibly this,
but it might be that.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.130
But we will share
the information

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.650
for whatever we discover.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:24.180
And as we begin to go beyond
these kinds of signals

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.150
that we've been looking
for and consider

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:30.360
other technological
modifications such as--

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.870
we heard about the
TRAPPIST-1 system.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:36.960
That's seven planets
orbiting a small dwarf

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:43.650
star, all within the distance
of the orbit of Mercury.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.590
Those planets are different
distances from the star.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:50.130
But what if, when we
get these great tools,

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:53.610
and we actually make an
image of those seven planets,

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:57.080
we find out that they all
look exactly the same?

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.310
Now, they shouldn't.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:01.640
Naturally, they should reflect
their distance from the star.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.880
But maybe somebody out there
needed more real estate

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.210
and they started transforming
some of these planets

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.760
because they had enough
energy to be able to do that.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.740
That kind of far-out thinking
is what's going on with respect

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.270
to technosignatures these days.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.630
And that one's going
to be really loaded.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:24.200
I mean, if we ever discover
something like that,

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.090
we'll tell you, but
it's going to have

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:29.441
an awful lot of caveats.

00:42:29.441 --> 00:42:29.940
Yeah.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.370
- Jill, thanks for a great talk.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:34.890
I was really struck
by your metaphor

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.900
of searching for
just the one-- we've

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.090
searched one glass of water
out of an entire ocean.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:43.560
And sometimes, in
my own work, I feel

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.130
like the challenges
are insurmountable,

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:52.830
whether it is just coping with
the distances, the tiny sizes

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.440
of the signals that
we're searching for,

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.080
or whether it's my
proposal got rejected,

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.570
or funding for science is
going down, or whatever.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:05.010
And I was curious, over the arc
of your career, what you draw

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:08.518
on for inspiration on bad days.

00:43:08.518 --> 00:43:12.150
- Ah, yeah, those bad days.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:15.300
It's the fact that
we can do today

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.090
what we couldn't
conceive of a year ago.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:22.300
And next year, we'll be
doing so much better.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.366
So you get out of
bed, or at least I

00:43:24.366 --> 00:43:25.740
get out of bed in
the morning not

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.340
thinking, today's the day
I'm going to get a signal,

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.710
because that's bound
to have a bad result.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:34.920
But you get out of bed thinking,
I gonna make the search better.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.060
We'll be able to do this.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.410
We'll be able to do that.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.240
And maybe, eventually,
we're going

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.500
to be doing the right thing
to find whatever is out there.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:48.450
So it's simply to look at
14 or 15 orders of magnitude

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:53.040
improvement over Frank
Drake's first search in 1960

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.270
and understand that with
exponentials, the best

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.500
stuff happens in
the last folding,

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.400
right, the last factor of 2.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.240
So yes, it's the
opportunity to do something

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.990
better than we did in the past.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.490
- Thank you.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:11.170
Your career is an
inspiration to us all.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:13.092
- Oh, Thank you, Laurie.

00:44:13.092 --> 00:44:16.068
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:23.170
- In respect to the
star shade, what exactly

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:28.440
would that item give you,
give your space telescopes,

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:36.430
for recognizing any
sort of alien signal?

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:40.060
- Well, so there a lot of
bright lights up there.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.550
And I can put my thumb
over one of them.

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:46.090
And then I can see if
there were anything

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:49.210
on the ceiling that were
small and faint around that.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:50.290
That would help.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.810
But my thumb isn't good enough.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:57.850
As we heard earlier, the
Earth, in optical wavelengths,

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:02.950
is 10 billion times fainter
than the star, the Sun,

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.030
if you were looking
at it from a distance.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:09.100
So what you have to try and do
is block out that bright star.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.240
You can do it with an instrument
inside the telescope called

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.430
a coronagraph, which
actually takes that starlight

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:17.710
and scatters it far away.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:20.800
But it's hard to get a factor
of 10 billion that way.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.960
But the star shade is just that.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.540
It flies in front
of the telescope,

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.610
and it serves the same purpose--

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:32.690
blocking out the star light so
that you have an opportunity,

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:37.750
perhaps, to be able to
image the faint planets very

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:40.185
close to, around
that bright star.

00:45:40.185 --> 00:45:43.990
- Is there a distance
to where it's

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:46.450
no longer efficient to use it?

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:50.110
- We actually have
not flown one yet.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:55.570
We hope that WFIRST will fly one
as a technology demonstrator.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:58.174
And it is flying--

00:45:58.174 --> 00:45:59.590
oh, I can't remember
the distance.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.520
Can anybody remember?

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.780
I think it's a few hundred
kilometers out in front

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:09.290
of the telescope to
cast this big shadow.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:13.210
- Do you give any credence to
the TV show Ancient Aliens or--

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.010
- I think science fiction
is a marvelous way

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:23.060
to help us think about things
that we can't conceive of.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.085
That wouldn't be
one of my choices.

00:46:25.085 --> 00:46:27.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:31.100
But I think science fiction
is actually fantastic.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:37.490
It gives us examples of
stories, where life was detected

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.770
and we didn't realize
that it was alive.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:41.420
It was a life that
we didn't yet know,

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.640
and we didn't realize
that it was alive.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.480
And we can explore
those kinds of ideas

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.900
and think about how
we use them to keep

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:55.910
our minds open to
future discoveries

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:58.592
of the undiscovered.

00:46:58.592 --> 00:47:00.550
- You've been doing this
for a number of years.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:01.936
And I'm just curious about--

00:47:01.936 --> 00:47:03.310
there were a couple
of times when

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:06.130
you thought you got
a signal, and what

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:07.240
that experience was like.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.080
And if it turned out it
wasn't, what kind of things

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.500
would cause you to
get that-- yeah.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.400
- That adrenaline
rush is unbelievable.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.840
And you get so excited,
you do stupid things.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.650
And so every time we have one
of these, our list of checklists

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:29.230
and what you do next
gets longer because we

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:31.090
learn from our mistakes.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:35.620
Yes, the one-- the one
that was most spectacular

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:41.650
for me personally
was, we observed

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.860
with two widely separated
telescopes in this project

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.260
that we call Phoenix.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.900
We were using the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.530
telescope.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:54.460
And we had a second
telescope in Georgia.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.710
And the telescope in
Georgia got hit by lightning

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:59.410
and it fried a disk drive.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.940
So it took FedEx a few days to
get in there with a new disk

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.440
drive.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.000
But we still have this
telescope in West Virginia.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.500
Right?

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.730
So what can we do?

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:08.920
We don't have the
differential Doppler signature

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.610
from the two telescopes to help
us distinguish interference

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:14.410
from the real thing.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:17.560
So you look at the star
that we were pointing at.

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.660
You see a signal.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.670
It's a picket fence in
the frequency time plane.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.710
That's not natural.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:24.520
And you look away.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.597
The signal goes away.

00:48:25.597 --> 00:48:26.680
You come back on the star.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.910
The signal's there.

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:30.560
Look off in a different
direction, signal goes away.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.990
Come back on the star--

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.334
hours of this.

00:48:33.334 --> 00:48:35.500
And early in the process,
I thought, well, you know,

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.580
that picket fence has a very
regular spacing in frequency.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.760
Why don't I query
our database and see

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.910
if we've ever seen that
frequency spacing before

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:48.045
from another part of the sky.

00:48:48.045 --> 00:48:48.670
And I did that.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:49.340
I wrote the program.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:49.970
It compiled.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:53.420
But I was in a hurry, and I
didn't do very good formatting.

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.780
It was kind of a mess
when I read it out.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.210
And indeed, it was the
right question to ask.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.390
And indeed, we had seen it
from other parts on the sky.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.000
But the columns
were mixed up, and I

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.150
didn't see that we
actually knew that it

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.580
wasn't coming from that star.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.350
So we spent the day.

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:12.220
The star set.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.850
And the nature of the signal
was changing over time,

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:19.150
changing in a way
that we knew that it

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:22.600
was rising above
us to the zenith

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.450
rather than setting in the west.

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:28.030
So we went off, and
had some dinner,

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:32.080
and did some internet
research, and figured out

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.410
it was the SOHO spacecraft
orbiting the sun,

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:39.520
getting in a tiny little
side lobe of the telescope.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.460
And that was really
disappointing.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.530
But you know what?

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.360
Our colleagues
back in California

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.050
were all excited because
we'd shared this with them.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:54.220
So they stayed up through the
night waiting for the star

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.386
to rise again because I forgot
to call them and tell them it

00:49:57.386 --> 00:49:57.886
wasn't.

00:49:57.886 --> 00:49:58.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:01.400
And I have paid--

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.780
I have bought so many drinks
in bars over the years

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.485
to apologize for
that bad behavior.

00:50:07.485 --> 00:50:08.860
- Thank you for
that great story.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.551
- OK.

00:50:11.551 --> 00:50:12.050
- Hi.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.120
Can you describe
what our planet looks

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.790
like to the observers that
are on another planet,

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:17.660
looking for us?

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.520
- It does.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:25.550
The strongest radio
signals that we actually

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:34.130
have are associated with the
radars that are looking--

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:36.200
over the horizon radars.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.060
And the most
numerous transmitters

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:41.780
we have are still the
ground-based broadcast

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.180
television and radio stations.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.760
And so if you looked
at our planet,

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.370
and you were looking at
the right frequencies,

00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:53.570
you would see it sparkle
as those transmitters came

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:56.140
over the limb as
the planet rotates.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:59.900
And you would see various
frequencies light up

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.490
from these signals.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:03.200
And indeed, there's
a great study

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.890
by Woody Sullivan a long time
ago that we need to redo.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.860
But you could actually--
back in the day, when

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.830
it was all broadcast
television, you

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.290
could figure out
the different parts

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:20.360
of the globe assigned different
television stations, slightly

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.220
different frequencies.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:27.050
So you might be able to conclude
that geopolitical structure

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:30.800
on the planet was not
global, had some differences.

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.020
But-- how we doing?

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.585
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:37.543 --> 00:51:38.980
- Thank you very much.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.417
- You're very welcome.

00:51:43.936 --> 00:51:45.810
- Well, that was certainly
worth waiting for.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:47.470
Thank you, again, Jill.

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.970
Thank you.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:51.330
And it falls to me to try
to say a few things that

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.160
connect what we heard today.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.860
And before I do that, I
just would like to point out

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.860
something that's kind of
a preamble to what I'll

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.140
say in a minute, which
is, this is the list

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.860
of countries where people are
now listening and watching

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.630
what's happening here--

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:10.620
the United States, Canada,
Belgium, Argentina, India,

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:14.100
the Netherlands, Turkey, Chile,
the United Kingdom, Israel,

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.070
Sweden, and Taiwan,
as far as we know.

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:18.750
So there are
hundreds or thousands

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.780
of people watching this live.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.780
And that's been
possible for the last--

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:26.340
I don't know--
decade or something.

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.710
It's become much
more popular now.

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:32.130
And you know, even
in places as far away

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:36.130
as Taiwan, people are clearly
up in the night watching this.

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:38.850
So thank you very much, Taiwan.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:45.180
And what this is allowing here
is an example of Radcliffe.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:48.600
My friend Immaculata here, my
colleague, Immaculata de Vivo,

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.120
the other director for
science, said, you know,

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.030
Radcliffe is being
discovered and used

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:56.070
to be part of the undiscovered.

00:52:56.070 --> 00:53:01.500
And technology is allowing
us to talk to more people.

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.180
And what we're doing is we're
transmitting information.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.760
And I think the
theme that you heard

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.640
today is that we've gotten
to the point where there

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.220
is so much information
and our ability

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.830
to gather this information,
and to put it together,

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:17.670
and to process it using
ever faster computers

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:22.470
is necessarily changing how
we emit the truth about how

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:23.742
we do science.

00:53:23.742 --> 00:53:25.200
So in other words,
you used to have

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.400
to share data with
close colleagues

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.740
and not share beyond
there, because there

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.690
wasn't so much to go around.

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:35.550
But now, in almost
every field, there's

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:39.000
too much information for
people to process on their own.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.920
So you heard about teams.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.160
You heard about people
using new algorithms

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.670
and finding cures for
diseases or finding out

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:50.190
that Alzheimer's
might have something

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:52.650
to do with viruses,
when that was clearly

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:55.360
not something anybody
was looking for.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.630
And so stepping
back and saying--

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:01.900
I think Nate's word that he used
several times was "reframing."

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.570
We have to reframe
the kinds of questions

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:07.660
we can ask in the presence
of so much information.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.230
And you heard a lot of people
use the phrase "big data."

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:11.980
I don't particularly
like that phrase

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:15.520
because what's important-- and
I do do data science sometimes

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.546
in my day job.

00:54:16.546 --> 00:54:17.920
And I know what's
important there

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.740
is what you heard some of here
today, which is combining.

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.450
You just heard Jill
tell you about so

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:25.060
many different telescopes
being used in the search

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.740
to answer one question.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.750
So you have a lot
of cases where you

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.030
have a lot of different
kinds of information being

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:32.850
brought to bear on a question.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.870
And we like to call
that "wide data."

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.660
You can think of it
as data diversity.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.240
OK?

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:41.470
So there's this plethora
of information that's

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:43.330
just getting larger and larger.

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:45.640
And we're inviting more
people into the conversation.

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.560
You heard about Citizen Science.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.680
Sometimes you hear this phrase,
"democratization of data."

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.530
Most importantly, you heard
the unbelievable questions

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:55.940
from the Barnstable
High School students.

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.060
Thank you again.

00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:59.800
And you heard about transitions.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.860
When we were talking, for
example, about climate,

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.320
you heard that there
are some transitions,

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.570
in some cases, that we just
want, like the transition

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.360
that we were talking about today
about how we teach education,

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:15.230
and some that we need, like the
way that we handle the climate.

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.050
And so we're at
this point where we

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:22.600
have to have a conversation with
the public about science, which

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.680
I was trying to think about it.

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:29.020
And it's a little bit
about how you're a parent.

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:32.080
And so I'm lucky enough that
my parents are here today.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.790
My daughter happens
to be in Morocco.

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:37.330
She's not on the list
of people watching this.

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:37.830
But--

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:40.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:43.510
But thinking about being a
parent and being a child,

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:46.780
there's this need to respect
your parents that you're

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.160
taught when you're very young.

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.410
And there's a need to
respect scientists.

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:52.630
And there's a need to
respect what's in the book

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:55.840
and what you have to learn
from what's in the book and all

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.600
that stuff that Stuart told
us this morning about what

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.220
you have to know.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:03.890
But then at some point, many
points in your life as a child,

00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:05.920
you have to learn
when to ask questions,

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.990
and when to stop
just completely--

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:09.490
I'm sorry to my parents--

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:15.040
respecting authority, and
just go a little bit outside.

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.220
I think earlier I called it
something like out-of-the-book

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:18.820
thinking.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:19.460
OK?

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.940
So going beyond what
your parents tell you.

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.610
But the thing is,
the danger here

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:26.800
is that we need to
admit uncertainty.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.060
We need to admit ignorance.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:31.330
We need to admit the mist
that Stuart was talking about,

00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.790
this fog that we look
at science through.

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.560
And if people haven't
had the experience

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.300
and they haven't been
taught in the right way,

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.980
they are going to
come to the conclusion

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.600
that that means we don't
know what we're doing.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.420
And if you have
good parents, you

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.620
don't ever come to that
conclusion about them.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:46.120
Right?

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.410
You still respect them.

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:49.240
But you can question them.

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.030
And that's how scientists have
to behave with their colleagues

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:52.990
as well.

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:54.880
And you heard these
stories about people

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.410
having data in a
drawer that they

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:59.560
didn't want to put out there
because it was going to violate

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.740
conventional wisdom, and it
was going to question authority

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:05.090
in a way that they
thought they might not get

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.150
tenure or something like that.

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:09.550
And I think that when we
have much information,

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:10.330
and a lot of it--

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:13.360
you heard people talking about
open data and open software.

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.260
We have this need and this
desire now for transparency.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.020
And yeah, we'll get to the point
of more reproducible research.

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.390
But really, it's not about
reproducing research.

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:25.660
It's about opening
new avenues and about

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:29.650
this idea of the undiscovered.

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:34.420
And I think that there are
so many questions to be asked

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:39.500
in this vast realm of
ignorance-- thank you, Stuart--

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:43.220
that I would just
like to close--

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:44.680
I want to thank a few people.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.630
And then, what I would
like is to capture

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.640
that spirit of the
undiscovered one more

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:54.460
time by asking Caylee to have
her poem read for her by us

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:55.790
one more time.

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:59.320
But I guess my
closing thought is

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.960
that in this era of
so much information

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.870
that you heard about
across all of these fields

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:11.050
and this so much more
inviting, instead of capable--

00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:13.930
or capabilities that
we have in terms

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:16.300
of ways of dealing with
it, and the more people who

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.510
are involved, we
can't hide any more.

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:23.080
We have to be open
about our ignorance.

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.530
And we have to somehow do
it in a way where we still

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:31.690
respect our parents or
the people who gave us

00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:34.050
this education that we
had that led us to ask

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:36.419
these intelligent questions.

00:58:36.419 --> 00:58:37.960
And so with that,
I would really like

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:41.710
to thank all of the
speakers for bringing us

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:43.040
this wonderful set of talks.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.426
So let's have round of
applause for the speakers.

00:58:45.426 --> 00:58:46.412
Thank you.

00:58:46.412 --> 00:58:49.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:55.210
And then you see so many
people scurrying around,

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:57.120
making this all look effortless.

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.980
But there really was about
a year of preparation

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.896
for this event.

00:59:01.896 --> 00:59:03.520
And I can't name them
all one at a time

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.436
because there are just
so many people helping.

00:59:05.436 --> 00:59:07.330
But I would just like
to thank the staff who

00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:10.008
participated in making this
such a fantastic event.

00:59:10.008 --> 00:59:12.864
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:14.292 --> 00:59:16.210
Thank you.

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:20.750
And I'll remind you that,
after Caylee reads her poem,

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:22.820
we can move to the
place where there

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.480
are copies of her poem,
the poster session.

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.650
We'll continue next
door with, this time,

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:31.560
a reception instead of lunch.

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.460
And I would just
like to say thank you

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:37.814
all for coming and for making
this such a fantastic day.

00:59:37.814 --> 00:59:39.230
And let me turn
it over to Caylee.

00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:40.198
Thank you.

00:59:40.198 --> 00:59:42.618
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:50.250
- You all ready for round two?

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:56.340
[LAUGHS] So I hope
that, because of all

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:58.560
of these amazing speakers
we've had here today,

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.860
that you can recontextualize
this poem I've written

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.860
and have a much
deeper understanding

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.110
of the meaning behind it.

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:09.710
So in case you missed
it the first time,

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:14.330
the poem's title is
"Method Versus Muse."

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:18.530
"People have drawn a thick
line between art and science.

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:21.890
But what is science
without the arts?

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:23.750
The questions that
need to be asked

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.660
can't come from a formula,
when, for centuries, they've

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:30.950
been deeply rooted in the
hearts of geniuses and prophets

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:33.230
with brains full of thought.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.360
It seems that,
over time, humanity

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.170
forgot how to think critically
and to question with care.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:42.230
And in an age of
internet access,

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:45.260
the answers are
always right there.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.840
And schools are so
focused on students

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.610
having all the right
answers that they

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:55.370
forget that we're poets,
and designers, and dancers.

01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:59.870
They draw facts on young minds
like piles of heavy bricks

01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:02.570
and expect us to
absorb information

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:04.870
stacked miles thick.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.790
They teach us so much.

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.640
But now, we need
to build from it.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.440
They marched with
us to base camp.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.900
But our goals are at the summit.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:18.170
Applying what we know to
explore the unforeseen

01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:20.750
and the undiscovered
is easier said

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:24.380
than done when curiosities
lie dormant and smothered.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:28.340
Every day I see young minds
afraid to ask questions.

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:33.660
It cripples the scientific
world at its very foundation.

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:39.180
Research never comes without
curiosity, without a spark.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.790
And my spark would
have died too,

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:44.340
but I found my
light in the dark.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:48.110
My creativity led me to
ask all the right things.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.690
And now I stand here before
you to ask, when will you

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:55.010
change the tune that you sing?

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:57.950
What will it take for
schools to open their eyes

01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:00.500
to a world of
unmatched opportunity

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.740
that very clearly lies in
the minds of young people

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.960
who still have their fire?

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.240
When will you take
their thoughts

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.490
and lift them up higher?

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:13.040
Maybe you will be
the one to inspire

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.600
someone's great questions
or someone's desire.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.070
Teach young minds to fall
in love with the unknown.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:25.970
For every question we ask,
there are many more to go.

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:30.140
Nurture the creativity we
all harbor in our hearts.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:34.490
And maybe we will give way for
a new way of thinking to start."

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:35.360
Thank you.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.460

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.060

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.460
- Thank you.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.910
Thank you so much.
