00:00:00.835 --> 00:00:03.655
 ok so the question is 

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:06.865
 the totalitarian forms of expression we have seen so far have been masculine 

00:00:07.565 --> 00:00:10.435
 But maybe we see something else now 

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.555
 I don't think it's anything else 

00:00:14.555 --> 00:00:17.595
 It is something similar 

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:19.885
 who has spread its influence 

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.735
 Imagine that there is an essential feminine pathology 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.665
 just as there is an essential masculine pathology. Freud clearly laid the essential feminine pathology 

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:29.900
 "Oedipus mother" 

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.495
 That's the mother there 

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.445
 coming too close to her children 

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:39.615
 that interferes too much with them 

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:42.595
 There, in trying to protect them, will undermine them 

00:00:42.595 --> 00:00:43.645
 in a fatal way 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.175
 There is a classic representation of the feminine in the West 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.680
 The Mother of Jesus 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.955
 One of those representations 

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.625
 that is beautiful 

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.865
 Maria has her foot on a snake 

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:05.435
 And she keeps Christ up like that 

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:08.435
 That is exactly how mothers have always done 

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.025
 It is a biological portrait of the human woman 

00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:14.195
 who keeps his infant away 

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:16.815
 the horrible snake-like predator 

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:18.985
 it is obvious 

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:22.595
 But adult people are not infants 

00:01:23.455 --> 00:01:24.845
 And neither are children 

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:28.695
 and if you treat them as such, you undermine them 

00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:34.425
 You make them sick and make them old babies 

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:36.045
 It's ugly 

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:39.645
 the freudian nightmare 

00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:42.500
 It happens quite often in therapy 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.440
 one can have a terrible relationship with his father 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.660
 often because he was 

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:51.285
 absent, abusive or tyrantical 

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:57.605
 But the common morality around mother is that she did everything for you 

00:01:57.975 --> 00:01:59.745
 What is left as you can do? 

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:01.285
 Nothing! 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.980
 Including never leaving home 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.600
 That is the motivation 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.460
 for the woman who is the overprotective mother there is nothing besides 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.560
 To take care of 

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:21.815
 infants 

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:24.665
 You just care to keep them as babies 

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:25.665
 so they never leave one 

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:28.145
 .... maybe they'll kill one when you sleep 

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:31.855
 but they never leave home 

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:37.485
 It is comical to see the postmodern feminists 

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.045
 waffle that gender does not exist 

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:44.155
 while in their actions 

00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:47.575
 plays the archetypal devouring mother at the same time 

00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:53.185
 They believe that the world can be divided into predators 

00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:55.105
 and infants 

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.485
 The predators are evil and must be stopped 

00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:00.475
 and the infants you have to take care of 

00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:04.085
 That's how Mother does 

00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:06.595
 But adults are not children 

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:10.165
 and you destroy them that way 

00:03:10.165 --> 00:03:13.195
 especially teenagers who just started their development 

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:17.265
 There is a rule I tried to follow 

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:20.245
 when I had young children 

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:23.245
 Do nothing for them as they can 

00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:27.125
 That rule is piss annoying 

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:32.415
 It takes 15 seconds to wear a 2 year old clothes 

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:34.825
 When he himself has to do it, it is 15 min 

00:03:35.445 --> 00:03:38.055
 or 20 or 30 

00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:41.985
 But if you teach them, you no longer have to 

00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:44.935
 And they can do well 

00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:47.865
 And you do that with everything 

00:03:47.865 --> 00:03:50.125
 "no you can now" 

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:52.975
 "I love you so much that I will do it for you" 

00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:54.085
 I do not like you at all if I say so 

00:03:57.385 --> 00:04:00.135
 I will not do anything for you as soon as I can 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.260
 How to work in a nursing home 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.820
 Don't do anything for the old ones 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.615
 as they can do for themselves, then they steal the last independence from them 

00:04:10.615 --> 00:04:13.545
 This is how you act as a manager 

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:16.375
 You make yourself superfluous 

00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:18.765
 by spreading autonomy 

00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:22.095
 so the people on the floor can handle it all by themselves 

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:25.275
 You don't do that by doing everything for people 

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:28.205
 and not at all by dividing the world 

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:31.035
 completely uncritical 

00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:33.855
 up in predators 

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:36.865
 and victims, infants 

00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:38.815
 then pretend to protect them 

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:41.435
 You can't protect people 

00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:43.195
 only make them strong 

00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:45.345
 that's all 

00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:48.905
 then they can protect themselves 

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:50.285
 And then they don't need you 

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:53.795
 and from there the pathology emerges 

00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:56.885
 "never leave me" 

00:04:56.885 --> 00:05:00.315
 "I will do everything for you, but never forsake me" 

00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:07.805
 The Freudian nightmare 

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.925
 You separate the child from himself 

00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:13.665
 You separate them from your husband 

00:05:14.155 --> 00:05:17.565
 and you fertilize the soil for their independence 

00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:20.615
 It is one of the reasons why it is useful for a mother and a father 

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:22.735
 The mother will have to fall in love with the infant 

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:25.875
 otherwise she will throw it out of the window 

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:28.915
 They are insanely demanding and always right 

00:05:28.915 --> 00:05:31.925
 The right month to treat a small infant 

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:34.925
 "I do everything for you and you are always right 

00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:37.555
 Your needs are more important than everyone else's 

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:40.585
 and anyone who threatens you is terrible " 

00:05:40.585 --> 00:05:44.015
 But when the child starts to crawl 

00:05:44.015 --> 00:05:47.195
 is the right attitude - 

00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:50.395
 "see getting started" 

00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:53.295
 Men who are less prone to negative emotions 

00:05:53.295 --> 00:05:56.255
 and have less compassion 

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.265
 is better at fostering this type of independence 

00:05:58.265 --> 00:06:01.495
 so it is usually the men 

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:04.505
 who play wild games 

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:07.895
 push them forward and say "get started. You can do it" 

00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:12.315
 It is difficult for a mother to be in both roles 

00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:13.725
 because she must fall in love with the infant 

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:17.065
 that it is difficult to be universal nursing mother 

00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:20.265
 and disciplining at the same time 

00:06:20.265 --> 00:06:23.285
 for the roles are contradictory 

00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:26.265
 Now there are lots of women in politics 

00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:29.155
 and they have taken their essential characteristics 

00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:32.035
 while saying "essential traits do not exist" 

00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:33.115
 Well they do!
