one of the nice things about memory as a
 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:06.820
one of the nice things about memory as a
subject of study for cognitive

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830
subject of study for cognitive
 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.740
subject of study for cognitive
psychologists is that it doesn't require

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750
psychologists is that it doesn't require
 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.840
psychologists is that it doesn't require
a lot of high technology to do with

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850
a lot of high technology to do with
 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.250
a lot of high technology to do with
experiments so we can actually do a

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260
experiments so we can actually do a
 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.110
experiments so we can actually do a
simple memory experiment right now that

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120
simple memory experiment right now that
 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.150
simple memory experiment right now that
you can test yourself with I'll just

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160
you can test yourself with I'll just
 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.550
you can test yourself with I'll just
read out a series of words and I want

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560
read out a series of words and I want
 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.070
read out a series of words and I want
you to listen to the words and um try to

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080
you to listen to the words and um try to
 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.660
you to listen to the words and um try to
remember them and then after a little

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670
remember them and then after a little
 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.130
remember them and then after a little
while I'll ask you some questions about

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140
while I'll ask you some questions about
 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.650
while I'll ask you some questions about
the words so we'll get started I'll read

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660
the words so we'll get started I'll read
 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.840
the words so we'll get started I'll read
them about one every second or so bed

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850
them about one every second or so bed
 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.729
them about one every second or so bed

so that was a simple list of words and

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839
so that was a simple list of words and
 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.930
so that was a simple list of words and
what I'm gonna do now is just ask you

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940
what I'm gonna do now is just ask you
 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.699
what I'm gonna do now is just ask you
about some of the words that may or may

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:03.709
about some of the words that may or may
 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:05.830
about some of the words that may or may
not have been on the list you can just

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840
not have been on the list you can just
 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.170
not have been on the list you can just
think to yourself now was that word part

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180
think to yourself now was that word part
 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.480
think to yourself now was that word part
of the list or not let's start with

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490
of the list or not let's start with
 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.050
of the list or not let's start with
snooze think about whether that was part

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060
snooze think about whether that was part
 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.510
snooze think about whether that was part
of the list now we'll try Apple was that

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520
of the list now we'll try Apple was that
 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.050
of the list now we'll try Apple was that
part of the list next

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060
part of the list next
 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.510
part of the list next
house was that part of the list how

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520
house was that part of the list how
 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.570
house was that part of the list how
about dream was that part of the list

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580
about dream was that part of the list
 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.149
about dream was that part of the list
and what about sleep was that on the

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159
and what about sleep was that on the
 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.550
and what about sleep was that on the
list so we just did about the lowest

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560
list so we just did about the lowest
 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.070
list so we just did about the lowest
technology possible memory experiment a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080
technology possible memory experiment a
 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.480
technology possible memory experiment a
list of words that you have to remember

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490
list of words that you have to remember
 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.219
list of words that you have to remember
and answer questions about this

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229
and answer questions about this
 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.780
and answer questions about this
experiment was actually originally done

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790
experiment was actually originally done
 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.630
experiment was actually originally done
by researchers named James Dees and also

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640
by researchers named James Dees and also

Roddy rota ger and Kathleen McDermott
 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.930
Roddy rota ger and Kathleen McDermott
and what they found was that people are

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940
and what they found was that people are
 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.270
and what they found was that people are
of course pretty good at realizing that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280
of course pretty good at realizing that
 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.950
of course pretty good at realizing that
which words are inside the lesson which

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960
which words are inside the lesson which
 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.660
which words are inside the lesson which
words were not in the list but there's

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670
words were not in the list but there's
 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.859
words were not in the list but there's
one kind of mistake that they make

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869
one kind of mistake that they make
 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.219
one kind of mistake that they make
pretty systematically and that's falsely

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229
pretty systematically and that's falsely
 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.080
pretty systematically and that's falsely
saying that the word sleep was part of

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090
saying that the word sleep was part of
 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.509
saying that the word sleep was part of
the list so the word sleep wasn't in the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519
the list so the word sleep wasn't in the
 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.699
the list so the word sleep wasn't in the
list that I just gave you the list was

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709
list that I just gave you the list was
 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.720
list that I just gave you the list was

yawn and drowsy all those words have to
 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.280
yawn and drowsy all those words have to
do with sleep but sleep was actually not

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290
do with sleep but sleep was actually not
 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.020

in the list yet a lot of subjects in

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030
in the list yet a lot of subjects in
 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.360
in the list yet a lot of subjects in
these in this experiment falsely think

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370
these in this experiment falsely think
 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.610
these in this experiment falsely think
that sleep was there and they're usually

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620
that sleep was there and they're usually
 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.990
that sleep was there and they're usually
pretty confident that sleep was in that

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000
pretty confident that sleep was in that
 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.610
pretty confident that sleep was in that
list also it's not sort of a marginal

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620
list also it's not sort of a marginal
 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.370
list also it's not sort of a marginal
it's not a marginal thing so even in a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380
it's not a marginal thing so even in a
 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.170
it's not a marginal thing so even in a
simple situation like this just trying

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
simple situation like this just trying
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.360
simple situation like this just trying
to remember a few words our memories can

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370
to remember a few words our memories can
 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.940
to remember a few words our memories can
play tricks on us
