00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.370
- [Instructor] When we
look out into the cosmos

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.480
for alien life, many folks
look for signs of water

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.600
on moons or planets.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.210
And that's because life as we know it

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.580
is dependent on water.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.040
And to understand that,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.950
we just have to take a closer look

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.570
at some of the properties of water.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.090
So what you see here are
some molecules of water.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.630
This might be a review for you.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.630
Every water molecule has one oxygen atom.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.280
And it is bonded to two hydrogens.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.280
So that is a hydrogen, and
that is a hydrogen as well.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.670
And the nature of that bond,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.210
it is a covalent bond,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.760
which means that the
oxygen shares electrons

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.480
with each of the hydrogen atoms.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.610
But oxygen is more electronegative,

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.600
and that's just a fancy way of saying

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.770
that even though those
electrons are shared,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.490
they're going to be spending more time

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.060
around the oxygen than
around the hydrogens.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.040
One way to think about it

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.880
is oxygen likes to hog electrons
more than hydrogen does.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.360
And since the electrons
will spend more time

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.030
around the oxygen than
around the hydrogen,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.090
and because it's a bent molecule

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.960
with the hydrogens on
one side of the molecule,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.340
what happens is the side
where the oxygen is,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.400
where the electrons spend more time,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.180
that gets a partially negative charge.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780
So this is the lowercase
Greek letter delta.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.980
That just means partially negative charge.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.460
And then the sides
where the hydrogens are,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.130
those acquire a partial positive charge.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.790
And so what you see here

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.470
is that a water molecule is
not charged in aggregate.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.210
But either side has a partial charge,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.520
so it is a polar molecule.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.960
And so you can imagine when you put

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.760
a bunch of water molecules together

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.060
what might happen?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.860
Well, the partially positive side

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.410
of one water molecule
where the hydrogens are

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.010
would be attracted to the
partially negative side

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.850
of another water molecule.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.910
And so they would be attracted,

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.020
and this is known as a hydrogen,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.550
hydrogen, hydrogen bond.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.100
And I could keep drawing that.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.070
This is going to be
partially positive here.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.500
This is going to be partially negative.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.910
They will attract.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.670
This oxygen end is going to be attracted

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.570
to that hydrogen end.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.620
This oxygen end is going to be attracted

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.460
to the that hydrogen end as well.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.880
And so it's this hydrogen bonding

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.330
that gives water a lot of the properties

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.570
that make it special
that, as far as we know,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.760
for harboring life or for even
allowing life to be possible.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.300
Life as we understand it
needs a fluid environment.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.360
Things move around and
bump into each other.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.830
And it's these hydrogen bonds,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.270
when the temperature and
conditions are appropriate,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.800
that allow water to be in that liquid form

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.330
where they're strong enough

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.320
so that the water stays together,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.310
but they're weak enough so that they allow

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.980
the water molecules to
flow past each other.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.250
And not only does it provide
a good fluid environment,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.200
it's a very good solvent.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.810
Water is often known as the universal,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.490
universal solvent, but it's
worth putting a disclaimer here.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.150
Even though people say it
is a universal solvent,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.600
that does not mean that
it dissolves everything.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.100
Water does dissolve more
things in its liquid state

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.090
than anything else we know about.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.070
But there are many molecules
that it cannot dissolve well.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.870
The things that it does dissolve well

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.750
are polar molecules or
things that have a charge.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.090
For example, when sodium
chloride dissolves in water,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.690
a sodium ion is positive,

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.760
so that is positively charged.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.120
And so you can imagine
it might be attracted

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.850
to the side of the water molecules

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.580
where the oxygen is.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.960
But it dissolves well.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.680
But things that don't have charge

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.240
don't tend to dissolve well in water.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.210
But even the property

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.110
that there's certain things
that it does not dissolve

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.090
is also good for life.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.372
Later on in biology we're going to study

00:03:58.372 --> 00:04:01.660
phospholipid bilayers where
you have these molecules

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.110
where one end is hydrophilic,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.340
which means it's attracted
to water molecules.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.380
And then the other ends are hydrophobic,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.070
which means they're not
attracted to water molecules.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.550
And many evolutionary biologists believe

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.910
that this property of having one side

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.400
that's hydrophilic and one
side that's hydrophobic

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.490
would have allowed these molecules

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.470
to start collecting into membranes,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.300
eventually forming these
spherical membranes

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.910
which could be the containers
for early cellular life.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.570
Now, another property of water

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.910
which makes it very suitable for life

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.043
is it's high heat capacity.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.330
Sometimes you'll hear people say

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.720
it has a high specific heat.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.200
The specific heat is the
amount of energy needed

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.690
to raise one gram of water
by one degree Celsius.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.420
And you might say why
does that matter for life?

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.140
Well, many life forms can only operate

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.160
within a certain range of temperatures.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.320
And so if it was really easy
to raise the temperature

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.530
of water really high or very
low temperatures very fast,

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.840
well, that would make it much harder

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.360
for life to operate within water,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.850
or even life to be made up of water.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.670
A related idea to this

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.670
is that water also has a
high heat of vaporization.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.620
We talk more about this
in detail in other videos,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.140
but this is talking about how much energy

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.990
does it take for water to
go from its liquid form

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.470
to its gas form.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.060
And this has proven
valuable in many life forms

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.090
for a form of cooling
where the vaporization

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.910
of water, evaporative cooling,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.290
can take heat away from an organism

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.150
so that it doesn't overheat.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.100
Other properties that
are important about water

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.900
include cohesion and adhesion.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.020
Cohesion is the property
of water molecules

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.370
that is attracted to
other water molecules.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.600
And you saw it here
with the hydrogen bonds.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.360
But then when you look at a macroscale,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.820
you'll see things like
water droplets form.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.120
You've all seen water
droplets, or dew droplets.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.640
These droplets couldn't form

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.830
if not for the cohesion of water.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.720
And even one drop can be an environment

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.700
in which thousands of
microorganisms can live.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.580
Adhesion is the property of water

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.650
where it can adhere to other things.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.680
You might have seen this
in a glass test tube

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.460
where it looks like the water is

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.060
kind of crawling up the top of the sides.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.270
And that's because some of the polarity

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.870
of the glass molecules of the test tube.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.340
But this property,
along with the cohesion,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.510
is what allows water
to transport nutrients,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.450
say, from the roots of a tree

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.580
all the way to the top of a tree.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.640
These properties are also an action

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.440
in our own blood vessels, when you get

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.400
to the really small blood
vessels, the capillaries.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.260
And that is called capillaries

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.080
'cause you have capillary action of water,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.680
which is due to its
cohesion and its adhesion.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.677
A last property of water,

00:06:56.677 --> 00:06:58.740
and this is not an exhaustive list,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.520
is that it is less dense as a solid.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.020
So another way to think about it is

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.110
ice, which is solid water, is less,

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.110
less dense than liquid water.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.440
Now, you might be thinking
why does that matter for life?

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.830
Well, imagine the environments

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.620
where we think life first arose.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.680
If you imagine some type of a pond,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.620
and this is the cross-section of it,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.270
if ice was more dense than liquid water,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.250
and for many substances that is the case,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.020
a solid form tends to be more dense,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.220
then what would happen?

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.280
If it's cold up here in the air,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.240
say, in the winter, then
this part would freeze.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.630
But then as it got more dense

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.210
it would sink to the
bottom right over there.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.280
Then the next surface water would freeze

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.490
and sink to the bottom.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.790
And then over time, the
entire lake or the entire pond

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.570
would freeze over, and
life would not be able

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.230
to live in that pond.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.690
Because when water freezes,

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.800
it breaks membrane-bound
structures as we know it.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.540
And so that would not
be suitable for life.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.510
But because ice is less dense than water,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.090
what typically happens is
just that top layer freezes.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.840
And then it'll freeze down as things

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.380
get colder and colder.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.930
But you have an entire environment

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.910
where life can continue to thrive

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.240
even when the air is much colder

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.040
than what is suitable for life.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.350
And because of water's high specific heat,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.540
that temperature variation in that water

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.620
is going to be much less

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.160
than the temperature variation
outside of the water,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.840
either in the air or on the land.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.450
So this is just an introduction,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.030
but hopefully it makes you appreciate

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:29.980
water a little more.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.810
And remember, and I've
said this in other videos,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.870
we are mostly water.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.050
One way to think about it is

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.110
that each of us is made
up of trillions of cells

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.300
which are primarily made up of water

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.400
and exist in a water-based environment.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.700
They coordinate with each other

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.280
and eventually have emergent complexity

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.763
that thinks that it is a
sentient being like each of us.
