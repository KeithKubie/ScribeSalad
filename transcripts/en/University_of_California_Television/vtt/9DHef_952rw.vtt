(light music)

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.580
- I'm Margaret Chowning, a
member of the History Department

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.300
but also more relevant
for today's meeting,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.563
Chair of the Moses Lectureship Committee.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.920
We are pleased, along with
the graduate division,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.650
to present Mary Ann
Mason, this year's speaker

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.763
in the Bernard Moses
Memorial Lecture Series.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.710
As a condition of
Professor Moses's bequest,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.120
we are obligated to tell
you how the endowment

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.893
supporting the lectures
came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:34.960
In 1937, University of
California president

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.310
Robert Gordon Sproul and
the UC Board of Regents

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.130
established the Bernard
Moses Memorial Lectureship

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.420
in the Social Sciences.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.720
The Lectureship honors
the memory of the late

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.890
Bernard Moses, a professor
of history and political

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.440
science at the University of California

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.430
from 1875 to 1911, and
an emeritus professor

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.003
from 1911 until his death in 1930.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.920
Professor Moses earned
a worldwide reputation

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.570
for his contributions to understanding

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.703
the problems of the
Latin American republics,

00:02:11.807 --> 00:02:16.143
and he was a pioneer scholar
of Latin American history.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.850
Professor Moses served as a
member of the United States

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.110
Philippine Commission from 1900 to 1904.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.210
Past lecturers have
included Herma Hill Kay,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.630
Lloyd Ulman, Nicholas
Riasanovsky, George Lakoff,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.110
Kenneth Stampp, Eugene Hammel, Ken Jowitt,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.683
Carolyn Merchant, Jean
Lave, and Emmanuel Saez.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.140
Now I'd like to say a few
words about today's lecturer,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.343
Mary Ann Mason.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.640
Professor Mason is currently a professor

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.670
of the graduate school,
and faculty co-director

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.710
of the Earl Warren Institute
for Law and Social Policy

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.713
at the UC Berkeley School of Law.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.770
Mason is an influential force in the areas

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.070
of family law, policy,
and child custody issues.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.730
Her lecture today, in part inspired by her

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.720
forthcoming book, Do Babies Matter?

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.100
Gender and Family in the Ivory Tower,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.510
which according to Amazon
is coming out in May,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.340
does that sound right?

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.173
- [Mary Ann] July.

00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:23.613
- July.

00:03:23.613 --> 00:03:25.800
(laughs)

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.650
This book will ask why
female doctoral graduates

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.480
do not follow the same
career trajectories as men

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.140
after receiving their degrees.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.490
Drawing on 12 years of
research, Mason traces the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.810
effect of family formation
on women from graduate school

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.250
through retirement.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.712
This follows on her more
recent work concerning

00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:48.330
the issues that professional
women face in law,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.513
medicine, science, and academia.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.110
Mary Ann Mason received
her PhD in American History

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.740
from the University of Rochester, and a JD

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.170
from the University of San Francisco.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.060
After teaching American
History and practicing law,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.620
Mason joined the faculty
of UC Berkeley in 1989,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.060
and served as a professor
in the Graduate School

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.260
of Social Welfare until 2007.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Between the year 2000 and
2007 Mason served as the first

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.320
woman dean of the Graduate
Division at UC Berkeley.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.810
She was and is a strong
advocate for graduate student

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.480
diversity, equity for student parents,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.590
and career life balance for all faculty.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.430
Her research is a foundation
for UC's system-wide

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.710
initiatives, including the
UC Family Friendly Edge,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.060
and the nationwide nine presidents
summit on gender equity.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.528
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Mary Ann Mason.

00:04:44.528 --> 00:04:46.778
(applause)

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.250
- Thank you, Margaret.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.620
I'm very honored to be the
Moses lecturer this year,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.610
and to be able to speak to my family,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.710
my Berkeley family, my favorite people.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.160
And my actual biological
family is here as well,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.840
where are you?

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.448
You didn't sneak out already.

00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:07.500
(laughs)

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.713
My daughter Eva and my husband Paul.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.140
I'm particularly glad to
be here because as Margaret

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.470
mentioned this actually
represents 12 years of research,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.430
and you have been my experimental subjects

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.740
for most of this time, as you will learn.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.730
So you might be able to
see yourself in some of

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.400
these pictures and charts and graphs,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.093
because we have been studying
you, and the whole UC system.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.400
This started actually when I first became

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.250
the Graduate Dean at
Berkeley in the year 2000.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.910
And I have to say, as an old 70s feminist,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.200
I was thrilled to see that
a little more than 50%

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.910
of the entering class were women.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.810
Unbelievably exciting to me.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.370
Thought we'd never see
this in my lifetime.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.280
The graduate students were
less impressed because

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.140
that's what they grew up
with, they didn't realize

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.390
how different things had been.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.690
So as you can see from
this, in terms of the rise

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.150
of women PhDs, in 1973
it's 20%, and now it's

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.160
actually a little more than 50%.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.250
I got a PhD in 1973, actually,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.900
and it was only 12% of
my class were women,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.360
so that doesn't surprise me.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.530
I got a law degree after
that, and only 10% of my class

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.990
were women, now law
school is well over 50%,

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.450
and certainly graduate degrees in history,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.800
as you know, are probably
over 60% as well.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.940
So things have changed greatly.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.920
Amazing, within my lifetime
to see such change.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.040
And it's not just overall,
it's also in the sciences,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.270
which everyone said was going to be stuck

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.620
in wherever forever, but in fact,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.480
since 1973 you've seen huge
growth in lots of fields.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.475
In psychology it's 71% now.

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:53.240
Even in the field of
engineering of all places,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.410
it's over 22%, coming
from zero that's a really

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.680
pretty good jump.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.935
And similarly you have
geoscience, and math and science

00:07:02.935 --> 00:07:05.060
are really going up very fast.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.150
Altogether about a little
less than 30% of all PhDs

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.800
in the sciences are now granted to women.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.630
So this is enormously impressive progress.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.630
However, I looked around me
and there are some issues here.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.727
So this is a test.

00:07:22.727 --> 00:07:25.690
And the winner either
gets Starbucks or bourbon,

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.750
depending on your predilection.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.650
So what do you think
this diagram resembles?

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.626
I mean the figure on the
right has got kind of

00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:36.880
a masculine hulk to him, and the woman on

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.862
the right's got those little
bulgy hips, it's hard to know.

00:07:39.862 --> 00:07:41.580
So what do you think it is?

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.480
Start at the top, it's the easiest.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.063
The two heads there,
there's the 987 and the 325.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.530
And this is Berkeley.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.135
And Paul you probably know the answer.

00:07:54.135 --> 00:07:56.810
(laughs)

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.420
Anybody else want to
guess what this might be?

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.253
The heads.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.860
No, actually, tenure track professors.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.570
We're kind of a shrinking faculty.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.920
987 to 325 of tenure track,
that includes assistant

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.950
as well as associate and full.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.410
And the most important story here though,

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.810
as it is in general in higher education,

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.665
are the necks.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.000
You see that women have
tiny heads and thick-ish

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.950
necks compared with
the little skinny necks

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.140
that the men have.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.833
What do you think the neck is?

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.849
Yes?

00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:30.780
Adjuncts, part-time,
lecturers on this campus.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.170
Doesn't include graduate
students, just the

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.730
adjuncts, part-time, and lecturers.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.960
Now the necks are the fastest growing part

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.173
of higher education.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.690
It's really a stunning figure
in the other direction,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.960
not a good direction.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.950
About 20 years ago
something like 58% of all

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.300
undergraduates were taught by tenure track

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.960
professors and now that's down to 37%,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.740
and going down further.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.700
The model has been to
shrink the professoriate

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.420
and raise the basically
the fungible workplace,

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.550
the workplace that is
cheap and can move on.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.630
Now this is only Berkeley,
because we're not

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.690
really doing this with the other slides,

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.370
but what do you think
the 3000 and 4000 are?

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.203
Pardon me?

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:14.120
They're a lot of, could
be the graduate students,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.752
you're right, but it's not.

00:09:15.752 --> 00:09:17.030
It's actually the staff.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.780
And the staff have,
because there are a lot

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.710
of technical people, and
people who work in the labs,

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.300
the men have higher paid
jobs, so those are the

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.310
broad shoulders, and women not so much.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.660
And then at the bottom,
the female bulge there,

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.480
there are lots of, at a school like this,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.180
residence workers and
restaurant workers, et cetera,

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.280
who are women.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.578
So this is the face of Berkeley.

00:09:41.578 --> 00:09:44.700
But it actually is the face
of most American corporations.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.940
And certainly all other
major universities.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.490
I've had people look at this diagram

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.750
and do their own, and it's very similar.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.040
It's what happened since
the feminist revolution.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.830
Huge numbers of women in the workplace,

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.130
but taking the bottom half.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.150
And with some representation at the top,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.330
but not too much, much more
in the middle management,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.790
the neck positions, in the corporate world

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.833
and in our world it's
basically the gypsy scholars.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.250
This is a little distressing,
I knew this of course,

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.870
it wasn't a great surprise to me.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.430
And I wanted to look at it more carefully,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.980
for my students to see
what was going to happen,

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.620
and more importantly, for
the university to see it

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.300
and to take some steps.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.020
So what happens to men and
women after they get their PhDs?

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.483
How does having babies affect tenure?

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.960
We had a wonderful data set to use.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.863
How many PhDs are in this audience?

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.430
There you go, I knew it, I
knew there'd be a lot of you.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.620
So every one of you,
if you got a PhD before

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.120
or after 1973, filled
it out once, the survey

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.340
of earned doctorate.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.470
We don't let you graduate
from the graduate division

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.990
unless you fill out that survey.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.360
So that's the base, and 10%
of all PhDs are followed

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.360
through every two years,
until they are 76,

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.850
dead, or have left the country.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:10.080
It's very hard to escape
NSF, just don't even try.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.522
So that is 160,000
participants, and arguably,

00:11:13.522 --> 00:11:17.310
it is the best employment
longitudinal database

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.830
that we have in America.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.120
You can ask questions from
this database that you're

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.760
not gonna find even for
instance, for doctors,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.970
or lawyers, they don't
have this kind of database.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.760
So we're really fortunate,
'cause you can really

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.520
pinpoint when and how family
formation makes a difference.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.740
Who gets tenure?

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.470
Do you see the old familiar
heads and necks again?

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.192
So what is it?

00:11:40.192 --> 00:11:41.380
Well we can see the guy on the right here.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.750
Guy, we're used to thinking
he's a guy now, in blue.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.750
78% of those who go into
academia of the men get tenure.

00:11:52.662 --> 00:11:56.530
And 22% go into the second
tier, part-time faculty,

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.120
non-tenure faculty, those are the fathers.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.950
The fathers actually,
married men, do better than

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.900
anyone else in the university in terms

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.340
of promoting up the ladder.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.190
They do better than single
men, they do better than

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.388
single women, they do a lot better than

00:12:10.388 --> 00:12:12.600
married women with children.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.266
The women with late or
no babies do pretty well,

00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:19.870
they're kind of in between, 71%.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.880
And they have a somewhat bigger neck.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.090
Late or no babies, by our definition,

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.470
late is really about over age 40,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:33.090
because it's anytime time
post-PhD, five years post-PhD,

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.272
the average PhD is now given at age 34,

00:12:36.272 --> 00:12:38.555
so you're really flirting around age 40

00:12:38.555 --> 00:12:41.120
when you're talking about a late baby.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.140
So anything over 40 would be a late baby,

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.180
there aren't too many of those.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.880
There's no difference between a late baby

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.120
over 40 or an early baby, but early babies

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.008
make a huge difference.

00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:53.740
And this is anytime, again,
before about the age of 40.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.410
And you can see that the
women who have the big necks

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:02.410
are disproportionately
married women with children.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.120
Now, the interesting part
is, here's the science world.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.560
Same pattern.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.770
As you'll find out, things are tougher for

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.360
women in science in some
ways, but the patterns

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.520
are remarkably similar to what happens

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.190
in the humanities and social sciences.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.870
In this case you see smaller
numbers because there

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.620
are fewer scientists to begin with,

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.030
so the heads and necks and whatever,

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.290
are disproportionately,
it's 3000 and 3000.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.940
And then the men have the same big heads,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.680
and same looking neck.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.500
In this case, however, the
women with late or no babies

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.950
in science do not do that well.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.030
They actually have a lot
of trouble getting tenure,

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.810
even if they don't have babies.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.580
And those who have babies
do pretty miserably,

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.400
53% to 77%.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.696
So this is the way academia
has been playing out,

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:55.410
and it hasn't changed much,
these kinds of images,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.180
probably for the last 10 years or so,

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.440
it's been fairly stable.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.210
Now looking at it a different way,

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.430
it shows kind of a timeline here

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.290
of falling out of the pipeline.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.340
And this is again, everybody,
it's not just the scientists.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.780
And you see the biggest
leak in the pipeline,

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.730
and this is true in science as well,

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.700
is before taking that first
assistant professor job.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.360
Women are likely to drop out
as you'll see in a moment,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.070
as post-docs, or change their
minds as graduate students.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.880
They've already decided,
hell no, I won't go,

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.210
and don't take that.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.780
It's the pool promise, we call it.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.530
Because when you're trying
to hire for a new position,

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.290
you find you don't have as
many women applying for it

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:40.780
proportional to the numbers.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.080
So this is a familiar one.

00:14:43.286 --> 00:14:46.640
And then women are 27%
less likely to become

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.430
associate professors, in other words,

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.020
they just don't get tenure.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:55.020
And women, leg-in and
those slow, slow years

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.630
of being an associate professor forever,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.430
so 20% less likely after 16 years

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.180
of being an associate professor
to be a full professor.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.980
So you see it all the way up,

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.230
but for women in general it's
really the younger years,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.940
the post-docs and the graduate
students where you see

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.490
the biggest change, they just don't

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.880
enter the pipeline at all.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.960
Here you have women in science.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.970
Now the interesting part
about women in science

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.930
is that they, single women actually,

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.540
take that first job, that
first tenure track job,

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.650
just about in the same
proportion as married fathers do.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.290
So they're really at an
even keel up to that point.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.610
And then single women take a big tumble

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.410
and don't get tenure.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.350
But the interesting part about it,

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.140
it's not just the mother effect.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.720
There are more complicated
things going on in science.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.430
I think the, I have
been studying with women

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.170
scientists now for the
last two or three years,

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.260
and the complexity of the implicit bias

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:59.260
and the stereotyping and
the gender discrimination

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.060
are really quite serious in the sciences.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.090
They're across the board
but not quite as much

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.711
as in the science.

00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:09.310
And in the sciences,
married mothers are 35%

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.140
less likely than married
fathers to take a tenure track,

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.910
and married mothers drop out 27% less than

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.610
married fathers with young
children to become tenure.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.270
So scientists take a
bigger hit, no question,

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.610
with motherhood.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.970
But it's not just
scientists who take the hit,

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.690
the patterns are there, it's
just tougher in science.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.930
And I think the women,
are there women scientists

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:30.763
in this room?

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.850
Is that your perception?

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.003
Yes.

00:16:35.003 --> 00:16:36.180
(laughs)

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.651
It is.

00:16:37.651 --> 00:16:38.660
And I think women scientists get much more

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.170
discouraged in early age,
so they're more likely

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:45.081
to drop out, which is what
we're really trying to aim at.

00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:49.291
These are post-docs, now
in the UC system we have

00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:52.550
just about as many post-docs
as we have doctoral students

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.660
in all the system itself,
about 8000 of them I think.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.530
And the most dramatic
thing, we actually have tons

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.020
of data on our UC post-docs,
because in addition

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.640
to the survey of doctorate
recipients we did

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.170
several original studies,
this is where you're

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.120
probably part of it.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.290
How many are faculty members here?

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.724
There we go.

00:17:12.724 --> 00:17:14.710
In 2003 there was a UC family survey,

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.320
which became our backbone
and has been brought up

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.910
to date really by the climate survey.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.070
And then in 2005 we did
all the doctoral students,

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.110
how many doctoral students in the office?

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.420
In the office.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.253
(laughs)

00:17:26.253 --> 00:17:27.920
Okay, you might have done
this, or you might not have

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.340
been here in 2005.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.750
And then in 2007 we did the post-docs,

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.000
we had this whole series.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.120
Again, the biggest data
set for these classes

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.310
of workers of any in the United States,

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.530
no one has that kind of
data for graduate students,

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.400
post-docs, or faculty.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.950
That gives you a kind of heft and power.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.030
But it's a distinct drop
off there, 41% who have

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.360
a new child since they became a post-doc,

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.090
say they changed their
opinion and they're no longer

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.780
going to become a research scientist

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.100
at an academic institution.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.100
41%, versus fathers who become children.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.276
Who become children.

00:18:07.276 --> 00:18:08.537
(laughter)

00:18:08.537 --> 00:18:09.920
I didn't say that.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.880
Who have children, right, right.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.300
And those who had children
previous to a post-doc,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.830
again you see a big slide,
they just find the post-doc

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.270
years just too tough.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.500
Other kinds of criteria when we measured,

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.330
the women with children
are far less likely

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.360
to go to conferences,
which is the lifeblood

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.140
of networking and getting a job.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.610
They're far less likely to
have a good relationship

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.770
with their mentor, which
is not very helpful

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.820
either 'cause your
mentor is the person who

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.580
most helps you through life.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.903
So post-docs have a serious disadvantage.

00:18:38.051 --> 00:18:42.640
And show it by just dropping
out of the pipeline.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.470
For scientists I think
that's really critical,

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.120
'cause we spend about half
a million dollars, at least,

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.990
to educate, the federal government does,

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.060
to educate scientists through their PhD,

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.440
and their post-doc, and then they leave,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.000
just because we don't do
much to help them stay.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.401
So it's really not a
very good use of funds.

00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:05.890
And this is our graduate students.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.400
Now you all I'm sure know the
graduate students quite well.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.610
They change their career goal as well.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.960
We did a snapshot, but we asked them,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.650
have you changed your career
goals since you entered?

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.757
And at the beginning of
entering their post-doc,

00:19:19.757 --> 00:19:24.757
not their post-doc, their
graduate program, women, 46%,

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.700
wanted to be a professor
in a research institution.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.070
But if they had a baby,
and these are all women

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:36.060
in the sciences, that number
absolutely plummeted to 11%.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.840
Basically getting rid of all the mothers

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.100
who had babies as doctoral students.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.970
For fathers, beginning number was 58%.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.960
And that went down to 45%.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.000
So it had an effect, but
not the drastic effect

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.130
that childbirth has.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:54.510
So childbirth is really, the
major reason I think why,

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.940
in certainly the
sciences, the women do not

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.710
look as strong as men
going through the pipeline.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.510
They start out pretty well, 30%,

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.370
and then they go down pretty rapidly.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.930
Okay.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.210
Now here, these are our own
sweet graduate students,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.010
and you've probably
heard remarks like this,

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.650
or maybe you haven't, from women,

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:16.650
all uniformly, in just the
comments, the freehand comments.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.910
I wanna be able to have
a family, have children,

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.410
enjoy being a mother and
wife, which are close to

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.880
impossible when one chooses academia.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.840
The clock is ticking
and it will not stop for

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.635
anything or anyone.

00:20:28.635 --> 00:20:31.450
And then, here we see the guy.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.500
Fed up with the
narrow-mindedness of supposedly

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.750
intelligent people who
are largely workaholic

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.700
and expect others to be so as well.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.090
He's sick of it too.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.330
So both men and women change their mind,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.240
but women more than men, and almost always

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.890
for family reasons, a significant
difference in that regard.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.910
And it's true that both men and women,

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.490
the majority, believe
that their university,

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.280
which is one of our UCs, is
not at all family-friendly.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.470
So we don't have a good example.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.530
How many of you have had
women graduate students

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.404
say, I don't wanna live your life?

00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:02.487
(laughs)

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.880
Doesn't do well as an example.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.570
So here's a repeat of this
first part of the study.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.760
Again, this is over many many studies,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.870
and over several years, but
just compiling together.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.630
Married mothers are 35% less likely

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.649
to enter tenure track
jobs than married fathers.

00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:26.430
Married mothers are 27% less
likely to achieve tenure

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.490
than married fathers.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.000
And mothers often make
their decisions early.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.510
Twice as many women than men are likely

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.860
to change their career
goal away from being

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.833
a research professor when
they have babies as post-docs.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.920
High percentage of mothers
slide into the second tier,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.580
the neck, the part-time,
adjunct, and lecturer corps.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.777
The gypsy scholars of
the university world.

00:21:49.777 --> 00:21:51.930
And I was a gypsy scholar for a while,

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.370
anyone else been a gypsy
scholar in this class?

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.570
There you go.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.440
It is the least well-paid,
least respected,

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.130
high educated discipline in this country

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.690
in terms of a job, it really
is just at the bottom of the

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.870
bill, no respect, no money,
no continuity, et cetera.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.910
And yet you find so many women and men,

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.090
but largely women, doing it because it's

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.810
really the only way they can continue on

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.510
in the university, or think it is.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.550
And then, after several years,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.300
we'd gotten this pretty well organized,

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.010
and figured women were
dropping out, et cetera.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.698
It occurred to me, and
several others actually,

00:22:30.698 --> 00:22:34.660
that there was another
important question to address.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.640
That equity was not just
looking at the numbers

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.250
of women compared with men who get tenure,

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.300
it was also looking at
the family formation

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.080
of those professors.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.420
What did women have to
give up if they wanted

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.970
to go all the way?

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:53.193
What was the effect of
career on family formation?

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.963
Taking the question on its head.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.300
And here you see it even more drastically

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.680
than you see it in terms of the numbers.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.680
These are across all
fields, tenured faculty.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.040
And the discrepancy between
men and women is huge.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.990
Married women with children, 44%.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.020
Married with children 70% for men.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.493
Women are twice as likely to be single.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.330
The only group that is more similar

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.610
are married without children,
but the marriage penalty,

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.690
not the marriage penalty,
the tenure penalty

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.290
for fertility is very high.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:32.850
And here you see it in the sciences,

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.309
this is a better drawn diagram
and you get the scale of it.

00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:39.360
Because as you can see,
women are a little teeny ball

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.220
up there, a little teeny satellite around

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.517
a huge moon, as the men are
much larger in the science,

00:23:44.517 --> 00:23:47.070
but you see it this way,
you see both the numbers

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.588
and the fact that there's a discrepancy.

00:23:49.588 --> 00:23:52.010
A double gender equity issue,

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:55.300
a discrepancy in having children.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.883
So in here, in sciences, it's 73% to 53%.

00:23:59.883 --> 00:24:03.030
Interestingly enough, women
scientists are more likely

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.993
to be married than women in
humanities and social sciences.

00:24:06.993 --> 00:24:09.683
Anyone have a guess at why that might be?

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.233
The numbers are good, the
proportionate numbers.

00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:17.640
You're outnumbered by men all the time,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.910
so the odds are good.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.150
But as they say, the goods might be odd,

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.820
as they say in a lot of schools.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.130
But nonetheless, so they
have a little bit better

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.080
advantage in terms of
being married mothers,

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.970
actually, than fathers do.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.890
And so many of them
have already dropped out

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.970
that you're not seeing of
course, the whole thing.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.763
Single mothers, eight percent,

00:24:40.487 --> 00:24:43.050
and married without children 15%.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.410
Basically, getting
divorced is also an area

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.120
where it's a lot of discrepancy.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.200
As you can see, ladder
rank women are the most

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.700
likely to be divorced,
and the least likely

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.347
to be divorced are the second tier women.

00:24:56.347 --> 00:24:59.080
Because they have chosen that life,

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.770
because they can't afford to be divorced,

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.810
I don't know, but it clearly
is a different pattern

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:06.900
for second tier women.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.610
And this is really quite interesting,

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.795
it's the census data, and it compares

00:25:13.795 --> 00:25:18.620
women faculty with women
lawyers to women doctors.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.690
And women faculty are
really much less likely

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.799
to have children, as you can see.

00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:27.380
However, women in
medicine do almost as well

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.440
as all college educated women.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.220
And that seems to be contradictory,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.902
'cause we know how hard
it is, and what the time

00:25:34.902 --> 00:25:38.130
dimensions are for women in medicine.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.900
But as one of my friends
said, who was a resident

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.760
at the time, she said,
Mary Ann, we just have to

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.090
put in the hours, we
don't have to get tenure.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.780
So by the time they're in their residency

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.040
they don't have the
pressure of publication,

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.750
which is a very different
kind of thing for women.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.070
And they also have something
to look forward to.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.170
I think medicine is
really unrolling itself

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:01.510
as being a far more flexible
career track for women.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.550
They have a lot of HMOs,
or places like Kaiser,

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.810
where people can work
50%, 60% and still have

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.510
high status, high salary, et cetera.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.935
It's also true that women
are more likely to be

00:26:12.935 --> 00:26:17.935
family doctors or things
that are not high prestige

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.670
like surgeons, et cetera.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.510
So there's a little bit
of a second tier effect,

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.820
but nonetheless, and they
actually earn 50% less

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.710
than men because they work fewer hours,

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.610
but still they can maintain their career

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.900
and not be washed out.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.450
Only five percent of
women doctors actually

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.490
leave practicing medicine.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.840
Which is quite astounding.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.780
And they have more children.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.860
They have more children in part
because they're also richer.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.959
(laughs)

00:26:39.959 --> 00:26:40.792
This is the problem with,

00:26:40.792 --> 00:26:42.360
what's the name of the woman in,

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.260
who just, the woman in Silicon Valley

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.346
who took the job all
pregnant, what's her name?

00:26:48.346 --> 00:26:49.179
(crowd murmurs)

00:26:49.179 --> 00:26:50.351
That's right.

00:26:50.351 --> 00:26:52.100
I mean, she has a baby and
she says there's no problem

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.990
here but then she also has a
staff of God knows how many,

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.430
so this is, and Cheryl Sandberg as well.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.820
So it's very easy for women

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.500
who are in that position to say,

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.040
of course you can do, just lean in.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.064
Just lean in, just be tough about it.

00:27:05.064 --> 00:27:08.910
And I think most academic
women do not have that luxury.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.660
Unless you're married to
someone in Silicon Valley,

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.538
which most of us aren't.

00:27:12.538 --> 00:27:14.120
(laughter)

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:19.120
So again, the years from
20 to 30 in all professions

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.080
are really the make or break years.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.340
You have to make it in your profession,

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.060
whether you're a lawyer, a doctor,

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.790
but even more so as an academic.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:29.390
Because you don't usually
get a second chance.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.260
If you don't get tenure,
you're likely not to

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.760
stay in the academic market.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.820
And it's a very intense and
clear five, six, seven years.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.690
So although it's true in all professions,

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.280
it's even more intense for women
in the academic profession.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.840
I call it the make or break decade.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.720
And now you can see in
terms of childbirth here,

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.150
the little long line
there is the hire date.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:56.940
And at that age most people
are around 35 these days.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.350
35, 36.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:03.350
And then you see the men and
women, these are the years

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.190
which they have children,
this is the percentage

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.460
of children they have.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:10.170
Now men have children,
babies, early and often.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.220
And through their
assistant professor years,

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.040
to the right of the hire date,

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.560
they have a lot of children.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.010
Women, more slowly and
only one year do they make

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.200
a big burst, and that's four to six years.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.180
That's the tenure year.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.410
They've got their case in,

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.210
and now it's time to have the baby,

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.740
and then after that it
goes down fairly quickly.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.070
So the tenure year has
been the most popular year.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.840
The problem with that is the tenure year

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.320
comes later and later
than it did in the past.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.680
So it's often over 40 and it's
waiting quite a long time,

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.580
so you see that it goes down very quickly.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.500
Now surprisingly, how can this be?

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.520
20 or more years pass being hired,

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.139
you have a little boomlet
here on the right,

00:28:49.139 --> 00:28:51.710
what could that possibly be?

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:52.803
It's all men too.

00:28:54.553 --> 00:28:56.463
The second marriage, yes.

00:28:56.463 --> 00:28:58.100
A familiar story.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.140
Although I have to tell you something,

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.410
I'm not gonna talk about retirement,

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.180
but the one factor out
of retirement which is

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.260
kind of interesting, there
isn't much difference

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.440
between men and women in terms of the age

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.660
at which they retire, with the exception

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.150
of those who still have
children in the household.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.660
Don't retire, can't ever retire.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.720
And that is largely going to be men,

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.158
so that's the only
differential you really see

00:29:18.158 --> 00:29:20.513
at the end of the career.

00:29:23.804 --> 00:29:26.220
Here again, just summing it up.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.560
Only one in three women without children

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.870
who takes a fast track university
job ever become mothers.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.320
That's if you enter a tenure
track job without children,

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.740
you're not likely to have children.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.050
It's also because of the
age and other things.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.820
Women are far less likely to be married

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.904
with children than are men.

00:29:43.904 --> 00:29:46.210
53% to 73%.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.030
Women who achieve tenure are
more than twice as likely

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.580
than men who achieve tenure to be single

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.380
12 years out from PhD.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.770
Now I'm really sorry there are students

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.740
in this audience because
this is when the hankies

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.160
come out, it just sounds so hopeless.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.020
But you will see there is
good news following this.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.703
It's not as bad as it seems.

00:30:03.427 --> 00:30:04.830
And if married, women are
significantly more likely

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.308
than men to experience
divorce or separation.

00:30:08.308 --> 00:30:09.310
(sighs)

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.306
Now it's getting sadder.

00:30:10.306 --> 00:30:11.580
Women faculty were more
than twice as likely

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.260
as men faculty to indicate they wished

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.893
they could have had more children.

00:30:14.893 --> 00:30:17.070
That was actually from
our UC faculty survey.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.349
Now, can you read this?

00:30:19.349 --> 00:30:22.979
I can't believe I forgot to have children.

00:30:22.979 --> 00:30:23.910
(laughter)

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.240
Now most of you probably
don't remember the 80s,

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.600
but those of you who do, this was a shirt

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.858
that was very popular,
and it was a backlash

00:30:30.858 --> 00:30:33.120
against the feminist movement.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.450
You know, you've given up motherhood.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.400
And the thing that's sad
about it is there's still

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.730
some truth to it, more
than some truth to it.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:41.490
That it hasn't quite worked out the way

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.310
that we had hoped it would
in terms of having children.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.853
Having it all, as they
say, is very difficult.

00:30:49.268 --> 00:30:50.620
And we are making progress
though, as you will see.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.100
I'm just recapitulating
about the family status

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.550
of tenure faculty, all field.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:58.260
That is, it's a double
equity problem because

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.569
it's both the number of
women who are full professors

00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:06.100
and also the family
configuration of those who are.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.980
So it's double trouble, as I think of it.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.220
And here again are the women scientists,

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.528
with their little orbs going around.

00:31:13.528 --> 00:31:16.510
So until we actually reach
equity in both areas,

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.180
we can't say that we have
reached any kind of equity

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.370
in terms of the university world.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.285
Now what are your next steps?

00:31:23.285 --> 00:31:27.100
The good news is we actually
in the last 10 years,

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.100
have been very active ones for Berkeley,

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.110
for the UC system, and for
pretty much all universities.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.960
There's been a lot of positive action

00:31:35.828 --> 00:31:37.260
and things are happening every day,

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.650
and largely good things,
to make the workplace

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.990
more flexible, to change the culture,

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.140
and to try to keep our women
students in the pipeline

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.940
and not let babies derail them.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.330
This is compiling all
together all the many kinds

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.060
of workplace strategies,
and I'm happy to say

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.065
that Berkeley now has
pretty much all of them.

00:31:57.065 --> 00:32:00.370
We have in terms of leaves, parental leave

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.623
for mothers and fathers,
as you probably know,

00:32:02.623 --> 00:32:04.860
there's an active service modified duty

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:09.033
of one semester for mothers,
two semesters for mothers,

00:32:09.033 --> 00:32:11.210
and one for dads, if they are significant,

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:16.210
or generally fair about the
distribution of child care,

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.210
they have to be doing it at
least the 50% of the time.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.640
And as you may have
noticed in your department,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.690
the men are taking this.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:26.238
This is not something that
is unappreciated or unknown.

00:32:26.238 --> 00:32:29.180
We have centralized funding for maternity

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.250
or parental leaves, that
was important as well

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.760
because some departments
resent it very much

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.240
if they have to pay
money to hire lecturers,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.809
so that was made part
of the original deal.

00:32:39.809 --> 00:32:41.220
And these are all part of
a number of initiatives

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:46.220
that started in 2003,
2004, after we'd published

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.140
our initial studies it
became a very important

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.770
political campaign to
take this to Atkinson,

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.260
and then to take it to the chancellors,

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.270
and then to take it to
the deans, et cetera.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.040
To sell the fact that we wanted to have

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.440
centralized, flexible,
family friendly policies.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.710
And we put in place a great number of them

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:07.873
between 2004 and 2005.

00:33:07.873 --> 00:33:10.700
There was a real fight over some of these.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.120
The one that was most
contentious was the part time

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.790
tenure track, and now for
family reasons you can have

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:20.290
a part time, pre-tenure
or post-tenure track

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.390
of up to five years.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:25.910
According to regents rules
you have to have tenure

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.440
by the time you've been here 10 years,

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.710
so that's sort of the
upper limit for pre-tenure.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.740
But for post-tenure
it's usually five years,

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.150
sometimes it can be longer.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.500
People have family needs
altering their life.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.010
They have them with their
spouse, with themselves,

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.200
with their families, et cetera.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.500
So it's a lifelong issue.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.600
And that's the way we actually
managed to get that through

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.580
because the faculty
were convinced that they

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.750
also might have needs for
themselves or their spouse,

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.230
et cetera, not so much with the baby,

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.900
certainly the men were
not thinking so much that,

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.410
but they knew that that would happen.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.540
And we were very definite about getting

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.300
some sort of parental leave or recognition

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.450
for fathers, because when
we do the 2003 survey

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.660
of faculty, we found that there
had been some good policies

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:10.660
on the books way from
the 1980s, but 52% of the

00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:14.090
mothers who were eligible
didn't know they existed.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.580
And something like 70% of the
dads didn't know they existed.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.230
So mothers rarely took
them, if they didn't

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.160
they said it was partly because,

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.350
those who did know about them,

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.050
they were afraid that
they would be considered

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.540
not a strong player, that
it would marginalize them.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.431
And men didn't take them at all,

00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:32.620
it was just sort of an unknown thing.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.800
So in order to change it
to allow women to do it,

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.090
we want men to get in there.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:39.370
So much of this has been
focused on men as well.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:41.030
Stop the clock for promotions,

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:42.550
that's pretty much the default.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.310
Now you have to ask to keep it going.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:46.810
So most people do take stop the clock,

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.160
not all but most do.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.670
And the same thing for fathers.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.340
And the part time track as I said,

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.280
is for mothers and fathers.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.630
When we first looked into this,

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.570
'cause it wasn't clear
that there was a part time

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.560
way of doing this, we
found that on the 10 UC

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.950
campuses there were a very large number of

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:05.930
part time professors.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.300
But were they mothers?

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.440
No, they were largely
engineers or chemists

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.500
who were starting their own company,

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.280
and they wanted to keep
their foot in the door

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.320
and keep their half time job
but also start their company.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.990
Very very prominent pattern
in many of the departments.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.660
So we thought, if they can do it,

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.000
everybody else could do it.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.760
So we did the part time, pre-tenure track.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.510
And the battle came
down to, well how do you

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.683
actually judge them, and
finally the academic senate,

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.470
the system wide academic senate,

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.300
decided in its wisdom
that as long as they had

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.390
the same kind of publications
they would if they

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:44.080
came through at a normal time,
then they were up for tenure.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.600
Wasn't going to cut down the number.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.070
Numbers were the same,
they just couldn't do it

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.420
in twice the time if they wanted to.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.600
Childcare.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.900
We have worked very hard on
childcare, everyone does.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.370
We have the wonderful new
childcare center at Haste,

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:59.404
and we have gotten dependent
care travel grants,

00:35:59.404 --> 00:36:03.840
both for faculty and for
graduate students as well.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.060
And in terms of graduate
students, childcare is

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.310
a real problem, particularly infant care.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.120
We do give, at this university,

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.810
a five to seven thousand
dollar student bonus

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.150
for the student parents to be able to use

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.100
as they like, which helps alleviate it,

00:36:20.189 --> 00:36:21.530
and a number of graduate
students have their

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.380
babies in the infant care center.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.220
And emergency childcare.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.560
This is new, but it is,
most of these things

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.700
are not that expensive, actually.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.730
In fact when we were
looking at maternity leave

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:38.220
for graduate students, I
took it to Bob Birgeneau

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.360
and I said, you know, we can do this,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.430
it's not gonna be that much money.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.900
He said, well how much money is it?

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.200
And I'm no mathematician, I promise you.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.030
But on the back of the
envelope I'd figured out

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.140
the number of graduate
students who were likely

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.620
to have babies that year,
and we have a lot of graduate

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.390
students, but still the
number is relatively small,

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.170
and the little bit of money it would cost,

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.890
since it's only for six
weeks and they're paid

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.700
almost nothing anyway,
so it was going to be

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.170
fairly small, so altogether
I think it came out,

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.840
the highest possibly it
could be 50, and the lowest

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.185
was going to be 15 or something
and he said, let's do it.

00:37:10.185 --> 00:37:12.670
'Cause the money just is not that big,

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.350
there's always this notion
that somehow we can't

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.130
afford these things when
in fact most of them

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.712
are very affordable.

00:37:17.712 --> 00:37:19.080
All of these things are fairly affordable.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.980
Emergency childcare, the same way.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.170
It's quite affordable.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:26.823
And it gives peace of mind I
think to all mothers on campus.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.590
Having the rules alone
don't do you much good,

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.250
as we discovered in 2003
when people weren't using

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.930
the policies and there was no acceptance

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:40.500
of any kind of flexibility
for mothers or fathers.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.910
So policies alone do not work,

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:46.630
you have to make room for fathers.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.673
All policies are
entitlements, not requests.

00:37:50.584 --> 00:37:51.730
In other words, you don't
have to ask your department

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.210
head if you want to have maternity leave

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:58.410
or if you want to get part
time pre-tenure track.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:59.780
That is an entitlement to you.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.190
It's like you have Christmas Day off,

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.091
and you have Thanksgiving Day off.

00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:06.910
It's not something that you
have to fight about, or beg for.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.010
And centrally funded, if possible,

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.010
because then, again, the department chair

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.030
will be much happier.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.400
Deans and chairs toolkit.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.910
Ah ha, we have it!

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.070
Creating a Family Friendly Department,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.030
Deans and Chairs Toolkit.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.890
And this was developed here at Berkeley

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:24.167
for all 10 campuses and it has,

00:38:24.167 --> 00:38:26.880
we've used it at recruitment time.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.810
And we've used it at
retreat time for the deans

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.640
and chairs every year,
so they actually know

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.150
what the policies are, which
is enormously important.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.790
They know what the problems are,

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.150
the research in the back,
and then they know what

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.770
the penalties are, which I'm
kind of a believer in as well.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:44.180
They know that the provost
at the University of Oregon

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:49.180
had to pay $490,000 to
a woman when he said,

00:38:49.837 --> 00:38:52.113
and he was the provost, he said,

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.450
with two children I don't
think it's appropriate

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:57.450
that you have tenure, or
something that blatant.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.010
Rarely do you hear anything that blatant,

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.090
but when you do, there
is a penalty for it.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:06.050
But the idea was, it's not just
the nice, good thing to do,

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:07.980
it's the legal thing to do and there are

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.020
consequences for not doing it.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.530
So this has been a very successful book,

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.130
people have used it all over the country

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:14.630
and just filled in, it's online,

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.310
so they just fill in their own documents,

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:20.910
their own policies, and it's
been used all over the place.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:25.910
And well advertised,
publicly posted explanation

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.210
of benefits for all level of scholars.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.500
I think we do that pretty
well for all these levels

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.070
of scholars you find on the web.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.690
There are things that are not on the web,

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.740
which I'm gonna talk about,
because we don't have

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.810
them yet, one is the dual career policy.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.790
Many universities have pretty
strong dual career policies

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.310
that they actually advertise, or at least

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.240
say what the parameters
are, and the rules.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.910
Dual career, which I'm sure many of you

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:52.620
can appreciate, is what
keeps women, often,

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.470
from getting jobs,
because they're following,

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.780
they're the trailing spouse
and they don't get the job.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.280
But it's also the thing
that makes it hardest

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.600
for provosts and deans to hire anyone.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.640
'Cause so many people
come as dual careers.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.620
We don't do a great job
with that at Berkeley.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.800
Other universities do
because they are expanding

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.520
or they have more land, and things,

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.520
but that's a very important one as well.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.990
And a high level administrator and a legal

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.740
counsel responsible for
advertising and enforcing

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.460
the policies, well we
do have Angie, Stacy,

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.770
and others in the office here,

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.870
they've been very good
about promoting this policy

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.850
so I think we do very well with that.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.640
And Sheila O'Rourke is very tough on these

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.570
policies as well.

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.940
She was one of the
people who pushed through

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.967
the office of the president
our initial competitive edge.

00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:39.110
Now here is my favorite poster boy.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.780
Those in the history
departments will recognize him.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.800
This is Mark Brilliant, he's
a professor of history here.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.130
And I sat next to him at a dinner,

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.840
at Paula's house
actually, and he mentioned

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.070
that he had been so
happy with the policies

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.400
that he'd put an acknowledgement
in the front page

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.500
of his new book.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.570
First I knew about it,
I don't think he knew

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.910
who I was either, but.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:04.910
When Ezra Max Brilliant was
born in 2008, I was able

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.590
to enjoy him as much as I
did during his first year

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.740
without risking my career
owes in good measure

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.480
to the architects of the UC
Family Friendly Edge program.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.300
They designed enlightened
policies that children

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.680
of all working parents should receive

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.720
as Ezra did and for
which I am very grateful.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.330
I don't think these programs get that kind

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:22.980
of valuation very often.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.330
That was, it's a good example though that

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:28.610
here's a father who really
took advantage of it,

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.430
really appreciated it,
and will have changed

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:33.480
the culture because it is a dad doing it.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.770
Now I want to talk just
a few minutes about

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:39.980
the kind of best practices
and needs that scientists,

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.330
women scientists have.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.780
Which are somewhat different.

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:46.893
Although ultimately
there's a lot of overlap.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.800
Women scientists are, for the most part,

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.610
supported by the federal agencies.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:55.070
And the federal agencies
until very recently have done

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:59.400
almost nothing in terms of
family friendly initiatives.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:04.260
Only now is NSF and NIH
jumping up to the plate a bit,

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.610
but as you see many of
them do nothing at all

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:11.220
like discount caregiving
resumes and grant reviews,

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.240
or provide instructions to peer reviews

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.730
on family accommodations, or collect data

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:17.490
on gender and family status.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:21.160
I've been working with NSF,
in fact I was on a Skype

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.370
with the congressional
committee this morning,

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:26.170
pushing the agencies to
take some initiative in this

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.290
because when they see that
they're losing their students,

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.040
they really should do something about it.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.670
To work with the universities,

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.800
to do more in terms of
the thing that I think

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.090
would make most difference,
they do now offer

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.520
supplements for the lab, for the PI,

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.220
for anyone who gets
pregnant so they can pay

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.630
someone to replace them.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:45.170
The re-entry post-doc
is what we really need.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.870
Because how many of you
are scientists here?

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.840
Yes, do you have the
notion that if you drop out

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.000
for five years you're
just dead, brain dead,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.530
dead to science, can't
possibly be revived?

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.363
Yeah.

00:42:55.363 --> 00:42:57.090
I don't think that's so
true in law or history

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:01.110
but it certainly is the
atmosphere in science.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:02.860
But if you had a yearlong
or a half yearlong

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.477
post-doc could you rev up your mind again?

00:43:05.477 --> 00:43:08.340
I think so, we just
haven't done much of that.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:12.170
So as a routine part of not
losing our women scientists,

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.430
to let them stay out
for awhile, which many

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.200
need to do in raising children.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.780
But to let them come back as well.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.927
We're losing a huge amount of brain power

00:43:19.927 --> 00:43:22.980
and social capital for our universities.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.370
But there are many of these
very different issues.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:29.930
This was another survey
that we took of all the

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:33.937
13 major agencies who support science

00:43:33.937 --> 00:43:36.920
in universities and colleges.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.400
Includes NIH and NSF are the biggest,

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.307
DOA is pretty big, and down to USDA.

00:43:43.307 --> 00:43:46.280
And since then there
has been some movement

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.040
to try to get them together.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.060
NSF has tried to get
the different agencies

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.360
to talk to each other,
NASA's trying to do this.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.630
Oh, Bob is trying to do
it, he's been very tough

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:56.670
on getting universities to get together

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.750
and do Title IX and save
women from whatever.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:03.000
So it's a good time for
this, and I'm hoping,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.450
this is really where I
spend most of my time now

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.450
is with these agencies,
that they will be more

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:08.950
proactive, because that's where the money

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.780
is in science, and the
rules make it almost

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.830
impossible sometimes for women.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.210
I think the first RO
is now given at age 40,

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.910
or something like that,
so it's a very long,

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.570
hard, road, and if you
have a child it's very easy

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:21.733
to get knocked off of.

00:44:22.865 --> 00:44:24.847
And this is what the AAU universities,

00:44:24.847 --> 00:44:28.810
62 major research universities,
do now for graduate

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.810
students, post-docs, academic
researchers and faculty.

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:35.710
Only 13% of these 62
give at least six weeks

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.150
paid leave to women graduate students

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:41.303
for maternity, I'm proud to say
it's Berkeley and one other.

00:44:41.303 --> 00:44:42.136
(laughs)

00:44:42.136 --> 00:44:43.660
The other is Princeton, who also actually

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.860
give the parental leave to men.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.675
Post-doctoral fellows, 23%.

00:44:48.675 --> 00:44:50.680
That's not very good either.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.760
Post-doctoral fellows
have a problem because

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.570
sometimes they're considered employees,

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.200
as they are in the UC
system, which does give them

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.030
guaranteed leave, they
are staff, they have

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.380
the same kind of rights.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.400
Most of the time they're
considered trainees,

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.830
and have no policies at all.

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.240
So they are really floating,
they're in a gray area.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.550
Academic researchers,
18%, and faculty get 58%.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.180
Have a long way to go on all these fronts,

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.920
but particularly those two
on the left are the most

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.710
vulnerable populations, they're the ones

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:19.572
we're most likely to lose.

00:45:19.572 --> 00:45:21.593
And very little has been done for them.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.325
Ah, now we've come to my
favorite topic which is new.

00:45:26.325 --> 00:45:28.390
In the course of studying women in science

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:29.780
which we've been doing more for the last

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.640
three or four years, we found many things.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.530
But one of the things that
I kind of stumbled on,

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.010
is that Title IX actually has very strong

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:41.010
prohibitions against
pregnancy discrimination.

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.650
It is very strong.

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:44.610
How many of you knew that Title IX covers

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.480
pregnancy discrimination?

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.410
You do Bill because I told you.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:49.500
You did know.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.350
No, I don't think so.

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:53.770
Even Title IX coordinators
often don't know that.

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:55.380
It's really quite shocking.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.720
But it's very clearly
there in the regulations,

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.880
it's starting to come
through the case law,

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.280
and it really could
transform certainly the

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.790
childbirth issue, because
they have very strong

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.140
regulations here,
altogether, no discrimination

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.210
in false pregnancy,
termination, et cetera.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.370
In education program or activity,

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:19.370
in employment, this means TAs,
RAs, post-docs, et cetera.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.030
And medical coverage.

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:25.270
You have to treat childbirth
as a temporary disability

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.290
and pay for it with the
insurance as you would

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:29.450
a temporary disability.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:32.620
And if the student's health
coverage covers gynecological

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.260
care it also must cover
pregnancy and childbirth.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.690
So there are really
strict rules about what

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:41.090
insurance will cover, how
you must not be left behind,

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:44.070
and basically the rules
say that anyone who has

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.081
a child, which is usually a woman,

00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:51.081
must be given the leave
appropriate, determined by

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.370
her doctor, or whatever,
and must be returned

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:57.380
to the same place with no disadvantage.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.050
That includes an educational program.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.410
So if you have to drop out for six months

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:04.580
and you're post-doc or a graduate student,

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.700
you can't be kicked back
or let go, you have to be

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.170
reinstated and catch up or do whatever,

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.850
but they have to accommodate you.

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.560
If you have a job, they
have to take you back

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.670
after six months, or
six weeks, or whatever.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:18.350
And not lose status.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:19.940
These are very strong regulations.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.030
And I think they haven't been really found

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:25.330
because they're probably kind of difficult

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:27.680
for universities to want to have to face,

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.410
but now, interesting, I
just looked at the website

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:33.090
of our own wonderful
Berkeley before I came,

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.830
'cause I'd seen it before
but I'd kinda forgotten.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:40.310
I Googled in Title IX and discrimination

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.660
and pregnancy discrimination,
pages and pages

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.470
about Title IX on our
website, and athletics,

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:46.920
and what the rules were, et cetera.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.630
And then, we have a whole
Title IX sexual harassment

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:52.560
office, so sexual harassment
has been the new frontier.

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.830
But now the new new frontier is definitely

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.870
going to be pregnancy discrimination.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:59.160
And this is what Obama
said, we're going to have

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.560
Title IX compliance, must be compliance,

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.900
he went on and on about it.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.450
The NASA guidelines, which he recommended,

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.280
actually include a big section
on pregnancy discrimination.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.610
So it's just around the corner, as I say,

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.175
this is my mission.

00:48:12.175 --> 00:48:13.720
A number of other people,
once they learn about this

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.810
are interested in it too.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.000
Because it would provide
a lot of coverage,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.757
as I said, often graduate
students and post-docs

00:48:19.757 --> 00:48:22.000
are not considered
employees, they're considered

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.010
trainees, et cetera, in all the aspects

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:27.740
of their work life and
their education life,

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.940
and medical coverage.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.373
So, you're going to be
hearing more about this.

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:33.750
You have to have a Title IX coordinator,

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.230
we have one, but doesn't cover
pregnancy discrimination.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:38.378
Complaint procedure,
dissemination, and self-evaluation.

00:48:38.378 --> 00:48:40.790
These are the keys to get going.

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:43.660
So hopefully we'll be doing
that soon at Berkeley.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.860
Here's one biology graduate student.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.860
Once I got pregnant I felt that my advisor

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.320
no longer considered
me a serious scientist.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.450
He gave me easy, not
very important projects

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:57.236
and spent much less time with me.

00:48:57.236 --> 00:49:00.590
You hear this complaint
a lot, that particularly

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:03.170
in the sciences that
pregnant women feel they

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:04.840
are no longer taken seriously.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.040
Now that's very hard to do, to prove,

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.000
has to be intentional
discrimination, all kinds

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.040
of criteria, but just knowing that there

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.923
is a discrimination
policy and that we don't

00:49:13.923 --> 00:49:16.390
accept discrimination like we don't accept

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.490
sexual harassment, which
changed the workplace,

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:20.520
I think would be an important step forward

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.637
for women in science and everywhere.

00:49:23.637 --> 00:49:27.340
This, actually not this presentation,

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.070
there's a video
presentation, we have an NSF

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.610
dissemination grant, an
advanced dissemination grant,

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.050
taking all of our research
and best practices

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:39.290
over the many years, and
Joan Williams is my co-PI.

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:40.940
She runs a center called WorkLife Law,

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.160
she's done a huge amount in creating new

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.380
family responsibilities, discrimination,

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.320
and gender bias things.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.700
So together we have about eight of these,

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.220
which are just coming
online next week actually.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.053
Do babies matter?

00:49:54.053 --> 00:49:58.343
They're 15 minutes long,
they're a video with wonderful

00:49:58.343 --> 00:50:02.380
wonderful Power Points and pyrotechnics,

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.240
and also some extra teaching materials

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.090
to go along with them.

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:07.660
So anybody can use them anywhere.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.830
And they're free, they're gonna
be on our website next week.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.286
Do babies matter, four
patterns of gender bias,

00:50:12.286 --> 00:50:14.500
ensure they don't derail your career,

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.103
how does your workplace mess up,

00:50:17.122 --> 00:50:18.470
(laughs) measure up, mess up is good too.

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:20.420
Double jeopardy, women
of color in science,

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.682
this is really kind of unique and new.

00:50:22.682 --> 00:50:25.570
They interviewed 60
women of color in science

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.940
and she came up with some really
quite interesting patterns.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.900
Some things are illegal,
including pregnancy

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.170
discrimination and other issues.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.190
It's cheaper to keep her.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:38.690
This is an analysis of
what family policies cause,

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:40.280
what it causes to lose someone,

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.750
what is it causes to retain someone,

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.120
what it causes to recruit someone.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.900
And it was started at
the University of Iowa,

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.380
but right now our very own Clair Brown

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.510
in the Economics department
is carrying on the study.

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.690
Because we have some
good data about things

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.050
that have been in place that have worked

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:56.160
and how much they cost.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.710
And these are difficult
correlations to make,

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:01.770
and we haven't had these
policies for too long,

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:03.520
but we're already seeing good things.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:08.250
Like, since 2003, the
percent of babies born

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:11.720
to assistant professors
has doubled, women.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:16.720
No children in 2003, excuse
me, 73% had no children

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:22.190
in 2003, and now in 2009,
only 36% have children.

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:24.870
I think we kind of left that off there.

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:26.480
2009 was the.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.480
For men similarly, 61% in
2003 and now it's only 41%.

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:35.430
But the real doubling has been with women

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:37.121
assistant professors.

00:51:37.121 --> 00:51:37.954
Now I consider that a victory.

00:51:37.954 --> 00:51:39.410
And it's clearly just our new policies

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:41.100
that have made it all worth it.

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.792
I take full credit for it.

00:51:42.792 --> 00:51:43.850
(laughs)

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:47.320
But we have, this is what I
mean by changing the culture.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.850
Where people feel it's
okay to have children,

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:51.350
and at least in the law school,

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:53.445
because we have a lot of young faculty,

00:51:53.445 --> 00:51:56.936
you see the men and women often talking

00:51:56.936 --> 00:51:57.900
childcare talk in the hallway.

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.630
Which is, I think pretty
healthy for young parents

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:02.810
to be able to do that
freely and not feel that

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.700
they are restricted in any way.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.370
So I'm very proud of that.

00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:08.950
But I just wanted to say,

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:10.150
the last thing I wanted.

00:52:12.989 --> 00:52:14.710
The book is coming out.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:17.550
Not actually in May but in July.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:20.830
Do Babies Matter? Gender and
Family in the Ivory Tower.

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:24.010
And this is the life course
book that I mentioned.

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:26.790
A lot of the information you heard today

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:28.560
is in it of course, and then it takes it

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.040
from graduate school years
through finding your first job,

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.950
through falling in and
out of the tenure track

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:37.960
and the second tier,
through getting tenure,

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.530
through going through
associate, and then finally

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:41.490
the retirement years.

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:44.060
And then with a whole lot of suggestions

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.380
along the way and at the end
for how to change things.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.130
And as I said, my heart
has been in doing more for

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.430
graduate students and
post-docs, because again,

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:55.320
you see the most serious
drop out at that point.

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.495
But the book really talks
about all the different

00:52:57.495 --> 00:53:00.550
areas of your life.

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:02.190
This is your life, so if
you want to read about

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:04.460
your life, this is it, Do Babies Matter?

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.410
I have to say, it's pretty serious stuff.

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:09.190
I mean, hopefully we wrote
it in a nice easy way,

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:12.378
but it's got a whole lot of
graphs and appendix at the end.

00:53:12.378 --> 00:53:13.370
(laughs)

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:14.760
You don't have to read those.

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.250
Well thank you very much, and I'm ready

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:18.057
for any quick questions.

00:53:18.057 --> 00:53:20.307
(applause)

00:53:25.516 --> 00:53:26.750
- [Woman In Stripes]
Thanks, it seems like a lot

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:30.040
of your data set comes from California.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.290
Just fantastic, you have
a really large data set

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:34.540
and it looks like you found
lots of really cool trends,

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.950
and I'm wondering which of
those trends in your opinion

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:40.880
would have changed if you
had a nationwide data set?

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.520
- Well actually most of
this does come from the

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.610
nationwide data set,
the survey of doctorate

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:46.420
recipients, which is everyone.

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.777
And then the ones about
post-docs and graduate students

00:53:49.777 --> 00:53:54.330
are more from our own
surveys in California.

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:55.900
But of course we have a huge number,

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.450
so these are important.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.810
And I think we're pretty representative of

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:03.550
research universities,
because otherwise if you're

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:05.980
not a research university
you're not having post-docs

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.850
and graduate students either.

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:12.150
So I don't think that's so far off.

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:14.230
Many other universities
have used this data

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:17.490
and these slides and such
and they seem to feel

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:20.800
that it works pretty well
for their university as well,

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.560
so that's a good question.

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.985
I think it's okay though,
from what we know.

00:54:25.985 --> 00:54:27.640
And the survey of doctorate recipients,

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.190
which is most of this,
is clearly everyone,

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:31.213
not just UC.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:33.960
Yes sir.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.810
- [Man] Thank you for
that, and as a young father

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.390
and a gypsy scholar at the moment,

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.270
especially appreciate it.

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:44.990
Especially, I certainly
am very familiar with

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:48.660
when I have gone off to look
after my little daughter

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.510
and pick her up and
things, there's definitely

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.040
a sense that I get from other staff of,

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.560
they wouldn't say it,
but there tends to be an

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:59.230
implication of well, shouldn't
your wife be doing that?

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:01.090
They would never say that, of course,

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:03.673
but there's always that
sort of implication.

00:55:04.722 --> 00:55:07.710
But one thing I wondered
was whether your data

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.980
was affected or whether
the percentages changed

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.950
or how it was affected
in places where perhaps

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:17.950
teaching was valued more than research,

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:21.650
and how much is this
perhaps to a certain extent

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:26.180
an indictment on the domination in the way

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.320
of the research ideal
rather than teaching?

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.840
Or perhaps thinking
about the balance there.

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.620
- Right, I think that's
a very good question.

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.030
And in the original survey
the graduate students

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:39.040
rated four year liberal arts colleges

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.100
to be a whole lot more family friendly.

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:43.060
But the truth is, our
survey really does cover

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.730
them as well, the big general survey about

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:47.150
when people drop out, et cetera.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:49.140
And there isn't that much difference

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.716
between them at that stage.

00:55:51.716 --> 00:55:54.310
But because we are geared
in graduate students

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:56.020
and post-docs, these are
people who are probably

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.650
going to go on to research universities,

00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:59.480
more likely at any rate.

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.313
But it's a good question.

00:56:00.313 --> 00:56:03.650
And by the way, thank you,
for taking your daughter,

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:05.370
and just being a good role model.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:06.910
Because I think it takes a lot of courage

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:09.010
for men to do that, but
again, once you have

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:10.750
three men carrying around the snuggy,

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:12.740
then they all get used
to it and it becomes

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.290
just ordinary, so just becoming ordinary

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:17.885
is what we're aiming for.

00:56:17.885 --> 00:56:19.052
(audience member speaks unintelligibly)

00:56:19.052 --> 00:56:20.950
And employed, yes.

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:22.760
So you're the gypsy scholar now, yes?

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.210
Well, I hope, there actually is some hope

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:28.379
for gypsy scholars, because a lot of,

00:56:28.379 --> 00:56:30.690
good percentage, it's in the book,

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:33.290
do get hired out of that to a regular job.

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:34.310
Just not necessarily in the place

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:36.078
where you're the gypsy scholar.

00:56:36.078 --> 00:56:37.310
(laughs)

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:40.250
- [Woman] Hi, I was wondering
if you could measure

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:44.822
any effects based on the
career of the other partner?

00:56:44.822 --> 00:56:46.003
- Yes.

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:49.060
Actually, there's a whole
thing, I can't remember

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.770
all the numbers but they're in the book,

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:52.580
about dual career couples.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:57.440
And not surprisingly, women are more often

00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:02.440
the trailing spouse, and have
more trouble than men do.

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:06.010
However, having said that they're about,

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:10.393
38% of all couples it's the men
who are the trailing spouse.

00:57:11.606 --> 00:57:12.770
And they probably have
even more trouble because

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:14.720
it's hard for their ego not to do this.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.100
It was a good survey
that came out of Stanford

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.910
and the numbers are just
not clear in my mind

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:22.098
at the moment, but it is a real difficulty

00:57:22.098 --> 00:57:25.980
for women, whether or
not they have children,

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:27.403
it's a difficulty for women.

00:57:29.631 --> 00:57:32.131
(light music)
