even though you have less you know that

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
even though you have less you know that
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.680
even though you have less you know that
you they've been fewer terrorist attacks

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690
you they've been fewer terrorist attacks
 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.480
you they've been fewer terrorist attacks
and certainly in North America and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490
and certainly in North America and
 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.990
and certainly in North America and
Europe so you know how do we how do we

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000
Europe so you know how do we how do we
 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.170
Europe so you know how do we how do we
reconcile these trends this this

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180
reconcile these trends this this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330
inactivity in the face of of major
 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.860
inactivity in the face of of major
disasters and an inactivity that

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
disasters and an inactivity that
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.720
disasters and an inactivity that
guarantees more disasters so I mean this

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730
guarantees more disasters so I mean this
 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.370
guarantees more disasters so I mean this
is I think this this is the trend that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380
is I think this this is the trend that
 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.110
is I think this this is the trend that
we need to focus on the trend that we

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120
we need to focus on the trend that we
 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.020
we need to focus on the trend that we
need to focus on is why it is that when

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
need to focus on is why it is that when
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.260
need to focus on is why it is that when
it is so clear when there is a

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270
it is so clear when there is a
 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.470
it is so clear when there is a
scientific consensus that we are

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480
scientific consensus that we are

scientific consensus that we are
contributing to climate change that this

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
contributing to climate change that this
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.730
contributing to climate change that this
is creating more and more frequent and

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740
is creating more and more frequent and
 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.400
is creating more and more frequent and
intense natural disasters that it is

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410
intense natural disasters that it is
 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.800
intense natural disasters that it is
creating mass and will create even more

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810
creating mass and will create even more
 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.650
creating mass and will create even more

we are casual in the face of this

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030
we are casual in the face of this
 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.990
we are casual in the face of this
disaster then we also see a huge amount

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000
disaster then we also see a huge amount
 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.570
disaster then we also see a huge amount
of investment going on to the building

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580
of investment going on to the building
 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.900
of investment going on to the building
of fortresses the fortress economy so we

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910
of fortresses the fortress economy so we
 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.520
of fortresses the fortress economy so we
don't see the investment in green energy

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530
don't see the investment in green energy
 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.210

we don't see the investment in policy

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220
we don't see the investment in policy
 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.390
we don't see the investment in policy
that will really address the biggest

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400
that will really address the biggest
 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.830
that will really address the biggest
crisis of our time which is climate

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840
crisis of our time which is climate
 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.240
crisis of our time which is climate
change and what we see huge investment

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250
change and what we see huge investment
 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.640
change and what we see huge investment
is it in the building of a fortress

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650
is it in the building of a fortress
