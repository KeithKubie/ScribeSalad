00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:04.140
We're going to talk about how
we control access to resources.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.280
These are protected resources.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.250
Any program can make a request for
such a resource,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.000
and we need to decide if the request
should be allowed to go ahead,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.220
it should be granted,
or we have to deny it.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.800
So we've been talking
about the importance

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.690
of the trusted computing base.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.900
In fact, when someone is asking for

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.400
a resource, they are generating
a reference for that.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.080
They have to reference the resource they
are interested in or they want to use,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.410
so the trusted computing base has
to act as a reference monitor.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.230
No request for resource should go
without the trusted computing base being

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.230
involved in checking that request.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.310
Obviously, it'll have to see
the source of the request is,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.800
what the target, or
what resource is being requested.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.030
And then we're going to discuss how
do we decide if it should be granted.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.840
As a quick example, let's say John is
a student in a class and there's a file

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.810
that has the grades of all the students
who are enrolled in that class.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.980
John, obviously,
can make a request to read that file.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.180
Not only he wants to see his own grade,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.530
maybe he's curious about how other
people did on a certain test or an exam.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.090
So John could make
a request to read a file.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.550
In this case,
we not only have to monitor the request

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.000
that is going to come from John, but
our access control that we going to do

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.670
should decide that John should not be
able to see other people's grades.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.810
So, in this case,
the result may be denying the request.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.900
But the idea here is that references
have to be monitored, and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.230
then we have to make some sort of
a decision when a request comes,

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.944
whether it should go ahead or
it should be denied.

00:01:45.944 --> 00:01:48.060
So we talked about authentication.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.070
Authentication basically tells
us when an application or

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.740
a process makes a request, on whose
behalf that request is being made.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.990
So the example that we're just
talking about, it's a process

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.600
that John launched, then it is
going to have John's User ID or UID.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.229
And authentication is how we know that
this particular UID should be associated

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.150
with the process.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.390
Authentication tells
us about the source.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.860
Authorization, or access control,
which is the topic for this lesson,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.650
is going to answer the question
knowing the source of a request,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.710
authentication is going to tell us that.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.880
Once we know the source of a request,
in this case a User ID, and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.880
the target of the request, which is a
file, and what they want to do with this

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.570
resource is read this file,
should we let them do it or not?

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.820
So access control is similar
to what we have in real world.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.510
You want to access something, and
somebody has to decide, in this case,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.860
the TCB, or the reference monitor that
is implemented by the TCB, whether that

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.660
access is one that should be allowed to
proceed or go forward, or it should not.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.550
So let's quickly talk about how
do we actually decide this.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.220
Resources that we have in the system,
for

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.690
example, files are created by
certain users or subjects.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.820
You can, perhaps,
think if Alice is creating a file,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.010
maybe she has the ability to decide who
should be able to access it or not.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.340
The intention here being,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.810
it's her file, she chooses to
decide who to share it with.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.490
So in many systems, actually, the idea
of an owner of a resource is defined.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.230
This is the subject who
creates the resource, and

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.030
it is at the discretion of the owner
how that resource can be shared.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.690
There are other kind of systems
where this may not be the case and

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.330
we're going to talk about that.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.050
For example, if you work for a company,
the company may not allow you to

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.350
decide how you can share certain
sensitive data about that company.
