00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:17.216
&gt;&gt;Whitney: The School of the Future
is a six through twelve public school

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:19.226
in District Two in New York City.

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:21.836
It's located on the
corner of 22nd Street

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:23.636
and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:26.606
&gt;&gt;John: I have to usually answer why
it's called "School of the Future."

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:30.236
Half the people think we beam people
up to the Star Trek Enterprise.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:32.396
But actually what I say is
that School of the Future,

00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:36.696
although originally was named for
Macintosh computers, my partner

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:39.046
and I feel that School of
the Future now is a spearhead

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:42.056
of progressive education that
is rigorous and accountable.

00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:44.796
&gt;&gt;Stacy: And we're continuing
to be a progressive school,

00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:48.916
but also to figure out how
we are folding in assessment

00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:53.126
and folding in accountability.

00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:57.856
I think what makes authentic
assessment authentic is

00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:02.166
that it's actually the
kind of work that a person

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.816
in that discipline would do.

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:07.146
A science authentic assessment
would challenge the kids

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:11.516
to do the same kind of task that
a scientist would actually do.

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:12.396
&gt;&gt;Esther: We're trying to give work

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:15.026
that either mirrors what they
might be doing later in life,

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:17.986
or will prepare them
for those kind of tasks,

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:21.866
or is simply meaningful to them.

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.526
&gt;&gt;Andy: In terms of authentic
work within the school,

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:27.056
it needs to be something that
the student really cares about,

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:28.616
and that the teacher
really cares about.

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:32.546
So if we want a school where it's
just really making real change

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:34.886
and really addressing
students in their hearts,

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:39.736
then we can't have curriculum that
is just going through the motions.

00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:41.506
&gt;&gt;Whitney: And then
the other piece is

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:45.026
that making sure the task
is a synthesis type of task.

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.816
That will ensure the
critical thinking necessary

00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:59.556
to feel that rigor is happening.

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:02.736
&gt;&gt;Mike: I think of authentic
assessment as a window

00:02:03.126 --> 00:02:05.846
into the true understanding
of the student.

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:08.036
&gt;&gt;Whitney: It makes
teaching much more efficient.

00:02:08.446 --> 00:02:10.066
You think that it takes
all this time,

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:13.326
but in fact it's far more
targeted and efficient,

00:02:13.326 --> 00:02:15.266
and it really speeds things up.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:17.656
&gt;&gt;Mike: I think first about what
are the big ideas I want them

00:02:17.656 --> 00:02:18.336
to come away with.

00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:20.056
Some may argue that's curriculum,

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.296
but I think it's even more
fundamental than curriculum.

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:24.076
What are the big things
I want the students

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:25.686
to be able to walk away with?

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:29.726
&gt;&gt;Whitney: The key is asking
yourself, "How will I know?"

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:33.946
And ask that upfront as you're
doing backwards planning.

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.546
What does that learning look like?

00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:36.776
What does it sound like?

00:02:36.776 --> 00:02:38.536
What would I be hearing?

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:40.246
What would I be seeing on paper?

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:44.936
And then based on that, creating
whatever assessment tool works best

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:45.476
for you.

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:46.476
&gt;&gt;Mike: When you're starting

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:48.406
to plan your curriculum,
start with-- all right.

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:49.876
What are the three assessments then?

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:51.606
The three big ones that
I'm going to see whether

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:55.136
or not they got these skills,
and then you can start think

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:57.106
of smaller assessments on their way.

00:02:57.106 --> 00:02:58.026
They're little check-ins.

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:02.146
And then designing the activities
that go along with does this activity

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:05.936
that I normally do, does it
address what I really want them

00:03:06.456 --> 00:03:10.976
to understand?

00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:14.026
&gt;&gt;Andy: I've been teaching
now for about 13 years,

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:16.986
and a lot of educational
fads have come and gone.

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:20.476
But one that I believe
is hopefully here with us

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:23.926
to stay is precisely this question
of how do we know they got it?

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:26.976
Before, sometimes it felt like
if we taught a great lesson

00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:29.236
and the students were nodding
a lot, and maybe writing

00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:31.066
in their notebooks, we felt good.

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:34.996
But now we have to find out did they
actually understand the material we

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:35.726
were teaching them?

00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:38.886
Are they connecting this to
their own intellectual interests?

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:40.066
Is it authentic for them?

00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:41.856
Was there real learning
that happened there?

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:45.436
And I think we're getting better
at doing that as teachers.

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:47.916
I think we're getting
better at doing that.
