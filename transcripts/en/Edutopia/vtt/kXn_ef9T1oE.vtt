00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:05.726
&gt;&gt;Susan: Making books is a very
valuable tool to help children

00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:10.386
to really gain a good understanding of
what any subject matter might be about.

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:14.336
They're invested in it, and
they really become experts

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:16.366
on in the content of the books.

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:24.706
&gt;&gt;John: The accordion fold
does a zig-zagging paper fold.

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:27.096
&gt;&gt;John: The bookmaking came

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:30.146
about through an idea of
starting sketch books.

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:35.016
And then the excitement over bookmaking
culminated into teachers saying, "Well,

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:39.006
you know, it'd be nice if we could get
the curriculum into these books, too."

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:46.766
&gt;&gt;Susan: Each child will be producing an
actual book that they will get to keep

00:00:47.216 --> 00:00:49.996
and the teachers in the grade level
chose what the topic would be,

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:51.016
and what style of book.

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:55.016
&gt;&gt;John: After we make the books here
in the art room, they take them back

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:59.396
to the classroom to integrate the
content based on whatever their unit is

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:02.346
that they're currently studying.

00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:05.426
&gt;&gt;Susan: I used to teach idioms
by reading books to children

00:01:05.426 --> 00:01:09.506
that had idioms in them, and
worksheet-type activities.

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:12.006
The bookmaking took it
to a whole new level,

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:13.886
where the kids really took ownership.

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:20.816
&gt;&gt;Katie: We're doing
like idiom pop-up books.

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:24.306
It's kind of like an expression,
like you don't mean it literally.

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:28.296
&gt;&gt;Isaiah: "Don't put all
your eggs in one basket,"

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:31.516
means "Don't put all your
resources in one possibility."

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:36.056
&gt;&gt;Ava: "Feeling under the weather,"
means you're feeling sick or ill.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:40.666
&gt;&gt;Gwennie: It's just really fun to
draw the idioms, because you don't get

00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:42.766
to draw things like that every day.

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:47.166
&gt;&gt;Victor: You can use your
imagination really, like right now,

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:50.946
I'm doing "Elvis left
the building," I think.

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:54.286
It means like, "The show
is over," and stuff.

00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:55.786
&gt;&gt;Robby: "Barking up the wrong tree,"

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.496
you think you're doing
something right, but you're not.

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:01.886
&gt;&gt;Gwennie: "To steal someone's
thunder" means to take credit

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:04.396
for something someone else did.

00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:07.666
&gt;&gt;Susan: They're not only learning about
the idioms in their own pop-up books,

00:02:08.016 --> 00:02:10.816
they're learning about
the meanings of the idioms

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:13.376
that their classmates are
putting into their books as well.

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:17.396
So it's a great process of
discovery, and creating.

00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:21.576
&gt;&gt;John: They've spent this time putting
a lot of effort into the quality

00:02:21.576 --> 00:02:25.356
of their work, how they're using
materials, thinking with their hands.

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:27.746
So these books are really
special to them.

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:33.076
Now this knowledge that they're learning
has a really magical place to go.

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:38.046
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: For the fifth grader,
bookmaking project is focusing

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:42.216
on geography, and so we came up with
the idea to do an accordion book

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:45.406
with pockets so that we
could house doodle maps,

00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:48.176
which we thought were really
cool in terms of being able

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:50.596
to share information, but
also incorporate in drawing.

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:52.226
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Who remembers
one of the themes?

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:53.446
Mia?

00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:58.126
&gt;&gt;Mia: Place, it's like how
you recognize a certain area.

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:04.226
You might recognize Keene as cold,
but beautiful leaves in the autumn.

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:07.926
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: So our next step is
to think about these five themes

00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:11.566
and how they're represented in the
different regions of the United States.

00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:14.216
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: They definitely
do a lot of research,

00:03:14.296 --> 00:03:16.386
and then they're deciding
how they incorporate

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:17.956
that information in and represent it.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:22.346
&gt;&gt;Kyah: When we draw it out, we
have to look up what movement

00:03:22.346 --> 00:03:24.616
and region, and all that means.

00:03:24.926 --> 00:03:26.676
And then we have to draw
a picture relating

00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:29.966
to the three sentences we
wrote for the definition.

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:33.436
I didn't really know
the States very well,

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:38.596
and then once we started doing this, I
started knowing crops, and the climate,

00:03:38.596 --> 00:03:40.746
and what animals are there.

00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:42.326
I learned a lot more.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:44.366
&gt;&gt;Student: This is really
coming together!

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:46.346
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: Our goal is
for them to really get

00:03:46.346 --> 00:03:47.846
to know the country that they live in.

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:50.806
So instead of me saying, "Oh,
here's a map of the 50 States,

00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:53.096
and we'll study it, and
we'll take a test about it,"

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:57.286
this is a lot more hands-on, and the
learning just seems more real for them.

00:03:57.796 --> 00:04:02.936
&gt;&gt;Calvin: I'm a really good drawer, so
I wouldn't really like doing a report.

00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:07.906
&gt;&gt;Maverick: I used to feel like
geography was stupid, dumb, horrible.

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:08.936
&gt;&gt;Kyah: This is Gary.

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:11.636
&gt;&gt;Maverick: But now I actually
think it's really cool.

00:04:11.636 --> 00:04:16.376
&gt;&gt;John: If we can actually create
something that's relevant to us,

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:19.246
we take that knowledge deeper into us.

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:21.076
I think it just helps us to learn.

00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:24.416
&gt;&gt;Susan: Each classroom
has a variety of learners,

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:30.026
and students who need the hands-on
experience, and those who tend

00:04:30.026 --> 00:04:34.836
to be more creative, have really
benefited from the bookmaking process.

00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:37.026
&gt;&gt;John: Those materials
that you're manipulating

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:41.736
to create something can have worth
outside of just a pretty picture.

00:04:42.226 --> 00:04:43.376
It has staying power.
