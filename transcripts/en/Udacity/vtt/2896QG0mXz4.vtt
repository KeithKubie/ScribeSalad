00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.250
&gt;&gt; We can create a canvas and web page by using the canvas tag.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.537
Canvas is a 2D surface that takes instructions and immediately renders them.

00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:09.984
It's not that different from a real world canvas.

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:12.494
&gt;&gt; Hey, do you want to try painting for a little bit?

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:14.344
[SOUND] When we make a mistake or

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:18.199
want to change something, we can't just hit an undo button.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.510
We have to paint over the portion of the painting that needs to be redrawn.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.340
But unlike a real world canvas, one coat will do.
