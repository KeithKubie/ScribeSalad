(applause)

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.982
Good morning.

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:21.123
(cheering)

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:24.557
Welcome to Google I/O.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.087
It's a beautiful day;
I think warmer than last year.

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:29.809
I hope you're all enjoying it.
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.022
I think we have
over 7,000 people here today.

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:36.942
As well as many, many people--

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:40.062
we're live streaming this
to many locations around the world.

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:43.254
So, thank you all for joining us today.
We have a lot to cover.

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:45.937
But, before we get started,

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:48.949
I had one important business
which I wanted to get over with.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:51.781
Towards the end of last year,
it came to my attention

00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:55.957
that we had a major bug
in one of our core products.

00:00:56.217 --> 00:00:59.293
- It turns out...
- (laughter)

00:00:59.697 --> 00:01:03.437
...we got the cheese wrong
in our burger emoji.

00:01:03.437 --> 00:01:05.092
Anyway, we went hard to work.

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:08.204
I never knew so many people
cared about where the cheese is.

00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:09.762
- (laughter)
- We fixed it.

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:13.703
You know, the irony of the whole thing
is I'm a vegetarian in the first place.

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:16.116
(laughter and applause)

00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:23.696
So, we fixed it--
hopefully we got the cheese right,

00:01:23.696 --> 00:01:27.449
but as we were working on this,
this came to my attention.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.340
(laughter)

00:01:31.996 --> 00:01:34.963
I don't even want to tell you
the explanation the team gave me

00:01:34.963 --> 00:01:37.425
as to why the foam
is floating above the beer.

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:39.116
(laughter)

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.762
...but we restored
the natural laws of physics.

00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:44.940
(laughter)

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.260
(cheering)

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:53.288
So, all is well.
We can get back to business.

00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:56.631
We can talk about all the progress
since last year's I/O.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.241
I'm sure all of you would agree

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:02.252
it's been an extraordinary year
on many fronts.

00:02:02.252 --> 00:02:04.026
I'm sure you've all felt it.

00:02:04.206 --> 00:02:07.416
We're at an important inflection point
in computing.

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:10.785
And it's exciting
to be driving technology forward.

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:15.909
And it's made us even more reflective
about our responsibilities.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.758
Expectations for technology vary greatly,

00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:22.616
depending on where you are in the world,

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:25.170
or what opportunities are available to you.

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:28.794
For someone like me,
who grew up without a phone,

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:30.588
I can distinctly remember

00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:34.671
how gaining access to technology
can make a difference in your life.

00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:38.833
And we see this in the work we do
around the world.

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:44.137
You see it when someone gets access
to a smartphone for the first time.

00:02:45.412 --> 00:02:49.093
And you can feel it in the huge demand
for digital skills we see.

00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:53.575
That's why we've been so focused
on bringing digital skills

00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.565
to communities around the world.

00:02:56.565 --> 00:03:00.505
So far, we have trained 
over 25 million people

00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:03.542
and we expect that number
to rise over 60 million

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:05.327
in the next five years.

00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:10.141
It's clear technology can be 
a positive force.

00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:14.394
But it's equally clear
that we just can't be wide-eyed

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.963
about the innovations technology creates.

00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:22.608
There are very real
and important questions being raised

00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:25.056
about the impact of these advances

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:27.002
and the role they'll play in our lives.

00:03:27.952 --> 00:03:32.692
So, we know the path ahead
needs to be navigated carefully

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:33.835
and deliberately.

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:38.358
And we feel a deep sense of responsibility
to get this right.

00:03:39.484 --> 00:03:42.643
That's the spirit with which
we're approaching our core mission--

00:03:42.643 --> 00:03:45.209
to make information more useful,

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.247
accessible, and beneficial to society.

00:03:48.872 --> 00:03:51.617
I've always felt
that we were fortunate as a company

00:03:51.617 --> 00:03:53.353
to have a timeless mission

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:56.930
that feels as relevant today
as when we started.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.699
We're excited about how
we're going to approach our mission

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.102
with renewed vigor,

00:04:02.102 --> 00:04:04.797
thanks to the progress we see in AI.

00:04:04.797 --> 00:04:08.535
AI is enabling for us to do this in new ways,

00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:12.156
solving problems for our users
around the world.

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:16.574
Last year, at Google I/O,
we announced Google AI.

00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:19.780
It's a collection of our teams and efforts

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.635
to bring the benefits of AI to everyone.

00:04:23.736 --> 00:04:26.030
And we want this to work globally,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.847
so we are opening AI centers 
around the world.

00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:32.777
AI is going to impact many, many fields.

00:04:32.777 --> 00:04:35.246
I want to give you 
a couple of examples today.

00:04:35.954 --> 00:04:40.149
Healthcare is one of the most
important fields AI is going to transform.

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.527
Last year we announced our work
on diabetic retinopathy.

00:04:45.527 --> 00:04:47.583
This is a leading cause of blindness,

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:51.284
and we used deep learning
to help doctors diagnose it earlier.

00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:54.613
And we've been
running field trials since then

00:04:54.613 --> 00:04:57.520
at Aravind and Sankara hospitals in India,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.191
and the field trials are going really well.

00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:03.721
We are bringing expert diagnosis to places

00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:06.356
where trained doctors are scarce.

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:11.330
It turned out, using the same retinal scans,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.883
there were things which humans
quite didn't know to look for,

00:05:14.883 --> 00:05:17.883
but our AI systems offered more insights.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.966
Your same eye scan,

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:22.340
it turns out, holds information

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.263
with which we can predict the five-year risk

00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:29.188
of you having an adverse
cardiovascular event--

00:05:29.188 --> 00:05:30.915
heart attack or strokes.

00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:33.781
So, to me, the interesting thing is that,

00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:36.758
more than what doctors
could find in these eye scans,

00:05:36.758 --> 00:05:40.006
the machine learning systems
offered newer insights.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.815
This could be the basis
for a new, non-invasive way

00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:46.457
to detect cardiovascular risk.

00:05:46.457 --> 00:05:48.903
And we're working--
we just published the research--

00:05:48.903 --> 00:05:51.202
and we're going to be working
to bring this to field trials

00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:52.924
with our partners.

00:05:54.064 --> 00:05:56.192
Another area where AI can help

00:05:56.192 --> 00:05:59.510
is to actually help doctors
predict medical events.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.071
It turns out, doctors have a lot
of difficult decisions to make,

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:06.269
and for them, getting advanced notice--

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:12.457
say, 24-48 hours before
a patient is likely to get very sick--

00:06:12.457 --> 00:06:15.368
has a tremendous difference in the outcome.

00:06:16.048 --> 00:06:18.717
And so, we put
our machine learning systems to work.

00:06:18.717 --> 00:06:20.499
We've been working with our partners

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:23.837
using de-identified medical records.

00:06:23.837 --> 00:06:28.634
And it turns out if you go and analyze
over 100,000 data points per patient--

00:06:28.634 --> 00:06:31.425
more than any single doctor could analyze--

00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:34.743
we can actually quantitatively predict

00:06:34.743 --> 00:06:36.666
the chance of readmission,

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:40.928
24-48 hours earlier than traditional methods.

00:06:40.928 --> 00:06:43.880
It gives doctors more time to act.

00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:47.091
We are publishing our paper 
on this later today

00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:51.251
and we're looking forward to partnering
with hospitals and medical institutions.

00:06:53.232 --> 00:06:57.007
Another area where AI can help
is accessibility.

00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:02.058
You know, we can make day-to-day use cases
much easier for people.

00:07:02.058 --> 00:07:04.563
Let's take a common use case.

00:07:05.253 --> 00:07:08.428
You come back home at night
and you turn your TV on.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:11.642
It's not that uncommon
to see two or more people

00:07:11.642 --> 00:07:14.247
passionately talking over each other.

00:07:14.247 --> 00:07:16.374
Imagine if you're hearing impaired

00:07:16.374 --> 00:07:19.906
and you're relying on closed captioning
to understand what's going on.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:21.627
This is how it looks to you.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.185
(two men talking over each other)

00:07:29.254 --> 00:07:33.634
As you can see, it's gibberish--
you can't make sense of what's going on.

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:37.160
So, we have machine learning technology
called <i>looking to listen</i>.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.902
It not only looks for audio cues,

00:07:40.902 --> 00:07:43.236
but combines it with visual cues

00:07:43.236 --> 00:07:45.912
to clearly disambiguate the two voices.

00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:48.589
Let's see how that can work,
maybe, in YouTube.

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:50.769
(man on right)
He's not on a Danny Ainge level.

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:52.884
But, he's above a Colangelo level.

00:07:52.884 --> 00:07:54.861
In other words,
he understands enough to...

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:58.264
(man on left) You said
it was alright to lose on purpose.

00:07:58.264 --> 00:08:00.565
You said it's alright to lose on purpose,

00:08:00.565 --> 00:08:02.203
and advertise that to the fans.

00:08:02.203 --> 00:08:05.028
It's perfectly okay.
You said it's okay!

00:08:05.028 --> 00:08:06.882
We have nothing else to talk about!

00:08:07.202 --> 00:08:09.812
(Sundar) We have a lot to talk about.
(chuckles)

00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:11.106
(laughter)

00:08:11.106 --> 00:08:12.391
(cheering)

00:08:14.898 --> 00:08:17.206
But you can see
how we can put technology to work

00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:20.342
to make an important
day-to-day use case profoundly better.

00:08:21.282 --> 00:08:24.796
The great thing about technology
is it's constantly evolving.

00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:28.031
In fact, we can even apply machine learning

00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:31.587
to a 200-year old technology-- Morse code--

00:08:31.587 --> 00:08:34.473
and make an impact
on someone's quality of life.

00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:35.716
Let's take a look.

00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:40.135
♪ (music) ♪

<i>As a very young child,</i>

00:08:55.809 --> 00:08:58.335
<i>I used a communication word board.</i>

00:08:58.335 --> 00:09:01.367
<i>I used a head stick to point to the words.</i>

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:04.314
<i>It was very attractive, to say the least.</i>

00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:08.480

<i>and partner in crime.</i>

00:09:28.593 --> 00:09:31.337
It's always been very, very difficult

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.554
just to find Morse code devices,

00:09:33.554 --> 00:09:35.250
to try Morse code.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.064
(Tania) <i>This is why I had to create my own.</i>

00:09:38.064 --> 00:09:40.662
<i>With the help from Ken, I have a voice,</i>

00:09:40.662 --> 00:09:43.711
<i>and more independence in my daily life.</i>

00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:46.090
<i>But most people don't have Ken.</i>

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.540
<i>It is our hope that we can collaborate
with the Gboard team</i>

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.898
<i>to help people who want to tap into
the freedom of using Morse code.</i>

00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:58.323
(woman) Gboard is the Google keyboard.

00:09:58.323 --> 00:10:00.855
What we have discovered, working on Gboard,

00:10:00.855 --> 00:10:04.556
is that there are entire pockets
of populations in the world--

00:10:04.556 --> 00:10:07.509
and when I say "pockets"
it's like tens of millions of people--

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:11.688
who have never had access to a keyboard
that works in their own language.

00:10:11.688 --> 00:10:15.816
With Tania, we've built support
in Gboard for Morse code.

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:17.431
So, it's an input modality

00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:21.480
that allows you
to type in Morse code and get text out

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.620
with predictions, suggestions.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.782
I think it's a beautiful example
of where machine learning

00:10:26.782 --> 00:10:30.492
can really assist someone
in a way that a normal keyboard,

00:10:30.492 --> 00:10:32.245
without artificial intelligence,

00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:33.962
wouldn't be able to.

00:10:33.962 --> 00:10:37.362
(Tania) <i>I am very excited
to continue on this journey.</i>

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:39.897
<i>Many, many people will benefit from this</i>

00:10:39.897 --> 00:10:42.896
<i>and that thrills me to no end.</i>

00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:45.413
♪ (music) ♪

00:10:48.392 --> 00:10:51.393
(applause)

00:10:56.492 --> 00:10:58.298
It's a very inspiring story.

00:10:58.298 --> 00:11:02.191
We're very, very excited
to have Tania and Ken join us today.

00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:04.322
(cheering)

00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:31.203
Tania and Ken are actually developers.

00:11:31.203 --> 00:11:33.552
They really worked with our team

00:11:33.552 --> 00:11:36.556
to harness the power
of actually predictive suggestions

00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:40.610
in Gboard, in the context of Morse code.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.923
I'm really excited
that Gboard with Morse code

00:11:42.923 --> 00:11:45.097
is available in beta later today.

00:11:45.677 --> 00:11:48.588
It's great to reinvent products with AI.

00:11:48.588 --> 00:11:51.374
Gboard is actually a great example of it.

00:11:51.374 --> 00:11:52.846
Every single day,

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:57.538
we offer users-- and users choose--
over 8 billion auto correction

00:11:57.538 --> 00:11:59.058
each and every day.

00:12:00.008 --> 00:12:03.470
Another example of one of our core products

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.283
which we are redesigning with AI

00:12:05.283 --> 00:12:06.894
is Gmail.

00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:09.676
We just had a new, fresher look for Gmail--

00:12:09.676 --> 00:12:11.102
a recent redesign.

00:12:11.102 --> 00:12:13.307
I hope you're all enjoying using it.

00:12:13.307 --> 00:12:15.748
We're bringing another feature to Gmail.

00:12:16.518 --> 00:12:18.958
We call it Smart Compose.

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.349
So, as the name suggests,

00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:26.571
we use machine learning
to start suggesting phrases for you

00:12:26.571 --> 00:12:27.757
as you type.

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:32.257
All you need to do is to hit Tab
and keep auto-completing.

00:12:32.257 --> 00:12:34.561
(applause)

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:42.097
In this case, it understands
the subject is "Taco Tuesday."

00:12:42.097 --> 00:12:45.194
It suggests chips, salsa, guacamole.

00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:49.596
It takes care
of mundane things like addresses

00:12:49.596 --> 00:12:51.412
so you don't need to worry about it--

00:12:51.412 --> 00:12:53.974
you can actually focus
on what you want to type.

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:55.749
I've been loving using it.

00:12:55.749 --> 00:12:58.211
I've been sending
a lot more emails to the company...

00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:00.951
- ...not sure what the company thinks of it.
- (laughter)

00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:02.128
But it's been great.

00:13:02.128 --> 00:13:05.500
We are rolling out Smart Compose
to all our users this month

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.557
and hope you enjoy using it as well.

00:13:07.557 --> 00:13:09.666
(applause)

00:13:12.498 --> 00:13:16.706
Another product,
which we built from the ground up using AI

00:13:16.706 --> 00:13:17.922
is Google Photos.

00:13:18.618 --> 00:13:20.766
Works amazingly well,

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.430
and it scales.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.888
If you click on one of these photos,

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.920
what we call the "photo viewer experience"

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.401
where you're looking at one photo at a time,

00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:31.547
so that you understand the scale.

00:13:31.547 --> 00:13:37.229
Every single day there are
over 5 billion photos viewed by our users,

00:13:37.229 --> 00:13:38.765
each and every day.

00:13:38.765 --> 00:13:42.826
So, we want to use the AI
to help in those moments.

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:47.418
We are bringing a new feature
called Suggested Actions--

00:13:47.418 --> 00:13:49.804
essentially suggesting small actions

00:13:49.804 --> 00:13:52.136
right in context for you to act on.

00:13:52.136 --> 00:13:55.233
Say, for example, you went to a wedding

00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:57.484
and you're looking through those pictures.

00:13:57.484 --> 00:14:00.243
We understand your friend, Lisa,
is in the picture,

00:14:00.243 --> 00:14:03.114
and we offer to the share
the three photos with Lisa,

00:14:03.114 --> 00:14:06.757
and with one click
those photos can be sent to her.

00:14:06.757 --> 00:14:10.358
So, the anxiety where everyone is trying
to get the picture on their phone,

00:14:10.358 --> 00:14:12.347
I think we can make that better.

00:14:12.897 --> 00:14:15.512
Say, for example,
if the photo-- in the same wedding--

00:14:15.512 --> 00:14:17.470
if the photos are underexposed,

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.065
our AI systems offer a suggestion

00:14:20.065 --> 00:14:23.604
to fix the brightness right there, one tap,

00:14:23.604 --> 00:14:26.087
and we can fix the brightness for you.

00:14:26.677 --> 00:14:30.855
Or, if you took a picture of a document
which you want to save for later,

00:14:30.855 --> 00:14:35.061
we can recognize,
convert the document to PDF,

00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:37.950
- and make it...
- (cheering)

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.060
...make it much easier for you to use later.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.290
We want to make
all these simple cases delightful.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.841
By the way,
AI can also deliver unexpected moments.

00:14:53.401 --> 00:14:57.335
So, for example,
if you have this cute picture of your kid,

00:14:57.335 --> 00:14:59.079
we can make it better--

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:02.291
we can drop the background color,
pop the color,

00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:04.087
and make the kid even cuter.

00:15:04.087 --> 00:15:06.326
(cheering)

00:15:07.316 --> 00:15:10.088
Or, if you happen to have
a very special memory,

00:15:10.088 --> 00:15:14.039
something in black and white--
maybe of your mother and grandmother--

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.896
we can recreate that moment in color

00:15:16.896 --> 00:15:20.851
and make that moment
even more real and special.

00:15:20.851 --> 00:15:23.459
(cheering)

00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:29.094
All these features are going to be
rolling out to Google Photos users

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:31.134
in the next couple of months.

00:15:31.134 --> 00:15:33.643
The reason we are able to do this

00:15:33.643 --> 00:15:36.225
is because, for a while,
we have been investing

00:15:36.225 --> 00:15:39.098
in the scale
of our computational architecture.

00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:43.863
This is why last year we talked 
about our Tensor Processing Units.

00:15:43.863 --> 00:15:46.681
These are special purpose
machine learning chips.

00:15:47.497 --> 00:15:51.305
These are driving all the product
improvements you're seeing today.

00:15:51.305 --> 00:15:54.064
And we have made it available
to our Cloud customers.

00:15:54.684 --> 00:15:57.229
Since the last year, we've been hard at work,

00:15:57.229 --> 00:16:02.556
and today, I'm excited to announce
our next generation TPU 3.0.

00:16:02.936 --> 00:16:04.981
(cheering)

00:16:05.621 --> 00:16:09.778
These chips are so powerful
that for the first time

00:16:09.778 --> 00:16:13.010
we've had to introduce
liquid cooling in our data centers.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.784
(cheering)

00:16:14.784 --> 00:16:17.938
And we put these chips
in the form of giant pods.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:22.925
Each of these pods is now 8x
more powerful than last year--

00:16:22.925 --> 00:16:24.825
it's well over 100 pedaflops.

00:16:24.825 --> 00:16:28.100
And this is what allows us
to develop better models,

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.652
larger models, more accurate models,

00:16:31.652 --> 00:16:34.853
and helps us tackle even bigger problems.

00:16:35.773 --> 00:16:39.025
And one of the biggest problems
we're tackling with AI

00:16:39.025 --> 00:16:40.686
is the Google Assistant.

00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:43.600
Our vision for the perfect Assistant

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.295
is that it's naturally conversational,

00:16:46.295 --> 00:16:47.802
it's there when you need it

00:16:47.802 --> 00:16:50.541
so that you can get things done
in the real world.

00:16:51.089 --> 00:16:53.876
And we are working to make it even better.

00:16:53.876 --> 00:16:58.560
We want the Assistant to be something
that's natural and comfortable to talk to.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.904
And to do that,

00:16:59.904 --> 00:17:03.067
we need to start with the foundation
of the Google Assistant--

00:17:03.067 --> 00:17:04.394
the voice.

00:17:04.394 --> 00:17:07.525
Today, that's how most users
interact with the Assistant.

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:11.416
Our current voice is code-named "Holly."

00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:15.524
She was a real person.
She spent months in our studio.

00:17:15.524 --> 00:17:18.941
And then we stitched
those recordings together to create Voice.

00:17:19.591 --> 00:17:21.229
But 18 months ago,

00:17:21.229 --> 00:17:24.200
we announced a breakthrough
from our DeepMind team

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.036
called WaveNet.

00:17:26.036 --> 00:17:27.930
Unlike the current systems,

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.703
WaveNet actually models
the underlying raw audio

00:17:30.703 --> 00:17:32.859
to create a more natural voice.

00:17:33.399 --> 00:17:36.085
It's closer to how humans speak--

00:17:36.085 --> 00:17:38.163
the pitch, the pace,

00:17:38.163 --> 00:17:41.093
even all the pauses, that convey meaning.

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:43.411
We want to get all of that right.

00:17:43.411 --> 00:17:45.758
So, we've worked hard with WaveNet,

00:17:45.758 --> 00:17:48.088
and we are adding, as of today,

00:17:48.088 --> 00:17:51.159
six new voices to the Google Assistant.

00:17:51.159 --> 00:17:53.211
Let's have them say hello.

00:17:53.211 --> 00:17:55.505
(voice #1) <i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

00:17:55.505 --> 00:17:57.922
(voice #2) <i>I'm your Google Assistant.</i>

00:17:57.922 --> 00:18:00.264
(voice #3) <i>Welcome
to Shoreline Amphitheatre.</i>

00:18:00.264 --> 00:18:03.429
(voice #4)
<i>We hope you'll enjoy Google I/O.</i>

00:18:03.429 --> 00:18:05.361
(voice #5) <i>Back to you, Sundar.</i>

00:18:06.671 --> 00:18:08.912
(applause)

00:18:11.474 --> 00:18:12.986
Our goal is, one day,

00:18:12.986 --> 00:18:17.608
to get the right accents, languages,
and dialects right, globally.

00:18:17.608 --> 00:18:20.077
WaveNet can make this much easier.

00:18:20.447 --> 00:18:21.576
With this technology,

00:18:21.576 --> 00:18:25.465
we started wondering
who we could get into the studio

00:18:25.465 --> 00:18:27.312
with an amazing voice.

00:18:27.312 --> 00:18:28.484
Take a look.

00:18:29.232 --> 00:18:30.275
Couscous:

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:32.808
A type of North African
semolina and granules

00:18:32.808 --> 00:18:34.995
made from crushed durum wheat.

00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:37.856
(trilling)

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:43.120
I want a puppy with sweet eyes
and a fluffy tail who likes my haikus.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.294
Don't we all?

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:49.721
(singing) ♪ Happy birthday,
to the person whose birthday it is...

00:18:50.501 --> 00:18:53.725
Happy birthday...

00:18:54.345 --> 00:18:56.297
...to you ♪

00:18:57.548 --> 00:18:59.016
John Legend...

00:18:59.016 --> 00:19:01.777
He would probably tell you
he don't want to brag

00:19:01.777 --> 00:19:04.567
but he'll be the best assistant
you ever had.

00:19:04.567 --> 00:19:06.570
(man) <i>Can you tell me where you live?</i>

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.956
You can find me on all kinds of devices--

00:19:08.956 --> 00:19:12.888
phones, Google Homes, and, if I'm lucky...

00:19:13.448 --> 00:19:14.808
...in your heart.

00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:17.149
(laughter and applause)

00:19:21.183 --> 00:19:24.315
That's right-- John Legend's voice
is coming to the Assistant.

00:19:24.315 --> 00:19:26.744
Clearly, he didn't
spend all the time in the studio

00:19:26.744 --> 00:19:30.077
answering every possible question
that you could ask.

00:19:30.077 --> 00:19:33.385
But WaveNet allowed us
to shorten the studio time,

00:19:33.385 --> 00:19:37.032
and the model can actually
capture the richness of his voice.

00:19:37.032 --> 00:19:40.941
His voice will be coming later this year
in certain contexts

00:19:40.941 --> 00:19:43.392
so that you can get responses like this:

00:19:43.392 --> 00:19:45.155
(John Legend's voice)
<i>Good morning, Sundar.</i>

00:19:45.155 --> 00:19:48.516
<i>Right now, in Mountain View,
it's 65 with clear skies.</i>

00:19:48.516 --> 00:19:52.122
<i>Today, it's predicted
to be 75 degrees and sunny.</i>

00:19:52.122 --> 00:19:55.510
<i>At 10 a.m. you have an event
called Google I/O Keynote.</i>

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.686
- <i>Then, at 1 p.m. you have margaritas.</i>
- (laughter)

00:19:58.686 --> 00:20:00.226
<i>Have a wonderful day.</i>

00:20:00.226 --> 00:20:02.475
I'm looking forward to 1 p.m.

00:20:02.475 --> 00:20:04.062
(laughter)

00:20:04.062 --> 00:20:06.365
So, John's voice is coming later this year.

00:20:06.365 --> 00:20:10.533
I'm really excited we can
drive advances like this with AI.

00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:13.309
We are doing a lot more
with the Google Assistant.

00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:15.474
And, to talk to you a little more about it,

00:20:15.474 --> 00:20:17.501
let me invite Scott onto the stage.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.233
Hey Google. Call Maddie.

00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:21.817
(Assistant) <i>Okay, dialing now.</i>

00:20:21.817 --> 00:20:23.392
Hey Google. Book a table for four.

00:20:23.392 --> 00:20:24.738
(Assistant) <i>Sounds good.</i>

00:20:24.738 --> 00:20:26.084
Hey Google. Call my brother.

00:20:26.084 --> 00:20:27.525
Hey Google. Call my brother.

00:20:27.525 --> 00:20:28.693
Text Carol.

00:20:28.693 --> 00:20:30.239
Can you text Carol for me, too?

00:20:30.239 --> 00:20:32.007
Hey Google. Who just texted me?

00:20:32.007 --> 00:20:33.515
- Yo Google.

00:20:33.515 --> 00:20:35.083
Kevin, that was great.

00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:37.094
But we haven't made "Yo Google" work yet,

00:20:37.094 --> 00:20:38.512
so you have to say "Hey".

00:20:38.512 --> 00:20:39.591
(together) Hey Google.

00:20:39.591 --> 00:20:41.524
- (calling) Hey Google.
- Play some Sia.

00:20:41.524 --> 00:20:42.819
(lip trilling)

00:20:42.819 --> 00:20:44.823
Hey Google, play the next episode.

00:20:44.823 --> 00:20:46.124
Play <i>The Crown</i> on Netflix.

00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:48.472
All Channing Tatum movies.

00:20:48.472 --> 00:20:49.479
(Assistant) <i>Okay.</i>

00:20:49.479 --> 00:20:50.692
- Yo Google.
- (man) <i>Cut!</i>

00:20:50.692 --> 00:20:52.026
<i>That was great.</i>

00:20:52.026 --> 00:20:55.511
<i>Can we just get one
where you say, "Hey Google"?</i>

00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:56.892
Hey Google. Find my phone.

00:20:56.892 --> 00:20:58.489
(Assistant) <i>Finding now.</i>

00:20:58.979 --> 00:21:00.080
Whoa!

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.584
- Hey Google.
- (whispering) Hey Google.

00:21:01.584 --> 00:21:03.243
(man yelling) Hey Google!

00:21:03.243 --> 00:21:04.920
Yo Google. Lock the front door.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.097
(man) <i>Cut!</i>

00:21:06.097 --> 00:21:07.884
(man) <i>Okay.
Let's just go with Yo Google then.</i>

00:21:07.884 --> 00:21:10.867
<i>I'm sure the engineers
would love to update... everything.</i>

00:21:10.867 --> 00:21:12.077
Yo.

♪ (music) ♪

00:21:21.918 --> 00:21:24.132
(cheering)

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.436
Two years ago

00:21:30.436 --> 00:21:33.778
we announced the Google Assistant
right here at I/O.

00:21:33.778 --> 00:21:38.799
Today, the Assistant is available
on over 500 million devices,

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:41.599
including phones, speakers, headphones,

00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:44.039
TVs, watches, and more.

00:21:44.829 --> 00:21:48.974
It's available in cars
for more than 40 auto brands,

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:53.287
and it works with over 
5,000 connected home devices,

00:21:53.287 --> 00:21:56.136
from dishwashers to doorbells.

00:21:56.806 --> 00:22:00.295
People around the world
are using it every single day.

00:22:00.295 --> 00:22:04.079
For example, we launched the Assistant
in India last year,

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:07.073
and the response has been incredible.

00:22:07.073 --> 00:22:10.768
Daily usage there has tripled
since the beginning of the year.

00:22:11.688 --> 00:22:13.186
By the end of this year,

00:22:13.186 --> 00:22:15.398
the Assistant will support 30 languages

00:22:15.398 --> 00:22:18.115
and be available in 80 countries.

00:22:18.115 --> 00:22:19.893
So, we've made great progress.

00:22:19.893 --> 00:22:21.947
But we're just getting started.

00:22:21.947 --> 00:22:25.114
Today, we're going to share with you
some important ways

00:22:25.114 --> 00:22:28.600
that the Assistant is becoming 
more naturally conversational

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.271
and visually assistive,

00:22:30.271 --> 00:22:33.306
in order to help you do more
and get time back.

00:22:34.146 --> 00:22:35.615
Now, as you heard from Sundar,

00:22:35.615 --> 00:22:39.395
new voices that you can choose from
to make the Google Assistant your own

00:22:39.395 --> 00:22:41.031
are an important aspect

00:22:41.031 --> 00:22:44.944
of making the conversation
with your Assistant more natural.

00:22:44.944 --> 00:22:47.370
But to be a great conversation partner,

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:52.666
the Assistant needs to deeply understand
the social dynamics of conversation.

00:22:52.666 --> 00:22:54.965
For example, let's be honest,

00:22:54.965 --> 00:22:58.382
it gets a little annoying
to say, "Hey Google"

00:22:58.382 --> 00:23:01.031
every time
I want to get my Assistant's attention.

00:23:01.831 --> 00:23:04.112
This grandma,
who you might have seen on YouTube,

00:23:04.112 --> 00:23:05.860
was definitely feeling that way.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.544
- (woman) Googoo!
- (laughter)

00:23:08.544 --> 00:23:09.950
Hey Googoo!

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.046
Googoo!
Hello Googoo!

00:23:12.046 --> 00:23:14.606
- (slowly) H-e-y Googoo.
- (laughter)

00:23:15.146 --> 00:23:16.449
Okay Googoo.

00:23:16.449 --> 00:23:19.478
- He wanna know what is the weather...
- (man) Tomorrow.

00:23:19.478 --> 00:23:20.965
(woman) Tomorrow.

00:23:21.645 --> 00:23:23.663
(Assistant) <i>In Flagler Beach tomorrow,</i>

00:23:23.663 --> 00:23:27.036
<i>there'll be showers
with a high of 65 and a low of 56.</i>

00:23:27.036 --> 00:23:28.629
(laughter)

00:23:29.529 --> 00:23:32.086
- (Scott laughing)
- (laughter)

00:23:32.086 --> 00:23:34.637
Well, the Assistant
eventually worked for her.

00:23:34.637 --> 00:23:36.377
But, it shouldn't be so hard.

00:23:36.377 --> 00:23:39.620
Now you won't have to say,
"Hey Google" every time.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.889
Check this out.

00:23:40.889 --> 00:23:42.834
Hey Google.
Did the Warriors win?

00:23:44.064 --> 00:23:46.487
(Assistant) <i>Yes,
the Warriors won 118 to 92</i>

00:23:46.487 --> 00:23:48.464
<i>last Sunday against the Pelicans.</i>

00:23:48.464 --> 00:23:51.045
(Scott) Nice!
When's their next game?

00:23:52.115 --> 00:23:54.756
(Assistant) <i>The Warriors' next game
is today at 7:30 pm</i>

00:23:54.756 --> 00:23:56.833
<i>where they will be playing the Pelicans.</i>

00:23:56.833 --> 00:23:59.357
(Scott) Great.
It's going to be fun to watch tonight.

00:23:59.357 --> 00:24:02.456
Hey, remind me to find
my Kevin Durant jersey when I get home.

00:24:02.456 --> 00:24:05.329
(Assistant) <i>Sure.
I'll remind you when you get home.</i>

00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:09.792
Now, notice that I was able to have
a natural, back-and-forth conversation

00:24:09.792 --> 00:24:10.803
with my Assistant,

00:24:10.803 --> 00:24:15.174
without having to repeat "Hey Google"
for every followup request.

00:24:15.174 --> 00:24:16.363
Even more helpful--

00:24:16.363 --> 00:24:19.883
my Assistant could understand
when I was talking to it

00:24:19.883 --> 00:24:21.794
versus when I was talking to all of you.

00:24:22.564 --> 00:24:25.224
We call this Continued Conversation

00:24:25.224 --> 00:24:27.418
and it's been a top feature request.

00:24:27.418 --> 00:24:29.742
You'll be able to turn it on
in the coming weeks.

00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:33.142
(applause)

00:24:35.671 --> 00:24:38.254
So, let's say it's almost game time.

00:24:38.254 --> 00:24:39.253
Hey Google.

00:24:39.253 --> 00:24:41.900
Turn on the Warriors game
and start the popcorn maker.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.308
(Assistant) <i>Sure.
Here's the Golden State Warriors game</i>

00:24:44.308 --> 00:24:47.321
<i>on YouTube TV
and turning the popcorn maker on.</i>

00:24:47.321 --> 00:24:50.968
(Scott) Oh, and can you dim the lights
in the family room and in the kitchen?

00:24:51.478 --> 00:24:55.018
(Assistant) <i>Sure. Dimming the lights
in the family room and in the kitchen.</i>

00:24:55.458 --> 00:24:57.582
(Scott) Now, you'll notice
in both of these examples

00:24:57.582 --> 00:24:59.807
I asked for multiple things at once--

00:24:59.807 --> 00:25:02.073
something
that feels really natural for us,

00:25:02.073 --> 00:25:04.661
but it's very difficult
for computers to understand.

00:25:05.431 --> 00:25:07.925
It's something we call Multiple Actions

00:25:07.925 --> 00:25:10.706
and we're rolling out this capability
in the Assistant now.

00:25:11.006 --> 00:25:15.243
You might think, "Come on, it's easy!
Just look for the 'and'."

00:25:15.243 --> 00:25:16.553
(laughter)

00:25:16.553 --> 00:25:19.961
But it's not always so straightforward.

00:25:19.961 --> 00:25:23.771
In this example,
even though it has the word "and,"

00:25:23.771 --> 00:25:27.027
it's not two requests--
it's actually just one.

00:25:27.027 --> 00:25:29.230
But here,

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.331
even though it looks very similar,

00:25:31.331 --> 00:25:33.311
the Assistant has to break it apart

00:25:33.311 --> 00:25:35.225
to form the two requests.

00:25:35.225 --> 00:25:38.067
In linguistics it's called
"coordination reduction."

00:25:38.967 --> 00:25:41.666
Multiple actions
can get way more complicated

00:25:41.666 --> 00:25:43.055
so, just for fun--

00:25:43.055 --> 00:25:44.208
Hey Google.

00:25:44.208 --> 00:25:48.054
Who was the governor of California
when Kevin Durant was drafted,

00:25:48.054 --> 00:25:50.056
and what team drafted him?

00:25:51.256 --> 00:25:54.406
(Assistant) <i>Arnold Schwarzenegger
was the governor in 2007.</i>

00:25:54.406 --> 00:25:57.346
<i>Kevin Durant was drafted
by the Seattle Super Sonics.</i>

00:25:58.136 --> 00:26:00.478
(Scott) Alright.
Just in case you were wondering.

00:26:00.478 --> 00:26:02.069
(applause)

00:26:03.223 --> 00:26:04.236
Alright.

00:26:05.476 --> 00:26:06.501
Next.

00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:07.799
We've also been working on

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:10.459
improving the conversation
with the Google Assistant

00:26:10.459 --> 00:26:11.871
for families.

00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:14.653
Last fall, we launched our Family experience

00:26:14.653 --> 00:26:15.877
for the Google Assistant.

00:26:15.877 --> 00:26:19.991
It provides family-friendly games,
activities, and stories.

00:26:19.991 --> 00:26:22.091
We've continued to grow our library,

00:26:22.091 --> 00:26:26.944
and families have listened to
over 130,000 hours of children's stories

00:26:26.944 --> 00:26:29.021
in the last two months alone.

00:26:29.021 --> 00:26:32.049
Now, as we continue
to improve the experience for families,

00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:34.518
a concern that we've heard 
from many parents--

00:26:34.518 --> 00:26:36.980
including people on the team
who have children--

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.447
is are kids learning
to be bossy and demanding

00:26:40.447 --> 00:26:43.940
when they can just say, "Hey Google"
to ask for anything they need?

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.850
It's not a simple area,

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.693
but one step that we've been working on
is something we call "Pretty Please."

00:26:49.693 --> 00:26:52.823
Some of the parents on the team have been
testing it out with their families.

00:26:52.823 --> 00:26:54.049
Take a look.

00:26:54.449 --> 00:26:56.365
Hey Google.
Talk to [inaudible].

00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.629
Daddy, you forgot to say please.

00:26:59.249 --> 00:27:01.328
Okay Google.
Please tell me a story.

00:27:02.158 --> 00:27:04.062
(Assistant) <i>Thanks for saying please.</i>

00:27:04.062 --> 00:27:06.523
Play "Freeze Dance," please.

00:27:06.523 --> 00:27:08.329
(Assistant) <i>What a nice way to ask me.</i>

00:27:08.329 --> 00:27:10.126
Tell me a story, please.

00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:13.067
(Assistant) <i>Thanks for asking so nicely.</i>

00:27:13.067 --> 00:27:15.271
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a wacky walrus...</i>

00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:17.276
Please help me with my homework.

00:27:17.276 --> 00:27:18.352
Please...

00:27:18.352 --> 00:27:19.622
- Please...
- Please...

00:27:20.522 --> 00:27:22.044
(Assistant) <i>You're very polite.</i>

00:27:22.514 --> 00:27:23.595
I know.

00:27:23.595 --> 00:27:24.861
♪ (music) ♪

(laughter)

00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:27.969
(Scott) So, the Assistant understands

00:27:27.969 --> 00:27:31.798
and responds to positive conversation
with polite reinforcement.

00:27:31.798 --> 00:27:35.263
We've been consulting with families
and child development experts,

00:27:35.263 --> 00:27:39.081
and we plan to offer Pretty Please
as an option for families later this year.

00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:43.278
So, with new voices for your Assistant,

00:27:43.278 --> 00:27:45.269
Continued Conversation,

00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:47.725
Multiple Actions and Pretty Please,

00:27:47.725 --> 00:27:49.679
AI is helping us make big strides

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:52.667
so everyone can have
a more natural conversation

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:54.129
with their Assistant.

00:27:54.429 --> 00:27:56.200
And now I'd like to introduce Lilian,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.756
who's going to share
some exciting things we're doing,

00:27:58.756 --> 00:28:01.846

Well, thanks Scott,
and good morning everyone.

00:28:13.363 --> 00:28:16.200
Over the last couple of years
the Assistant has been focused

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.481
on the verbal conversation
that you can have with Google.

00:28:19.481 --> 00:28:22.238
Today, we're going to unveil
a new visual canvas

00:28:22.238 --> 00:28:24.537
for the Google Assistant across screens.

00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:28.658
This will bring the simplicity of Voice
together with a rich visual experience.

00:28:28.658 --> 00:28:30.381
I'm going to invite Meggy to come up

00:28:30.381 --> 00:28:33.182
because we're going to be switching
to a lot of live demos.

00:28:33.492 --> 00:28:36.167
We gave you an early look
at our new Smart Displays

00:28:36.167 --> 00:28:38.263
at CES in January.

00:28:38.263 --> 00:28:41.530
We're working with some of the best
consumer electronic brands,

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.700
and today I'm excited to announce
that the first Smart Displays

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.080
will go on sale in July.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.985
Today, I'll show you some of the ways
that this new device

00:28:50.985 --> 00:28:52.436
can make your day easier,

00:28:52.436 --> 00:28:54.497
by bringing the simplicity of Voice

00:28:54.497 --> 00:28:56.690
with the glanceability of a touch screen.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.800
Let's switch over to the live demos.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.963
Now, this is one
of the Lenovo Smart Displays.

00:29:02.963 --> 00:29:05.517
The ambient screen
integrates with Google Photos

00:29:05.517 --> 00:29:09.227
and greets me with pictures of my kids,
Bella and Hudson-- those are really my kids.

00:29:10.065 --> 00:29:12.443
Best way to start my day every morning.

00:29:12.443 --> 00:29:15.088
Because the device is controlled by voice,

00:29:15.088 --> 00:29:18.728
I can watch videos or live TV
with just a simple command.

00:29:18.728 --> 00:29:21.432
This makes it so easy
to enjoy my favorite shows

00:29:21.432 --> 00:29:23.562
while multitasking around the house.

00:29:23.932 --> 00:29:26.366
Hey Google.
Let's watch Jimmy Kimmel Live.

00:29:27.836 --> 00:29:30.277
(Assistant) <i>Okay,
playing Jimmy Kimmel Live</i>

00:29:30.277 --> 00:29:31.498
<i>on YouTube TV.</i>

00:29:36.802 --> 00:29:39.318
(applause coming via the device)

00:29:40.348 --> 00:29:43.228
(Jimmy) <i>I had a funny thing happen.
Here's something from my life--</i>

00:29:43.228 --> 00:29:45.647
<i>I was driving my daughter
to school this morning...</i>

00:29:46.397 --> 00:29:47.529
(Lilian) That's right.

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:51.878
On YouTube TV you will be able
to watch all of these amazing shows,

00:29:51.878 --> 00:29:53.940
from local news, live sports,
and much more,

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.252
and they will be available
on Smart Displays.

00:29:57.202 --> 00:30:00.712
Now, of course you can also enjoy
all the normal content from YouTube,

00:30:00.712 --> 00:30:03.780
including How-to videos, music,
and original shows,

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.598
like the brand new series <i>Cobra Kai</i>

00:30:05.598 --> 00:30:09.014
which we started binge watching this week
because it's so good. (laughs)

00:30:09.584 --> 00:30:13.180
Now, cooking is another instance
where the blend of voice and visuals

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.785
is incredibly useful.

00:30:14.785 --> 00:30:18.255
Nick and I are always looking
for simple family-friendly recipes.

00:30:18.835 --> 00:30:20.054
Hey Google.

00:30:20.054 --> 00:30:22.155
Show me recipes for pizza bombs.

00:30:23.205 --> 00:30:24.787
(Assistant) <i>Sure.
Here are some recipes.</i>

00:30:24.787 --> 00:30:27.493
(Lilian) So we can choose the first one
from Tasty-- that looks good.

00:30:27.493 --> 00:30:31.184
You see the recipe details come right up
and we can just tap to start cooking.

00:30:31.184 --> 00:30:33.354
(Assistant) <i>Sure, here's Tasty.</i>

00:30:34.514 --> 00:30:37.750
So, seeing a video demonstration
along with spoken instructions

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.747
is a total game changer for cooking,

00:30:39.747 --> 00:30:42.011
especially when you have your hands full.

00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:43.184
Thanks, Meggy.

00:30:43.744 --> 00:30:46.481
(applause)

00:30:49.428 --> 00:30:51.789
We showed you a couple of ways
that Smart Displays

00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:53.517
can make life at home easier,

00:30:53.517 --> 00:30:55.323
but there are so many more,

00:30:55.323 --> 00:30:58.874
from staying in touch with family
with Broadcast and Dual Video Calling,

00:30:58.874 --> 00:31:03.265
to keeping an eye on your home
with all of our other Smart Home partners,

00:31:03.265 --> 00:31:07.230
to seeing in advance what the morning
commute's like with Google Maps.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.573
We're thoughtfully integrating
the best of Google,

00:31:09.573 --> 00:31:12.459
and working with developer and partners
all around the world

00:31:12.459 --> 00:31:16.115
to bring Voice and Visuals together
in a completely new way for the home.

00:31:18.117 --> 00:31:21.733
Now, inspired by
the Smart Display experiences,

00:31:21.733 --> 00:31:24.861
we've also been working
to reimagine the Assistant experience

00:31:24.861 --> 00:31:27.822
on the screen
that's with us all the time--

00:31:27.822 --> 00:31:29.253
our mobile phones.

00:31:29.253 --> 00:31:32.622
I'm going to give you a sneak peak
into how the Assistant on the phone

00:31:32.622 --> 00:31:36.755
is becoming more immersive,
interactive, and proactive.

00:31:36.755 --> 00:31:38.990
So, we're going to switch
to another live demo.

00:31:41.814 --> 00:31:44.248
Hey Google, tell me about Camila Cabello.

00:31:45.838 --> 00:31:47.568
(Assistant) <i>According to Wikipedia,</i>

00:31:47.568 --> 00:31:51.527
<i>Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao
is an American singer and songwriter.</i>

00:31:51.864 --> 00:31:54.553
As you can see,
we're taking full advantage of the screen

00:31:54.553 --> 00:31:57.022
to give you a rich and immersive response.

00:31:57.022 --> 00:31:58.157
Here's another.

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:00.523
Turn down the heat.

00:32:02.923 --> 00:32:05.554
(Assistant) <i>Sure.
Cooling the living room down.</i>

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.966
For Smart Home requests
what you can see here

00:32:07.966 --> 00:32:10.774
is we're bringing the controls
right into your fingertips.

00:32:11.484 --> 00:32:13.127
And here's one of my favorites.

00:32:14.187 --> 00:32:16.428
Hey Google.
Order my usual from Starbucks.

00:32:19.198 --> 00:32:21.733
(Assistant) <i>Hello.
Welcome back to Starbucks.</i>

00:32:21.733 --> 00:32:24.952
<i>That's one tall, non-fat latte
with caramel drizzle.</i>

00:32:24.952 --> 00:32:26.218
<i>Anything else?</i>

00:32:26.748 --> 00:32:28.003
No, thanks.

00:32:28.003 --> 00:32:31.008
(Assistant) <i>And, are you
picking that up at the usual place?</i>

00:32:31.008 --> 00:32:32.385
So, I'm going to tap <i>Yes</i>.

00:32:33.355 --> 00:32:35.205
(Assistant) <i>Okay, your order's in.</i>

00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:36.647
<i>See you soon.</i>

00:32:37.717 --> 00:32:40.556
- (applause)
- Yeah!

00:32:43.011 --> 00:32:45.688
We're excited to share
that we've been working with Starbucks,

00:32:45.688 --> 00:32:48.896
Dunkin' Donuts, DoorDash, Domino's
and many other partners

00:32:48.896 --> 00:32:52.489
on a new food pick up and delivery
experience for the Google Assistant.

00:32:52.489 --> 00:32:54.746
We have already
started rolling some of these out,

00:32:54.746 --> 00:32:56.856
with many more partners coming soon.

00:32:58.626 --> 00:33:01.242
Now, rich and interactive
responses to my requests

00:33:01.242 --> 00:33:02.570
are really helpful,

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.706
but my ideal Assistant should also
be able to help in a proactive way.

00:33:06.706 --> 00:33:11.249
So, when I'm in the Assistant now,
and swipe up,

00:33:11.249 --> 00:33:14.471
I now get a visual snapshot of my day.

00:33:14.471 --> 00:33:17.730
I see helpful suggestions
based on the time, my location,

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.634
and even my recent interactions
with the Assistant.

00:33:21.544 --> 00:33:25.452
I also have my reminders, packages,

00:33:25.452 --> 00:33:29.591
and even notes and lists,
organized and accessible right here.

00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:32.129
I love the convenience
of having all these details

00:33:32.129 --> 00:33:35.189
helpfully curated and so easy to get to.

00:33:35.189 --> 00:33:37.679
This new visual experience for the phone

00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:39.847
is thoughtfully designed
with AI at the core.

00:33:39.847 --> 00:33:43.498
It will launch on Android this summer,
and iOS later this year.

00:33:44.708 --> 00:33:46.825
(applause)

00:33:51.427 --> 00:33:54.272
Now, sometimes the Assistant
can actually be more helpful

00:33:54.272 --> 00:33:56.523
by having a lower visual profile.

00:33:56.523 --> 00:33:59.795
So, when you're in the car,
you should stay focused on driving.

00:33:59.795 --> 00:34:01.732
So, let's say I'm heading home from work.

00:34:01.732 --> 00:34:03.965
I have Google Maps showing me
the fastest route

00:34:03.965 --> 00:34:05.513
during rush hour traffic.

00:34:05.943 --> 00:34:08.891
Hey Google. Send Nick my ETA 
and play some hip-hop.

00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:14.412
(Assistant) <i>Okay.
Letting Nick know you're 20 minutes away</i>

00:34:14.412 --> 00:34:17.009
<i>and check out
this hip-hop music station on YouTube.</i>

00:34:17.009 --> 00:34:19.949
♪ (hip-hop music) ♪

00:34:22.736 --> 00:34:25.508
So, it's so convenient
to share my ETA with my husband

00:34:25.508 --> 00:34:27.556
with just a simple voice command.

00:34:27.556 --> 00:34:31.439
I'm excited to share that the Assistant
will come to navigation in Google Maps

00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:32.675
this summer.

00:34:32.675 --> 00:34:35.042
(applause)

00:34:38.296 --> 00:34:41.664
So, across Smart Displays,
phones, and in Maps,

00:34:41.664 --> 00:34:44.375
this gives you a sense
of how we're making the Google Assistant

00:34:44.375 --> 00:34:45.960
more visually assistive,

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.818
sensing when to respond with voice,

00:34:47.818 --> 00:34:50.741
and when to show a more immersive
and interactive experience.

00:34:51.246 --> 00:34:53.978
And with that I'll turn it 
back to Sundar. Thank you.

00:34:53.978 --> 00:34:56.118
♪ (music) ♪

00:35:05.094 --> 00:35:06.316
Thanks, Lilian.

00:35:06.316 --> 00:35:08.672
It's great to see
the progress with our Assistant.

00:35:09.732 --> 00:35:11.981
As I said earlier,
our vision for our Assistant

00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:14.206
is to help you get things done.

00:35:14.906 --> 00:35:18.651
It turns out, a big part 
of getting things done

00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:20.506
is making a phone call.

00:35:20.506 --> 00:35:22.945
You may want to get an oil change schedule,

00:35:22.945 --> 00:35:25.197
maybe call a plumber
in the middle of the week,

00:35:25.197 --> 00:35:27.370
or even schedule a haircut appointment.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.769
We are working hard
to help users through those moments.

00:35:31.769 --> 00:35:35.814
We want to connect users
to businesses in a good way.

00:35:36.874 --> 00:35:39.100
Businesses actually rely a lot on this,

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.180
but even in the US,

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:45.886
60% of small businesses don't have
an online booking system set up.

00:35:46.756 --> 00:35:49.680
We think AI can help with this problem.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.446
So, let's go back to this example.

00:35:52.446 --> 00:35:56.811
Let's say you want to ask Google
to make you a haircut appointment

00:35:56.811 --> 00:35:59.292
on Tuesday between 10 and noon.

00:35:59.292 --> 00:36:02.546
What happens is the Google Assistant

00:36:02.546 --> 00:36:05.774
makes the call seamlessly
in the background for you.

00:36:06.234 --> 00:36:08.547
So, what you're going to hear

00:36:08.547 --> 00:36:12.164
is the Google Assistant
actually calling a real salon

00:36:12.164 --> 00:36:14.150
to schedule an appointment for you.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.632
- (cheering)
- Let's listen.

00:36:17.922 --> 00:36:20.040
(ringing tone)

00:36:20.477 --> 00:36:22.312
(woman) <i>Hello, how can I help you?</i>

00:36:22.312 --> 00:36:25.509
(Assitant) <i>Hi, I'm calling
to book a women's haircut for our client.</i>

00:36:25.509 --> 00:36:27.527
<i>I'm looking for something on May 3rd.</i>

00:36:28.397 --> 00:36:30.692
(woman) <i>Sure, give me one second.</i>

00:36:31.172 --> 00:36:34.323
- (Assistant) <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- (laughter)

00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:38.037
(woman) <i>Sure.
What time are you looking for, around?</i>

00:36:38.037 --> 00:36:39.321
(Assistant) <i>At 12 pm.</i>

00:36:39.721 --> 00:36:42.006
<i>We do not have a 12 pm available.</i>

00:36:42.006 --> 00:36:45.431
<i>The closest we have to that is a 1:15.</i>

00:36:46.101 --> 00:36:49.977
(Assistant) <i>Do you have anything
between 10 am and 12 pm?</i>

00:36:50.357 --> 00:36:52.852
(woman) <i>Depending on
what service she would like.</i>

00:36:52.852 --> 00:36:54.868
<i>What service is she looking for?</i>

00:36:55.398 --> 00:36:57.450
(Assistant)
<i>Just a women's haircut, for now.</i>

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.235
(woman) <i>Okay, we have a 10 o' clock.</i>

00:37:00.055 --> 00:37:03.224
- (Assistant) <i>10 am is fine.</i>
- (woman) <i>Okay, what's her first name?</i>

00:37:03.793 --> 00:37:05.513
(Assistant)
<i>The first name is Lisa.</i>

00:37:06.163 --> 00:37:10.353
(woman) <i>Okay, perfect, so I will see Lisa
at 10 o' clock on May 3rd.</i>

00:37:10.733 --> 00:37:14.183
- (Assistant) <i>Okay great, thanks.</i>
- (woman) <i>Great, have a great day, bye.</i>

00:37:14.663 --> 00:37:16.462
(applause)

00:37:20.899 --> 00:37:23.359
That was a real call you just heard.

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:26.163
The amazing thing is the Assistant
can actually understand

00:37:26.163 --> 00:37:28.080
the nuances of conversation.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.186
We've been working on this technology
for many years.

00:37:32.186 --> 00:37:33.987
It's called Google Duplex.

00:37:34.507 --> 00:37:37.174
It brings together
all our investments over the years

00:37:37.174 --> 00:37:39.462
on natural language understanding,

00:37:39.462 --> 00:37:40.796
deep learning,

00:37:40.796 --> 00:37:42.289
textured speech.

00:37:42.289 --> 00:37:44.568
By the way, when we are done
the Assistant can give you

00:37:44.568 --> 00:37:48.188
a confirmation notification saying
your appointment has been taken care of.

00:37:49.258 --> 00:37:50.965
Let me give you another example.

00:37:50.965 --> 00:37:54.473
Let's say you want to call a restaurant,
but maybe it's a small restaurant

00:37:54.473 --> 00:37:57.586
which is not easily available
to book online.

00:37:57.586 --> 00:38:00.681
The call actually
goes a bit differently than expected.

00:38:00.681 --> 00:38:02.186
So, take a listen.

00:38:04.164 --> 00:38:07.197
(ringing tone)

00:38:07.197 --> 00:38:08.669
(woman) <i>Hi, may I help you?</i>

00:38:08.669 --> 00:38:12.569
(Assistant) <i>Hi, I'd like to reserve
a table for Wednesday, the 7th.</i>

00:38:13.692 --> 00:38:15.275
(woman) <i>For seven people?</i>

00:38:16.155 --> 00:38:18.282
(Assistant) <i>Um, it's for four people.</i>

00:38:18.982 --> 00:38:22.947
(woman) <i>Four people?
When? Today? Tonight?</i>

00:38:22.947 --> 00:38:24.965
(Assistant) <i>Um, next Wednesday, at 6 pm.</i>

00:38:26.525 --> 00:38:30.534
(woman) <i>Actually, we reserve
for upwards of five people.</i>

00:38:30.534 --> 00:38:32.430
<i>For four people, you can come.</i>

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.495
(Assistant) <i>How long is the wait
usually to be seated?</i>

00:38:37.045 --> 00:38:40.458
(woman) <i>For when?
Tomorrow? Or weekend, or..?</i>

00:38:41.488 --> 00:38:44.141
(Assistant) <i>For next Wednesday,
uh, the 7th.</i>

00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:48.310
(woman) <i>Oh no, it's not too busy.
You can come for four people, okay?</i>

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.816
- (Assistant) <i>Oh, I gotcha. Thanks.</i>
- (woman) <i>Yep. Bye-bye.</i>

00:38:52.816 --> 00:38:54.121
(laughter)

00:38:54.121 --> 00:38:56.001
(cheering)

00:38:59.693 --> 00:39:01.178
Again, that was a real call.

00:39:01.178 --> 00:39:05.958
We have many of these examples,
where the calls quite don't go as expected

00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:09.129
but the Assistant
understands the context, the nuance,

00:39:09.129 --> 00:39:11.517
it knew to ask
for wait times in this case,

00:39:11.517 --> 00:39:14.227
and handled the interaction gracefully.

00:39:14.227 --> 00:39:16.988
We're still developing this technology,

00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:19.487
and we actually want to work hard
to get this right--

00:39:19.487 --> 00:39:22.618
get the user experience
and the expectation right

00:39:22.618 --> 00:39:24.975
for both businesses and users.

00:39:24.975 --> 00:39:28.521
But, done correctly,
it will save time for people,

00:39:28.521 --> 00:39:31.182
and generate
a lot of value for businesses.

00:39:31.182 --> 00:39:34.465
We really want it to work in cases, say,
if you're a busy parent in the morning

00:39:34.465 --> 00:39:37.574
and your kid is sick and you want to call
for a doctor's appointment.

00:39:37.574 --> 00:39:39.882
So, we're going to work hard
to get this right.

00:39:40.672 --> 00:39:44.462
There is a more straightforward case
where we can roll this out sooner,

00:39:44.462 --> 00:39:49.018
where, for example, every single day
we get a lot of queries into Google

00:39:49.018 --> 00:39:51.889
where people are wondering
on the opening and closing hours

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:53.227
of businesses.

00:39:53.227 --> 00:39:55.718
But it gets tricky during holidays

00:39:55.718 --> 00:39:57.862
and businesses get a lot of calls.

00:39:57.862 --> 00:40:01.524
So, we as Google,
can make just that one phone call

00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:05.662
and then update the information
for millions of users

00:40:05.662 --> 00:40:10.289
and it will save a small business
countless number of calls.

00:40:10.289 --> 00:40:12.539
So, we're going
to get moments like this right,

00:40:12.539 --> 00:40:15.126
and make the experience better for users.

00:40:15.126 --> 00:40:19.303
This is going to be rolling out
as an experiment in the coming weeks.

00:40:19.303 --> 00:40:20.787
And so, stay tuned.

00:40:20.787 --> 00:40:23.371
(applause)

00:40:26.027 --> 00:40:28.461
A common theme across all this is

00:40:28.461 --> 00:40:31.292
we are working hard
to give users back time.

00:40:31.852 --> 00:40:34.875
We've always been obsessed
about that at Google.

00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:39.079
Search is obsessed
about getting users the answers quickly

00:40:39.079 --> 00:40:41.640
and giving them what they want.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.934
Which brings me to another area--
Digital Wellbeing.

00:40:46.654 --> 00:40:48.786
Based on our research,

00:40:48.786 --> 00:40:52.454
we know that people
feel tethered to their devices.

00:40:52.454 --> 00:40:55.028
I'm sure it resonates with all of you.

00:40:55.028 --> 00:40:57.592
There is increasing social pressure

00:40:57.592 --> 00:40:59.895
to respond to anything you get right away.

00:41:00.425 --> 00:41:03.203
People are anxious to stay up to date

00:41:03.203 --> 00:41:05.940
with all the information out there.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.086
They have FOMO-- Fear of Missing Out.

00:41:10.376 --> 00:41:12.836
We think there's a chance
for us to do better.

00:41:12.836 --> 00:41:14.610
We've been talking to people,

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:17.835
and some people introduced to us
the concept of JOMO--

00:41:17.835 --> 00:41:20.263
the actual Joy of Missing Out. (chuckles)

00:41:20.263 --> 00:41:21.226
(laughter)

00:41:21.226 --> 00:41:24.928
So, we think we can really help users
with digital wellbeing.

00:41:25.672 --> 00:41:28.582
This is going to be a deep, ongoing effort

00:41:28.582 --> 00:41:30.925
across all our products and platforms,

00:41:30.925 --> 00:41:32.538
and we need all your help.

00:41:33.108 --> 00:41:36.092
We think we can help users
with their digital wellbeing

00:41:36.092 --> 00:41:37.530
in four ways.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:41.147
We want to help you
understand your habits,

00:41:41.147 --> 00:41:43.854
focus on what matters,

00:41:43.854 --> 00:41:46.068
switch off when you need to,

00:41:46.068 --> 00:41:49.053
and, above all,
find balance with your family.

00:41:49.053 --> 00:41:51.255
So, let me give a couple of examples.

00:41:51.655 --> 00:41:54.363
You're going to hear about this
from Android a bit later,

00:41:54.363 --> 00:41:55.795
in their upcoming release.

00:41:55.795 --> 00:41:59.177
But one of my favorite features
is Dashboard.

00:41:59.177 --> 00:42:03.089
In Android, we're actually
going to give you full visibility

00:42:03.089 --> 00:42:05.051
into how you're spending your time--

00:42:05.051 --> 00:42:07.797
the apps where you're spending your time,

00:42:07.797 --> 00:42:10.531
the number of times you unlock your phone
on a given day,

00:42:10.531 --> 00:42:13.199
the number of notifications you got,

00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:15.910
and we're going to really help you
deal with this better.

00:42:17.102 --> 00:42:18.749
Apps can also help.

00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:21.080
YouTube is going to take the lead,

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.043
and if you choose to do so,

00:42:23.043 --> 00:42:25.757
it'll actually remind you to take a break.

00:42:25.757 --> 00:42:28.815
So, for example, if you've been
watching YouTube for a while,

00:42:28.815 --> 00:42:32.413
maybe it'll show up and say,
"Hey, it's time to take a break."

00:42:33.783 --> 00:42:37.771
YouTube is also going to work to combine--
if users want to--

00:42:37.771 --> 00:42:40.533
combine all their notifications

00:42:40.533 --> 00:42:43.018
in the form of a daily digest,

00:42:43.018 --> 00:42:46.924
so that if you have four notifications,
it comes to you once during the day.

00:42:46.924 --> 00:42:50.558
YouTube is going to roll out
all these features this week.

00:42:51.998 --> 00:42:54.261
(applause)

00:42:57.881 --> 00:43:00.265
We've been doing a lot of work in this area.

00:43:00.265 --> 00:43:02.512
Family Link is a great example,

00:43:02.512 --> 00:43:04.871
where we provide parents tools

00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:08.060
to help manage kids' screen time.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.755
I think this is an important part of it.

00:43:09.755 --> 00:43:11.763
We want to do more here,

00:43:11.763 --> 00:43:15.007
we want to equip kids
to make smart decisions.

00:43:15.007 --> 00:43:18.003
So, we have a new approach--
a Google design approach.

00:43:18.003 --> 00:43:20.198
It's called Be Internet Awesome,

00:43:20.198 --> 00:43:23.793
to help kids become safe explorers
of the digital world.

00:43:24.663 --> 00:43:28.748
We want kids to be secure, kind,
mindful, when online.

00:43:28.748 --> 00:43:32.276
And we are pledging to train
an additional 5 million kids

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:33.677
this coming year.

00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:35.524
All these tools you're seeing

00:43:35.524 --> 00:43:38.551
are launching with our Digital Wellbeing site

00:43:38.551 --> 00:43:40.141
later today.

00:43:41.671 --> 00:43:45.462
Another area where we feel
tremendous responsibility

00:43:45.462 --> 00:43:46.426
is news.

00:43:47.646 --> 00:43:49.667
News is core to our mission.

00:43:50.787 --> 00:43:52.174
Also, at times like this,

00:43:52.174 --> 00:43:54.308
it's more important than ever

00:43:54.308 --> 00:43:57.082
to support quality journalism.

00:43:57.082 --> 00:43:59.570
It's foundational to how democracies work.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.102
I've always been fond of news.

00:44:02.582 --> 00:44:03.733
Growing up in India,

00:44:03.733 --> 00:44:07.439
I have distinct memory of--
I used to wait for the physical newspaper.

00:44:08.119 --> 00:44:10.558
My grandfather
used to stay right next to us.

00:44:10.998 --> 00:44:12.809
There was a clear hierarchy.

00:44:12.809 --> 00:44:15.424
He got his hands on the newspaper first,

00:44:15.424 --> 00:44:16.685
then my dad,

00:44:16.685 --> 00:44:19.060
and then my brother and I would go at it.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.702
I was mainly interested
in the sports section at that time,

00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:25.284
but over time
I developed a fondness for news,

00:44:25.284 --> 00:44:27.628
and it stayed with me even till today.

00:44:28.258 --> 00:44:31.246
It is a challenging time
for the news industry.

00:44:31.246 --> 00:44:34.474
Recently, we launched 
Google News Initiative,

00:44:34.474 --> 00:44:38.927
and we committed 300 million dollars
over the next three years.

00:44:38.927 --> 00:44:42.276
We want to work with organizations
and journalists

00:44:42.276 --> 00:44:45.684
to help develop
innovative products and programs

00:44:45.684 --> 00:44:47.474
that help the industry.

00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:52.201
We've also had a product here
for a long time-- Google News.

00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:55.196
It was actually built right after 9/11.

00:44:55.196 --> 00:44:58.028
It was a 20-person project
by one of our engineers

00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:01.322
who wanted to see news
from a variety of sources

00:45:01.322 --> 00:45:03.935
to better understand what happened.

00:45:04.715 --> 00:45:09.432
Since then, if anything, the volume
and diversity of content has only grown.

00:45:10.382 --> 00:45:14.441
I think there is more great journalism
being produced today

00:45:14.441 --> 00:45:15.785
than ever before.

00:45:16.475 --> 00:45:20.263
It's also true that people
turn to Google in times of need

00:45:20.263 --> 00:45:23.931
and we have a responsibility
to provide that information.

00:45:24.941 --> 00:45:28.163
This is why we have re-imagined 
our News Project.

00:45:28.163 --> 00:45:33.439
We are using AI to bring forward
the best of what journalism has to offer.

00:45:34.129 --> 00:45:37.987
We want to give users
quality sources that they trust,

00:45:37.987 --> 00:45:41.449
but we want to build a product
that works for publishers.

00:45:41.449 --> 00:45:46.222
Above all, we want to make sure
we're giving them deeper insight

00:45:46.222 --> 00:45:48.165
and a fuller perspective

00:45:48.165 --> 00:45:50.255
about any topic they're interested in.

00:45:50.705 --> 00:45:53.723
I'm really excited to announce
the new Google News,

00:45:53.723 --> 00:45:55.906
and here's Trystan to tell you more.

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:58.962
♪ (music) ♪
(applause)

00:46:05.237 --> 00:46:06.986
Thank you, Sundar.

00:46:06.986 --> 00:46:10.846
With the new Google News,
we set out to help you do three things:

00:46:11.376 --> 00:46:14.169
First, keep up with the news you care about.

00:46:14.169 --> 00:46:16.710
Second, understand the full story.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:21.069
And, finally, enjoy and support
the sources you love.

00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:23.345
After all, without news publishers

00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:25.789
and the quality journalism they produce,

00:46:25.789 --> 00:46:28.121
we'd have nothing to show you here today.

00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:31.464
Let's start with how 
we're making it easier for you

00:46:31.464 --> 00:46:33.636
to keep up with the news you care about.

00:46:34.146 --> 00:46:36.127
As soon as I open Google News,

00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:37.545
right at the top,

00:46:37.545 --> 00:46:42.336
I get a briefing with the top five stories
I need to know right now.

00:46:42.336 --> 00:46:44.085
As I move past my briefing,

00:46:44.085 --> 00:46:46.899
there are more stories selected just for me.

00:46:47.769 --> 00:46:51.329
Our AI constantly reads
the firehose of the web for you--

00:46:51.329 --> 00:46:55.259
the millions of articles, videos,
podcasts, and comments

00:46:55.259 --> 00:46:57.242
being published every minute--

00:46:57.242 --> 00:46:59.828
and assembles the key things
you need to know.

00:47:00.448 --> 00:47:04.719
Google News also pulls in local voices
and news about events in my area.

00:47:04.719 --> 00:47:08.235
It's this kind of information that
makes me feel connected to my community.

00:47:08.951 --> 00:47:11.167
This article from <i>The Chronicle</i>
makes me wonder

00:47:11.167 --> 00:47:13.890
how long it would take
to ride across this new Bay Bridge.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.513
What's cool is I didn't have to tell the app

00:47:17.513 --> 00:47:21.709
that I follow politics, love to bike,
or want information about the Bay area--

00:47:21.709 --> 00:47:24.095
it works right out of the box.

00:47:24.415 --> 00:47:28.427
And, because we've applied techniques like
reinforcement learning throughout the app,

00:47:28.427 --> 00:47:30.286
the more I use it, the better it gets.

00:47:30.996 --> 00:47:34.347
At any point, I can jump in and say
whether I want to see less or more

00:47:34.347 --> 00:47:36.534
of a given publisher or topic.

00:47:37.474 --> 00:47:40.083
And whenever I want to see
what the rest of the world is reading,

00:47:40.083 --> 00:47:41.517
I can switch over to Headlines

00:47:41.517 --> 00:47:44.336
to see the top stories
that are generating the most coverage

00:47:44.336 --> 00:47:46.311
right now, around the world.

00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:48.172
So, let's keep going.

00:47:49.402 --> 00:47:52.425
You can see
there are lots of big, gorgeous images

00:47:52.425 --> 00:47:55.181
that make this app super engaging,

00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:57.718
and a truly great video experience.

00:47:57.718 --> 00:47:58.933
Let's take a look.

00:48:00.313 --> 00:48:03.082
(music and cheering via the device)

00:48:06.342 --> 00:48:08.704
This brings you
all the latest videos from YouTube

00:48:08.704 --> 00:48:09.959
and around the web.

00:48:11.679 --> 00:48:15.529
All of our design choices
focus on keeping the app light, easy,

00:48:15.529 --> 00:48:17.097
fast, and fun.

00:48:17.857 --> 00:48:21.504
Our guiding principle is to
let the stories speak for themselves.

00:48:21.504 --> 00:48:23.108
So, it's pretty cool, right?

00:48:23.108 --> 00:48:25.553
(applause)

00:48:28.207 --> 00:48:32.544
What we're seeing here throughout the app
is the new Google Material Theme.

00:48:32.544 --> 00:48:34.868
The entire app is built
using Material design--

00:48:34.868 --> 00:48:37.298
our adaptable, unified design system

00:48:37.298 --> 00:48:40.129
that's been uniquely tailored by Google.

00:48:40.129 --> 00:48:42.382
Later today, you'll hear more about this

00:48:42.382 --> 00:48:45.436
and how you can use Material themes
in your products.

00:48:46.356 --> 00:48:50.239
We're also excited to introduce
a new visual format we call Newscasts.

00:48:50.979 --> 00:48:54.159
You're not going to see these
in any other news app.

00:48:54.969 --> 00:48:57.440
Newscasts are kind of like
a preview of the story,

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.675
and they make it easier for you
to get a feel for what's going on.

00:49:00.995 --> 00:49:03.203
Check out this one on the <i>Star Wars</i> movie.

00:49:04.083 --> 00:49:07.924
Here we're using the latest developments
in natural language understanding

00:49:07.924 --> 00:49:09.757
to bring together everything,

00:49:09.757 --> 00:49:11.683
from the <i>Solo</i> movie trailer,

00:49:11.683 --> 00:49:15.444
to news articles, to quotes--
from the cast and more--

00:49:15.444 --> 00:49:19.045
in a fresh presentation
that looks absolutely great on your phone.

00:49:19.925 --> 00:49:22.521
Newscasts give me an easy way
to get the basics

00:49:22.521 --> 00:49:25.105
and decide
where I want to dive in more deeply.

00:49:26.895 --> 00:49:30.551
And sometimes I even discover things
I never would have found out otherwise.

00:49:32.441 --> 00:49:34.400
For the stories I care about most,

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.435
or the ones that are really complex,

00:49:36.435 --> 00:49:39.521
I want to be able to jump in
and see many different perspectives.

00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:44.404
So, let's talk about our second goal
for Google News--

00:49:44.404 --> 00:49:46.594
understanding the full story.

00:49:47.684 --> 00:49:50.130
Today, it takes a lot of work
to broaden your point of view

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.316
and understand a news story in-depth.

00:49:52.716 --> 00:49:56.029
With Google news, we set out
to make that effortless.

00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:59.735
Full Coverage is an invitation to learn more.

00:50:01.525 --> 00:50:03.549
It gives a complete picture of a story

00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:06.645
in terms of how it's being reported
from a variety of sources,

00:50:06.645 --> 00:50:08.645
and in a variety of formats.

00:50:09.915 --> 00:50:11.173
We assemble Full Coverage

00:50:11.173 --> 00:50:14.678
using a technique
we call temporal co-locality.

00:50:15.318 --> 00:50:18.527
This technique enables us
to map relationships between entities

00:50:18.527 --> 00:50:21.878
and understand the people,
places, and things in a story

00:50:21.878 --> 00:50:23.395
right as it evolves.

00:50:24.015 --> 00:50:26.967
We applied this to the deluge
of information published to the web

00:50:26.967 --> 00:50:28.209
at any given moment

00:50:28.209 --> 00:50:30.154
and then organize it around story lines--

00:50:30.154 --> 00:50:31.854
all in real time.

00:50:32.434 --> 00:50:35.306
This is by far
the most powerful feature of the app,

00:50:35.306 --> 00:50:38.572
and provides a whole new way
to dig into the news.

00:50:39.402 --> 00:50:41.223
Take a look at how Full Coverage works

00:50:41.223 --> 00:50:43.483
for the recent power outage
in Puerto Rico.

00:50:44.523 --> 00:50:47.246
There are so many questions
I had about this story, like,

00:50:47.246 --> 00:50:48.548
"How did we get here?"

00:50:48.548 --> 00:50:50.036
"Could it have been prevented?"

00:50:50.036 --> 00:50:52.235
and, "Are things actually getting better?"

00:50:52.725 --> 00:50:55.184
We built Full Coverage
to help make sense of it all,

00:50:55.184 --> 00:50:56.583
all in one place.

00:50:58.303 --> 00:51:01.759
We start out with a set of top headlines
that tell me what happened,

00:51:01.759 --> 00:51:04.344
and then start to organize
around the key story aspects

00:51:04.344 --> 00:51:06.626
using our real time event understanding.

00:51:07.326 --> 00:51:11.023
For news events that have played out,
like this one, over weeks and months,

00:51:11.023 --> 00:51:14.196
you can understand
the origin of developments,

00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:16.975
by looking at our timeline
of the key moments.

00:51:17.735 --> 00:51:19.410
And while the recovery has begun,

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.974
we can clearly see
there's still a long way to go.

00:51:22.984 --> 00:51:26.051
There are also certain questions
we are all asking about a story,

00:51:26.051 --> 00:51:29.095
and we pull those out
so you don't have to hunt for the answers.

00:51:30.665 --> 00:51:33.513
We know context and perspective
come from many places,

00:51:33.513 --> 00:51:38.005
so we show you Tweets
from relevant voices, and opinions,

00:51:38.005 --> 00:51:40.748
analysis, and fact checks,

00:51:40.748 --> 00:51:44.126
to help you understand the story
that one level deeper.

00:51:45.536 --> 00:51:49.366
In each case, our AI is highlighting why
this is an important piece of information

00:51:49.366 --> 00:51:51.981
and what unique value it brings.

00:51:53.741 --> 00:51:55.191
Now, when I use Full Coverage,

00:51:55.191 --> 00:51:57.543
I find that I can build
a huge amount of knowledge

00:51:57.543 --> 00:51:59.151
on the topics I care about.

00:51:59.621 --> 00:52:01.991
It's a true 360 degree view

00:52:01.991 --> 00:52:05.650
that goes well beyond what I get
from just scanning a few headlines.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.061
On top of this,

00:52:09.061 --> 00:52:12.417
our research shows that having
a productive conversation or debate

00:52:12.417 --> 00:52:16.381
requires everyone
to have access to the same information.

00:52:17.111 --> 00:52:19.883
Which is why
everyone sees the same content

00:52:19.883 --> 00:52:21.724
in Full Coverage for a topic.

00:52:21.724 --> 00:52:26.129
It's an unfiltered view of events
from a range of trusted news sources.

00:52:28.019 --> 00:52:30.116
(applause)

00:52:30.567 --> 00:52:31.709
Thank you.

00:52:33.659 --> 00:52:36.095
So, I've got to say--
I love these new features.

00:52:36.095 --> 00:52:38.818
And these are just a few of the things
we think make the new Google News

00:52:38.818 --> 00:52:39.958
so exciting.

00:52:40.408 --> 00:52:42.212
But, as we mentioned before,

00:52:42.212 --> 00:52:44.857
none of this would exist
without the great journalism

00:52:44.857 --> 00:52:47.043
news rooms produce every day.

00:52:48.393 --> 00:52:50.043
Which brings us to our final goal--

00:52:50.043 --> 00:52:53.049
helping you enjoy and support
the news sources you love.

00:52:54.379 --> 00:52:57.274
We've put publishers front and center
throughout the app,

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:58.873
and here in the Newsstand section,

00:52:58.873 --> 00:53:02.552
it's easy to find and follow
the sources I already love,

00:53:02.552 --> 00:53:04.512
and browse and discover new ones.

00:53:04.512 --> 00:53:07.291
including over 1,000 magazine titles,

00:53:07.291 --> 00:53:10.291
like <i>Wired</i>,
<i>National Geographic</i>, and <i>People</i>,

00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:12.409
which all look great on my phone.

00:53:13.209 --> 00:53:18.276
I can follow publications like <i>USA Today</i>
by directly tapping the star icon.

00:53:18.916 --> 00:53:21.514
And, if there's a publication
I want to subscribe to--

00:53:21.514 --> 00:53:22.871
say, <i>The Washington Post</i>,

00:53:22.871 --> 00:53:25.046
we make it dead simple.

00:53:25.046 --> 00:53:29.191
No more forms, credit card numbers,
or new passwords,

00:53:29.191 --> 00:53:31.617
because you're signed in
with your Google account,

00:53:31.617 --> 00:53:32.641
you're set.

00:53:34.481 --> 00:53:36.218
When you subscribe to a publisher,

00:53:36.218 --> 00:53:40.112
we think you should have easy access
to your content everywhere.

00:53:40.112 --> 00:53:43.501
And this is why we developed
Subscribe with Google.

00:53:44.301 --> 00:53:47.043
Subscribe with Google
enables you to use your Google account

00:53:47.043 --> 00:53:49.867
to access your paid content everywhere,

00:53:49.867 --> 00:53:53.913
across all platforms and devices
on Google Search, Google News,

00:53:53.913 --> 00:53:55.826
and publishers' own sites.

00:53:57.036 --> 00:54:00.255
We built this in collaboration
with over 60 publishers around the world

00:54:00.255 --> 00:54:02.754
and it will be rolling out
in the coming weeks.

00:54:05.274 --> 00:54:07.577
(applause)

00:54:09.936 --> 00:54:10.976
Thank you.

00:54:10.976 --> 00:54:12.972
And this is one
of the many steps we're taking

00:54:12.972 --> 00:54:16.393
to make it easier to access
dependable, high quality information,

00:54:16.393 --> 00:54:18.814
when and where it matters most.

00:54:20.484 --> 00:54:22.178
So, that's the new Google News.

00:54:22.178 --> 00:54:24.551
It helps you keep up
with the news you care about,

00:54:24.551 --> 00:54:26.866
with your Briefing and Newscasts,

00:54:26.866 --> 00:54:29.544
understand the full story,
using Full Coverage,

00:54:29.544 --> 00:54:32.208
and enjoy and support
the news sources you love,

00:54:32.208 --> 00:54:34.951
by reading, following, and subscribing.

00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:38.673
And now, for the best news of all,

00:54:38.673 --> 00:54:42.069
we're rolling out
on Android, iOS and the web,

00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:45.211
in 127 countries, starting today.

00:54:45.211 --> 00:54:48.281
(cheering)

00:54:48.281 --> 00:54:50.701
I think so, too.
Pretty cool.

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:54.837
It will be available
to everyone next week.

00:54:55.887 --> 00:54:59.364
At Google, we know that
getting accurate and timely information

00:54:59.364 --> 00:55:00.833
into people's hands,

00:55:00.833 --> 00:55:03.815
and building and supporting
high quality journalism

00:55:03.815 --> 00:55:07.269
is more important
than it ever has been right now.

00:55:07.269 --> 00:55:10.168
And we are totally committed
to doing our part.

00:55:10.728 --> 00:55:13.458
We can't wait
to continue on this journey with you.

00:55:13.458 --> 00:55:15.279
And now, I'm excited to introduce Dave

00:55:15.279 --> 00:55:17.712
to tell you more
about what's going on in Android.

00:55:17.712 --> 00:55:19.451

00:57:01.461 --> 00:57:05.867
Hi everyone.
It's great to be here at Google I/O 2018.

00:57:05.867 --> 00:57:07.544
(cheering)

00:57:09.644 --> 00:57:13.244
Ten years ago,
when we launched the first Android phone,

00:57:13.244 --> 00:57:14.769
the T-Mobile G1,

00:57:14.769 --> 00:57:17.218
it was with a simple but bold idea--

00:57:17.218 --> 00:57:21.624
to build a mobile platform
that was free and open to everyone.

00:57:21.624 --> 00:57:24.418
And, today, that idea is thriving.

00:57:24.418 --> 00:57:28.110
Our partners have launched
tens of thousands of smartphones,

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:31.668
used by billions of people
all around the world.

00:57:31.668 --> 00:57:34.849
And through this journey we've seen
Android become more

00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:37.502
than just a smartphone operating system.

00:57:37.502 --> 00:57:43.929
powering new categories of computing,
including wearables, TV, auto, ARVR, IoT.

00:57:44.499 --> 00:57:47.350
And the growth of Android
over the last ten years

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:49.649
has helped fuel the shift in computing

00:57:49.649 --> 00:57:52.042
from desktop to mobile.

00:57:52.552 --> 00:57:56.623
And, as Sundar mentioned, the world
is now on the precipice of another shift.

00:57:56.623 --> 00:57:59.653
AI is going to profoundly change industries

00:57:59.653 --> 00:58:01.482
like healthcare and transport.

00:58:01.482 --> 00:58:04.056
It is already starting to change ours.

00:58:04.056 --> 00:58:08.136
And this brings me to the new version
of Android we're working on--

00:58:08.136 --> 00:58:09.177
Android P.

00:58:09.177 --> 00:58:11.677
Android P is an important first step

00:58:11.677 --> 00:58:15.774
towards this vision of AI
at the core of the operating system.

00:58:15.774 --> 00:58:20.073
In fact, AI underpins the first
of three themes in this release,

00:58:20.073 --> 00:58:21.231
which are:

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:22.373
Intelligence,

00:58:22.373 --> 00:58:23.585
Simplicity,

00:58:23.585 --> 00:58:25.418
and Digital wellbeing.

00:58:25.418 --> 00:58:27.319
So, starting with intelligence.

00:58:28.119 --> 00:58:30.133
We believe smartphones should be smarter.

00:58:30.133 --> 00:58:32.962
They should learn from you
and they should adapt to you.

00:58:32.962 --> 00:58:35.841
Technologies
such as on-device machine learning

00:58:35.841 --> 00:58:37.926
can learn your usage patterns,

00:58:37.926 --> 00:58:40.367
and automatically anticipate
your next actions,

00:58:40.367 --> 00:58:41.838
saving you time.

00:58:41.838 --> 00:58:43.691
And, because it runs on device,

00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:46.200
the data is kept private to your phone.

00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:49.105
So, let's take a look at some examples

00:58:49.105 --> 00:58:51.524
of how we're
applying these technologies to Android

00:58:51.524 --> 00:58:53.818
to build a smarter operating system.

00:58:54.518 --> 00:58:56.915
In pretty much every survey
of smartphone users,

00:58:56.915 --> 00:58:59.835
you'll see battery life
as the top concern.

00:58:59.835 --> 00:59:02.671
And, I don't know about you,
but this is my version

00:59:02.671 --> 00:59:04.672
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:59:04.672 --> 00:59:06.913
(laughter)

00:59:06.913 --> 00:59:08.718
And we've all been there.

00:59:08.718 --> 00:59:11.643
Your battery's been okay, but then
you have one of those outlier days,

00:59:11.643 --> 00:59:15.173
where it's draining faster than normal,
leaving you to run to the charger.

00:59:15.783 --> 00:59:18.117
With Android P
we partnered with Deep Mind

00:59:18.117 --> 00:59:22.366
to work on a new feature
we call Adaptive Battery.

00:59:22.366 --> 00:59:26.011
It's designed to give you
a more consistent battery experience.

00:59:26.351 --> 00:59:28.984
Adaptive battery
uses on-device machine learning

00:59:28.984 --> 00:59:32.392
to figure out which apps
you'll use in the next few hours,

00:59:32.392 --> 00:59:35.729
and which you won't use until later,
if at all, today.

00:59:35.729 --> 00:59:37.311
And then, with this understanding,

00:59:37.311 --> 00:59:40.772
the operating system
adapts to your usage patterns.

00:59:40.772 --> 00:59:43.157
so that it spends battery
only the apps and services

00:59:43.157 --> 00:59:44.571
that you care about.

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.759
And the results are really promising.

00:59:46.759 --> 00:59:51.346
We're seeing a 30% reduction
in CPU wake-ups for apps in general.

00:59:51.346 --> 00:59:53.912
And this, combined
with other performance improvements,

00:59:53.912 --> 00:59:57.770
including running background processes
on the small CPU cores,

00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:00.668
is resulting in an increase in battery
for many users.

01:00:00.668 --> 01:00:01.991
It's pretty cool.

01:00:02.831 --> 01:00:06.172
Another example
of how the OS is adapting to the user

01:00:06.172 --> 01:00:07.740
is auto-brightness.

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:11.499
Now, most modern smartphones
will automatically adjust the brightness,

01:00:11.499 --> 01:00:13.692
given the current lighting conditions.

01:00:13.692 --> 01:00:15.980
But it's a one-size-fits-all.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:19.016
They don't take into account
your personal preferences

01:00:19.016 --> 01:00:20.546
and environment.

01:00:20.546 --> 01:00:24.687
So, often what happens, is you then need
to manually adjust the brightness slider,

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:26.978
resulting in the screen
later becoming too bright

01:00:26.978 --> 01:00:27.999
or too dim.

01:00:28.479 --> 01:00:32.516
With Android P, we were introducing
a new on-device machine learning feature

01:00:32.516 --> 01:00:35.449
we call Adaptive Brightness.

01:00:35.449 --> 01:00:38.860
Adaptive Brightness learns
how you like to set the brightness slider,

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:40.501
given the ambient lighting,

01:00:40.501 --> 01:00:42.044
and then does it for you

01:00:42.044 --> 01:00:43.685
in a power-efficient way.

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:46.093
So, you'll literally see
the brightness slider move

01:00:46.093 --> 01:00:48.911
as the phone adapts to your preferences.

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:50.451
And it's extremely effective.

01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:53.289
In fact, we're seeing
almost half of our test users

01:00:53.289 --> 01:00:56.280
now make fewer manual brightness adjustments,

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.594
compared to any previous version of Android.

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.350
We're also making the UI more intelligent.

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:06.202
Last year we introduced the concept
of predicted apps,

01:01:06.202 --> 01:01:09.835
a feature that places the next apps
the OS anticipates you need

01:01:09.835 --> 01:01:11.725
on the path you'd normally follow

01:01:11.725 --> 01:01:13.208
to launch that app.

01:01:13.208 --> 01:01:14.578
And it's very effective,

01:01:14.578 --> 01:01:17.461
with an almost 60% prediction rate.

01:01:17.461 --> 01:01:18.774
With Android P,

01:01:18.774 --> 01:01:21.975
we're going beyond
simply predicting the next app to launch,

01:01:21.975 --> 01:01:24.896
to predicting the next action
you want to take.

01:01:24.896 --> 01:01:27.785
We call this feature App Actions.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:29.452
Let's take a look at how it works.

01:01:30.042 --> 01:01:32.586
At the top of the launcher
you can see two actions--

01:01:32.586 --> 01:01:34.389
one, to call my sister, Fiona,

01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:38.158
and another to start a workout on Strava,
for my evening run.

01:01:38.158 --> 01:01:41.593
So, what's happening here
is that the actions are being predicted

01:01:41.593 --> 01:01:43.970
based on my usage patterns.

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:47.893
The phone is adapting to me
and trying to help me get to my next task

01:01:47.893 --> 01:01:48.939
more quickly.

01:01:49.319 --> 01:01:51.904
As another example,
if I connect my headphones,

01:01:51.904 --> 01:01:55.891
Android will surface an action
to resume the album I was listening to.

01:01:56.551 --> 01:01:58.175
To support App Actions,

01:01:58.175 --> 01:02:02.605
developers just need to add
an <i>actions.xml</i> file to their app.

01:02:02.605 --> 01:02:05.352
And then Actions surfaces
not just in the Launcher,

01:02:05.352 --> 01:02:09.245
but in Smart Text selection,
the Play Store, Google Search,

01:02:09.245 --> 01:02:11.000
and the Assistant.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.447
Take Google Search.

01:02:12.447 --> 01:02:15.372
We're experimenting with different ways
to surface actions

01:02:15.372 --> 01:02:17.646
for apps you've installed and use a lot.

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:19.913
For example, I'm a big Fandango user.

01:02:19.913 --> 01:02:23.688
So, when I search for the new
Avengers movie, <i>Infinity War</i>,

01:02:23.688 --> 01:02:25.940
I get, in addition to regular suggestions,

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.430
I get an action to the Fandango app

01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:29.724
to buy tickets.

01:02:29.724 --> 01:02:30.743
Pretty cool.

01:02:31.953 --> 01:02:34.670
Actions are a simple but powerful idea

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.720
for providing deep links into the app

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.512
given your context.

01:02:38.512 --> 01:02:42.350
But even more powerful
is bringing part of the app UI

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:44.617
to the user, right there and then.

01:02:44.617 --> 01:02:46.805
We call this feature Slices.

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:49.271
Slices are a new API

01:02:49.271 --> 01:02:53.263
for developers to define
interactive snippets of their app UI.

01:02:53.263 --> 01:02:55.955
They can be surfaced
in different places in the OS.

01:02:56.825 --> 01:03:01.256
In Android P, we're laying the groundwork
by showing slices first in Search.

01:03:01.256 --> 01:03:02.652
So, let's take a look.

01:03:02.652 --> 01:03:06.487
Let's say I'm out and about
and I need to get a ride to work.

01:03:06.847 --> 01:03:08.991
If I type "lyft"
into the Google Search app,

01:03:08.991 --> 01:03:12.919
I now see a slice from the Lyft app
installed on my phone.

01:03:12.919 --> 01:03:17.152
Lyft is using the Slice API's rich array
of UI templates

01:03:17.152 --> 01:03:20.595
to render a slice of their app
in the context of Search.

01:03:20.595 --> 01:03:23.622
And then Lyft is able to give me
the price for my trip to work,

01:03:23.622 --> 01:03:27.256
and the slice is interactive,
so I can order the ride directly from it.

01:03:27.256 --> 01:03:28.400
Pretty nice.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.381
The Slice templates are versatile
so developers can offer everything

01:03:32.381 --> 01:03:35.134
from playing a video to,
say, checking into a hotel.

01:03:35.694 --> 01:03:38.480
As another example-- if I search for Hawaii,

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.068
I'll see a slice from Google Photos
with my vacation pictures.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:44.678
And we're working with some amazing partners

01:03:44.678 --> 01:03:46.662
on App Actions and Slices.

01:03:46.662 --> 01:03:49.389
And we'll be opening
an early-access program to developers

01:03:49.389 --> 01:03:50.978
more broadly next month.

01:03:50.978 --> 01:03:54.282
So, we're excited to see
how Actions and, in particular, Slices,

01:03:54.282 --> 01:03:57.547
will enable a dynamic two-way experience

01:03:57.547 --> 01:04:00.932
where the app's UI
can intelligently show up in context.

01:04:01.942 --> 01:04:05.775
So, that's some of the ways
that we're making Android more intelligent

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:07.512
by teaching the operating system

01:04:07.512 --> 01:04:09.131
to adapt to the user.

01:04:09.531 --> 01:04:11.602
Machine learning's a powerful tool,

01:04:11.602 --> 01:04:13.831
but it can also be intimidating and costly

01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:16.542
for developers to learn and apply.

01:04:16.542 --> 01:04:19.440
And we want to make these tools accessible

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.580
and easy to use

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.650
to those who have little or no expertise

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:23.899
in machine learning.

01:04:23.899 --> 01:04:28.007
So, today I'm really excited
to announce ML Kit,

01:04:28.007 --> 01:04:31.370
a new set of APIs
available through Firebase.

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:33.204
With ML Kit,

01:04:33.204 --> 01:04:35.271
you get on-device APIs,

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:37.856
to text recognition, and face detection,

01:04:37.856 --> 01:04:40.032
image labeling, and a lot more.

01:04:40.032 --> 01:04:43.057
And ML Kit also supports the ability

01:04:43.057 --> 01:04:46.276
to tap into Google's
cloud-based ML technologies.

01:04:46.836 --> 01:04:49.078
Architecturally, you can think of ML Kit

01:04:49.078 --> 01:04:51.145
as providing ready-to-use models,

01:04:51.145 --> 01:04:52.680
built on TensorFlow Lite

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.357
and optimized for mobile.

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:57.240
And, best of all,
ML Kit is cross platform,

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.167
so it runs on both Android and iOS.

01:05:00.167 --> 01:05:02.687
(cheering)

01:05:07.257 --> 01:05:10.333
We're working with
an early set of partners on ML Kit

01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:12.376
with some really great results.

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:15.807
For example, the popular
calorie counting app, Lose It!

01:05:15.807 --> 01:05:17.505
is using our text recognition model

01:05:17.505 --> 01:05:19.190
to scan nutritional information,

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:21.579
and ML Kits custom-model APIs

01:05:21.579 --> 01:05:24.179
to automatically classify 200 different foods

01:05:24.179 --> 01:05:25.835
through the camera.

01:05:25.835 --> 01:05:29.501
You'll hear more about ML Kit
at the developer keynote later today.

01:05:30.421 --> 01:05:33.606
So, we're excited about
making your smartphone more intelligent,

01:05:33.606 --> 01:05:38.074
but it's also important to us
that the technology fades to the back.

01:05:38.594 --> 01:05:41.441
One of our key goals over the last few years

01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:45.761
has been to evolve Android's UI
to be simpler and more approachable,

01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:47.652
both for the current set of users,

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:50.298
and the next billion Android users.

01:05:50.298 --> 01:05:51.624
With Android P,

01:05:51.624 --> 01:05:54.862
we put a special emphasis on simplicity

01:05:54.862 --> 01:05:58.564
by addressing many pain points
where we thought-- and you told us--

01:05:58.564 --> 01:06:01.913
the experience
was more complicated than it ought to be.

01:06:01.913 --> 01:06:04.744
And you'll find these improvements
on any device

01:06:04.744 --> 01:06:06.437
that adopts Google's version

01:06:06.437 --> 01:06:08.889
of the Android UI, such as Google Pixel

01:06:08.889 --> 01:06:11.086
and Android One devices.

01:06:11.856 --> 01:06:15.488
So, let me walk you through
a few live demos on my phone.

01:06:15.878 --> 01:06:17.717
What could possibly go wrong

01:06:17.717 --> 01:06:19.781
in front of 7,000 people in an amphitheater?

01:06:19.781 --> 01:06:21.659
Okay. (laughs)

01:06:21.659 --> 01:06:25.450
As part of Android P,
we're introducing a new system navigation

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:28.186
that we've been working on
for more than a year now.

01:06:28.186 --> 01:06:31.949
And the new design makes
Android's multitasking more approachable

01:06:31.949 --> 01:06:33.773
and easier to understand.

01:06:33.773 --> 01:06:36.049
And the first striking thing you'll notice

01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:38.401
is the single, clean Home button.

01:06:38.401 --> 01:06:42.045
And the design recognizes a trend
towards smaller screen bezels

01:06:42.045 --> 01:06:44.282
and places an emphasis on gestures

01:06:44.282 --> 01:06:46.700
over multiple buttons
at the edge of the screen.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.963
So, when I swipe up,

01:06:47.963 --> 01:06:49.888
I'm immediately brought to the Overview,

01:06:49.888 --> 01:06:52.404
where I can resume apps I've recently used.

01:06:52.404 --> 01:06:55.285
I also get five predicted apps
at the bottom of the screen

01:06:55.285 --> 01:06:57.030
to save me time.

01:06:57.030 --> 01:07:00.623
Now, if I continue to swipe up,
or I swipe up a second time,

01:07:00.623 --> 01:07:02.493
I get to All Apps.

01:07:02.493 --> 01:07:04.253
So, architecturally, what we've done

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:08.504
is combine the All Apps
and Overview spaces into one.

01:07:09.074 --> 01:07:11.312
The swipe up gesture works from anywhere,

01:07:11.312 --> 01:07:13.303
no matter what app I'm in

01:07:13.303 --> 01:07:16.109
so that I can quickly get back
to All Apps and Overview

01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:18.394
without losing the context I'm in.

01:07:18.884 --> 01:07:20.774
And, if you prefer,

01:07:20.774 --> 01:07:22.964
you can also use the Quick Scrub gesture

01:07:22.964 --> 01:07:24.811
by sliding the Home button sideways

01:07:24.811 --> 01:07:27.870
to scroll through
your recent set of apps like so.

01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:29.967
(applause)

01:07:33.354 --> 01:07:36.390
Now, one of the nice things
about the larger horizontal Overview

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:38.440
is that the app content is now glanceable,

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:41.585
so you can easily refer back
to information in a previous app.

01:07:42.045 --> 01:07:46.308
Even more is we've extended
Smart Text Selection to work in Overview.

01:07:46.308 --> 01:07:49.980
So, for example, if I tap anywhere
on the phrase, The Killers,

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:51.978
all of the phrase will be selected for me,

01:07:51.978 --> 01:07:55.447
and then I get an action
to listen to it on Spotify, like so.

01:07:55.777 --> 01:07:59.017
And we've extended Smart Text Selection's
neural network

01:07:59.017 --> 01:08:00.669
to recognize more entities,

01:08:00.669 --> 01:08:04.956
like sports teams and music artists,
and flight codes and more.

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:07.708
I've been using this View
navigation system for the last month,

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:09.199
and I absolutely love it.

01:08:09.199 --> 01:08:11.058
It's a much faster, more powerful way

01:08:11.058 --> 01:08:12.610
to multitask on the go.

01:08:13.257 --> 01:08:16.667
So, changing how Navigation works--
it's a pretty big deal.

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:20.145
But sometimes small changes
can make a big difference, too.

01:08:20.145 --> 01:08:21.704
So, take volume control.

01:08:21.944 --> 01:08:24.647
We've all been there--
you try to turn down the volume

01:08:24.647 --> 01:08:26.034
before a video starts,

01:08:26.034 --> 01:08:28.277
but instead, you turn down the ringer volume

01:08:28.277 --> 01:08:31.139
and then the video
blasts everyone around you.

01:08:31.139 --> 01:08:32.475
So, how are we fixing it?

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:35.563
Well, you can see 
the new simplified volume controls here.

01:08:35.933 --> 01:08:38.917
They're vertical,
and located beside the hardware buttons--

01:08:38.917 --> 01:08:40.142
so they're intuitive.

01:08:40.142 --> 01:08:44.447
But the key difference is that the slider
now adjusts the media volume by default,

01:08:44.447 --> 01:08:47.128
because that's the thing
you want to change most often.

01:08:47.128 --> 01:08:50.786
And, for the ringer volume,
all you really care about is On, Silent,

01:08:50.786 --> 01:08:52.529
and Off, like so.

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:53.802
Okay.

01:08:54.082 --> 01:08:56.427
We've also greatly simplified rotation.

01:08:56.427 --> 01:08:57.664
And, if you're like me,

01:08:57.664 --> 01:08:59.787
and hate your device 
rotating at the wrong time

01:08:59.787 --> 01:09:01.042
you'll love this feature.

01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:03.606
So, right now, I'm in the Lock Rotation mode.

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:05.202
And let me launch an app,

01:09:05.202 --> 01:09:07.612
and you'll notice
that when I rotate the device,

01:09:07.612 --> 01:09:10.236
a new Rotation button appears on the Nav bar.

01:09:10.236 --> 01:09:13.442
And then I can just tap on it
and rotate under my own control.

01:09:13.442 --> 01:09:14.436
It's pretty cool.

01:09:14.436 --> 01:09:16.605
(applause)

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.700
Alright, so that's a quick tour

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:25.407
of some of the ways that we've simplified
user experience in Android P.

01:09:25.407 --> 01:09:26.805
And there's lots more.

01:09:26.805 --> 01:09:29.256
Everything from a redesigned work profile,

01:09:29.256 --> 01:09:31.153
to better screenshots,

01:09:31.153 --> 01:09:34.379
to improved
notifications management, and more.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:36.506
Speaking of notifications management,

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:40.265
we want to give you more control
over demands on your attention.

01:09:40.265 --> 01:09:43.475
And this highlights a concept
that Sundar alluded to earlier--

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:45.929
making it easier
to move between your digital life

01:09:45.929 --> 01:09:47.510
and your real life.

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:49.840
To learn more about this important area,

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.090
and our third theme,
let me hand over to Sameer.

01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:53.099
Thanks.

01:09:53.099 --> 01:09:54.775
(applause)

01:09:54.775 --> 01:09:57.199
♪ (music) ♪

01:10:01.435 --> 01:10:02.535
Hi everyone!

01:10:04.475 --> 01:10:06.106
On a recent family vacation,

01:10:06.106 --> 01:10:08.306
my partner asked if she could see my phone

01:10:08.306 --> 01:10:10.501
right after we got to our hotel room.

01:10:10.501 --> 01:10:11.809
She took it from me,

01:10:11.809 --> 01:10:14.236
walked over to the hotel safe,

01:10:14.236 --> 01:10:16.612
locked it inside,

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:19.006
and turned and looked me
right in the eye and said,

01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:22.661
"You get this back
in seven days when we leave."

01:10:22.661 --> 01:10:24.485
(laughter)

01:10:24.485 --> 01:10:27.192
Whoa! I was shocked.

01:10:27.192 --> 01:10:29.047
I was kind of angry.

01:10:29.047 --> 01:10:33.835
But after a few hours,
something pretty cool happened.

01:10:33.835 --> 01:10:36.060
Without all the distractions
from my phone,

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.171
I was actually able to disconnect,

01:10:38.171 --> 01:10:39.992
be fully present,

01:10:39.992 --> 01:10:44.268
and I ended up
having a wonderful family vacation.

01:10:44.268 --> 01:10:45.609
But it's not just me.

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:48.488
Our team has heard
so many stories from people

01:10:48.488 --> 01:10:51.562
who are trying to find
the right balance with technology.

01:10:52.182 --> 01:10:53.962
As you heard from Sundar,

01:10:53.962 --> 01:10:55.981
helping people with their digital wellbeing

01:10:55.981 --> 01:10:58.296
is more important to us than ever.

01:10:58.756 --> 01:11:02.833
People tell us a lot of the time
they spend on their phone is really useful.

01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:06.274
But some of it
they wish they'd spent on other things.

01:11:06.274 --> 01:11:09.322
In fact, we found over 70% of people

01:11:09.322 --> 01:11:12.153
want more help striking this balance.

01:11:12.153 --> 01:11:13.838
So, we've been working hard

01:11:13.838 --> 01:11:16.540
to add key capabilities right into Android

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.396
to help people
find the balance with technology

01:11:19.396 --> 01:11:20.825
that they're looking for.

01:11:21.465 --> 01:11:23.767
One of the first things we focused on

01:11:23.767 --> 01:11:26.105
was helping you understand your habits.

01:11:26.465 --> 01:11:28.491
Android P will show you a Dashboard

01:11:28.491 --> 01:11:31.067
of how you're spending time on your device.

01:11:31.067 --> 01:11:32.111
As you saw earlier,

01:11:32.111 --> 01:11:34.948
you can see how much time you spent in apps,

01:11:34.948 --> 01:11:37.317
how many times
you've unlocked your device today,

01:11:37.317 --> 01:11:39.964
and how many notifications you've received.

01:11:39.964 --> 01:11:42.707
And you can drill down
on any of these things.

01:11:42.707 --> 01:11:45.702
For example,
here's my Gmail data from Saturday.

01:11:45.702 --> 01:11:49.201
And when I saw this it did make me wonder
whether I should've been on my email

01:11:49.201 --> 01:11:50.257
all weekend.

01:11:50.257 --> 01:11:52.541
But that's kind of the point
of the Dashboard.

01:11:52.971 --> 01:11:57.307
Now, when you're engaging
is one part of understanding.

01:11:57.307 --> 01:11:59.430
But what you're engaging with in apps

01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:00.948
is equally important.

01:12:01.468 --> 01:12:03.094
It's like watching TV--

01:12:03.094 --> 01:12:05.870
catching up on your favorite shows
at the end of a long day

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:07.402
can feel pretty good.

01:12:07.402 --> 01:12:10.052
But watching an infomercial
might leave you wondering

01:12:10.052 --> 01:12:12.582
why you didn't do something else instead.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:16.067
Many developers call this concept
"meaningful engagement."

01:12:16.067 --> 01:12:19.175
And we've been working closely
with many of our developer partners

01:12:19.175 --> 01:12:20.411
who share the goal

01:12:20.411 --> 01:12:23.384
of helping people use technology
in healthy ways.

01:12:24.044 --> 01:12:25.486
So, in Android P,

01:12:25.486 --> 01:12:27.984
developers can link
to more detailed breakdowns

01:12:27.984 --> 01:12:30.188
of how you're spending time in their app

01:12:30.188 --> 01:12:31.441
from this new Dashboard.

01:12:31.941 --> 01:12:34.756
For example,
YouTube will be adding a deep link

01:12:34.756 --> 01:12:36.714
where you can see total watch time

01:12:36.714 --> 01:12:39.062
across mobile and desktop

01:12:39.062 --> 01:12:41.077
and access many of the helpful tools

01:12:41.077 --> 01:12:43.575
that Sundar shared earlier.

01:12:44.435 --> 01:12:46.518
Now, understanding is a good start.

01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:50.044
But Android P also gives you controls

01:12:50.044 --> 01:12:54.175
to help you manage
how and when you spend time on your phone.

01:12:54.175 --> 01:12:56.080
Maybe you have an app that you love,

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.540
but you're spending more time in it
than you realize.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.376
Android P lets you set
time limits on your apps

01:13:02.376 --> 01:13:04.917
and will nudge you
when you're close to your limit

01:13:04.917 --> 01:13:06.849
that it's time to do something else.

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:08.457
And, for the rest of the day,

01:13:08.457 --> 01:13:10.282
that app icon is grayed out,

01:13:10.282 --> 01:13:11.788
to remind you of your goal.

01:13:12.998 --> 01:13:16.367
People have also told us
they struggle to be fully present

01:13:16.367 --> 01:13:19.609
for the dinner that they're at
or the meeting that they're attending,

01:13:19.609 --> 01:13:22.014
because the notifications
they get on their device

01:13:22.014 --> 01:13:23.242
can be distracting

01:13:23.242 --> 01:13:25.558
and too tempting to resist.

01:13:25.558 --> 01:13:27.939
Come on-- we've all been there.

01:13:28.749 --> 01:13:30.574
So we're making improvements

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.043
to Do Not Disturb mode,

01:13:32.043 --> 01:13:34.999
to silence not just 
the phone calls and texts,

01:13:34.999 --> 01:13:38.564
but also the visual interruptions
that pop up on your screen.

01:13:38.994 --> 01:13:41.569
To make Do Not Disturb even easier to use,

01:13:41.569 --> 01:13:43.472
we've created a new gesture

01:13:43.472 --> 01:13:46.467
that we've affectionately
code-named Shush.

01:13:46.467 --> 01:13:48.176
(laughter)

01:13:48.176 --> 01:13:52.462
If you turn your phone over on the table,
it automatically enters Do Not Disturb

01:13:52.464 --> 01:13:55.121
so you can focus on being present--

01:13:55.121 --> 01:13:58.507
no pings, vibrations, or other distractions.

01:13:58.507 --> 01:14:00.726
(applause)

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.956
Of course, in an emergency,

01:14:05.956 --> 01:14:08.946
we all want to make sure we're still
reachable by the key people in our lives,

01:14:08.946 --> 01:14:11.032
like your partner or your child's school.

01:14:11.032 --> 01:14:13.427
Android P will help you
set up a list of contacts

01:14:13.427 --> 01:14:15.907
that can always
get through to you with a phone call,

01:14:15.907 --> 01:14:18.019
even if Do Not Disturb is turned on.

01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:22.462
Finally, we heard from people
that they often check their phone

01:14:22.462 --> 01:14:24.073
right before going to bed,

01:14:24.073 --> 01:14:25.903
and, before you know it,

01:14:25.903 --> 01:14:27.723
an hour or two has slipped by.

01:14:27.723 --> 01:14:31.330
And, honestly, this happens to me
at least once a week.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.095
Getting a good night's sleep is critical,

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:36.180
and technology should help you with this,

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.203
not prevent it from happening.

01:14:38.743 --> 01:14:41.421
So, we created Wind Down mode.

01:14:41.871 --> 01:14:44.963
You can tell the Google Assistant
what time you aim to go to bed,

01:14:44.963 --> 01:14:47.848
and when that time arrives
it will switch on Do Not Disturb,

01:14:47.848 --> 01:14:50.192
and fade the screen to gray scale,

01:14:50.192 --> 01:14:52.577
which is far less stimulating for the brain,

01:14:52.577 --> 01:14:55.033
and can help you set the phone down.

01:14:55.033 --> 01:14:57.130
It's such a simple idea,

01:14:57.130 --> 01:15:00.045
but I found it's amazing
how quickly I put my phone away

01:15:00.045 --> 01:15:03.305
when all my apps
go back to the days before color TV.

01:15:03.305 --> 01:15:05.528
(laughter)

01:15:05.528 --> 01:15:07.110
(applause)

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.007
Don't worry, all the colors
return in the morning when you wake up.

01:15:14.137 --> 01:15:17.972
Okay, that was a quick tour
of some of the digital wellbeing features

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:20.477
we're bringing to Android P this fall,

01:15:20.477 --> 01:15:22.771
starting with Google Pixel.

01:15:22.771 --> 01:15:25.780
Digital wellbeing is going to be
a long term theme for us,

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.450
so look for much more to come in the future.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.746
Beyond the three themes
of intelligence, simplicity,

01:15:31.746 --> 01:15:34.286
and digital wellbeing
that Dave and I talked about,

01:15:34.286 --> 01:15:37.386
there are literally hundreds
of other improvements coming

01:15:37.386 --> 01:15:38.586
in Android P.

01:15:38.586 --> 01:15:42.506
I'm especially excited about the security
advancements we've added to the platform,

01:15:42.506 --> 01:15:45.647
and you can learn more about them
at the Android Security session

01:15:45.647 --> 01:15:46.747
on Thursday.

01:15:47.317 --> 01:15:49.442
But your big question is:

01:15:49.442 --> 01:15:51.024
That's all great.

01:15:51.024 --> 01:15:53.058
How do I try some of this stuff?

01:15:53.968 --> 01:15:58.537
Well, today we're announcing 
Android P Beta.

01:15:58.537 --> 01:16:00.414
(applause)

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:07.418
And with efforts in Android Oreo
to make OS upgrades easier,

01:16:07.418 --> 01:16:10.419
Android P Beta
is available on Google Pixel

01:16:10.419 --> 01:16:15.149
and seven more
manufacturer flagship devices today.

01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:17.100

and please do let us know what you think.

Okay, that's a wrap

have allowed us to dramatically
improve long-standing products

01:17:54.313 --> 01:17:55.681
like Google Maps,

01:17:55.681 --> 01:17:59.110
and have also made possible
brand new products, like Google Lens.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.863
Let's start with Google Maps.

01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:04.962
Maps was built to assist everyone,

01:18:04.962 --> 01:18:07.018
wherever they are in the world.

01:18:07.018 --> 01:18:10.181
We've mapped
over 220 countries and territories,

01:18:10.181 --> 01:18:13.930
and put hundreds of millions
of businesses and places on the map.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.288
And, in doing so,
we've given more than a billion people

01:18:17.288 --> 01:18:18.801
the ability to travel the world

01:18:18.801 --> 01:18:21.569
with the confidence
that they won't get lost along the way.

01:18:22.289 --> 01:18:24.059
But we're far from done.

01:18:24.059 --> 01:18:26.353
We've been making Maps
smarter and more detailed

01:18:26.353 --> 01:18:28.851
as advancements in AI have accelerated.

01:18:29.451 --> 01:18:33.663
We're now able to automatically add
new addresses, businesses, and buildings

01:18:33.663 --> 01:18:37.288
that we extract from Street View
and satellite imagery directly to the Map.

01:18:38.138 --> 01:18:39.941
This is critical in rural areas,

01:18:39.941 --> 01:18:41.960
in places without formal addresses,

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.586
and in fast-changing cities,
like Lagos here,

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:47.770
where we've literally changed
the face of the map in the last few years.

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:50.151
(cheering)

01:18:51.476 --> 01:18:53.606
Hello, Nigeria! (laughs)

01:18:53.606 --> 01:18:55.581
(laughter)

01:18:56.168 --> 01:18:59.162
We can also tell you if the business
you're looking for is open,

01:18:59.162 --> 01:19:00.189
how busy it is,

01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:01.784
what the wait time is,

01:19:01.784 --> 01:19:03.959
and even how long
people usually spend there.

01:19:05.179 --> 01:19:07.400
We can tell you before you leave

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.702
whether parking
is going to be easy or difficult,

01:19:09.702 --> 01:19:11.295
and we can help you find it.

01:19:11.875 --> 01:19:15.599
And we can now give you different routes
based on your mode of transportation,

01:19:15.599 --> 01:19:18.013
whether you're riding a motorbike
or driving a car.

01:19:18.663 --> 01:19:22.380
And, by understanding how different types
of vehicles move at different speeds,

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:25.524
we can make more accurate
traffic predictions for everyone.

01:19:26.574 --> 01:19:29.777
But we've only scratched the surface
of what Maps can do.

01:19:30.477 --> 01:19:34.525
We originally designed Maps
to help you understand where you are,

01:19:34.525 --> 01:19:37.077
and to help you get from here to there.

01:19:37.077 --> 01:19:38.651
But, over the past few years,

01:19:38.651 --> 01:19:42.238
we've seen our users
demand more and more of Maps.

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:45.230
They're bringing us harder
and more complex questions

01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:48.561
about the world around them,
and they're trying to get more done.

01:19:49.361 --> 01:19:52.680
Today, our users aren't just asking
for the fastest route to a place.

01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:55.731
They also want to know
what's happening around them,

01:19:55.731 --> 01:19:57.580
what the new places to try are,

01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.587
and what locals love
in their neighborhood.

01:20:01.567 --> 01:20:04.709
The world is filled
with amazing experiences,

01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:07.309
like cheering for your favorite team
at a sports bar,

01:20:07.309 --> 01:20:10.826
or a night out with friends or family
at a cosy neighborhood bistro.

01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:14.286
We want to make it easy for you
to explore and experience

01:20:14.286 --> 01:20:16.412
more of what the world has to offer.

01:20:16.962 --> 01:20:19.819
We've been working hard
on an updated version of Google Maps

01:20:19.819 --> 01:20:22.326
that keeps you in the know
on what's new and trending

01:20:22.326 --> 01:20:23.824
in the areas you care about.

01:20:23.824 --> 01:20:26.059
It helps you find the best place for you,

01:20:26.059 --> 01:20:28.497
based on your context and interests.

01:20:28.497 --> 01:20:31.494
Let me give you a few examples
of what this is going to look like,

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:32.926
with some help from Sophia.

01:20:34.086 --> 01:20:38.067
First, we're adding a new tab 
to Maps called For You.

01:20:38.387 --> 01:20:40.582
It's designed to tell you
what you need to know

01:20:40.582 --> 01:20:42.588
about the neighborhoods you care about--

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:44.244
new places that are opening,

01:20:44.244 --> 01:20:45.373
what's trending now,

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:47.572
and personal recommendations.

01:20:47.972 --> 01:20:50.919
Here, I'm being told about a cafe
that just opened in my area.

01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:53.288
If we scroll down,

01:20:53.288 --> 01:20:56.158
I see a list of the restaurants
that are trending this week.

01:20:56.578 --> 01:20:58.969
This is super useful, because,
with zero work,

01:20:58.969 --> 01:21:01.623
Maps is giving me ideas
to kick me out of my rut

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:04.051
and inspire me to try something new.

01:21:05.311 --> 01:21:08.607
But how do I know
if a place is really right for me?

01:21:09.067 --> 01:21:12.442
Have you ever had the experience
of looking at lots of places,

01:21:12.442 --> 01:21:14.046
all with four-star ratings,

01:21:14.046 --> 01:21:16.623
and you're pretty sure there's some
you're going to like a lot

01:21:16.623 --> 01:21:18.549
and others that maybe aren't quite so great,

01:21:18.549 --> 01:21:20.789
but you're not sure how to tell which ones?

01:21:21.319 --> 01:21:24.171
We've created a score called Your Match

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:27.204
to help you find more places
that you'll love.

01:21:27.664 --> 01:21:29.882
Your Match uses machine learning

01:21:29.882 --> 01:21:33.356
to combine what Google knows
about hundreds of millions of places

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:35.726
with the information that I've added--

01:21:35.726 --> 01:21:37.016
restaurants I've rated,

01:21:37.016 --> 01:21:38.295
cuisines I've liked,

01:21:38.295 --> 01:21:40.115
and places that I've been to.

01:21:41.115 --> 01:21:42.836
If you click into the Match number,

01:21:42.836 --> 01:21:45.893
you'll see reasons explaining
why it's recommended just for you.

01:21:46.153 --> 01:21:48.599
It's your personal score for places.

01:21:48.609 --> 01:21:51.664
And our early testers
are telling us that they love it.

01:21:52.214 --> 01:21:55.295
Now, you can confidently pick the places
that are best for you,

01:21:55.295 --> 01:21:57.051
whether you're planning ahead

01:21:57.051 --> 01:22:00.711
or on the go and need to make
a quick decision, right now.

01:22:00.711 --> 01:22:02.314
Thanks so much, Sophia.

01:22:02.314 --> 01:22:04.800
(applause)

01:22:06.474 --> 01:22:09.228
The For You tab, and the Your Match score,

01:22:09.228 --> 01:22:11.951
are great examples
of how we can help you stay in the know

01:22:11.951 --> 01:22:13.877
and choose places with confidence.

01:22:14.307 --> 01:22:16.822
Now, another pain point
we often hear from our users

01:22:16.822 --> 01:22:19.572
is that planning with others
can be a real challenge.

01:22:19.572 --> 01:22:22.453
So, we wanted to make it easier
to pick a place together.

01:22:22.453 --> 01:22:23.847
Here's how.

01:22:23.847 --> 01:22:25.812
Long press on any place

01:22:25.812 --> 01:22:27.694
to add it to a short list.

01:22:27.694 --> 01:22:29.413
Now, I'm always up for ramen,

01:22:29.413 --> 01:22:31.512
but I know my friends
have lots of opinions of their own,

01:22:31.512 --> 01:22:34.434
so I can add some more options
to give them some choices.

01:22:34.434 --> 01:22:36.942
When you've collected enough places
that you like

01:22:36.942 --> 01:22:39.880
share the list with your friends
to get their input, too.

01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:42.417
You can easily share,
with just a couple of taps,

01:22:42.417 --> 01:22:44.636
on any platform that you prefer.

01:22:44.636 --> 01:22:47.240
Then, my friends can add more places
that they want to,

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:51.805
or just vote with one simple click
so we can quickly choose a group favorite.

01:22:51.805 --> 01:22:54.581
So now, instead of copying and pasting
a bunch of links

01:22:54.581 --> 01:22:56.312
and sending texts back and forth,

01:22:56.312 --> 01:22:59.151
decisions can be quick, easy, and fun.

01:22:59.861 --> 01:23:02.525
This is just a glimpse
of some of what's coming to Maps

01:23:02.525 --> 01:23:05.266
on both Android and iOS later this summer.

01:23:05.566 --> 01:23:08.389
And we see this is just the beginning
of what Maps can do

01:23:08.389 --> 01:23:10.456
to help you make better decisions on the go

01:23:10.456 --> 01:23:12.993
and to experience the world in new ways,

01:23:12.993 --> 01:23:16.273
from your local neighborhood,
to the far-flung corners of the world.

01:23:19.373 --> 01:23:22.049
This discovery experience
wouldn't be possible

01:23:22.049 --> 01:23:24.425
without small businesses.

01:23:24.425 --> 01:23:26.809
Because, when we help people
discover new places,

01:23:26.809 --> 01:23:30.713
we're also helping local businesses
be discovered by new customers.

01:23:31.783 --> 01:23:34.322
These are businesses
like the bakery in your neighborhood,

01:23:34.322 --> 01:23:36.245
or the barbershop around the corner.

01:23:36.635 --> 01:23:39.440
These businesses
are the fabric of our communities

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.881
and we're deeply committed
to helping them succeed with Google.

01:23:44.271 --> 01:23:46.892
Every month, we connect users 
to businesses nearby

01:23:46.892 --> 01:23:49.456
more than 9 billion times,

01:23:49.456 --> 01:23:51.550
including over a billion phone calls

01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:54.191
and 3 billion direction requests
to their stores.

01:23:55.381 --> 01:23:57.667
In the last few months,
we've been adding even more tools

01:23:57.667 --> 01:24:00.411
for local businesses to communicate
and engage with their customers

01:24:00.411 --> 01:24:01.733
in meaningful ways.

01:24:02.143 --> 01:24:05.017
You can now see daily posts
on events or offers

01:24:05.017 --> 01:24:07.055
from many of your favorite businesses.

01:24:07.055 --> 01:24:09.020
And soon you will be able
to get updates from them

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.862
in the new For You stream, too.

01:24:11.042 --> 01:24:12.520
And, when you're ready,

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.127
you can easily book an appointment
or place an order with just one click.

01:24:18.617 --> 01:24:21.650
We're always inspired to see
how technology brings opportunities

01:24:21.650 --> 01:24:22.823
to everyone.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:25.742
The reason we've invested
over the last 13 years

01:24:25.742 --> 01:24:30.007
in mapping every road,
every building, and every business,

01:24:30.007 --> 01:24:31.090
is because it matters.

01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:34.821
When we map the world,
communities come alive

01:24:34.821 --> 01:24:38.506
and opportunities arise in places
we never would have thought possible.

01:24:40.146 --> 01:24:41.617
And, as computing evolves,

01:24:41.617 --> 01:24:44.544
we're going to keep challenging ourselves
to think of new ways

01:24:44.544 --> 01:24:47.126
that we can help you get things done
in the real world.

01:24:47.126 --> 01:24:49.865
I'd like to invite Aparna to the stage
to share how we're doing this,

01:24:49.865 --> 01:24:52.270
both in Google Maps, and beyond.

01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:54.808
♪ (music) ♪

01:25:03.323 --> 01:25:06.009
The cameras in our smartphones--

01:25:06.009 --> 01:25:09.714
they connect us to the world around us
in a very immediate way.

01:25:09.714 --> 01:25:12.838
They help us save a moment,
capture memories, and communicate.

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:15.619
But with advances
in AI and computer vision

01:25:15.619 --> 01:25:17.549
that you heard Sundar talk about,

01:25:17.549 --> 01:25:20.326
we said, "What if the cameras can do more?

01:25:20.326 --> 01:25:23.247
What if the cameras
can help us answer questions?"

01:25:23.247 --> 01:25:27.614
Questions like, "Where am I going?"
or, "What's that in front of me?"

01:25:28.664 --> 01:25:30.337
Let me paint a familiar picture.

01:25:30.337 --> 01:25:31.726
You exit the subway.

01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:34.006
You're already running late
for an appointment--

01:25:34.006 --> 01:25:36.812
or a tech company conference--
that happens.

01:25:36.812 --> 01:25:40.577
And then your phone says,
"Head south on Market Street."

01:25:41.067 --> 01:25:42.239
So, what do you do?

01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:45.332
One problem-- you have no idea
which way is south.

01:25:45.332 --> 01:25:46.805
So, you look down at the phone,

01:25:46.805 --> 01:25:48.670
you're looking
at that blue dot on the map,

01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:52.043
and you're starting to walk to see
if it's moving in the same direction.

01:25:52.043 --> 01:25:54.175
If it's not, you're turning around.

01:25:54.175 --> 01:25:56.125
- (laughter)
- We've all been there.

01:25:57.455 --> 01:26:00.780
So, we asked ourselves, "Well,
what if the camera can help us here?"

01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:03.382
Our teams have been working really hard

01:26:03.382 --> 01:26:06.357
to combine the power of the camera,
the computer vision,

01:26:06.357 --> 01:26:08.200
with Street View and Maps

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.128
to re-imagine Walking Navigation.

01:26:11.128 --> 01:26:13.705
So, here's how it could look in Google Maps.

01:26:13.705 --> 01:26:14.737
Let's take a look.

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:18.630
- You open the camera...
- (cheering)

01:26:24.148 --> 01:26:27.970
You instantly know where you are.

01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:29.484
No fussing with the phone.

01:26:30.094 --> 01:26:33.563
All the information on the map,
the street names, the directions--

01:26:33.563 --> 01:26:35.207
right there in front of you.

01:26:35.597 --> 01:26:38.992
Notice that you also see the map
so that way you stay oriented.

01:26:40.092 --> 01:26:43.589
You can start to see nearby places--
so you see what's around you.

01:26:43.589 --> 01:26:46.086
(applause)

01:26:46.546 --> 01:26:47.766
And, just for fun,

01:26:47.766 --> 01:26:51.248
our team's been playing with the idea
of adding a helpful guide,

01:26:51.248 --> 01:26:52.438
like that there...

01:26:52.438 --> 01:26:53.563
(applause)

01:26:53.563 --> 01:26:55.406
...so that it can show you the way.

01:26:55.406 --> 01:26:58.091
Oh, there she goes! Pretty cool.

01:26:58.501 --> 01:27:01.542
Now, enabling these kinds
of experiences, though,

01:27:01.542 --> 01:27:03.717
GPS alone doesn't cut it.

01:27:03.717 --> 01:27:07.196
So, that's why we've been working on
what we call VPS--

01:27:07.196 --> 01:27:10.013
Visual Positioning System--

01:27:10.013 --> 01:27:13.271
that can estimate precise positioning
and orientation.

01:27:13.271 --> 01:27:15.882
One way to think about
the key insight here is,

01:27:15.882 --> 01:27:18.764
just like you and I,
when we're in an unfamiliar place,

01:27:18.764 --> 01:27:20.477
you're looking for visual landmarks.

01:27:20.477 --> 01:27:23.342
You're looking for the storefront,
the building facade, et cetera.

01:27:23.342 --> 01:27:24.608
And it's the same idea.

01:27:24.608 --> 01:27:27.907
VPS uses the visual features
in the environment

01:27:27.907 --> 01:27:29.101
to do the same,

01:27:29.101 --> 01:27:31.826
so that way we help you
figure out exactly where you are

01:27:31.826 --> 01:27:34.820
and get you exactly where you need to go.
Pretty cool.

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:38.579
So, that's an example
of how we're using the camera

01:27:38.579 --> 01:27:40.694
to help you in Maps.

01:27:40.694 --> 01:27:43.519
But we think the camera
can also help you do more

01:27:43.519 --> 01:27:44.883
with what you see.

01:27:45.413 --> 01:27:48.475
That's why we started working on Google Lens.

01:27:48.475 --> 01:27:52.351
Now, people are already using it
for all sorts of answers,

01:27:52.351 --> 01:27:55.897
and especially when the questions
are difficult to describe in words.

01:27:55.897 --> 01:27:58.741
Answers like, oh, that cute dog in the park--

01:27:58.741 --> 01:28:00.430
that's a Labradoodle.

01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:04.026
Or, this building in Chicago
is the Wrigley Building,

01:28:04.026 --> 01:28:06.579
and it's 425 feet tall--

01:28:07.209 --> 01:28:09.606
or, as my 9-year old son says these days,

01:28:09.606 --> 01:28:12.452
"That's more than 60 Kevin Durants!"

01:28:12.452 --> 01:28:13.884
(laughter)

01:28:13.884 --> 01:28:17.131
Now, today Lens has the capability,
in Google products--

01:28:17.131 --> 01:28:18.997
like Photos and the Assistant--

01:28:18.997 --> 01:28:21.627
but we're very excited that,
starting next week,

01:28:21.627 --> 01:28:25.682
Lens will be integrated
right inside the camera app

01:28:25.682 --> 01:28:28.890
on the Pixel, the new LG G7,

01:28:28.890 --> 01:28:30.548
and a lot more devices.

01:28:31.048 --> 01:28:33.813
This way, it makes it super easy
for you to use Lens

01:28:33.813 --> 01:28:36.910
on things right in front of you
already in the camera.

01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:38.758
Very excited to see this.

01:28:39.598 --> 01:28:41.188
Now, likewise,

01:28:41.188 --> 01:28:44.741
Vision is a fundamental shift
in computing for us.

01:28:44.741 --> 01:28:47.157
And it's a multi-year journey,

01:28:47.157 --> 01:28:49.172
but we're already making a lot of progress,

01:28:49.172 --> 01:28:52.872
so today I thought I'd show you
three new features in Google Lens

01:28:52.872 --> 01:28:56.411
that can give you more answers
to more types of questions,

01:28:56.411 --> 01:28:57.690
more quickly.

01:28:57.690 --> 01:28:59.238
Shall we take a look?

01:28:59.238 --> 01:29:00.344
Alright!

01:29:00.344 --> 01:29:04.530
Okay, first, Lens can now recognize
and understand words.

01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:06.387
Words are everywhere.

01:29:06.387 --> 01:29:09.781
If you think about it--
traffic signs, posters,

01:29:09.781 --> 01:29:12.595
restaurant menus, business cards.

01:29:12.595 --> 01:29:15.326
But now, with Smart Text Selection,

01:29:15.326 --> 01:29:17.727
you can now connect the words you see

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:20.015
with the answers and actions you need.

01:29:20.015 --> 01:29:23.256
So, you can do things like copy and paste

01:29:23.256 --> 01:29:25.027
from the real world

01:29:25.027 --> 01:29:26.704
directly into your phone.

01:29:27.444 --> 01:29:29.838
- Just like that.
- (applause)

01:29:32.807 --> 01:29:35.459
Or, let's say you're looking at--

01:29:35.459 --> 01:29:39.205
or you can turn a page of words
into a page of answers.

01:29:39.205 --> 01:29:42.061
So, for example,
you're looking at a restaurant menu,

01:29:42.061 --> 01:29:44.817
you can quickly tap around,
figure out every dish--

01:29:44.817 --> 01:29:47.851
what it looks like,
what are all the ingredients, et cetera.

01:29:48.521 --> 01:29:51.506
By the way, as a vegetarian,
good to know ratatouille

01:29:51.506 --> 01:29:54.197
is just zucchini and tomatoes. (chuckles)

01:29:54.197 --> 01:29:55.876
- (laughter)
- Really cool.

01:29:55.876 --> 01:29:57.289
Now, in these examples,

01:29:57.289 --> 01:30:01.920
Lens is not just understanding the shape
of characters and the letters, visually,

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:06.212
it's actually trying to get at the meaning
and the context behind these words.

01:30:06.212 --> 01:30:08.534
And that's where
all the language understanding

01:30:08.534 --> 01:30:11.636
that you heard Scott talk about
really comes in handy.

01:30:12.646 --> 01:30:15.055
Okay, the next feature I want to talk about

01:30:15.055 --> 01:30:16.737
is called Style Match.

01:30:17.667 --> 01:30:19.068
And the idea is this.

01:30:19.068 --> 01:30:22.461
Sometimes, your question is not,
"Oh, what's that exact thing?"

01:30:22.461 --> 01:30:25.997
Instead, your question is,
"What are things like it?"

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:29.825
You're at your friend's place,
you check out this trendy looking lamp,

01:30:29.825 --> 01:30:32.608
and you want to know things
that match that style.

01:30:32.608 --> 01:30:34.578
And now, Lens can help you.

01:30:36.188 --> 01:30:39.871
Or, if you see an outfit
that catches your eye,

01:30:39.871 --> 01:30:41.606
you can simply open the camera,

01:30:41.606 --> 01:30:43.902
tap on any item,

01:30:43.902 --> 01:30:46.121
and find out, of course, specific information

01:30:46.121 --> 01:30:48.847
like reviews, et cetera of any specific item,

01:30:48.847 --> 01:30:53.219
but you can also see all the things,
and browse around, that match that style.

01:30:53.879 --> 01:30:56.176
(applause)

01:30:59.662 --> 01:31:01.349
There's two parts to it, of course.

01:31:01.349 --> 01:31:04.070
Lens has to search through
millions and millions of items,

01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:07.547
but we kind of know how to do that search.

01:31:07.547 --> 01:31:09.122
- (laughter)
- But the other part

01:31:09.122 --> 01:31:12.484
actually complicates things,
which is if they can be different textures,

01:31:12.484 --> 01:31:16.058
shapes, sizes, angles,
lighting conditions, et cetera.

01:31:16.058 --> 01:31:17.727
So, it's a tough technical problem.

01:31:17.727 --> 01:31:21.284
But we're making a lot of progress here
and really excited about it.

01:31:21.714 --> 01:31:24.099
So, the last thing
I want to tell you about today

01:31:24.099 --> 01:31:27.716
is how we're making Lens work in real time.

01:31:27.716 --> 01:31:30.435
So, as you saw in the Style Match example,

01:31:30.435 --> 01:31:33.207
you start to see--you open the camera--

01:31:33.207 --> 01:31:35.948
and you start to see
Lens surface proactively

01:31:35.948 --> 01:31:38.193
all the information instantly.

01:31:38.193 --> 01:31:41.790
And it even anchors that information
to the things that you see.

01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:44.063
Now, this kind of thing--

01:31:44.063 --> 01:31:47.106
where it's sifting through billions
of words, phrases, places, things,

01:31:47.106 --> 01:31:49.585
just in real time to give you what you need--

01:31:49.585 --> 01:31:52.997
not possible without machine learning.

01:31:52.997 --> 01:31:55.383
So, we're using both on-device intelligence,

01:31:55.383 --> 01:31:59.156
but also tapping into the power
of cloud TPUs,

01:31:59.156 --> 01:32:02.417
which we announced last year at I/O,
to get this done.

01:32:02.417 --> 01:32:03.500
Really excited.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:07.869
And over time, what we want to do
is actually overlay the live results

01:32:07.869 --> 01:32:11.484
directly on top of things,
like store fronts, street signs,

01:32:11.484 --> 01:32:12.924
or a concert poster.

01:32:13.624 --> 01:32:19.156
So, you can simply point your phone
at a concert poster of Charlie Puth,

01:32:19.156 --> 01:32:21.591
and the music video just starts to play,

01:32:21.591 --> 01:32:22.770
just like that.

01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:28.856
This is an example of how the camera
is not just answering questions,

01:32:28.856 --> 01:32:33.172
but it is putting the answers
right where the questions are.

01:32:33.172 --> 01:32:34.882
And it's very exciting.

01:32:35.792 --> 01:32:38.201
So, Smart Text Selection,

01:32:38.201 --> 01:32:40.389
Style Match, real time results--

01:32:40.389 --> 01:32:43.342
all coming to Lens in the next few weeks.

01:32:43.342 --> 01:32:45.053
Please check them out.

01:32:45.053 --> 01:32:47.748
(applause)

01:32:51.562 --> 01:32:55.966
So, those are some examples
of how Google is applying AI in Camera

01:32:55.966 --> 01:32:58.143
to get things done in the world around you.

01:32:58.593 --> 01:33:03.208
When it comes to applying AI,
mapping, and computer vision

01:33:03.208 --> 01:33:05.972
to solving problems in the real world,

01:33:05.972 --> 01:33:09.818
well, it doesn't get more real
than self-driving cars.

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:11.446
So, to tell you all about it,

01:33:11.446 --> 01:33:16.427
please join me in welcoming
the CEO of Waymo, John Krafcik.

01:33:16.427 --> 01:33:17.437
Thank you.

01:33:17.437 --> 01:33:19.287
(applause)

01:33:19.287 --> 01:33:21.567
♪ (music) ♪

01:33:22.899 --> 01:33:24.170
Hello, everyone!

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:28.793
We're so delighted to join our friends
at Google on stage here today.

01:33:28.793 --> 01:33:31.200
And while this is my first time at Shoreline,

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:34.897
it actually isn't the first time
for our self-driving cars.

01:33:34.897 --> 01:33:36.973
You see, back in 2009,

01:33:36.973 --> 01:33:39.584
in the parking lot just outside this theater,

01:33:39.584 --> 01:33:43.826
some of the very first tests
of self-driving technology took place.

01:33:44.096 --> 01:33:47.690
It was right here
where a group of Google engineers,

01:33:47.690 --> 01:33:50.174
roboticists, and researchers

01:33:50.174 --> 01:33:52.293
set out on a crazy mission

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:55.189
to prove that cars
could actually drive themselves.

01:33:55.849 --> 01:33:58.502
Back then, most people thought 
that self-driving cars

01:33:58.502 --> 01:34:00.504
were nothing more than science fiction.

01:34:01.064 --> 01:34:03.130
But this dedicated team of dreamers

01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:07.338
believed that self-driving vehicles
could make transportation safer,

01:34:07.338 --> 01:34:10.362
easier, and more accessible for everyone.

01:34:11.042 --> 01:34:15.032
And so, the Google
Self-Driving Car Project was born.

01:34:15.032 --> 01:34:17.316
Now, fast-forward to 2018,

01:34:17.316 --> 01:34:19.363
and the Google Self-Driving Car Project

01:34:19.363 --> 01:34:23.876
is now its own, independent
Alphabet company called Waymo.

01:34:24.586 --> 01:34:27.631
And we've moved
well beyond tinkering and research.

01:34:28.081 --> 01:34:32.043
Today, Waymo is the only company in the world

01:34:32.043 --> 01:34:35.536
with a fleet of fully self-driving cars,

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:37.202
with no-one in the driver's seat

01:34:37.202 --> 01:34:38.428
on public roads.

01:34:39.218 --> 01:34:41.607
Now, members of the public
in Phoenix, Arizona,

01:34:41.607 --> 01:34:46.596
have already started to experience some
of these fully self-driving rides, too.

01:34:46.596 --> 01:34:47.782
Let's have a look.

01:34:48.602 --> 01:34:51.881
(man) Okay, Day One of self-driving.
Are you ready?

01:34:52.861 --> 01:34:53.832
Go!

01:34:53.832 --> 01:34:55.218
Oh, this is weird.

01:34:55.218 --> 01:34:56.753
(child laughing)

01:34:58.957 --> 01:35:00.607
This is the future. (laughing)

01:35:00.607 --> 01:35:04.252
Yeah, she was like,
"Is there no-one driving that car?"

01:35:04.252 --> 01:35:05.662
(woman laughing)

01:35:05.662 --> 01:35:07.759
I knew it! I was waiting for it.

01:35:07.759 --> 01:35:09.575
♪ (music) ♪

01:35:17.559 --> 01:35:21.260
(woman) You'd certainly never know that
there wasn't someone driving this car.

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:22.704
(man) Yo! Car!

01:35:23.124 --> 01:35:24.184
Selfie!

01:35:24.184 --> 01:35:25.568
Thank you, car.

01:35:25.568 --> 01:35:27.120
(giggles) Thank you, car.

01:35:28.961 --> 01:35:30.992
(applause)

01:35:31.602 --> 01:35:32.856
It's pretty cool.

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:38.218
All of these people are part of what
we call the Waymo Early Rider Program,

01:35:38.218 --> 01:35:40.744
where members of the public
use our self-driving cars

01:35:40.744 --> 01:35:42.199
in their daily lives.

01:35:42.199 --> 01:35:43.409
Over the last year,

01:35:43.409 --> 01:35:45.986
I've had a chance
to talk to some of these Early Riders

01:35:45.986 --> 01:35:48.564
and their stories
are actually pretty inspiring.

01:35:48.564 --> 01:35:50.426
One of our Early Riders, Neha,

01:35:50.426 --> 01:35:54.088
witnessed a tragic accident
when she was just a young teen,

01:35:54.088 --> 01:35:57.451
which scared her
into never getting her driver's license.

01:35:57.451 --> 01:36:00.444
But now, she takes a Waymo to work every day.

01:36:00.444 --> 01:36:02.094
And there's Jim and Barbara,

01:36:02.094 --> 01:36:05.432
who no longer have to worry
about losing their ability to get around

01:36:05.432 --> 01:36:07.022
as they grow older.

01:36:07.382 --> 01:36:09.118
Then, there's the Jackson family.

01:36:09.118 --> 01:36:12.348
Waymo helps them all
navigate their jam-packed schedules,

01:36:12.348 --> 01:36:15.287
taking Kyla and Joseph to and from school,

01:36:15.287 --> 01:36:17.805
practices and meetups with friends.

01:36:18.335 --> 01:36:21.046
So, it's not about science fiction.

01:36:21.426 --> 01:36:24.180
When we talk about
building self-driving technology,

01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:26.657
these are the people we're building it for.

01:36:27.387 --> 01:36:33.756
In 2018, self-driving cars are already
transforming the way they live and move.

01:36:34.326 --> 01:36:37.336
So, Phoenix will be the first stop

01:36:37.336 --> 01:36:39.711
for Waymo's Driverless
Transportation Service,

01:36:39.711 --> 01:36:41.547
which is launching later this year.

01:36:41.547 --> 01:36:46.148
Soon, everyone will be able 
to call Waymo, using our app,

01:36:46.148 --> 01:36:49.229
and a fully self-driving car will pull up,

01:36:49.229 --> 01:36:51.087
with no-one in the driver's seat,

01:36:51.087 --> 01:36:53.652
to whisk them away to their destination.

01:36:53.652 --> 01:36:55.146
And that's just the beginning.

01:36:55.146 --> 01:36:56.602
Because, at Waymo,

01:36:56.602 --> 01:36:59.478
we're not just building a better car.

01:36:59.478 --> 01:37:02.676
We're building a better driver.

01:37:02.676 --> 01:37:07.085
And that driver can be used
in all kinds of applications--

01:37:07.085 --> 01:37:09.981
ride hailing, logistics, personal cars,

01:37:09.981 --> 01:37:12.172
connecting people to public transportation.

01:37:12.662 --> 01:37:14.635
And we see our technology

01:37:14.635 --> 01:37:17.760
as an enabler
for all of these different industries.

01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:21.327
And we intend to partner
with lots of different companies

01:37:21.327 --> 01:37:24.794
to make this self-driving future
a reality for everyone.

01:37:25.684 --> 01:37:27.405
Now, we can enable this future

01:37:27.405 --> 01:37:30.838
because of the breakthroughs
and investments we've made in AI.

01:37:31.318 --> 01:37:32.828
Back in those early days,

01:37:32.828 --> 01:37:35.951
Google was, perhaps,
the only company in the world

01:37:35.951 --> 01:37:39.678
investing in both AI
and self-driving technology

01:37:39.678 --> 01:37:41.400
at the same time.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.779
So, when Google started making
major advances in machine learning,

01:37:44.779 --> 01:37:48.414
with speech recognition, computer vision,
image search, and more--

01:37:48.414 --> 01:37:51.451
Waymo was in a unique position to benefit.

01:37:51.451 --> 01:37:54.043
For example, back in 2013,

01:37:54.043 --> 01:37:56.216
we were looking for a breakthrough technology

01:37:56.216 --> 01:37:59.509
to help us with pedestrian detection.

01:37:59.509 --> 01:38:00.812
Luckily for us,

01:38:00.812 --> 01:38:04.460
Google was already deploying
a new technique called deep learning,

01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:07.737
a type of machine learning that allows you
to create neural networks,

01:38:07.737 --> 01:38:10.849
with multiple layers,
to solve more complex problems.

01:38:10.849 --> 01:38:14.953
So, our self-driving engineers
teamed up with researchers

01:38:14.953 --> 01:38:16.569
from the Google Brain team,

01:38:16.569 --> 01:38:18.999
and within a matter of months

01:38:18.999 --> 01:38:24.317
we reduced the error rate
for detecting pedestrians by 100x.

01:38:24.317 --> 01:38:27.915
That's right-- not 100%, but a hundred times.

01:38:28.915 --> 01:38:30.788
- And today...
- (applause)

01:38:30.788 --> 01:38:32.048
Thanks.

01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:37.898
Today, AI plays an even greater role
in our self-driving system,

01:38:37.898 --> 01:38:40.740
unlocking our ability
to go truly self-driving.

01:38:41.410 --> 01:38:43.131
To tell you more
about how machine learning

01:38:43.131 --> 01:38:47.037
makes Waymo the safe and skilled driver
that you see on the road today,

01:38:47.037 --> 01:38:49.776
I'd like to introduce you to Dmitri. Thanks.

01:38:49.776 --> 01:38:52.162
♪ (music) ♪

01:38:52.162 --> 01:38:55.162
(applause)

01:38:58.006 --> 01:39:01.170
Good morning, everyone.
It's great to be here.

01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:04.721
Now, at Waymo,
AI touches every part of our system,

01:39:04.721 --> 01:39:07.852
from perception to prediction
to decision-making to mapping,

01:39:07.852 --> 01:39:09.252
and so much more.

01:39:09.702 --> 01:39:12.007
To be a capable and safe driver,

01:39:12.007 --> 01:39:16.029
our cars need a deep semantic
understanding of the world around them.

01:39:16.029 --> 01:39:18.824
Our vehicles need to understand
and classify objects,

01:39:18.824 --> 01:39:21.409
interpret their movements,
reason about intent,

01:39:21.409 --> 01:39:23.584
and predict what they will do in the future.

01:39:23.584 --> 01:39:25.159
They need to understand

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:28.145
how each object
interacts with everything else.

01:39:28.145 --> 01:39:31.472
And, finally, our cars need 
to use all that information

01:39:31.472 --> 01:39:33.809
to act in a safe and predictable manner.

01:39:33.809 --> 01:39:34.982
So, needless to say,

01:39:34.982 --> 01:39:37.993
there's a lot that goes 
into building a self-driving car.

01:39:37.993 --> 01:39:40.926
And today I want to tell you about two areas

01:39:40.926 --> 01:39:43.437
where AI has made a huge impact--

01:39:43.437 --> 01:39:45.977
perception and prediction.

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:48.378
So, first perception.

01:39:48.378 --> 01:39:51.354
Detecting and classifying objects
is a key part of driving.

01:39:51.354 --> 01:39:53.883
Pedestrians, in particular,
pose a unique challenge

01:39:53.883 --> 01:39:57.402
because they come in all kinds of shapes,
postures, and sizes.

01:39:57.402 --> 01:39:59.815
So, for example, here's a construction worker

01:39:59.815 --> 01:40:01.337
peeking out of a manhole,

01:40:01.337 --> 01:40:03.006
with most of his body obscured.

01:40:03.956 --> 01:40:07.468
Here's a pedestrian crossing the street,
concealed by a plank of wood.

01:40:07.928 --> 01:40:09.188
And here...

01:40:09.188 --> 01:40:13.139
we have pedestrians who are dressed
in inflatable dinosaur costumes.

01:40:13.139 --> 01:40:15.169
(laughter)

01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:18.034
Now, we haven't taught our cars
about the Jurassic period,

01:40:18.034 --> 01:40:20.107
but can still classify them correctly.

01:40:20.107 --> 01:40:22.435
We can detect and classify these pedestrians

01:40:22.435 --> 01:40:24.275
because we apply deep nets

01:40:24.275 --> 01:40:26.280
to a combination of sensory data.

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.535
Traditionally, in computer vision,

01:40:28.535 --> 01:40:32.157
neural networks are used
just in camera images and video.

01:40:32.157 --> 01:40:35.044
But our cars have a lot more
than just cameras.

01:40:35.044 --> 01:40:38.735
We also have lasers
to measure distance and shapes of objects,

01:40:38.735 --> 01:40:40.796
and radars to measure their speed.

01:40:40.796 --> 01:40:44.487
And, by applying machine learning
to this combination of sensor data,

01:40:44.487 --> 01:40:48.559
we can accurately detect pedestrians
in all forms, in real time.

01:40:50.069 --> 01:40:54.670
A second area where machine learning
has been incredibly powerful for Waymo

01:40:54.670 --> 01:40:57.072
is predicting how people
will behave on the road.

01:40:57.572 --> 01:41:01.949
Now, sometimes, people do
exactly what you expect them to,

01:41:01.949 --> 01:41:04.433
and, sometimes, they don't.

01:41:04.433 --> 01:41:06.918
Take this example
of a car running a red light.

01:41:14.619 --> 01:41:17.588
Unfortunately, we see this kind of thing
more than we'd like.

01:41:17.588 --> 01:41:20.673
But let me break this down
from the car's point of view.

01:41:20.673 --> 01:41:23.557
Our car is about to proceed
straight through an intersection.

01:41:23.557 --> 01:41:25.446
We have a clear green light,

01:41:25.446 --> 01:41:27.631
and cross traffic
is stopped with a red light.

01:41:28.511 --> 01:41:30.508
But, just as we enter the intersection,

01:41:30.508 --> 01:41:34.699
all the way in the right corner,
we see a vehicle coming fast.

01:41:34.699 --> 01:41:37.466
Our models understand
that this is unusual behavior

01:41:37.466 --> 01:41:40.010
for a vehicle that should be decelerating.

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:42.214
We predict the car will run the red light.

01:41:42.214 --> 01:41:44.869
So, we preemptively slow down--

01:41:44.869 --> 01:41:47.196
which you can see here with this red fence--

01:41:47.196 --> 01:41:50.294
and this gives the red light runner
room to pass in front of us

01:41:50.294 --> 01:41:53.212
while it barely avoids
hitting another vehicle.

01:41:53.992 --> 01:41:55.674
We can detect this kind of anomaly

01:41:55.674 --> 01:41:59.446
because we've trained our ML models
using lots of examples.

01:42:00.013 --> 01:42:04.401
Today, our fleet has self-driven
more than 6 million miles

01:42:04.401 --> 01:42:05.591
on public roads,

01:42:05.591 --> 01:42:09.146
which means we've seen hundreds
of millions of real world interactions.

01:42:09.466 --> 01:42:13.428
To put that in perspective,
we drive more miles each day

01:42:13.428 --> 01:42:16.077
than the average American drives in a year.

01:42:17.387 --> 01:42:20.268
Now, it takes more than good algorithms

01:42:20.268 --> 01:42:22.257
to build a self-driving car.

01:42:22.257 --> 01:42:24.861
We also need really powerful infrastructure.

01:42:25.271 --> 01:42:28.104
And, at Waymo,
we use the TensorFlow ecosystem

01:42:28.104 --> 01:42:30.739
and Google's data centers, including TPUs,

01:42:30.739 --> 01:42:32.286
to train our neural networks.

01:42:32.946 --> 01:42:35.691
And with TPUs, we can now train our nets

01:42:35.691 --> 01:42:37.973
up to 15 times more efficiently.

01:42:38.743 --> 01:42:40.862
We also use this powerful infrastructure

01:42:40.862 --> 01:42:43.737
to validate our models in simulation.

01:42:43.737 --> 01:42:45.763
And in this virtual world,

01:42:45.763 --> 01:42:49.555
we're driving the equivalent of 25,000 cars

01:42:49.555 --> 01:42:51.428
all day, every day.

01:42:51.918 --> 01:42:56.662
All told, we've driven
more than 5 billion miles in simulation.

01:42:57.552 --> 01:42:58.919
And with this kind of scale,

01:42:58.919 --> 01:43:02.033
both in training
and validation of our models,

01:43:02.033 --> 01:43:05.104
we can quickly and efficiently
teach our cars new skills.

01:43:05.714 --> 01:43:08.389
And one skill we started to tackle

01:43:08.389 --> 01:43:10.760
is self-driving in difficult weather,

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:13.508
such as snow, as you see here.

01:43:13.508 --> 01:43:14.848
(applause)

01:43:14.848 --> 01:43:16.746
And today, for the first time,

01:43:16.746 --> 01:43:18.898
I want to show you a behind-the-scenes look

01:43:18.898 --> 01:43:21.664
at what it's like for our cars
to self-drive in snow.

01:43:22.664 --> 01:43:25.511
This is what our car sees
before we apply any filtering.

01:43:25.511 --> 01:43:26.834
(laughter)

01:43:26.834 --> 01:43:28.530
Driving in a snowstorm can be tough

01:43:28.530 --> 01:43:31.505
because snowflakes
can create a lot of noise for our sensors.

01:43:31.905 --> 01:43:35.521
But when we apply
machine learning to this data,

01:43:35.521 --> 01:43:37.182
this is what our car sees.

01:43:37.542 --> 01:43:40.929
We can clearly identify
each of these vehicles,

01:43:40.929 --> 01:43:42.917
even through all of the sensor noise.

01:43:43.127 --> 01:43:46.118
And the quicker we can unlock
these types of advanced capabilities,

01:43:46.118 --> 01:43:48.317
the quicker
we can bring our self-driving cars

01:43:48.317 --> 01:43:50.023
to more cities around the world,

01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:51.873
and to a city near you.

01:43:51.873 --> 01:43:54.488
We can't wait to make our self-driving cars

01:43:54.488 --> 01:43:56.332
available to more people,

01:43:56.332 --> 01:43:57.779
moving us closer to a future

01:43:57.779 --> 01:44:02.413
where roads are safer, easier
and more accessible for everyone.

01:44:02.413 --> 01:44:03.758
Thanks, everyone.

01:44:03.758 --> 01:44:06.052
(applause)

01:44:10.972 --> 01:44:13.422
Now, please join me in welcoming back Jen

01:44:13.422 --> 01:44:15.330
to close out the morning session.

01:44:15.330 --> 01:44:17.071
♪ (music) ♪

01:44:21.511 --> 01:44:22.566
Thanks, Dmitri.

01:44:22.866 --> 01:44:25.927
It's a great reminder of how AI
can play a role in helping people

01:44:25.927 --> 01:44:27.763
in new ways all the time.

01:44:28.623 --> 01:44:32.206
I started at Google as an engineering intern

01:44:32.206 --> 01:44:33.749
almost 19 years ago.

01:44:34.179 --> 01:44:38.662
And what struck me from almost
the very first day I walked in the door,

01:44:38.662 --> 01:44:42.824
was the commitment to push the boundaries

01:44:42.824 --> 01:44:45.183
and what was possible with technology,

01:44:45.183 --> 01:44:49.014
combined with a deep focus
on building products

01:44:49.014 --> 01:44:51.997
that had a real impact on people lives.

01:44:52.707 --> 01:44:55.173
And, as the years have passed,
I've seen, time and again,

01:44:55.173 --> 01:44:58.346
how technology
can play a really transformative role,

01:44:58.346 --> 01:45:00.924
from the earliest days
of things like Search and Maps,

01:45:00.924 --> 01:45:03.201
to new experiences,
like the Google Assistant.

01:45:03.601 --> 01:45:07.545
As I look at the Google of today,
I see those same early values

01:45:07.545 --> 01:45:09.053
alive and well.

01:45:09.963 --> 01:45:11.390
We continue to work hard,

01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:13.042
together with all of you,

01:45:13.042 --> 01:45:15.640
to build products for everyone,

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:17.693
and products that matter.

01:45:18.433 --> 01:45:21.537
We constantly aspire
to raise the bar for ourselves even higher

01:45:21.537 --> 01:45:24.571
and to contribute to the world and to society

01:45:24.571 --> 01:45:26.773
in a responsible way.

01:45:26.773 --> 01:45:29.577
Now, we know
that to truly build for everyone,

01:45:29.577 --> 01:45:32.466
we need lots of perspectives in the mix.

01:45:32.466 --> 01:45:34.531
And so that's why we broadened I/O this year

01:45:34.531 --> 01:45:37.104
to include an even wider range of voices.

01:45:37.104 --> 01:45:40.511
We've invited additional speakers
over the next three days

01:45:40.511 --> 01:45:43.927
to talk to you all about the broader role
that technology can play

01:45:43.927 --> 01:45:46.379
in everything
from promoting digital wellbeing,

01:45:46.379 --> 01:45:50.604
to empowering NGOs to achieve their missions,

01:45:50.604 --> 01:45:51.656
along with, of course,

01:45:51.656 --> 01:45:54.790
the hundreds of technical talks
that you've come to expect from us at I/O

01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:57.446
and that we hope
you can enjoy and learn from as well.

01:45:58.186 --> 01:46:00.334
Welcome to I/O 2018.
