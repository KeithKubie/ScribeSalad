00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.350
Although this example may appear to be
abstract, it is actually quite realistic

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.390
because it is similar to many
real world APT instances.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.530
In this example, the CEO gets
an email with a PDF attachment

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.210
showing pie charts of sales activities.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.640
When he opens the PDF document
inside browser, for example, so

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.770
that he can use the Acrobat Reader
plug in to view the document,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.540
the crafted attack data embedded in the
PDF document would cause a zero exploit

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.890
that broke out the plug in sand box in
a browser and compromised the browser.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.800
In a detail of such attack can be for
example a buffer overflow attack that

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.750
lead to control flow hijacking and
taking over the browser.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.510
Then the injected attack code will
download a malicious browser extension.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.625
Record that a malicious browser
extension is the malware embedded within

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:53.070
the browser.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.910
&gt;From this point on, each time the CEO
send an email to his employees

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.020
with an attachment, for
example a PDF document,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.120
the malicious browser extension
would infect the attachments.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.630
Eventually, the malware gets
on the computer of a user

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.690
who has admin privilege of
the company's server, and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.760
therefore the malware can
steal the credentials

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.300
that will lead the malware into
access into the companies servers.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.310
&gt;From this point on,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.010
the malware can then steal the most
valuable data from the company.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.400
This example captures a number
of key characteristics of APTs.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.740
Fist, the users, including the system
admins do not realize that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.420
their computers and
their network have been compromised.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.410
Second, the APT activities blend
in with normal user activity.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.379
For example, the APT does not
just send email by itself,

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:44.830
it only modifies emails sent by the CEO.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.770
Third, it takes its time in or
to get to the key individual and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.440
steal his credentials.
