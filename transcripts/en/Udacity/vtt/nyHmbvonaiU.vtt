00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well let's start by thinking about position 3.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
When the mass is way back here as far away from equilibrium as it's going to go

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
it has only potential energy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
All the energy is stored in the spring for an instant the block stops moving

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
before it changes direction making the kinetic energy 0.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's turn to position 1 next where here the spring isn't stretched out.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's at equilibrium. X is 0, so there can be any potential energy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So what happened to all the potential energy that was storing the spring back here?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, it must've been converted to kinetic energy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
At position 2, midway between positions 1 and 3,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I know the spring is stretched somewhat so it has potential energy

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but it's not as stretched as much as it was at position 3.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So some of that potential energy must've also been converted

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to the energy of motion, kinetic energy. So these are the answers.
