So far, we've discussed one theory of how to change someone's attitudes. And

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.377
that's through persuasion. However, there's another theory that explains how

00:00:07.377 --> 00:00:11.990
and why we change our attitudes. And that's the theory of cognitive dissonance.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.340
Cognitive dissonance is the feelings of discomfort we get when we're presented

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.440
with information that is inconsistent with how we perceive ourselves as a

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.520
sensible, reasonable, human being. Let's go to Susan for some more details

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.323
