00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.452
Ideally, we want to test more people. That will give us a better indicator of

00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:09.130
whether or not the drugs are effective. We also want to give each drug to very

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.440
similar groups of people. This is why we randomize. And we also want to test a

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.860
large dose of the medication, because we really want to see how that will

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.904
effect the subject rather than other factors. Larger samples result in higher

00:00:23.904 --> 00:00:29.580
power. Remember the standard error of the mean? When n increases, the standard

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.262
error decreases. Lower within group variability also leads to higher power. We

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:39.420
can be more sure of significant differences when the distributions aren't

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.189
overlapping. However, if the variability increases, Its harder to tell if

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:50.792
there's a signficant difference. And finally, choosing treatments with strong

00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:55.837
effects sizes will increase power. To do this you can make treatment conditions

00:00:55.837 --> 00:00:59.863
last longer, make them occur more often, the treatments could just have strong

00:00:59.863 --> 00:01:06.219
effects. Or you can make the treatment conditions last longer, make them more

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.344
intense make them occur more often etc. These are all ways to detect whether or

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:13.640
not theirs a signifcant difference.
