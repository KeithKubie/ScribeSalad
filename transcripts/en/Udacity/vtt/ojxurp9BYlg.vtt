00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.884
Okay Michael so here's the little trick. So all I've done is I

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:09.810
have replaces the equation at the top with an alternate version of the equation.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.068
&gt;&gt; 'Kay. So it looks there's, you're now exponentially blowing up the reward.

00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:18.198
&gt;&gt; I am not exponentially blowing up the reward.

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:20.200
Instead of what I've done. Is I've added of

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.700
the see, the rewards that I'm going to see. For

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.450
the states that I'm going to see. And I multiplied

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.530
by gamma to the T. The gamma is between 0 and 1.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.080
&gt;&gt; I see. So...

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.360
&gt;&gt; Do you?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.200
&gt;&gt; Well, kind of. So, so it

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.918
doesn't exponentially blow up. It exponencially implodes.

00:00:38.918 --> 00:00:40.001
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.180
&gt;&gt; So, so things that are like a thousand steps in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.470
the future If we multiply, if we take something that's less

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.410
than 1 and we raise it to that power, it goes

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.610
essentially to 0. So it's like it starts off the rewards

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.530
are kind of substantial and then they get, they trail off quickly.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.600
&gt;&gt; Right. And in fact we can write down mathmatically what this is If

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.700
you actually, if you stare at it

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.950
long enough and you remembered your intermediate algebra

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.110
or your calculus or wherever it is

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.190
you learned this stuff. You would probably recognize

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.430
this as a special kind of sequence or series. Do you remember what it is?

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.085
&gt;&gt; Television series?

00:01:14.085 --> 00:01:15.093
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:15.640
&gt;&gt; No, but that's

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.110
remarkably close. So let's see if we can

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.540
bound this particular equation. So we know that

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.910
this version of the equation eventually ends up

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.210
being infinity if all the rewards are positive. Right?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.641
&gt;&gt; Mm, hm-mm.

00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:30.710
&gt;&gt; So what does this end up being even in the case where all

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.910
the rewards are positive? Well, we can bound this from above by the largest

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.560
reward that we will ever see, in the following way. So all I've then

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.690
is said well I don't know what the rewards are but there is some

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.180
maximum reward I'm going to call it Rmax. And if I pretended that I always

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.750
got the Rmax reward. So long as that, as long as that's an actual number.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.650
A finite number. I know that this is bounded from above by this expression.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.450
Well what does this look like. Maybe this does look like a series you remember.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.040
&gt;&gt; Geometric series?

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.520
&gt;&gt; Yes. This is the geometric series. And this is exactly equal to this. .

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.000
&gt;&gt; And I assume that the summation

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.880
causes the max to become lower case.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.430
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes it does. That's a, that's a trick that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.880
they don't really go over deeply in calculus, but it's true.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.290
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's cool. Alright so, the reward, the maximum reward

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.855
divided by 1 minus gamma. So when gamma is really close to

00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:23.450
0, you're just getting, oh you're getting just that one reward

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.770
in the beginning and then everything falls off to nothing after that.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.210
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.380
&gt;&gt; And if gamma is really close to 1. You're

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.540
dividing by something that's teeny tiny, which actually is like multiplying

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.080
it by something that's really big. So it kind

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.320
of magnifies the reward out, but it's not infinity

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.670
until gamma get's all the way up to 1

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.130
and that's the same case we were in before.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.370
&gt;&gt; Right, so in fact you'll notice the way I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.590
wrote this, gamma has to be between 0 and 1, 0

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.260
inclusive but strictly less than 1. If I made it so

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.370
that it could include 1, well that's actually the first case.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.640
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.280
&gt;&gt; Because 1 to a power is always 1, and so,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.900
this is actually a generalization of the sort of, infinite

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.340
sum of rewards. This is called discounted rewards, or discounted

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.600
series, or discounted sums, and it allows us, it turns

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.260
out, to go an infinite distance in finite time. Wait.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.870
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.040
&gt;&gt; No. No. [LAUGH] An infinite distance?

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's at least the way I like

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.530
to think about it. So, if we're discounted in

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.550
this particular way, then that gives us a

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.410
geometric series. And what it does is it allows

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.640
us to add an infinite number of numbers,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.160
but it actually gives us a finite number. Cool.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.030
&gt;&gt; So this means we can still have our, and it

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.710
turns out, by the way, just to be clear, that this

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.640
world that we're in. Where we are in between 0 and

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.080
1, 0 inclusive is still consistent with our infinite horizons and

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.390
our stationarity over preferences. So we can add things together

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.930
and be consistent with those assumptions we were making before Or

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.540
we can do discounted rewards and we're still going to be consistent

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.340
with what we're doing before. But the difference between this case

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.110
and this case is that by doing the discount, we

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.590
get to add infinite sequences and still get something finite. The

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.080
intuition here is that Since, if gamma's less than 1, then

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.470
eventually as you raise it to a power, it will basically

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.050
become 0. I mean, that's why it's a

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.420
geometric series. Which is like having a finite horizon.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.529
But that horizon is always the same finite distance

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.270
away, no matter what, where you are in time.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.080
&gt;&gt; Which means it's effectively infinite.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.330
&gt;&gt; Or unbounded, or however you want to think about it. So it's

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.100
like you take a step, but you're no closer than where, when you started.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.640
&gt;&gt; Right, so, what does that mean in, a world

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.480
where you meant to say you're no closer than where

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.470
you were trying to end up? So that means that

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.510
even though, you've taken a step forward, the horizon sort

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.940
of remains a fixed distance away from where you are.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.710
&gt;&gt; Mmm, mmhmm.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.010
&gt;&gt; That's what it means to To, to have this kind of this

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.460
gamma value here and so you can still treat it as if it's always

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.180
going to be infinite, even though it gives you a finite value, and that

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.690
gives you your stationary. So does that make sense? I mean that's sort of

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.330
the intuition.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.990
&gt;&gt; You really are have an in, you're

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.640
always in infinite, It's always in, infinity. But the

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.540
gamma value means that at any given point in

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.780
time, you only really have to think about what

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.590
amounts to a finite distance. You never get closer

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.100
to the horizon, even though you're always taking steps

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.880
towards it. But there still is a horizon that

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.750
you can see, and I can kill that analogy.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.910
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So can we, can you explain to me why

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.740
it has this form, this R max over 1 minus gamma?

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.500
&gt;&gt; I could. There's a You can kind of prove that, in a little

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.640
cute math way, and I'm happy to take that diversion if you want.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. I mean, unless,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.720
unless you were going to tell me something else.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.980
&gt;&gt; Well how about I tell you something else and then I take that diversion?

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.370
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.320
&gt;&gt; Okay, so here's the something else. In

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.360
the beginning I said, well, this is like going

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.120
in infinite amount of distance in finite time, which

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.479
you rebelled against. And my explanation is more about.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.650
How infinity looks finite which is not

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.880
the same thing as going an infinite amount

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.410
of distance in finite time. The reason

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.020
I said that is beacuse of the sningularity.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.320
&gt;&gt; What?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.010
&gt;&gt; The singularity so, some of our listeners no doubt

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.720
have heard of the singularity. You never heard of the singularity?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.490
&gt;&gt; The singularity is like when computers

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.580
get so fast that you do infinite computation

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.840
and, oh. Right. So the singularity, for those of you who don't know is is

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.650
this sort of observation that has been made by

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.530
many folks. That the sort of limit to computer

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.940
power growing faster is the fact that it takes us amount, some amount of time to

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.310
design the next generation of computers. Right, So

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.120
Moore's law says everything doubles you know, everything

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.130
6, 18 months or whatever. But if we

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.980
could design things faster, then we could actually make

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.290
it double more quickly. So, one day we'll get

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.790
to the point where the computer, which I will

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.620
draw here, like that. The computer can actually design

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.910
the next generation of computer. Well, when it designs the

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.520
next generation of computer, that computer will also have

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.360
the ability to design the next generation of computer.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.880
But it will be able to design it twice

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.060
as fast. And then the next one will be able

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.290
to design its next successor twice as fast, and so on and so forth. So

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.770
this little time between generations, will keep Having

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.550
every single time, which looks remarkably like a

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.420
geometric sequence. And so once we reach this

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.670
point, where the computer can actually design its

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.250
successor, we will then be able to do

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.876
an infinite number of successors. In finite time.

00:07:35.876 --> 00:07:37.223
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:38.960
&gt;&gt; And that's when the world comes to and end.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.580
And that's what's called the singularity. Because we can't understand

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.740
what happens after that point. So that's what I mean

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.760
by going an infinite amount of distance in finite time.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.810
&gt;&gt; It just doesn't seem like distance.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.100
But, yeah, that's a weird example, for sure.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.350
&gt;&gt; I think it makes sense.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.652
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] infinite number of doublings in it. Yeah, [INAUDIBLE],

00:07:57.652 --> 00:08:02.420
no. [LAUGH] Well, we'll, we'll, we'll do we'll do some assignment

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.100
where we allow people to decide whether this

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.820
makes sense or one of your analogies make

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.120
sense. And I'll just remind the listener that

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.670
I'm the one who'll be assigning final grades.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.130
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.400
&gt;&gt; So with that let's go and do your little diversion.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.860
And and then we'll come back to. Doing a whole lot

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.250
of math. So I actually think this little nice diversion will

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.330
be warmup to all the math we're going to be doing. Okay?

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.200
&gt;&gt; Oooh. Hm. More math.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:25.890
&gt;&gt; Hm.
