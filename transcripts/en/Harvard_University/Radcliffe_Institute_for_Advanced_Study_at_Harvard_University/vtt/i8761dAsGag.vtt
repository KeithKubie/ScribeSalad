00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.880
- The idea for this
installation first came to me

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.430
when I was participating
in the winter

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.860
session for this competition.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.650
And I remember being in
the Schlesinger Library

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.180
and being shown historic
maps of the Radcliffe campus

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.390
and finding myself attracted
to the buildings that

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.020
are no longer here and what
their stories might have been.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.860
That fascination
with lost structures

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.530
was the key motivator
to incorporate them

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.750
into this public space
as part of the design.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.890
My name is John Wang.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.170
I was a senior in Harvard
College when I submitted

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.726
for the Radcliffe Institute
Public Art competition,

00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:58.100
and I am now a
first year student

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.808
in the Harvard Graduate
School of Design,

00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:00.730
studying architecture.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.940
It was a really unbelievable
experience almost

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.640
to find out that I
won the competition

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.560
as an undergraduate.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.570
It was a school-wide
competition,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.460
and there were a lot
of different proposals.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.040
It was really exciting for me
to take the idea from my mind,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.420
to paper, to presentations,
and then finally, to reality.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.030
Just being able to
bring an idea to life

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.981
and share it with the public is
a really incredible experience.

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:35.336
The plants are rosemary,
the Russian sage,

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:37.220
with the lavender.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.500
A large part of the
project was predicated

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.600
on these historic footprints.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.300
But as I was working
through design,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.930
I realized I also wanted this to
really be a lively public space

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.680
that people would come and
have it and make it their own.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.590
Radcliffe being a scholarly
kind of exchange environment,

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.300
this could be a place
for conversations.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.440
Maybe people in the area would
come here and they would picnic

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.000
or they would have
lunch on the site.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.870
And so, now that
it's here, it really

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.110
excites me to see how
people would come and use

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.890
this installation.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.640
