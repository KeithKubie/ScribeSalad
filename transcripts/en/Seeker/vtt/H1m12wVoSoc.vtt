This Dnews episode is brought to you by Domain.com

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:06.830
The Holidays are a time when we show generosity
towards strangers and loved ones alike by

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.000
giving them the perfect gift.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.690
And science says we suck at it.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.170
Hey there everyone, Julian here for DNews,
lets wrap about presents.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.470
Gifts have become the standard for expressing
love this time of year.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.650
They’re like a tangible way of showing how
well you know someone.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.360
But the problem is apparently we don’t seem
to get good gifts, even if we truly do know

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.800
someone like a brother.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.410
Except I don’t know my brother at all.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.749
Sorry for all the crappy gifts, Alex.

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:38.640
The Society of Personality and Social Psychology
released a study on Monday that said sometimes

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.100
we give gifts that are tailored to a person’s
traits.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.769
Sounds like it would be a good thing, but
according to the researchers Mary Steffel,

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.949
Elanor Williams, and Robyn Laboeuf it can
be disappointing or not very useful for the

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:49.949
recipients.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.030
They noticed that gift cards to specific stores
tend to go unused for much longer than cards

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.379
that can be redeemed anywhere.

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.499
Instead they recommend giving more flexible
gifts or something that focuses on a person’s

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.219
current needs than their more stable traits.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.710
Like I love astronomy and would definitely
appreciate a toy telescope, but I really need

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.550
like, a thousand dollars right now.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.420
I fell in with a bad crowd, don’t ask.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.640
Of course, you might think making it clear
you’re picky would get you exactly what

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.320
you want, and according to the SPSP report,
you’re right.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.259
That is, if you get a gift at all.

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.500
Usually when someone shops for a picky recipient,
they actually put less effort into the gift.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.840
They usually just get a gift card or forgo
getting something altogether.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.439
So you’re more likely to get a gift you’ll
use if you’re picky, but you’ll probably

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.710
receive fewer gifts.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530
Also, c’mon, don’t be a jerk.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.289
Be grateful someone was thinking of you.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.750
So what’s the best gift to really show someone
you care and strengthen a relationship?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.880
As it turns out, it’s probably not an object,
but an experience.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.359
Researchers Cindy Chan and Cassie Mogilner
found that when an experiential gift is consumed,

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.420
it evokes a strong emotional response in the
recipient.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.219
And they don’t even have to share the experience
with the gift giver, so they’re the perfect

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.039
gift for when you want to get closer to someone
without spending time with them.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.119
While a great gift might only slightly strengthen
a relationship, a bad gift is a great way

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.289
to damage it.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.340
Chastity talks about the science behind that
down here.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.160
So would you prefer a material gift or an
experience?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.660
I know I’d love tickets to a hockey game…
hint hint.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.420
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
