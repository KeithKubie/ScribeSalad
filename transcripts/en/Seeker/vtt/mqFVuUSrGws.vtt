00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670
SUBJECT: This is the largest
movable structure ever built.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.400
It's taller than the
Statue of Liberty,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.490
longer than two jumbo jets, and
nearly three times the weight

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.780
of the Eiffel Tower.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.180
This mega structure is
the engineering feat

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.100
of an architect's dreams.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.295
And beneath it is a
radioactive nightmare.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.000
In 1986, a surge of power
destroyed one of the reactors

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.890
at Chernobyl
nuclear power plant,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.250
leaving behind a toxic disaster.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.820
An extreme amount
of radiation was

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.350
leaking into the environment,
and by extreme amount,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.490
I mean like 400 times more
than the radioactive fallout

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.000
that followed the atomic
blast in Hiroshima, Japan.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.180
About 200 people were
hospitalized immediately.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.100
More than two
dozen of them died.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.560
And at least 150,000
nearby residents

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.450
were forced to
leave their homes.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.850
At the time, the long-term
effects of the radiation

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.190
exposure were still unknown.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.410
To make matters worse,
because of weather patterns,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.780
radiation from the
Chernobyl disaster

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.004
spread across the region
and far into Western Europe.

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:02.670
And what remained at
the Chernobyl plant

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.960
was close to 200 tons of nuclear
fuel and radioactive elements

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.690
emitting lethal
amounts of radiation.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.120
So engineers had
to act fast to keep

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.070
more radiation from spreading.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.840
In an effort to contain
the power plant,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.450
an army of workers known,
as the liquidators,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.350
started constructing a tomb.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.180
The liquidators
worked day and night

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.000
to contain the worst of the
radiation inside the reactor.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.030
And then they built a
concrete steel sarcophagus

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.310
around the whole building.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.360
It took 206 days, and more than
half a million liquidators, who

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.450
wore little to no protection.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.250
The structure was only meant
to last 20 to 30 years.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.550
And the tomb was never
successfully sealed,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.620
so there was no
way to protect it

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.990
from the corrosion and
environmental damage that

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.264
happens with anything
that's outside.

00:01:51.264 --> 00:01:52.680
If the structure
were to collapse,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.140
it's believed that a
radioactive dust cloud would

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.450
be ejected into the atmosphere.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.460
And that sort of fallout
would be devastating

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.280
not only for Ukraine and
the surrounding countries,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.240
but potentially for
the entire planet.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.340
To really understand how
devastating it could be,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.710
we need to dive into
some nuclear physics.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.400
Spent or used nuclear fuel, like
the kind inside the Chernobyl

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.280
plant, consists primarily
of uranium, plutonium,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.490
fission products, and
minor transuranic elements.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.010
Some of the most significant
fission products or radioactive

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.500
isotopes released during
the Chernobyl disaster

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.760
were Iodine-131,
Cesium-137, Strontium-90,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.980
and Plutonium-241.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.500
These isotopes can
take lifetimes to decay

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.450
and then be considered harmless.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.220
The rate at which
they decay is measured

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.080
by their half-life,
which is the time it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.640
takes for a
radioactive substance

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.010
to lose half its radioactivity.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.690
Now Iodine-131 decays
in a matter of days.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.810
And Cesium-137 and Strontium-90
have half lives about 30 years.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.870
The real problem child
is Plutonium-241.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.500
While this isotope has a
half-life of only 14 years,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.930
the isotopes that are
formed during its decay

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.670
are terrifying.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.430
It decays into
Americium-241, which has

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.250
a half-life of about 432 years.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.440
And then Americium-241
breaks down

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.940
into Neptunium-237, an
incredibly stable isotope,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.710
which sounds good, but it's bad.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.114
It has a staggering half-life
of 2.14 million years.

00:03:23.114 --> 00:03:25.530
Essentially, this means that
if the old structure covering

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.440
Chernobyl were to collapse,
our planet would probably never

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.240
recover from the fallout.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.310
Since this would be an
international disaster,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.620
it needed an
international solution.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.240
So more than 40
different countries,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.490
along with engineers,
architects, and financiers,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.020
stepped in and contributed
to Plan B, B as in big,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.150
really, really big.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.920
The New Safe Confinement,
or NSC, as it's called,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.090
is large enough to entomb the
old Chernobyl sarcophagus.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.460
The massive arch is
made of multiple layers

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.650
of rustproof stainless
steel, and it's

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.440
designed to withstand
extreme temperatures and even

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.180
natural disasters.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.400
The space between the
inner and outer cladding

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.900
is incredibly important.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.090
It holds a complex
ventilation system

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.790
which regulates humidity,
temperature, and pressure.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.550
And that will prevent corrosion
and keep radioactive dust

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.230
from escaping the structure.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.120
One of the greatest
challenges was deciding

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.310
where to build this giant tomb.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.980
Because of the radiation
leaking from the damaged plant,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.400
the structure couldn't be
constructed directly over it.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.840
So to keep workers safe, they
built the NSC in two halves

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.420
300 meters away from
the power plant.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.700
And this is where the major
engineering feat comes in,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.640
because the arch needed to
be moved over the reactor.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.240
And moving a 35,000-ton
structure has never been done

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.260
before.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.990
Each of the halves were
lifted at separate times

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.760
and moved onto
specialized rails.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.280
Once they were
connected, the arch

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.950
then inched its
way very carefully

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.170
over the existing sarcophagus.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.230
Now the challenge is to
seal this giant tomb, which

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.140
is expected to be
completed by late 2017.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.800
And then remotely operated
cranes inside the arch

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.700
will begin dismantling the
unstable old sarcophagus.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.350
The New Safe
Confinement is expected

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.810
to last at least
the next 100 years,

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.254
but damage from the Chernobyl
disaster is irreversible.

00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:14.670
Today we're starting
to understand

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.310
the human cost of
nuclear fallout,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.210
as cancer rates and
other health impairments

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.649
rise among people exposed
to Chernobyl's radiation.

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:23.190
While this feat of
engineering showed

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.070
what could be accomplished when
faced with one of the worst

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.440
disasters in human
history, capping

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.410
a radioactive catastrophe
is not a permanent solution.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.020
Let's not forget those
radioactive isotopes will still

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.808
be decaying for millions
of years to come.

00:05:37.808 --> 00:05:39.120
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.640
Once the original Chernobyl
sarcophagus is dismantled,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.130
the radioactive waste will
be removed from the site.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.680
To find out where
radioactive waste is stored,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.830
check out this video.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.038
