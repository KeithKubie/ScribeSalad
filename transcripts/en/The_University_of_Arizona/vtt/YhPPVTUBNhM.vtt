 On Veterans Day, I would
like to recognize and thank

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.520
our nearly 1800 veterans
who are students,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.660
faculty members, and staff
at the University of Arizona.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.370
 Thank you so much
for your service.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.550
 Thanks for your service.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.340
 From me, and from
the OSIRIS-REx team,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.012
thank you very much
for your service.

00:00:17.012 --> 00:00:18.220
 Thank you for your service.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.928
 To all who have
served or are currently

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:23.250
serving in the military, we'd
like to welcome you to U of A.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.290
You bring unique experiences
to the rest of the students

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.340
and a level of maturity
that is unparalleled.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.310
 So on this Veterans
Day, from all of us

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.180
at the University of Arizona
and the wildcat family,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.170
we want to thank you for your
service, your leadership,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.890
and your courage to simply
make this world a better place.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.240
