University

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290
 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.810
everything humans know of our planet we

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820
everything humans know of our planet we
 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.070
everything humans know of our planet we
were told had been shared

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080
 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.390
you lied to us

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400
you lied to us
 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.180
you lied to us
made a grave mistake

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190
 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.490
Isaac Asimov created the Three Laws of

Isaac Asimov created the Three Laws of
 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.090
Isaac Asimov created the Three Laws of
Robotics that is he suggested in one of

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100
Robotics that is he suggested in one of
 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.710
Robotics that is he suggested in one of
his science fiction works but it then

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720
his science fiction works but it then
 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.189
his science fiction works but it then
spread that a robot needs to be

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199
spread that a robot needs to be
 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.819
spread that a robot needs to be
inculcated with three ideas one is I

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829
inculcated with three ideas one is I
 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.069
inculcated with three ideas one is I
will never let a human come to harm I

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079
will never let a human come to harm I
 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.649
will never let a human come to harm I
will never harm a human and that I will

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659
will never harm a human and that I will
 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.710
will never harm a human and that I will
protect myself except insofar as it

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720
protect myself except insofar as it
 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.259
protect myself except insofar as it
violates one of the first two so a robot

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269
violates one of the first two so a robot
 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.660
violates one of the first two so a robot
can't protect itself at the expense of a

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670
can't protect itself at the expense of a
 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.399
can't protect itself at the expense of a
human life for human harm so what you

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409
human life for human harm so what you
 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.330
human life for human harm so what you
have often when you have science fiction

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340
have often when you have science fiction
 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.480
have often when you have science fiction
stories or movies about robots gone bad

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490
stories or movies about robots gone bad
 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.020
stories or movies about robots gone bad
is how did they go around some of these

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030
is how did they go around some of these
 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.270
is how did they go around some of these
protections that we assume will build

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280
protections that we assume will build
 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.669
protections that we assume will build
into robots when we create them because

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679
into robots when we create them because
 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.380
into robots when we create them because
what we don't want is robots going

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390
what we don't want is robots going
 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.570
what we don't want is robots going
around killing human beings now there

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580
around killing human beings now there
 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.609
around killing human beings now there
are two interesting ways to get around

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619
are two interesting ways to get around
 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.520
are two interesting ways to get around
that one is to what about robot soldiers

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530
that one is to what about robot soldiers
 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.649
that one is to what about robot soldiers
right so robot soldiers have to protect

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659
right so robot soldiers have to protect
 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.300
right so robot soldiers have to protect
you but kill the enemy so there have

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310
you but kill the enemy so there have
 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.650
you but kill the enemy so there have
been some science-fiction that have

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660
been some science-fiction that have
 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.300
been some science-fiction that have
tried to use that vehicle but what

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310
tried to use that vehicle but what
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.330
tried to use that vehicle but what
transformers does is it bill is it takes

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340
transformers does is it bill is it takes
 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.370
transformers does is it bill is it takes
another attack which is what about alien

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380
another attack which is what about alien
 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.859
another attack which is what about alien
robots alien robots aren't necessarily

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869
robots alien robots aren't necessarily
 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.130
robots alien robots aren't necessarily
designed by us to protect us so they get

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140
designed by us to protect us so they get
 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.870
designed by us to protect us so they get
the opportunity to create good robots

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880
the opportunity to create good robots
 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.029
the opportunity to create good robots
and bad robots I think that this does

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039
and bad robots I think that this does
 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.930
and bad robots I think that this does
tap into a very deep fear we have of our

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940
tap into a very deep fear we have of our
 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.160
tap into a very deep fear we have of our
creations not being willing to protect

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170
creations not being willing to protect
 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.949
creations not being willing to protect
us and I think it is it is a direct line

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959
us and I think it is it is a direct line
 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.290
us and I think it is it is a direct line
back to even Frankenstein and the idea

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300
back to even Frankenstein and the idea
 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.999
back to even Frankenstein and the idea
of creating even an organic form that

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009
of creating even an organic form that
 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.699
of creating even an organic form that
goes out of control and it's the idea

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709
goes out of control and it's the idea
 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.930
goes out of control and it's the idea
that we are creatures that are

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940
that we are creatures that are
 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.559
that we are creatures that are
characterized by our creating things we

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569
characterized by our creating things we
 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.330
characterized by our creating things we
are tool-making creatures we are

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340
are tool-making creatures we are
 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.089
are tool-making creatures we are
surrounded at all times by the things we

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099
surrounded at all times by the things we
 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.520
surrounded at all times by the things we
create right now sitting in this room

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
create right now sitting in this room
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.170
create right now sitting in this room
there isn't a single thing we can look

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180
there isn't a single thing we can look
 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.300
there isn't a single thing we can look
at we can see that wasn't created by

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
at we can see that wasn't created by
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.050
at we can see that wasn't created by
human beings and so we always worry that

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
human beings and so we always worry that
 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.670
human beings and so we always worry that
the products of our hands will somehow

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680
the products of our hands will somehow
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.589
the products of our hands will somehow
harm us hurt us whether we're talking

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599
harm us hurt us whether we're talking
 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.300
harm us hurt us whether we're talking
about global warming or whether we're

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310
about global warming or whether we're
 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.670
about global warming or whether we're
talking about robotics and so what

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680
talking about robotics and so what
 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.710
talking about robotics and so what
transformers does is it plays on that

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720
transformers does is it plays on that
 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.100
transformers does is it plays on that
fear that these created creatures

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
fear that these created creatures
 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.470
fear that these created creatures
are going to come back to haunt us are

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480
are going to come back to haunt us are
 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.970
are going to come back to haunt us are
going to come back to hurt us now these

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980
going to come back to hurt us now these
 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.040
going to come back to hurt us now these
happen to be aliens but it still plays

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050
happen to be aliens but it still plays
 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.520
happen to be aliens but it still plays
to that idea that that human beings at

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530
to that idea that that human beings at
 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.470
to that idea that that human beings at
least have a conscience or a soul or

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480
least have a conscience or a soul or
 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.660
least have a conscience or a soul or
whatever we want to talk about that we

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
whatever we want to talk about that we
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.640
whatever we want to talk about that we
can appeal to or try to get access to to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650
can appeal to or try to get access to to
 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.740
can appeal to or try to get access to to
try to stop them from doing the wrong

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750
try to stop them from doing the wrong
 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.280
try to stop them from doing the wrong
thing but a robot or never sure when

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290
thing but a robot or never sure when
 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.830
thing but a robot or never sure when
artificial intelligence first got

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840
artificial intelligence first got
 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.870
artificial intelligence first got
underway in its early days it thought

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880
underway in its early days it thought
 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.180
underway in its early days it thought
that human mental processing was a very

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190
that human mental processing was a very
 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.880
that human mental processing was a very
was rational and that if it could mimic

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890
was rational and that if it could mimic
 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.949
was rational and that if it could mimic
it it could then create artificial

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959
it it could then create artificial
 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.530
it it could then create artificial
intelligence that was similar to human

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540
intelligence that was similar to human
 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.990
intelligence that was similar to human
intelligence and what it underestimated

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000
intelligence and what it underestimated
 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.199
intelligence and what it underestimated
at the beginning was the powerful part

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209
at the beginning was the powerful part
 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.710
at the beginning was the powerful part
that our emotional lives and brains play

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720
that our emotional lives and brains play
 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.550
that our emotional lives and brains play
and in the way in which we think about

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560
and in the way in which we think about
 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.960
and in the way in which we think about
the world and even in the way in which

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970
the world and even in the way in which
 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.180
the world and even in the way in which
we make decisions and so now you get to

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190
we make decisions and so now you get to
 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.240
we make decisions and so now you get to
the question of how do we create robots

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250
the question of how do we create robots
 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.670
the question of how do we create robots
that will somehow think like human

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680
that will somehow think like human
 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.550
that will somehow think like human
beings and not by the way like computers

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560
beings and not by the way like computers
 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.080
beings and not by the way like computers
because we already have computers to

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090
because we already have computers to
 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.479
because we already have computers to
think like computers and maybe we can

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489
think like computers and maybe we can
 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.789
think like computers and maybe we can
already create some primitive robots

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799
already create some primitive robots
 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.949
already create some primitive robots
that think like computers but as we all

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959
that think like computers but as we all
 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.020
that think like computers but as we all
know computers do not think like human

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030
know computers do not think like human
 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.080
know computers do not think like human
beings and so they may be very good at

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090
beings and so they may be very good at
 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.240
beings and so they may be very good at
playing chess but they actually play

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250
playing chess but they actually play
 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.860
playing chess but they actually play
chess very differently than we play

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870
chess very differently than we play
 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.680
chess very differently than we play
chess they just can quickly calculate

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690
chess they just can quickly calculate
 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.870
chess they just can quickly calculate
millions and millions of moves while we

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880
millions and millions of moves while we
 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.420
millions and millions of moves while we
use something we call intuition or or

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430
use something we call intuition or or
 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.400
use something we call intuition or or
sort of a gestalt view of what's going

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410
sort of a gestalt view of what's going
 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.070
sort of a gestalt view of what's going
on to not have to go through all the
