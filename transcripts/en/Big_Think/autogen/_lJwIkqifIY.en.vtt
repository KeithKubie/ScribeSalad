00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 align:start position:0%
far away away from that and i think that
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
far away away from that and i think that
the<00:00:40.920><c> leadership</c><00:00:41.280><c> within</c><00:00:41.610><c> the</c><00:00:41.730><c> Democratic</c>

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.209 align:start position:0%
Party understands that as well and I
have<00:00:44.430><c> faith</c><00:00:44.760><c> that</c><00:00:45.059><c> the</c><00:00:45.680><c> that</c><00:00:46.680><c> the</c><00:00:46.710><c> right</c><00:00:47.039><c> will</c>

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 align:start position:0%
have faith that the that the right will
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.850 align:start position:0%
have faith that the that the right will

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
prevail and I also AM think on a part of

prevail and I also AM think on a part of
the<00:00:49.980><c> process</c><00:00:50.219><c> now</c><00:00:50.600><c> that</c><00:00:51.600><c> I</c><00:00:51.660><c> could</c><00:00:51.840><c> at</c><00:00:51.899><c> least</c>

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
the process now that I could at least
