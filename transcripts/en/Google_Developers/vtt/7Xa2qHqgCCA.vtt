MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.800
Welcome to Root Access, the
show on Google Developers

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.700
Live about startups.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.950
My name is Martin Omander,
and I'm joined here today

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.800
by Don Dodge, longtime
investor and startup advocate.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.725
Welcome, Don.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:20.600
DON DODGE: Thank you.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.584
Great to be here.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:22.500
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
So you've invested
in many companies.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.110
And we keep hearing, or
at least I keep hearing,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.000
that investors look
at the team a lot.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.690
Not just the idea, but at the
team in a startup before they

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.270
invest.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.090
What specifically
are they looking for?

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.340
DON DODGE: They look for a
couple of things in a team.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.360
One is balance.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.300
So a technical co-founder,
a business co-founder, maybe

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.850
a design co-founder that's
really strong in design.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.150
Or maybe someone who's strong
in marketing and social media

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.490
and that kind of thing.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.780
You need all of those
things, and it's rare

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.317
that one person possesses
all of those qualities.

00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:03.900
So the first thing
they're looking for

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.390
is a balance of co-founders
and capabilities.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.140
Second thing they look
for is experience.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.230
So do you have experience in
building scalable systems?

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.270
Or do you have experience
in launching products

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.050
across multiple market segments?

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.250
Or do you have domain experience
in this market, so you

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.940
understand what the problems
are and that kind of thing?

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.740
So it's those types of things
you look for in founders.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.560
And then the most
important thing is passion.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.940
Do you have passion
for this idea?

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.320
Is it something that
you have experience in?

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.549
So a lot of times I
hear investors say,

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.840
why did you start this company?

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.200
What is the idea?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.920
The reason they
ask that question

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.600
is to probe a little bit
on where your passion is.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.550
Is this a problem that
you've experienced

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.420
and that you have passion about?

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.684
If you do then your odds of
success are slightly better.

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:06.600
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.740
So what if you have
everything lined up?

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.000
You have a team that is a
good balance of business

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.530
and technology, good
domain experience.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.860
And what if you have
somebody on the team who

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.370
has done startups and
been successful before?

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.010
Does that mean you're
going to succeed?

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.051
DON DODGE: Good question.

00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:27.990
So the question about, are
serial entrepreneurs more

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.900
successful than first
time entrepreneurs?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.440
Generally, yes.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.730
If you've had an experience
once or twice before,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.670
your chances of success
are slightly higher.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.017
Even if those prior
experiences were failures.

00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:44.975
The reason is because--

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:46.020
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, even
if they were failures.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.180
DON DODGE: Yes, yes.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.520
Now, if you've had
multiple startups before,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.910
and they were successful,
your odds of success

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.080
go up a little higher.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.980
But even if you've had
multiple experiences,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.260
and one or two of
them were failures,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.590
you still have a
slightly better chance

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.640
of success than a first
time entrepreneur.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.890
Because you've seen
some of those problems

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.170
that come up in every startup.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.590
So every startup
is going to face

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.730
some of these
problems that happen.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.740
And if you've been
through them before,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.970
at least you know
what to look for.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.495
And you see the red flags
earlier and say, oh, OK,

00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:28.209
I have seen that problem before.

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.500
I didn't do it right last time.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.540
So I know not to do that.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.730
I'm going to try
something different.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.396
So all of those things
together give you

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:35.720
a slightly better
chance of success.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.470
MARTIN OMANDER: A
slightly better chance.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.217
So not a much
better chance then.

00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:40.800
DON DODGE: No.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.591
MARTIN OMANDER: No?

00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:43.130
DON DODGE: No.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.710
Most startups fail.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.200
50% of them fail completely.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.360
So what you're trying to
do, as an entrepreneur

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.180
and as an investor, is
increase your chances

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.380
of success 5% or 10%.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.440
If you can do that, if
you can be successful

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.220
55% of the time, 60% of
the time as an investor,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.420
you're doing great.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.180
As an entrepreneur,
if you can just

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.590
increase your odds of success.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.040
Because there are no
guarantees in this business.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.510
But if you can increase your
odds of success a little bit,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.284
that's good.

00:04:13.284 --> 00:04:14.200
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.880
Even a little bit counts.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.190
DON DODGE: Yes.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.820
MARTIN OMANDER: So I've seen
many startup teams, founders,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.330
they have this great idea.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.310
They think they're
alone with it.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.920
They are very excited about it.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.640
And then they hear that another
company's doing it, maybe

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.380
another startup that
is better funded.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.140
Or they might hear that
somebody tried a similar idea

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.330
in the past and failed.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.600
And they are disheartened.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.340
Should they be?

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.730
DON DODGE: No, they
shouldn't be disheartened.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.030
They should learn from that.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.950
So as an entrepreneur
you want to look

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.380
at the competitive
landscape and see,

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.080
is there anyone else trying
to do what I'm doing now?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.720
Generally there is.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.040
So understand--

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.690
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, so you're
seldom alone with your idea?

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.731
DON DODGE: Almost rarely.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:02.250
If you're alone, I would
be even more skeptical.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.180
Because if no one
else is doing this,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.000
then maybe this isn't a market.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.500
So typically there is
competition, either currently

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.070
or someone has tried this
in the past and failed.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.720
So what you want to do is
learn from that and say,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.960
all right, here are the
approaches that they took.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.850
Here are the strategies
that they had.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.650
Here the feature sets
that they focused on.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.500
Why did those fail?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.230
Or why did they succeed?

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.150
You need to do the
homework to understand

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.530
why the competition
failed and how

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.280
you're going to
avoid that failure.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.690
Or how you're going to
do something better,

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.700
maybe the same
approach but you have

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.510
new wrinkles and new
approaches to make it work.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.540
So if you haven't done the
homework to sort that out

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.000
and to understand what
the competition is,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.400
why they succeeded in some
cases and why they failed,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.240
then your chances
of success go down.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.650
So make sure you
do your homework

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.646
and understand why
something failed.

00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:04.270
MARTIN OMANDER:
Understand what failed.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.480
OK, great.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.810
Thank you very much, Don.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.750
Thanks for sharing your
experience with us.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.500
DON DODGE: Thanks.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.310
Good to be here.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.750
MARTIN OMANDER: And when
I'm not sitting here

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.830
I'm a developer here
at Google, writing

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.560
internal tools for my team.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.480
And I always use the
Google Cloud Platform.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.600
Because that allows
me to actually write

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.560
code and be productive,
and not deal

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.540
with system administration.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:31.230
And we now have an offer
where you viewers can

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.930
get started on the
Google Cloud platform

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.870
and get a $2,000 credit.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.360
So you can really try it out,
see how it works for you.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.530
The details are onscreen.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.730
That's it for today.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.890
Please keep those comments
on YouTube coming.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.620
And we will address and answer
them in future episodes.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.980
Thanks, bye.
