women will play a greater role in the
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.230
women will play a greater role in the
evolution of technology we have a huge

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
evolution of technology we have a huge
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720
evolution of technology we have a huge
demand for more scientists engineers and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
demand for more scientists engineers and

percent of our engineering so I think
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230
percent of our engineering so I think
will be very much involved in that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
will be very much involved in that
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.510

through our wireless devices to people

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
through our wireless devices to people
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.860
through our wireless devices to people
at virtually in all corners of the world

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870
at virtually in all corners of the world
 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.139
at virtually in all corners of the world
corners of Latin America we will be

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
corners of Latin America we will be
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690
corners of Latin America we will be
monitoring our blood pressure over our

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
monitoring our blood pressure over our
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.510
monitoring our blood pressure over our
devices and the home itself were

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
devices and the home itself were
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.639
