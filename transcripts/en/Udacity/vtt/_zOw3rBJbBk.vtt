00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.930
So you're going to need to tell the back-end API which client apps are allowed

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.391
to use it. So here I am in

00:00:07.391 --> 00:00:12.397
the ConferenceAPI.java class, up where I'm specifying the,

00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:17.290
the endpoints API. And you'll notice that it has the client IDs. And this one

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.810
here, the Constants.API.EXPLORER_CLIENT_ID is the client ID for

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.822
the APIs Explorer and then this one here,

00:00:24.822 --> 00:00:29.115
Constants.WEB_CLIENT_ID, this is where we're specifying the client

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:31.968
IDs of other apps, not the APIs Explorer,

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:37.570
but other web apps that are allowed to use this application. And if you knew the

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.340
client ID, you could just write it out here if you wanted, but we're using this

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.630
Constants class to hold our, our WEB_CLIENT_ID. So,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.530
let's take a look at the constants class.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.440
And you'll see here in the Constants class that we

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.763
define the client ID and to start with, there's no value,

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:58.470
so let's replace this with your client ID. So, yeah,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.501
it is a value, but it's not a real value. So

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.640
you're going to need to go ahead and put your client

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.110
ID in here. And just a reminder that you get your

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.930
client ID in the developers console. And the client ID

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.150
includes everything. It's not just the number. It's the whole thing

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.440
that you see in the developers console up to

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.740
the .com part, if you see that on yours. And

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.740
you can just copy and paste the client ID from

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.730
the developers console. What we've done is that we've set

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.930
that the applications with web client ID as specified

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.840
are allowed to access our endpoints APIs, so we basically

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.400
granted permission to the UI to use our endpoints. But

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.920
another thing you have to do is that on the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.314
client side, on the JavaScript side, on the web,

00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:46.260
the web app UI side, you have to, when

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.700
the, when the user logs in, you need to

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.260
run the authentication process, so you need to identify yourself.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.100
So you'll need to go into the web app

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.800
folder and then into the js folder and this time

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.960
you're going to have to go to app.js. One of

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.920
the things that this file does is that it runs

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.768
your authentication process when, when a user logs in.

00:02:08.768 --> 00:02:11.719
And you're going to need to set the appropriate client

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.595
ID in here, so you can go ahead and

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:19.710
search for CLIENT-ID. And it's uppercase CLIENT-ID. And you'll

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.509
see here again that the CLIENT-ID is just a,

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.164
a placeholder. So you're going to need to put

00:02:25.164 --> 00:02:27.554
your client ID right here. And again, that's a

00:02:27.554 --> 00:02:30.650
client ID that you get from the developers console.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.300
Here it's being used for the client ID to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.860
identify itself during the authentication process. So, here's my

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.540
client ID and then of course, save it. And

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.110
it hasn't mattered until now that the client ID wasn't

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.540
set here because we haven't been using the webpages

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.570
in the Conference Central application to test our functions. I

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.354
think if you try to log in using the

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:56.580
webpages, you will have found that it didn't work because

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.190
it didn't have its CLIENT_ID set. Another thing you

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.570
need to make sure is that your consent screen

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.639
has a product name. So again, you'd go to

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.285
your project in the developers console, go to APIs &amp;

00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:13.461
auth. Then you click Consent screen here, down here.

00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:15.394
And then first thing you see is it shows you

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:18.670
what your consent screen would look like. And this

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.010
is the screen that gets shown to users when they

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.360
go to use your application. And you do need to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.364
scroll down. Don't be put off that it's a little

00:03:26.364 --> 00:03:30.130
bit faded. Just go ahead and scroll down. The email

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.000
address does need to have a value. And then specify

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.830
a product name for your application, basically your application name.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.730
Okay, one last thing you need to do is to

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.530
add the JavaScript Cross-Origin in the client application. So for

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.540
this, you're going to go back to the credentials screen in

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.520
the developer console, and your client ID for

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.750
web application. You're going to add your JavaScript origins.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.340
So click Edit Settings. Make sure you're in the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.410
right box for JavaScript Origins and then you need

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.750
to add two here. You need to add the URL for where your app is when it's

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.440
running on appspot and you need to add the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.660
URL for localhost. You'd go ahead and add those.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.460
If your app running on appspot, you do

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.660
need to specify HTTPS for secure connection. For the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.340
app running on localhost, it's just HTTP, because

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.690
the dev server running on localhost doesn't support HTTPS.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.040
So you go ahead and you add those and you say Update, and basically what this is

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.080
doing is it's giving permission to these URLs

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.760
to run JavaScript to access your app. And you

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.300
need to do this even though this is the app itself, right?

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.040
I'm in here. My app is cake-hut and I'm giving permission to cake-hut

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.010
to run JavaScript to access cake-hut. And after you've done all of

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.400
these things, you should find that the My Profile page works for you.
