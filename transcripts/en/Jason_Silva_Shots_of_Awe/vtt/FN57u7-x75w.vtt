00:00:07.386 --> 00:00:09.776
[HEARTBEAT]

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.750
So there's a great
line by Shakespeare

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.800
in which he says,
"We know what we are.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.720
We know not what we may be."

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.840
And in the age of
accelerating technologies

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.510
in which we extend the
cognitive reach of our minds,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.200
the perimeters of our humanness,
with these extensions of self,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.150
these exoskeletons, these
technological scaffoldings--

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.345
you know, the wings
of our aircrafts

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:44.410
and the signals traveling
through our smartphones,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.925
sending our
thoughts, electrified

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:49.310
at the speed of light,
across oceans of sky--

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.330
we redefine and extend
what it means to be human.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.052
Edward O. Wilson says we
have actually decommissioned

00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:03.060
natural selection, and now we
must look deep within ourselves

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.440
and decide what
we wish to become.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.000
We are now the chief
agents of evolutions.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.500
We have reverse-engineered
the software of biology

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.880
and are about to
rewire and upgrade it,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.290
redefine what it is
to be a Homo sapien.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.720
Juan Enriquez uses the
term Homo evolutis,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.266
the being that evolves itself,
that transforms itself, right?

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.383
Ray Kurzweil-- we didn't
stay in the caves.

00:01:34.383 --> 00:01:36.980
We haven't stayed on the planet.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.086
Biology-- just another
membrane to be transcended.

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:42.670
You know, Marvin
Minsky used to say,

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.730
will robots inherit the Earth?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.740
Yes, they will.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.750
But they will be our children.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.084
You know, I love this idea,
because we hear the term

00:01:50.084 --> 00:01:51.500
"transhumanism,"
and what it means

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.149
to be human is to be transhuman.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.480
We are the species that
transforms and transcends.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.630
We never stop.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.790
We always did.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.230
It's what we are.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.670
