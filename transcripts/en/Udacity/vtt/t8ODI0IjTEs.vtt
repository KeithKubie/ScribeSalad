00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.810
Well, let's see.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.920
The first thing I want to figure
out is how many cups of juice

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.550
my guests are going to drink.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.290
And since I have 26 guests and
they're each going to drink 5 cups,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.610
they're going to drink
26 x 5 cups of juice.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.567
And that's equal to 130 cups.

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:16.890
But I want to know how
many liters to buy.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.744
So first I'm going to
convert to gallons so

00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:22.660
that I can then convert
from gallons to liters.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.564
So, I'm going to multiply by
1 gal divided by 16 cups,

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:28.652
which lets me simplify cups.

00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:34.480
And then multiply by my gallon to liter
conversion of 3.785 liters per gallon.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.630
Gallon simplifies, and
I'm left with liters.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.550
When I carry out this multiplication,
I find that I need 30.75 liters,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.800
which would actually mean I
should buy 31 one-liter bottles.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.340
So if you put 31 that was okay, too.
