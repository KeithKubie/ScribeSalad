00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.890
Let's talk a little bit more
about the comparison between

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:09.660
Sn1 and Sn2 reactions, and maybe
we can also talk about

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.760
what type of conditions make
one or the other more

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.110
favorable, especially
the solvent.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.550
We've talked about it a little
bit, but we'll go into a

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.760
little bit more detail.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.200
So just as a bit of a review,
an Sn1 reaction, you might

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.000
have some type of a-- let me
just draw it like this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.410
So you'll have some
carbon that's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.610
attached to three things.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.720
I'm making these three things
just arbitrary colors.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.549
They could be other
carbons, CH3.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.830
It could be hydrogens.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.480
It could be other things.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.640
And then it's also attached
to a leaving group.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.660
Let me do this in a color that
I haven't used yet: in pink.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.280
And then you also have a
nucleophile floating around.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.700
That'll be our nucleophile.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.740
It has one excess electron.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.270
It has a negative charge.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.660
And in an Sn1 reaction, the
first step only involves one

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.500
of the reactants, one
of the reagents.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.720
That's why it's called Sn1.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.590
So in the very first step, the
nucleophile just waits

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.520
passively while the leaving
group leaves.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.570
So maybe there's an electron
right there, the leaving group

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.850
already has an electron.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.130
It swipes one, so it has to be
reasonably electronegative.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.480
It swipes one from that carbon,
and so once it does

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.440
that, our situation will
look like this.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.830
You have your substrate.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.310
It now just lost an electron.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.030
It lost that electron, so it
now has a positive charge.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.820
Let me add that little
trace of something.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.760
Let me erase this right here
so you don't think that

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.290
electron is still there.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.210
So it now has a positive
charge.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.540
The leaving group, which was
neutral, took an electron.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.340
So it out now has a
negative charge.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.180
The leaving group now took an
electron, so it now has at

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.180
least two valence
electrons there.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.170
It has a negative charge,
probably a lot more.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.050
And then in the next step, this
nucleophile-- so let me

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.110
copy and paste this.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.632
That's not what I
wanted to do.

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:03.460
Let me copy and paste
it again.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.620
So copy and paste.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.090
OK.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.180
So that thing that was waiting
patiently during the

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.720
rate-determining steps
says, hey, there's

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.100
a carbocation there.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.070
I'm a nucleophile.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.760
I'm not a strong nucleophile in
the case of an Sn1, but I

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.320
still like giving away electrons
to nucleuses.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.770
I love nucleases.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.190
I see a positive carbocation
there.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.520
Actually, a carbocation is
positive by definition, so let

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.090
me give my electrons to him.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.320
And in the very last step, we
have a situation where this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.360
guy-- let me copy and
paste this again.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.310
Let me copy and let me paste.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.230
That guy is bonded to
the nucleophile.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.300
Since the nucleophile gave the
electron to this carbon, the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.770
carbon doesn't have
a charge anymore.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.840
Since the nucleophile lost that

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.800
electron, it's now neutral.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.940
So you have it bonded to the
nucleophile, and, of course,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.650
you have the leaving
group still here

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.000
with a negative charge.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.690
We've hinted at this a little
bit, but in order for this

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.650
step to happen on its own with
only this reagent happening

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.300
spontaneously to some degree,
or for it to just happen.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.690
And we won't talk
about the rates.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.520
And it won't necessarily happen
fast, but in order for

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.940
this to happen at all, this
has to be a stable

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.910
carbocation.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.760
And we've seen before that in
order for this to be a stable

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.540
carbocation, it has to be bonded
to things that are

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.230
willing to lend it some
electrons so it's not super

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.270
hungry for electrons.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.220
And in order for that to happen,
this carbocation right

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.870
here has to be tertiary.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.190
Tertiary is ideal.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.710
Tertiary carbocation means that
these three things over

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.290
here are all carbons
or carbon chains.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.450
So ideally, it would be tertiary
and secondary will

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.650
also work if at least two of
these guys are carbon.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.830
That'll also work if the solvent
is favorable, if the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.290
environment we're dealing with
is a favorable environment.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.840
If only one of these were
carbon, so if this was a

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.630
primary carbocation or this was
a methyl carbocation where

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.890
nothing here is a carbon,
then you're unlikely

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.060
to have an Sn1 reaction.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.709
Now, on the other side of the
picture, Sn2 reaction, this is

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.040
the one where you have a super
strong nucleophile, or at

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.020
least a strong nucleophile, and
the whole reaction happens

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.740
in one step involving both
of the reagents.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.305
So you start here with
your leaving group.

00:04:36.305 --> 00:04:38.580
The way you can think about it,
Sn1, the leaving group is

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.750
the thing that does something
first. In Sn2, it all happens

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.940
at once, but the nucleophile's
kind of the aggressor.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.500
It really wants to give that
electron away badly.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.740
So in the very first step, it
comes in here and gives it to

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.035
that carbon, even though that
carbon didn't necessarily want

00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:56.920
it that badly.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.970
It would have a partial positive
charge if this thing

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.400
is really electronegative and
might be hogging this electron

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.026
already, but that thing that it
was already hogging, now it

00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:05.350
could say, hey, you already
got an electron.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.810
I can take it from you.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.240
And so in literally one
step, we end up with

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.490
something like this.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.970
Actually, let me just
redraw that.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.680
So we have our leaving
group has left.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.950
It's taken the electron
that the

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.600
carbon didn't need anymore.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.030
So it now has this electron and
that one and maybe more,

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.380
and it has a negative charge.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.370
And now this carbon is attached
to the blue thing.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.040
I'll just draw the purple thing,
and maybe in back, it's

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.330
attached to the orange thing.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.730
Let me draw it so you can see
what I'm talking about, so the

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.890
blue thing and then
the purple thing.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.360
And then the nucleophile had
come from the other direction,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.230
so now it's also bonded
to the nucleophile.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.340
The nucleophile is giving an
electron, so it loses its

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.945
negative charge.

00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:57.400
And essentially, the negative
charge gets transferred to the

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.890
leaving group, which is able to
take an electron, and then

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.000
that carbon in the middle
stays neutral.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.060
And we saw before that this
can only reasonably happen

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.990
with a strong nucleophile.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.640
That has to be a strong
nucleophile, and there can't

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.420
be a lot of steric hindrance.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.730
These things can't
really block this

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.290
nucleophile from attacking.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:23.740
So this will work best if this
is a methyl or primary carbon.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.150
And if the conditions are just
right and if the nucleophile

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.880
is strong enough,
maybe secondary,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.680
maybe a secondary carbon.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.250
Because once you have too many
carbons or big carbon chains

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.390
over here, then it blocks
the nucleophile.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.190
It cannot attack.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.060
If these are all hydrogens,
there's a lot of space for

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.210
this nucleophile to attack.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.400
If only one of these are carbon,
still a lot of space.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.490
Now, that's just kind of a
general comparison, and it

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.520
gives you some clues.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.600
Weak nucleophile, you're
dealing with Sn1.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.760
Strong nucleophile, Sn2.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.550
If this is a tertiary or
secondary carbon, so if it's

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.830
bonded to a lot of other
carbons, Sn1

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.960
should be in your brain.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.220
If this isn't bonded to a lot
a carbons and you have a

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.740
strong nucleophile, Sn2 should
be in your brain.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.550
And now the last thing you
should have to think about is

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.970
the solvent itself.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.700
What are these reagents
actually dissolved in.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.210
So let's think about it.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.670
So in either an Sn1 or an Sn2
reaction, we're dealing with

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.300
things that have charge.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.180
And in general, if you're
dealing with ions or things

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.210
that have charge, they're going
to be more soluble in

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.680
polar solvents because the
charge likes to be around

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.670
other things with charge so that
they can mix and match.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:41.050
So in both situations, you want
to have polar solvents.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.990
And you are familiar with
polar solvents.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.730
Examples of polar solvents
are, well,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.170
water is a polar solvent.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.500
H2O, and it's polar because
oxygen is so electronegative

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.740
it hogs electrons.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.590
So you have a partial negative
charge on the oxygen side and

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.870
partial positive charges
on the hydrogen side.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.890
Another example of a polar
solvent that you may have not

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:18.620
seen before is something
like diethyl ether.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.800
So diethyl ether would
look like this.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:29.350
CH2, CH3, CH2, CH3.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.050
And I know we havn't
named ethers yet.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:31.670
Let me write this.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:37.630
This is diethyl-- let me make
sure I get that "y" right.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.510
This is diethyl ether.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.890
And this is a bit of a review.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.410
This is probably the best
way to learn things, as

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.970
we learn as we go.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.590
An ether is something
that has a form.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.970
You have some carbon chain or
some-- you could call it a

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.920
radical-- some group attached to
a carbon chain, I guess is

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.120
the way my brain processes it,
to an oxygen which is attached

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.230
to another carbon chain.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.800
It doesn't have to be
the exact same one.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.760
And diethyl ether is the same.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.400
And you're literally just
saying diethyl.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.220
You have to ethyl groups
attached to an ether.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.480
Ethyl is two carbons.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.340
So two carbons, oxygen,
two more carbons.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.650
Diethyl ether.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:19.740
And this would also be a polar
solvent because oxygen is more

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.880
electronegative then carbon, so
you still have this partial

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.890
negative charge-- let me do this
in a different color-- on

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:32.640
the oxygen end and you still
have a partial positive charge

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.680
on your carbon end.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.710
So this is also a
polar solvent.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.410
Both of these are
polar solvents.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.080
Now, the difference between
these, and this will probably

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:46.130
be a new term for you, is this
water and most types of

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.980
alcohol, something that has
hydrogen that could be knocked

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.050
off, this is a protic sovent.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.940
And protic just comes
from proton.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.970
And that means that if something
is dissolved in

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.860
this, or if you have a solution
of this, then these

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.750
hydrogens might be able to get
knocked off and you might have

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.830
free protons lying around.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.620
Because let's say this
oxygen swipes this

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.770
electron from this hydrogen.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.530
If it swipes that electron from
that hydrogen, then you

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.750
have a situation where you
have OH minus, right?

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.090
The oxygen now has a
negative charge.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.760
And this hydrogen, all it had to
its name was that electron.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.110
If you take that away, all
it is is a proton.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.370
So when someone draws H plus,
that literally is a proton.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.510
That literally is a proton.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.440
And this can occur in water,
that you have some protons

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.320
floating around, so water
is fundamentally a

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.860
protic polar solvent.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.950
Diethyl ether, on the other
hand, it doesn't have

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.480
hydrogens where oxygens can
take its hydrogens away.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.200
The hydrogens here are all
bonded to carbon, which is not

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.300
that electronegative, so this
is an aprotic solvent.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.550
Let me draw this.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.510
Now, let's think about whether
an Sn1 or Sn2 is better and--

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.780
well, I already said the
solvents have to be polar.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.690
That's because we're dealing
with charged

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.700
things in both reactions.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.790
But which one will be better?

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.760
So let me write this down.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.360
So in both situations, we want
a polar solvent, so let me

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.790
write that down.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.730
And I'll give you a hint: one
of them will be good in a

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.640
protic environment and one of
them will not be good in a

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.960
protic environment.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.690
So in an Sn2, if you had-- let's
just think it through.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.040
Let's just not memorize this.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.010
If we had protons floating
around in an Sn2 situation,

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.680
what is likely to happen?

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.920
We have this strong
nucleophile.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.960
We have this thing that wants
to give away electrons.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.010
Now, it could give it away to a
carbon that might maybe have

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.450
a partial positive charge and
then the leaving group could

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.780
take it away, but what
wants electrons more?

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.420
A carbon that has a partial
negative charge or a proton,

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.770
something that has a full
positive charge?

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.450
Well, a proton would
want it more.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.500
So if you had protons floating
around, the nucleophile would

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.730
just give its electrons to the
proton and the Sn2 reaction

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.670
wouldn't actually occur.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.810
The protons would take
all the electrons.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.270
So you can't have protons
floating around.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.060
You cannot have protons
floating

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.000
around in an Sn2 reaction.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.790
Then this carbon will never
get the electron.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.090
The proton will take it.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:33.340
So you need an aprotic
solvent.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.650
So Sn2 would work well
in diethyl ether.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.705
If this is a strong nucleophile,
it's a solution

00:12:42.705 --> 00:12:46.310
in diethyl ether, and these were
all hydrogens, then you'd

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.300
be just ready to go for
an Sn2 reaction.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.660
Now, on the other end of the
spectrum, the key in an Sn1

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.250
reaction is that this
carbocation be stable.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:03.320
And for a carbocation to be
stable-- or actually even more

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.690
important, instead of the
carbocation being stable,

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.070
that's dependent on it being a
tertiary or secondary carbon.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.060
But order for the leaving group
to be stable when it's

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.840
negative, it actually would
be nice if there was

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.960
some protons available.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.820
Maybe it could give electrons
to the proton.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.200
Maybe it could bond
with the proton.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.560
So in this situation, the
protons will actually help

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.270
stabilize the situation.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:35.260
So in an Sn1 reaction, the
ideal is actually a polar

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.550
protic solvent.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.580
So if you see a situation where
you have a secondary or

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:48.700
tertiary carbon, it is a weak
nucleophile, and you're

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.720
dealing with a polar protic
solvent, the most famous of

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.010
which is water, but an alcohol
would also work, then you

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.053
should be thinking Sn1.

00:13:57.053 --> 00:14:00.434
If you see a strong nucleophile,
there's not much

00:14:00.434 --> 00:14:01.400
steric hindrance.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.815
There's space that
it can attack.

00:14:03.815 --> 00:14:06.954
This is a methyl or a primary,
maybe a secondary carbon, and

00:14:06.954 --> 00:14:10.650
it's happening in an aprotic
polar solvent like diethyl

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.390
ether, then you know you're
ready for an Sn2.
