Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible] joining me today is an actor, a standup comic, the host of American Ninja Warrior, and a guy whose birthday today, Matt Iseman. Happy Birthday. Well, thank you so much. I'm, I'm a little under the weather. I'm a little hoarse here, but this is a great birthday gift. I always say one of the great choices since I moved out to La was always want to make sure I, I perform, I do something on my birthday because that's what I love doing. So this is it. This is my gift to myself. How old are you? I'm, I'm 40 48 40 48 which sounds so old and yet I don't does that? I don't know that it's 42 48 no longer now. 48 sounds old because I still in my head see myself in my twenties yeah, and it's hard. It's really hard to shift that, that, that, that thought process because I'm still still, I'm dating a girl, but no kids, so no commitment, none of those responsibilities.

Speaker 1:          01:00          I know you're married. I think those are the kinds of things that make you those little, the markers in life that might make you feel, okay, I've matured but I've regressed in everything I've done. I talked about Ninjas for living. I do stand up comedy, so there's nothing that would make me feel like an adult other than seeing that 48 next to my name and somehow through it all at 48 years. And maybe it's that you don't have kids big smile on your face, so you're doing something, you know, I think, um, I was a naturally enthusiastic kid. My mom, you know, they, they called me, they might the sunshine boy and uh, I, I think, you know, the, the word I always used, if there was one adjective I would say to describe myself who was enthusiastic, I get excited about things. And that's one of the, one of the things I think that was what it was a gift for me and, and to, to have found a career where you get rewarded for that.

Speaker 1:          01:50          And especially your shield like Ninja Warrior, which deals in hype and hyperbole, where the more enthusiastic I am, the better it is. And that's become a thing onto itself. We'll talk. It really is and it's, it's, it's been, uh, it's, I think also having switched careers, uh, midstream in life gave me such an appreciation for being able to do something that I love because you look at so many people and I always think of the song working for the week, everybody's working for the weekend. That idea of a job is supposed to be toil. It's supposed to be arguous. It's supposed to be something you do to provide for your family and then allow you to have that free time. We've found a way to disrupt the system and do something we love. It's bizarre, right? It's the best. And it's one of those things of if you can do it, and, and, and I, I credit this to my dad deserves the credit.

Speaker 1:          02:40          Cause I, you know, I was a, I was a doctor. My Dad's a doctor and he was a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado where I was doing residency and my dad is a world renowned physician. He's the man I respect more than any other person on this planet. He is, he is the smartest, the best, the kindest, the wisest man I've ever known or you type the wrong ice minutes. Dude. You totally do. My Dad is, my dad is, he's a legend. I Yo, he's iron Mike. He is just, and, and so to be [inaudible] following in his footsteps and to know, to feel like a, obviously I think he was, he was very proud of it. So when I sensed that medicine wasn't my passion and that I needed to take a step back and reevaluate because I couldn't in good conscience be a doctor, knowing my heart wasn't 100% in it, I felt like I was a fraud.

Speaker 1:          03:31          I felt like I was not doing a service to my patients and certainly not to myself that the scariest moment was telling my dad. And I remember when I told him the first words, he said, we're life is short. Do what makes you happy. So I've got that very quote from your dad right here because it's the first thing that you say on your about page, on your site all the time. Because in a certain way it sort of sounds cliche. Do what makes you happy. It is cliche. It's almost the best advice or only advice that you could get to that one. I don't at a certain level. Yeah. You know, certainly it's not a Shakespearian line, but I thought it was just, you know, particularly for him to say it at a moment when very easily, probably most parents would be, you're crazy.

Speaker 1:          04:11          There's, there's a lot of money invested in this education. This is a stable job. You don't walk away from it for him to instead say, all we care about is you being happy. And you know, I've talked to them so many times about it and marveled at that he could have mustered those words. Cause, uh, my dad's an amazing man and he's also, he worked hard for everything he had. And, uh, I was very fortunate to have more opportunities because of his hard work and the work of my mom. And, and, uh, I, I think too, you know, when, when he says, I'm like, how can I ever repay that? He say, just if you ever have kids someday do the same for them. It's that pay it forward mentality. And it's that thing of, I don't know, it's, uh, it makes me appreciate though the opportunity that I have.

Speaker 1:          04:56          I know how lucky I am to be out here getting to do this and how lucky I am to have tried medicine and learn so much from it and learned so much and be given so much perspective about what truly is life or death and to be out here in entertainment where we feel like everything is life or death, but it's just silliness. It's silliness. And it's so much fun what we get to do. Yet we still do have a chance to make a difference. Yeah. Well you can do something real. It's still enjoyable. Yeah. But wait, so, so let's back up a bit. So your dad's a doctor. Yeah. Was it just sort of a foregone conclusion that you were going to? No, no, he wasn't even, he never pressured me into it. It was more I think, lead by example. It was either, the funny thing was I think at eight I kind of had a crisis during college because I worked, there was just in growing up, it was you work hard, you play sports, you go to school, you excel, you achieve, and that's the path you're on.

Speaker 1:          05:50          But I never kind of stopped to say stuff right there, work hard and succeed. Right? But I never stopped to think what's, what's the end? Where am I headed? And so then, you know, when I kind of poked my head up midway through college, you go, w where am I headed? And I looked around and I thought, you know, that's when I thought, okay, I like science. I like people. And I looked at my dad as someone who I respected tremendously and saw the satisfaction he got from medicine. Now, I think he, he was a little impression in seeing that medicine was changing and doctors were losing autonomy and that, you know, medicine today is radically different than it was 30 years ago. So I think he saw that there was probably going to be some disruptions in the field of medicine, but um, it seemed on paper the perfect job.

Speaker 1:          06:37          But it's so interesting, you know, that's what you realize is, you know, it's like when you watch sports or something, you know, you don't play a game on paper. You don't live your life on paper. What looks like it might be perfect that sometimes it's just that divine spark is missing that, that whatever it is, that intangible thing. And I'm so lucky to have somehow stumbled into performing and finding that I love an audience. I love being in front of the camera. I love doing standup comedy. I love being on Ninja Warrior. I mean these are the things where no matter how sick I am, no matter how tired I am, if it's like when you get onstage and you have an audience, I just feel like I feel present. I feel alive. It's such a rush. Did you have a moment when you realized it was wrong for you?

Speaker 1:          07:19          Sort of slow thing. There was a loud moment. It was in January of 1999 I was in the ICU. It was probably three in the morning. You know, I'd, I'd been up for 18 hours. We were getting slammed. I think we had seven admin. So this super sick people are rolling in and I'm a uh, resident. I man, I'm an intern first, first year out of med school and I had a second year with me and there's, there's also an attending when he wasn't in the hospital. So at this point the guy was like the person who was overseeing me, it was just like, just you got to the rights of mortars, you got to make some choices, make some decisions for these people. And I'm all of a sudden realizing these people's lives now are in my hands. And I just thought, I'm sitting there going, I want to be skiing or playing Nintendo or, or I don't want to be here.

Speaker 1:          08:05          I didn't feel like this is the moment I've trained for it. It wasn't like er I jumped on top of a Gurney and started doing CPR. It was just this moment of I felt like a fraud. I felt like my heart, you know it all this training, all this and I loved medical school. I loved the problem solving elements of it but I realized, I think there was, there's just something, I think there are jobs and there are callings. Medicine is a calling. It is not something that you just do nine to five. It is something that consumes you that you are obsessed with your, your patients are obsessed with being up to date on the information and giving them the best care possible. And if you're, if you don't hear that calling, if it's just a job for you, that's awful because it is, it is such a consuming profession and you know, and when you look at the opportunity cost of somebody who goes to medical school and is going six figures into that versus my friends who went into finance and or making six figures and then during residency you're making subsistence level wages.

Speaker 1:          09:05          As your debt continues to grow, some of these people will never get out from under that, that debt and and you end up working this career and making choices that you might not want to or practicing the way you would want to or given the level of care that you would want to. When you think I, I do believe that health care in America is going to see a radical shift in the next few decades because people aren't going to be able to afford to go into medicine anymore or want to. It's such a fascinating thing because it's like, wow, you train your whole life or something. Okay, now you make, you have this moment, right? You have to wake up moment. What happens in the next day? So you know, my mom, my mom said something like there's no wasted education and she's so right. Like so when I came out to la, I literally, I packed up, I packed up a u haul, I moved out to La September one 99 and I got the a la weekly, I got the back pain.

Speaker 1:          09:57          This is like bad movie version of this is, this is John's playing Mecasa and, and so I just started finding open mikes and I just started going to open mikes and I'm just, honestly, when I came out here, it wasn't as though I said I'm going to be a standup comedian. Part of me thought I'm going to take a year and I'm going to grow up. I'm going to get this out of my system and realize I'm fortunate to be a doctor and I'll go back and adult. That's kind of what I thought 20 years ago. So you're late, late twenties, late twenties and I can't really understand the open mic situation. It's the God awful. I remember when I was doing it. And it's like, it's like a terrible, you know, couple of years that you have to do as a comic, as you're figuring out your shit. But I remember there would be doctors, they're lawyers, they're, there would be professionals and I, every time I saw one of them, I'd be like, what in the world is wrong with you?

Speaker 1:          10:49          Why are you here? You're a real person. You're a functioning person. And yet they were there because they had something in them that there's something, there's something, you know, I think, I think everybody has that we all search for purpose. We all search for something that, that, that ignites a fire in this. And rare is the person that finds, I think, the job that does that. And I think we're so lucky to have found something. And again, it even gets luck. Um, well you're okay. We took the chance and we certainly went out. I, I still think there is a certain amount of, of fortune or, or circumstance or something, you know, I, I'm not gonna say I'm Christopher Columbus who boldly decided to explore the frontiers of the job world and walked away from medicine. I was lucky in that my family supported me. I was lucky in that when I came out, you know, you meet the right people.

Speaker 1:          11:42          Look, luck is what prep preparation besides whatever cliches we want to spout out. Yeah. I just thought you'd have a good one there that I, I don't, I don't know. I mean, I'd never been called on that day. You're very good. I, I'm not saying it. Is it luck? I do think it's partly luck her kids made or magic of just putting the work in all those things. Having said that, you're right. I think, um, that once I realized it was this, that's where the medicine came in so handy in that medicine taught me such a discipline and, and such, uh, an ability to work hard and process information and to just withstand a river of shit being dumped on you where you're like, this is, this is easy, right? I'm not, I'm not on third call for 36 hours. You're asking me to sit here with craft services and have someone do make up and be pampered that fine.

Speaker 1:          12:28          Yeah, fine. Great. I love this can be a lot of waiting around, which is quite cool. It is. And you know, the, the, it's a business. Well here's, here's where it really helped is Hollywood is a business of no, you, you go out for a hundred things and 99 times you're told no, and often you're told nothing. You're not given a reason why you might've been amazing. You're never told why. And if you don't have something that provides you with that sense of self, that sense of it's okay, I know I am talented. If you don't have that belief, then I think people really crumble. And the people who succeed aren't necessarily the most talented. They're the ones who persist. They're the ones who can slog it out. And you know this, we, we, we've seen it the 1520 year overnight success where somebody pops and like, oh my God, this guy came out of nowhere.

Speaker 1:          13:16          And you're like, no, I've been doing it for 20 years. And they finally, they got recognized and that's why they're so good is because they've been doing it for 20 years. I heard Susie Essman, you know the comedians. Yeah. Curb your enthusiasm. I heard her say that. Everyone says she's an overnight success and she always goes, you know what? She's got a great piety match. She's always like, well, where the fuck were you for 20 years? Yeah. It's like, yeah, there's a lot of work, you know. And honestly though it, it's a, it, it does two things. A, it makes you appreciate it, but B, it also makes you ready for it because if I come out here and gotten a show one weekend, you, you wouldn't have had the chops. You wouldn't have known how to do it. You wouldn't have had the ability to know right from wrong or, or to make the right decisions.

Speaker 1:          13:57          And I think that's what you learn over those 20 years of hard knocks. You know, you, you start to see, um, you get these opportunities performing in front of four people. So when you go out there and you're like, there is nothing, I hosted a live show on the history channel, um, with Travis Pastrana ray recreated evil Knievel stunts for three hours. Half the time people are just like, just talk. And you're like, okay, I can do that. I've done that. That, that's what I've been trained for. And so it was so great to feel like you, you, you're ready for things. I did. I was just talking about celebrity apprentice. So I was with Arnold Schwarzenegger this weekend and um, the show got politicized. Nobody watched it. But what was great about it was it was so much fun for me because it called on. I felt everything I had done in my life to that point, whether it'd been playing sports or being a doctor or going to school or a stand up or hosting our w anything you, you called on all these different seals and it's so much fun when you feel ready, when an opportunity comes and you're like, I am ready for this opportunity.

Speaker 1:          15:02          There's nothing you could throw at me that I can't handle. And, and I would much rather have someone go, where have you been? Then see you too early and go, miles. All right, but next. All right, so we've got the beginnings of a Nice Hollywood story here, but for a content, it took a turn for the worse. Right? Then you moved to La crumbles. No, but, but, you know, they say the comedy comes from pain. Um, uh, I'm not seeing like, well, you know, I think I always say people go into a, they, those people, I think, I think there's, um, I think people go into comedy for one of two reasons. They weren't hugged enough as a child pain or they were hugged too much. I was definitely the latter where I had a mother who just showered me with attention and affection and praise and she was always Matt.

Speaker 1:          15:50          Oh, that's so funny. Whatever I did was amazing and she made me believe have this ridiculous confidence this. And she was always there. She was always there. I had this unbelievable sense of a safety net from my mom and, and my dad. And I think that that's what gave me the confidence to think I could come out here and take a swing and be okay and know that I could fall flat on my face and either go back to Madison and my parents wouldn't disown me and, and, but, but ultimately I believed, yeah, I, what I've realized in life is nothing is certain. And, and I look at, I have a ton of friends who are in finance. I had a friend who was at bear Stearns when it imploded and you know, saw people lose $60 million overnight and these guys who thought they were going to be able to retire all of a sudden an hour out of a job and broke.

Speaker 1:          16:42          And you know, you go into, you choose some of these careers thinking, all right, I'm going to work my ass off, but it'll pay off in the end. And you realize there nothing's guaranteed. And so I think too, what I realized is the best bet in life you can make is to bet on yourself because that's where you have the most control. And so while these career I'm at, we're in well is so fickle and so on the surface fickle where, you know, my show, they live week to week with ratings. Oh my God, it's, it's up a pointer. It's down a point. And you think it could end at any moment. And, and we, and we make our peace with that. But ultimately what I've realized is having been out here 19 years, I've worked and I, I just have to have this confidence. The only way I can sleep at night as to say if it goes away, something else will come, I'll bet on myself.

Speaker 1:          17:31          And I think that's one of those things in life that, um, is, is hard to get to. But if you can, is a great position to be in is when you say, I'd rather bet on myself than someone else, than relying on someone else to provide me as you have, you've gone out on your own. Yeah. I mean, I feel that very intimately because even just in the last couple of months with this patriotic thing, the rubber met the road and I was like, can I make a move here? That's a huge risk and not, and I did make the move and it, and it's worked. And I've found that if you're, if you're just present enough and aware enough of what really is going on and you put in the work that you generally make the right moves, you're going to do some missteps along the way. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:06          But, but that generally speaking, the right path, we'll kind of, you've got to shoot though. You've got to take that shot. I've got to think it's a, you know, with Ninja Warrior, one of the things we see is everybody falls, everybody's going to have a misstep. Everyone's gonna have a show, get canceled or something and you just get back up and you learn from it and you keep going. Some people are devastated by that. Some people can't handle that, that failure. And you just have to realize that it's not a failure. It's, it's just this was one thing that didn't work, but hopefully it'll lead you to the next thing that does. Are you shocked at the amount of people that are just afraid to do something special now? They're like, I get it. I mean, again, you know, I, I think I was, I was very lucky to have parents who were incredibly supportive.

Speaker 1:          18:49          So, and I was also like, I think to have been exposed to enough. So even though I, you know, my life had always been very much set towards, you know, sports, school achievement, it was set towards, you know, lawyer finance doctor is something that, there was enough exposure to think that it was possible to have it. Outside of that. So for a random person who's growing up without parents who are encouraging them, I think it's hard. I know how lucky I was to have parents who gave me that sense of confidence and that sense of anything is possible. So for the average person, I, the people who amaze me are the people I, you know, I want that movie. I Tonya about Tonya Harding. One of the things that struck me, there were two things that struck me. One was how remarkable it was that this girl from the trailer parks went into this sport and through sheer will and athleticism, um, made it to the top.

Speaker 1:          19:48          But the thing I didn't like about the movie was that while it purported to tell her story, I felt there was a little winking and judgmental of she still white trash trailer park. And when you told, when you really saw the story of how her mom would hire people to yell at her, I don't know that, you know, you want it to be a sympathetic figure, but at least you understood what this woman overcome and the, for the tenacious, the ferocious to tenacity, she had to persevere in, in this world where she was such an outsider. Those are the people who amaze me. Yeah, I mean, I, I know I was very fortunate to, to have a lot of opportunities that gave me the confidence to take my shot. So look, any other thing was like when I moved out here, I didn't have a family.

Speaker 1:          20:29          I didn't have kids, I didn't have responsibilities. So for that person who's sitting there, those are the people, you know, if you have a wife and kids and you can say, I'm going to risk our future to take the shot, that's, those are the people I think I really salute. Right? It's a little harder to the doctor or the lawyer or the finance guy or the janitor who is like, I got some kids and now I'm quitting and I'm going to do stand up comedy. We've got a different situation. Yeah. And it's, it's, it is hard and it's, it's, uh, you know, one of the things I love with American Ninja Warrior, uh, to shamelessly promote, but, but it's to see these people who have families who have jobs and still find time to train for this ridiculous thing because it's their passion. And when you see that it's, that's what I love about it is because I think it's, it's kind of, it's sums up the American dream of it's just bootstraps.

Speaker 1:          21:18          It's that there's no, there is no secret formula. I'd work hard. Have you seen people that have been to absolutely wrapped up in that thing, whatever that thing may be, be it, be it comedy, be it, you know? Sure, sure. Of course. Of course. You know, I think, I think there's a, you know, there, there's, there's obsession and, and a healthy obsession. Then there's a, you know, a consuming obsession. I think with American Ninja Warrior for the most part, um, there's, uh, there's the community is, there's such a, a positive supportive community that we haven't seen people, you know, go off the rails. And the good news is, look, I don't think any of them are know using pds. They're too expensive. These guys are making a lot of money. I think they really are leading a healthy lifestyle, but more importantly, it's a supportive lifestyle. But certainly with comedy you've seen lots of, you know, lots of friends who've in comedy is a very lonely existence when you're on the road.

Speaker 1:          22:16          Now I'm lucky that with TV I get to do comedy selectively and not have to be out there 40 50 weeks a year in strange cities where you're working two hours a day and 22 hours, you're in a strange city with nothing to do and no one around. And that is, uh, that is a existence that's kind of fun when you're 20. But when you get into your forties is incredibly lonely in your fifties. It's very hard. Yeah. I remember when I was maybe six or seven years into stand up, I was doing some of my first road gigs. I was opening at bananas in Poughkeepsie, New York for bobcat. Stop bragging. Oh, bottom bobcat's great. He was really great actually, and the shows were sold out to the and to move us out of the club. He was in a best western, best western in Poughkeepsie.

Speaker 1:          22:58          Wow. Move us out of the comedy club into a ball room, so it's, you know, I don't know, five, 600 people. I think we did six shows over three nights or something like that, but I remember on the last night that the show ends and I'm alone in Poughkeepsie and it's freezing out and I'm starving and the is closed and there's nothing else. I leave there and I remember I walk up to the vending machine at the end of the hallway and I got a skittles and I laid in bed eating skittles, you know, best what's going to be kipsy after one of your best shows, the best shows of my life. And I was like, I'm actually depressed. Yeah. That's how warp this thing, if you have some of those moments, I remember that I was sitting there and yeah, same thing like in Ohio, walking around going, what am I, what am I doing?

Speaker 1:          23:39          Walking to Mcdonald's at two in the morning. But, but it's, I don't know, I thought if you did you see the documentary comedian with Jerry Seinfeld, but you know the story of the band is like walking through the snow and they see these families celebrating Christmas. What do it live like that and I think there is, there is just a certain, you know, you have a certain mindset of I have to be on stage, but it does get hard and it does get lonely and so it's nice to find something that allows you a little more stable lifestyle. And with, with Ninja warrior, we're really only shooting about 23 days a year. And so the majority of the time I can be around La, me, around my girlfriend and we can lead largely a normal existence and pick and choose when I go out and for stand up.

Speaker 1:          24:19          And so I right now I'm in in in a very fortunate situation but it could change at any moment so I'm also at the same time there's always a fire under my ass. That thing of you always have to be hustling to make sure to find the next thing because as we've seen, things can get taken away from you very quickly. You could say something at any moment that could end your, so this is one of this. This sounds really why one of the things that's most fascinating to me when you make a living with words right now, one of the things that amazes me is that the artistic community and comedians in particular haven't been more vocal in supporting people because again, while I am a clean comic and the shows I do are completely family friendly and and I try to be in the middle of the road, I also know that those people who are out there on the edges, guys like Doug, Stan hope or Jim Norton, those who are pushing those envelopes, they're keeping that area of speech protected because once you've seen an area, once it's taken away.

Speaker 1:          25:24          Once we say, okay, you don't, we can't joke about that. You never get that back. And to me, it's not that I, where I feel the power of comedy is, is the power to talk about very difficult, very touchy subjects in a way, in a disarming way through humor. Now I've had rheumatoid arthritis and I've had cancer, and when I tell those stories, I tell them as funny as possible. Those are stories that you know aren't necessarily the best stories to tell, but it's amazing what you can talk about when you use humor. And when we take some of those topics off the table for comedy, I think we really lose an important tool for us to communicate and for us to find common ground. And that's why it's so amazing to me as we see this now where there's, there's this almost this agreement of, yeah, we're agreeing certain topics now are no longer, you can't joke about it, or am I am, we're going to go back and apply it.

Speaker 1:          26:15          Retroactive. Yeah. Well did you see just in the last couple of weeks that the producers, a family guy said that they're not going to do gay jokes anymore. It's like you guys have done gay. Everyone has, I mean they're, they're one of their iconic bits. Was that musical musical. Cotillion musicals, but which one was it? Everyone has aids. Oh, ever. Yeah. David's aids. You know where they, they just kept repeating it. Seth Macfarlane and again, it's like, or every character is a ridiculous stereotype, right? It's like which groups? How do we decide which groups we are not going to make jokes about these really actually equality is that you, everyone will make fun of everyone. That's what real equality. I think South Park does that better than anyone. Whether everything is fair game or nothing is very, now having said that, if you want to evolve, if you say, you know what, I no longer want to tell those jokes, that's fine.

Speaker 1:          27:00          More power to you make the choice of your own volition. Whatever you find funny is great. Maybe you've had some personal awakened whatever it is. But I just think, again, what I don't like is the idea of people saying you can't joke about it. Like if you choose not to, great. Again, I choose not to joke about a lot of things. I've just not comfortable. You know, I always picture my grandma in the crowd or my mom. I want people to be entertained. I don't want to alienate people. That's me. But I love listening to some of the filthiest comics talk about things and, or joke about cancer or things that have impacted me. And, and I find it hilarious and I find it Cathartic to laugh about it. And I think because someone else doesn't, you know, may have had a bad experience with it, doesn't mean that someone shouldn't be able to joke about it.

Speaker 1:          27:46          Um, I, I just think that this is a really interesting time because social media gives voice to people and we see where one or two people protesting can change a network. And that's what's, what's remarkable is that as we really don't see these networks saying, you know, 99% of people may not care. They came to this smaller percentage. And again, often it'd be nice for them to say, okay boycott, we stand behind our performers. We stand behind this content. Yeah. So it's a weird time to be a comic. I mean, so I, I did stand up for 12 years in New York, then I came here, I started doing this, I was doing something else that I liked. I stopped doing it. This can be even more dangerous though day. So now I started again in June and now I'm selling out clubs all over the country and I don't care that much.

Speaker 1:          28:32          So I'm having the most fun I've ever had on stage. I do an hour and I'm messing around with the crowd. And how did you have people coming out to see you? [inaudible] is the best. So that way, that's a game changer because when people come out and they, you know, they're there for you, they know something about you, you can do insight or stuff as opposed to just being the eighth white guy at a 12th comics and they're like, who the hell? That guy was hilarious. What was the name of, you know, and then, and then that's it. But, um, but it's an odd time to be doing stand up knowing that people could be in the crowd recording you waiting to take you down. And they are, and you know, and that's the workshop that that's, you know, that's not where you're, that's what you're learning the medicine where you're performing the surgery.

Speaker 1:          29:09          It is. And, and, and no other, you know, Jim Norton, I give so much credit for, for talking about, um, how comics are held to a different standard than any other artists. So say you're an actor and you go on Svu and you play the most reprehensible character. Nobody believes that you are that person. Right? But as a comedian, what they don't understand is sometimes you will say something hyperbolic. You will say something ironically to make a point. It's not what you actually believe, but because it's Dave Ruben saying it, they take you literally going, wait, you missed the entire of the joke. You missed the Joe Guy. My point was the exact opposite. But nobody will give you the credit for the context. And people often just see the written words and it's, it's really unfortunate. And, and, and again, what people don't understand, and, and Jim was just talking about this with Judd Apatow in the case of Louis C K is jokes don't spring fully formed.

Speaker 1:          30:00          Jokes can take weeks, months, years to be honed. It's so hard, especially if it's a topic that is delicate to find the phrasing and to say, I'm going to tackle a subject that nobody thinks I can make funny and I'm going to find a way to make it funny. It's going to take me awhile and I'm going to stumble through and I'm going to get some groans and I can get some people alienated. Not me. I talk about various, you know, ridiculous things. But yeah, I appreciate those comments. Who can go there and say, take a subject that I would say, I will never laugh at this. You made me laugh at this. Despite that, then I think Doug Stanhope is one of the best examples of someone who will take the most taboo subjects and make you laugh despite you might be vehemently opposed to the way he thinks, but he's funny.

Speaker 1:          30:44          Yeah. And when you do that, there's, it's such a way of opening up your mind to saying, okay, let me, let me, let me rethink these things. Or maybe it doesn't, but it, but it just proves that I think anything can be funny. Anything can be fair game. And I think it's important that we allow comedians to have this full range of words and emotions to use because that's, we're talking about the human condition. And I think comedians really do have a great job in that we can bring up some of these topics in a way that, you know, when you see it happen on Tucker Carlson, people might go to fisticuffs, but in the comedy club you'll laugh about it and go, you know what? Maybe, maybe my crazy uncles, not so crazy. Maybe we can talk. Yeah, well that's why it's so strange that I'm doing this because I feel like they dragged me into it because I've seen a lot of comics who, I love that if become the word police, they've become the hysterical.

Speaker 1:          31:36          Right? Who on Twitter who are calling for books not to be printed and all of this stuff. [inaudible] I always think it's like, man, if Karlyn was alive, what would he be doing? Right, right. He'd be making funny shit. Patrice O'neil, same guy or, or, or would he be demanding that people be booted off? Platforms are silenced or otherwise and it's like what a strange place for an artist. And you see eventually it consumes them. Eventually it comes back to bite them because nobody is perfect. Nobody, nobody is without a flaw. Nobody's without, you know, having nobody has led their lives. Like, Jesus, we, we've all done something or said something or tried to make a joke that at some point if you went back people would say that's wrong and you'd be like, okay, but that was 10 years ago or any, it is an odd time.

Speaker 1:          32:22          I think that that people aren't particularly, comedians aren't more supportive instead are really leading this book burning charge. Well that's why this, this uh, family guy thing irked me so much. It's like, you guys did this for 20 years. I'm not even mad. I don't know if sets even that in front of the, I don't even know if he's that much involved in the show anymore, but like it's like you did this for 20 years and now it's like you're on the other side of success kind of. So like, are you, are we a more tolerant society because we're not going to joke about certain people now. Does that make us more tolerant? I like that. It's interesting is odd to me. You know, it's really, it's a, it's a funny thing where, and I'd love to have him here and that's not even a, it's really about a judgment on him.

Speaker 1:          33:00          I just want to deal with this shit. Right? Why this and then what about what other topics? Right? So it's like, okay, so you can't make fun of gays. Like should we get the, where's the list? Where's the list loans? That list, who owns who judges it, who's, you know, and, and, and, and that list is shifting. And what's crazy is, you see, it's not the joke, it's who says it. Yeah. Because you know the same person, two people can say the same joke. One person gets celebrated, one person gets vilified. So it's not the words, it's who's saying that? And that's wrong. Like it should be. Absolutely. It should be. Either this is a fair game or not. It shouldn't be based on what we're getting to is, you know, papers please, you have to have the papers to prove that you are of this group.

Speaker 1:          33:42          So you can talk about this topic. And it's like either the topic is fair game where it's not either everyone can talk about it. Uh, that's what I believe. But again, you know, I realize I'm, I'm, I'm the white male, so I, I, you know, I also am, oh wait, listen, I don't know. Oh No, wait, what? I've been with you this whole time. Why should you shut up and listen, I always, you're doing that with a little tongue in cheek is I always feel the need. This is one of the what I hate that. Oh, now you're doing it. You're going to fill in the details, your coffee, you feel they need tissue caveats where you feel the need to say I, you know, I, I don't like, uh, homophobia, but I think family guy can make jokes who unit where it's like, of course now you know, where you normally would assume that's the concession you're making.

Speaker 1:          34:32          Just cause you're a good person. I think I used to do a lot of that too. And now I'm just sort of over. It's like, well, it's because you own your platform and I see might be watching this. So, right. But nothing, you've said he's homophobic. Obviously we're talking about the nature jokes or, or that they don't want to Apu and the Simpsons anymore. Well, you see it's craziness. What I don't like also was the guilt by association where, you know, I thought Mike Rowe said that someone was criticizing micro for going on, I don't know, rush Limbaugh and then Rachel Maddow, you know, and people were complaining on both sides. He's like, going on a show doesn't mean I implicitly endorse every single stance that person has. It means I'm talking to somebody, I'm expressing my opinions. They may have different opinions. It's a discussion and I just wish we would allow more of that because otherwise all you're saying is people I approve of talking to people I approve of.

Speaker 1:          35:19          So all you're hearing is what you want to hear. Yeah. I think that's what we miss is reasoned people having reason discussions. Unfortunately, when you turn on the TV, we know hyperbole, hyperbole moves the needle. I, you know, yeah, it's an amazing run, but at least it's not, you know, politically and, and you see that light. I think that's, it's a, you know, I, I, and I, I told you before I give you full credit what I love is, and Joe Rogan does the same thing. I think you guys are willing to have people on you might disagree with and you're not looking for a gotcha moment. You're not looking for confrontation. You're looking for understanding, like, help me understand your position. Let me help you understand my position. Maybe there's agreement, maybe there isn't. But for the listeners, at least they're being informed. There's, they're hearing different points of view.

Speaker 1:          36:06          Does it strike you as odd that that seems so unique these days? Like I've had people in here, I think people don't seek it out. Yeah. I think, you know, and I think, um, I, I, you know, we look at the universities, we look at places where I think people are taught, you know, diversity of thought or a different thought that there, that there is one right daughter that you shouldn't have these discussions. And I think that's, you know, we've always, I mean I look at, I look at medicine and, and it's, it's so amazing how medicine, you know, you think you deal in absolutes, you think you deal in complete science, black and white, but we see a new study talked about sunscreen, how actually sunscreen may not be healthy because we, the rally is melanoma, which is completely devil, only about 1% of skin cancers and it is awful, but people are putting so much sunscreen on, they're not getting any of the beneficial vitamin D. We're seeing an increase in cardiac disease.

Speaker 1:          36:57          Cardiac disease is killing so many more people than melanoma. So now dermatologists are thinking maybe we shouldn't be wearing as much sunscreen. So you see these truths that we thought were absolute being challenged because people look at the data, they look at empirical things when it comes to life and death. We're able to do that when it comes to political topics, which are just as important. I think it's much harder to do it because they're so politically charged that people don't want to look at the data. They want to look at how they feel about them or are these emotions are what it stirs up. And if someone presents a counterargument you're dismissed or debunked or d platform. Yeah. What do you consider yourself politically? I think I'm, I'm a little more, you know, I, I am Vietnam free speech. I am vehemently, people should live their lives the way they want to live them.

Speaker 1:          37:46          Um, I think I'm moderate to right. Would, would, would probably be it. I don't like the government taxing us to, and I don't think the government is great at a lot of things like health care. Um, but at the same time, you know, really audio function in Hollywood with the set of ideas. And here's the other thing is I tend not to talk politics because it isn't my purview. Might like I'm an entertainer and I'm the last person. They, people are getting their political opinions from the host of American Ninja Warrior. I think, again, I think for me, I what I like is, you know, for me, I never talked politics on stage. I never, you know, I would rather bring people together. I'm not looking to alienate people or, or try to be clever. It's, I think that's, I leave to Lewis Black or guys who are very good at that.

Speaker 1:          38:37          That's, that's her area to tackle the political humor. That's just not my thing. Um, I, I think I, again, I just think in Hollywood, the one thing I think that is so important is, is the exchange of ideas. And that's what I think is being compromised right now. And that's the thing that I try to, um, the year that I really want people to, to fight for. Because again, once we see that ground, we're not getting it back. All right, so let's shift to this binge. You're warring warrior warrior for something they love. When you say that it, so it started out as a joke. It actually, and you can hear I'm hoarse. I, I am a very loud adds a little something. Well, so this, this was, I was in hosting the Arlo pro strongman world series and Santa Monica, so it was five hours nonstop of, Oh look at him lifting this weight.

Speaker 1:          39:28          And when I went into the show, uh, so for those who don't know, American American Ninja Warrior started out, it's a, it's a, it was a Japanese show, Saas Gay. It was poured into America and dubbed. It started doing so well on g four. They made an American version in the second season. They realized they had something and they're like, okay, we're going to put some money into this and we're bringing in the new host. And they found me and I think they were looking for a Joe Rogan. There's some bigger guys, but I don't care. You know, it's like the lights come up at 2:00 AM in the morning and then like the pretty girl goes, all right, I'll go home with you. I might've been your last choice. I'm just happy to be here. Rogan's got enough stuff. So I started doing this show and um, you know, we would be going for eight or nine hours a day calling me runs and it's all 10 out of 10 because it was based on the Japanese show.

Speaker 1:          40:10          And so my, my sports calling technique comes just from years of watching sports, watching the Japanese show and being an enthusiastic, I am always yeah, hyperbolic. But it was really straining on the voice since we were shooting these ins and outs where it's coming up next on American Ninja Warrior and I was a little gravelly in the, and so I was kind of making a point like, hey my, my voice is kind of shot. So I was like American Ninja Warrior and the petitioner was like, Oh, do that, do more of that. So this is like in the fourth year, if you watch the earlier seasons I'm like, uh, next on American name. I can't even do it cause I'm rally. There was, it was none of that. So it was just kind of born out of blowing out my voice and now it's become like the signature thing that I love to do anything for your voice.

Speaker 1:          40:51          I, a lot of my friends who are still had gone to a lot of voice coaches and tried to, obviously they really were so effective. It's um, but I mean even on the medical side of things, just to make sure you're not blowing out your book, you know, I see an ENT on a regular basis. I'll do, so we'll go to Vegas and we'll do six out of seven days where we're shooting at night, but it's still a hundred degrees in dust for, you know, eight hours in a row, 10 out of 10 energy. And those, I'll do ivs and anti inflammatories and steroids just to try to maintain the vocal cords in vocal rest. Um, but I, you know, you, you, I'm, I'm going back trying to learn better technique. It's, it's almost like rock singers. I look at Brian Johnson from ACDC who was like, you know, that guy was doing it at 70 the most vocally taxing way.

Speaker 1:          41:37          So that's one of the things is, is trying to learn how to preserve the voice to work for that long. Speaking of rock stars, I saw this morning that you tweeted something about Steve Perry from journey. Now I love journey, love, love, love you. You're my favorite band in the world. I love Steve Perry. I love the fact that he's back now. Cause he, cause he had had some voice stuff actually. Speaking of guys. Yeah. He, I mean he basically lost his voice for a while. I can't say this completely on camera. Suffice to say he kind of lives near here and I may remain and I know the Mexican joint that he goes to. So, uh, so today we're going to pull people to this. Not Iceland's birthday it Steve Perry's birth. They say Terri's birthday. So Steve Birthday and I'm not, I'm not lying. So for my thready Edward, they never met him.

Speaker 1:          42:25          Yeah. For I, I've been a journey fan since I can remember. And, and I, for my 30th birthday at the Brown Derby, the last night of the Brown Derby, we closed it down. I hired a journey cover band and I had them play it and I still have this fantasy that someday on my birthday I'm going to be singing faithfully or don't stop believing in. All of a sudden another guy's gonna walk out behind me and it's going to be Steve Perry and we're going to do a duet together and arm and arm to singing like faithfully at the end. Yeah. That's my family. Steve, if you're watching how your, I hope he's a huge fan of Ninja warrior cause he, I just listened to that voice. Yeah. I think he had one of the most unique, yeah. And Arnelle Pinatas. Remarkable story. It's an incredible story, but you listen to Steve and you listen to the passion and the range and just the unique notes that guy would hit.

Speaker 1:          43:16          It was incredible. I, I'm just, I love journey. I loved their songs. I love the eighties I love the unabashed passion and, and, and, and glory. There's no cynicism in it. It just awesome. Every, every time I do stand up now or when I do like a public speaking thing and the, but you know, right before you start, they go, well, what's going on, do you want to go up to, and the only thing that always pops into my mind is separate ways by journey that, that beginning, oh my God, that video when they're playing the keyboard on the wall, so much power, so much power close chains that by, I mean it's just, you know, yeah. You don't stop believing or any way you wanted it. And they have so many great songs that when you just hear it, they're just toe tappers. And I mean, granted, you know, if you grew up in the 80s it was the soundtrack of our youth.

Speaker 1:          43:58          So, so much of it takes us back to there. But um, Steve Perry is just a, he's one of, he's been one of the, one of the great artists, I think what journey has done and, and I would love, I saw them up in San Francisco and show Schoen was shutting him out. And I thought, I wonder if Steve's going to come out on stage for the, for the long of they didn't have, yeah, well they just got inducted to the rock and yeah, I, it's, you know, a lot of bad blood to I think get over, but, but yeah. Anyway, that's a sidebar for a side. Let's get back to that Ninja thing. Um, so like what, like what's some of some sort of insider something that you can give us about what these guys are like that, that are doing this of, you know, it's, it's a, what you see is what the, the amazing thing is they really are the people you see.

Speaker 1:          44:46          They are these people who are incredibly hardworking and so generous and supportive of one another. We had, um, a woman Maggie Thorn and she was, she was open about that. She was going through a really tough divorce and she has three little girls. And uh, during that time she started traveling around the country, visiting her Ninja sisters as she called them, people like Barclays Docket and Jessie Flexible breadcrumb Michelle warranty. And she just talked about how had she not had this community, she, she wasn't sure what she would've done to get through it. And you see it's been unlike any other sport. I mean a, we've only had one winner, intense seasons. Like what other show? Like I talked about, like at the end of America's got talent, you know, they'd come out and go, well it turns out America doesn't have talent there. And yet, you know, it's a show where every single person who's competing on the show has fallen at one point.

Speaker 1:          45:38          So it's a show that would seem to be filled with failure. And yet when you watch it, you feel like you're seeing more success than ever. And I think we've, we've stumbled into a formula where you see it's these are really everyday. They're truly everyday people. They're us. They are people who have jobs, have families who've dealt with substance abuse or cancer or the loss of a loved one, whatever it is, loss of a job and yet are trying to work through it. And you see the obstacle courses, just a metaphor for the obstacles they've overcome in life. And you know, we tell the, the thing we do, I think better than most shows is in 90 seconds we give you a reason to care about these people and then we show you, we let you cheer for them and it's the Olympic formula of, I don't give, I don't care about curling, but you told me this guy works at ups.

Speaker 1:          46:27          He's got a new baby on the way and it's like a Bruce Springsteen song. Then when he's up there breast and I'm like, Ooh, go buddy. You Go Flynn's Jurgen from Norway where you, you just find yourself cheering for him and I think it's this, it's this thing of one of the things I love, I love doing the, like the strong man competition or Ninja or I work with Travis Pastrana, this evil thing. I love watching people push the envelope or do things they didn't think they could do. I love people seeing people have their moment because they, one of the things in life that helps define you, that helps give you the confidence is to have a Superbowl moment, to have to have a moment where you, you, when you're victorious in something, whether it's you get a job or you get a promotion or you, you know, you literally win a game or whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          47:12          When you have a moment where you've worked so hard, you overcame the obstacles and you've got that moment where you're, you're, you get the trophy, you get that feeling of wow, the hard work pays off and to have those moments, and I think Ninja Warrior is filled with that and for so many of the people, it's not about getting to the end and winning the money. It's getting on the course for, we had a girl, Daniela Bright, I think it was season six, I was live tweeting the show and she said, you know, if I ever get out of bed, I'd love to be on the show. I'm like, why are you in bed? She's like, well, I have stage three breast cancer and I'm not sure how it's gonna turn out. And so I sent her a tee shirt and I said, well, we'll be here waiting for you the next year.

Speaker 1:          47:50          Wow. She's on the course. She goes out on the first obstacle and comes out with the biggest smile on her face. And, and you know, our sideline reporter was like, how are you feeling? She goes, I won. Yeah, I'm here. I feel amazing. And to see that, to see someone, you know, what a perspective on life when we so often get caught up and I did the Patriots win, or who cares, you know, those are real battles that these people are having that we're all gonna face. They're all going to be touched by. And to remember that, you know, in the face of those you can still struggle and overcome and find your little victories. I think that's the message of Ninja where and why the show's resonated. What do you make of the fact that Ninja Warrior or what Rogan's doing with MMA, like people doing physical things seems to be actually like cool.

Speaker 1:          48:36          Again, I think it's, it's, it's, you know, it's a primitive part of us. It's the gladiators. It's, it's, it's also, you know, particularly as we get more and more static as we sit around on our phones, we miss that. You miss that as a kid. You miss playing. You miss that feeling of, one of the things that I know rheumatoid arthritis took away from me was my sense of physical wellbeing. That ability to spring out of bed and feel like you could run around and run for hours and, and it's, it's, it's that idea of to see people achieving something physically at a high level inspires you and makes you feel motivated. I think that that is possible. Especially, you know, MMA or NFL, we love watching exceptional performances with Ninja. What I think the appeal is, is the idea of that could be me, maybe I have a chance to turn this around and, and get back in shape one last time and do something amazing.

Speaker 1:          49:31          And I think that's, you know, we're, we're looking for inspiration. We're looking for hope. I think that's part of humanity is we want to, we want to be inspired. We want to find that spark and, and wake up and feel like there's hope in the world. And that's why I love doing what I do. I love, you know, with Ninja Warrior, with my comedy, I want to, I want people to leave feeling better. Um, uh, you know, again, Love Stan, hope, love, Arusha, fair love. Those guys who can tear a crowd apart. Love it. I can't do it. I suck out. I've tried doing roasts, I bombed, I'm so bad. I was just like, I'm sorry. I don't know how to install you to your face or a socket. This make fun of me. And you know, it's, it's just, it's, I think that's part of kind of finding authentically where you are and what, what resonates with you and where you're comfortable.

Speaker 1:          50:17          And that's one of the things know we talk about people hear this in comedy, finding your voice, who you are and what you're comfortable with. And that is one of the hardest things to do because so often we emulate those, we respect, but that's not us. You really have to dig inside and say, where do I live? What's my sense of humor? And Gary Gulman right now, if you're a comedian or even if you're just interested in expression, Gary Gulman is putting on a clinic since January 1st he's been putting out a writing tip every day and they'd been gold. And one of the best was he put out Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay on self reliance and it talked about, so often we see our thoughts reflected in someone else and think they're genius. But when it comes through us, we dismissed them because it's ours. We think it's common and it's like trust yourself, trust that your enough.

Speaker 1:          51:04          It's you know, then paraphrasing here. But I thought it was just such a good for someone who's creative. So often you think of something like, oh, that's not as funny as what Patrice would've said if George Carlin would have said. But it's like no, trust your way and you're on the path and just keep developing it. So before we wrap up, you mentioned, so you mentioned that you had cancer and you have rheumatoid. Yeah, that's the thing. You can't really, right. It's no cure yet. You control basically. Um, no. Let's just talk a little bit about dealing with some serious health stuff. Cause someone, yeah, the average person watching this, looking at you like you're jack than you and you look healthy and all those things, but you've, you've lived through, it's about it and you talk about it. Yeah. Well, you know, and that was one of the things.

Speaker 1:          51:42          So, you know, having been a doctor or as my dad points are, you're still a doctor champ. Um, [inaudible] when I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, I found out what it's like to be a patient. And you go online and you look things up, you see the worst case scenario because that's the textbook they show you, you know, the typically deformed joints and you think this is my future and it gives you this sinking feeling. And I realized that's why I was so important for me to be out there, visible telling my story. Um, so that people would see there, there there's alternatives. You know, not everyone living with the disease is destroyed by it. We have incredible new treatments. And just the other day I got a call from someone who I'd been baseball with in college, a new, and, uh, he thought he had ra and he was just, he was petrified and it was so, and he's like, I was just googling it and I found out, he's like, I didn't know you had it.

Speaker 1:          52:40          I just googled it and found you had it because you'd talked about it. And I thought, Oh, you know, that's why I tell it. So that this person who called me up and I could tell my story and say, look, there's hope. There's treatments. Don't worry about this. You know, whatever it is you're facing. They're incredible treatments out there. And that's why I went on celebrity apprentice. That was my charity. We raised $1 million to help with research. And so it's, um, look, I, I would much prefer not to have rheumatoid arthritis. And what level of pain are you going through when you realized? So it started, it started with pain in my hand. And um, it just, it's for those who don't know, Ra essentially is an autoimmune disease where my body attacks my joints and the immune system erodes the joints and causes joint destruction, inflammation, and can impact the Oregons, the stiffness in the back and neck.

Speaker 1:          53:27          And, and, uh, so I went from, you know, being, working out five or six days a week to not working out at all. I had, um, my feet were in pain where I was wearing clogs and limping. I couldn't sleep. I was sleeping like 14 hours, but I was always exhausted. I gained 55 pounds. I felt like a shell of a man. I, I, I was physically ruined. And then it took 18 months to get the diagnosis and I was going to doctors. I was having blood work. It just took that long for the blood work to convert. And when I started the treatment, I got my life back. Um, and I didn't realize how sick I was and not just physically, but emotionally how drained I was. And the thing that kept me going was comedy, was that, you know, the thing that I would get out of bed for, the thing that would motivate me was to go out and laugh and to realize Norman cousins was right.

Speaker 1:          54:19          Like the Catharsis of laughter and how, how, how good those endorphins are, how important it is. Um, I can't overstate it and that's one of the things I've talked about is, you know, for people who are sick is taught telling your story because so often people with the disease field defined by their disease and one of the things I've done is tried to make my stories what I talk about, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer. I want people to laugh. I'm going to move me to laugh about it because if they do, they know I'm okay with it and I am okay with it. Like cancer, I'm 10 years, I'm cured in the Ra, I've made my peace with it. I'm, I'm doing well on my medications and I'm living the best life I can with it. So people take their cues from you. So teaching people how to tell their story because so many people, when they tell a story of illness, they feel they can see PT and people's eyes and that they may not want that.

Speaker 1:          55:09          But it's hard to, to learn how to tell your story in a way that says I'm okay with it. And that's one of the things I've been working on is trying to figure out how to help people take, take charge over their disease by doing what you can control is how you tell your story and trying to use, for me it's humor, but for whatever they're, there are so many tools, uh, for people who are dealing with chronic illness, um, to try to make it, you know, don't let it define your life because it's very easy and it's very easy to, to fall into the victim, you know, and feeling sad for yourself. That'd be a shame if you did that. Wilford Brimley you might have diabetes feel sorry for yourself. You don't, all right, so do what makes you happy. That's how we started this thing. Live the best life that you can. That's how we're going to do, and I think you're doing it today, so I appreciate you having me on. Right on that. It's been a pleasure chatting with you. Thank you.
