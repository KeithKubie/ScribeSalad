[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.450
EMILY FORTUNA: Hello, and
welcome to "The Boring Show."

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.160
I'm Emily Fortuna,
again, and with us

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.310
is a very special guest.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.760
LARA MARTIN: I'm Lara Martin.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.930
I am a [INAUDIBLE] developer
specialized on Android,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.747
working in a very, very small
company in Berlin, Germany.

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:25.580
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.922
I'm so glad to have
you with us today.

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:28.880
LARA MARTIN: Thank you.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.560
EMILY FORTUNA: As you
can see, our setup

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.476
is a little different.

00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:33.980
And that's because we're not
shooting in our normal studio.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.825
This is "Boring
Show" on the road.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:40.700
[LAUGHS] Lara was giving
a presentation with me,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.180
and so we figured we would shoot
a super special episode here

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.500
today.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.430
So today, what
we're hoping to do

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.960
is we're going to
talk a little bit

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.000
about the Flutter, inspector
and how it can be used.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.130
I think it's a
under-appreciated feature.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.260
And then, as promised,
we will get back to,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.890
on the Hacker News app, how
to implement keeping the page

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.240
scroll position.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.430
And we'll be doing a
little bit of refactoring

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.870
with that, as well.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.211
So Lara, let's take a
look at Flutter Inspector.

00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:16.960
LARA MARTIN: Sure.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.250
OK, right now I have
the project running.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.870
I'm going to close this.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.260
And we should be able to see
exactly the widget tree we

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.900
have displayed on our emulator.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.650
OK, we're going to
refresh, just in case.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.483
EMILY FORTUNA: Sure.

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:39.270
LARA MARTIN: OK,
everything is good.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.500
So what do we have here?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.921
Do you want to see the
widget tree, or options, or--

00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.170
EMILY FORTUNA: Give me a tour.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.950
Tell me [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.280
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.210
EMILY FORTUNA: Show me what
you think is [INAUDIBLE] first.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.668
LARA MARTIN: So
the first thing you

00:01:51.668 --> 00:01:54.950
see when you open the Flutter
Inspector is basically

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.830
the widget tree that you
have on your app running.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.180
So here, we see that
we have a MaterialApp,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.252
we have our MyHomePage--

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:08.960
EMILY FORTUNA: Very
exciting right there.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.520
LARA MARTIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.960
And a Scaffold.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.150
Surprise, right?

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.557
And we see a bunch
of other widgets.

00:02:17.557 --> 00:02:18.890
EMILY FORTUNA: All the articles.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.910
LARA MARTIN: Exactly.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.210
They're the same.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.040
So I really like these.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.510
So we can get to sometimes
see bugs, something

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.124
that is strange on the screen.

00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:34.040
EMILY FORTUNA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.860
LARA MARTIN: And you can--

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.884
I think it's tapping
on this icon here.

00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:41.300
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh,
it highlights--

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.630
LARA MARTIN: You can
basically select something.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.265
Like ListView,
what's the ListView?

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:50.390
EMILY FORTUNA: Where is it?

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.100
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.430
In the beginning, I didn't
understand what was a scaffold,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.945
or what was exactly.

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:00.070
EMILY FORTUNA: And you're
like, it's a whole thing.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.790
LARA MARTIN: It's a whole thing.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.081
EMILY FORTUNA: I'm so confused.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.640
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.700
Straightforward.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.533
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:08.180
So in case you're still
confused about the scaffold,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.650
it's basically sort
of an outline--

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.979
it's providing
scaffolding, if that's

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.270
kind of an unusual word to use.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.220
It's basically
providing structure

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.880
for where different things
are laid out in your app

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.380
on the overall screen.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.670
So it tells you that the
app bar should be up on top.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.780
And your body should
be the main part, and--

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.100
LARA MARTIN: Exactly.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.120
EMILY FORTUNA:
--that sort of thing.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.680
LARA MARTIN: If we
collapse things,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.580
we can see that we have
basically three parts.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.150
The body, this part.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.407
And then we have the app bar on
top, and the bottom navigation.

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:43.240
EMILY FORTUNA: Cool.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.990
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.540
That's really cool when you
don't know what a widget is.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.610
Let's say, I don't
know exactly what's

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.890
this square I'm seeing on the
screen, and you tap on it,

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.857
and you can divide it.

00:03:54.857 --> 00:03:55.690
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.682
LARA MARTIN: Because you
see what it's been rendered.

00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:00.640
EMILY FORTUNA: So yeah.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.390
I can imagine this
being super useful,

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.070
especially if you're
working with a code

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.722
base that is new to you.

00:04:07.722 --> 00:04:08.430
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.640
EMILY FORTUNA:
And you're like, I

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.056
don't know how this is written,
where does this code live?

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.105
How can you tap on--

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:19.866
is there a mode that you need
to do to tap on the screen

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:21.490
so that it highlights
in the inspector?

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.240
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.580
So basically, you
enable it by clicking

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.030
on this first icon, where it
says Toggle Select Widget Mode.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.050
EMILY FORTUNA: OK, cool.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.060
And then when you tap, it
will automatically [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.143
LARA MARTIN: Now it's off.

00:04:32.143 --> 00:04:38.380
But if we turn it on,
then we can select things.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.120
And for example, this one.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120
Or maybe, let's do--

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.220
do I want to lay an
icon on the app bar?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.330
Maybe not.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.040
Ah, because we are expanding.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.100
Yeah, this is a bit
difficult, because where

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.292
we are expanding items.

00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:55.500
EMILY FORTUNA: Is that a bug?

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.168
LARA MARTIN: Oh, it
changed the color, even.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.584
EMILY FORTUNA:
What just happened?

00:05:02.584 --> 00:05:06.584
[LAUGHS] Is that a
bug in the inspector?

00:05:06.584 --> 00:05:07.500
Or do you think it's--

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.333
LARA MARTIN: I know.

00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:09.500
We opened one of the items--

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.249
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, we
opened the web view.

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:12.300
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.567
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, OK.

00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:15.150
LARA MARTIN: Everything
is highlighted

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.280
in different colors.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.760
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.910
LARA MARTIN: Oh, OK.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.350
But yeah.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.717
Basically, you turn on,
and you can select items.

00:05:25.717 --> 00:05:27.300
EMILY FORTUNA: And
so then over here--

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.091
LARA MARTIN: And then
you see, for example,

00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:31.420
this item we have
highlighted, it just

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.210
stacks here in the tree.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.210
And then you can see
more properties on it.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.210
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, cool.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.220
Are they editable,
the properties?

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.490
Could you tweak things?

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.990
LARA MARTIN: Not
sure, to be honest.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.867
I haven't tried yet.

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.200
EMILY FORTUNA: We could try now.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.760
LARA MARTIN: Maybe we can.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.960
EMILY FORTUNA: I guess
technically, with hot reload,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.960
it's not super necessary,
but I'm just curious.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.460
No.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.000
LARA MARTIN: No.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.700
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, but you
could go to the source.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.220
Click on that.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.470
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.020
That's very useful.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.160
EMILY FORTUNA: And
then you can edit it.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.532
LARA MARTIN: Also from here.

00:05:54.532 --> 00:05:55.740
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, perfect.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.890
LARA MARTIN: So you can
go to the source code,

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.800
and then go through it.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.520
EMILY FORTUNA: Ah, nice.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.490
That's super handy.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.300
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.015
EMILY FORTUNA: What are the
other buttons up on the Flutter

00:06:09.015 --> 00:06:10.440
Inspector?

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.080
LARA MARTIN: Oh, wait.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.765
I'm clicking things,
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:16.060
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, it
keeps jumping around.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.580
LARA MARTIN: OK, let's go back.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.420
Wait.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.770
No.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.590
So if you have to refresh,
because the [INAUDIBLE] you see

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.377
is not the same as the one on
the screen, you can refresh.

00:06:32.377 --> 00:06:33.210
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.390
So I guess that's probably--

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.800
I should talk to the
Flutter Inspector

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.760
creator, who sits nearby me,
but I haven't asked him--

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.590
I'm guessing that's
for performance reasons

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.860
that it doesn't
auto-update all the time.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.735
LARA MARTIN: Exactly.

00:06:46.735 --> 00:06:47.820
Yeah.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.490
So I'm not sure this one.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.550
Performance Overlay.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.890
I didn't play with it yet much.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.564
EMILY FORTUNA: So that is--

00:06:57.564 --> 00:06:59.480
LARA MARTIN: I'm going
to disconnect this one.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.620
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.370
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.237
So it will be, I guess, looking
at the performance of your app.

00:07:06.237 --> 00:07:07.070
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.180
And I know a little
bit about this one.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.560
So it moves when you
are doing an animation,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.020
because checking to see
that the animations are

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.620
in 60 frames per second.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.470
And so, in this case, if
we're not moving anything,

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.350
the little bar there
is not doing anything.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.450
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.283
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:07:25.283 --> 00:07:27.700
I think if you scroll,
you'll see it go, too.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.620
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.750
EMILY FORTUNA: And
then one other thing

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.320
that I got a question
about earlier, and just

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.730
want to clarify.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.800
So someone was complaining that
their app was not 60 frames

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.570
per second, very smooth.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.990
And I was like, are you
running it in debug mode?

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.220
And they were like, what's that?

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.240
So what's going on is, when
you run your app normally

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.440
to develop so you can get hot
reload, it is in debug mode.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.530
And you'll see there's a
banner at the top there

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.820
that says Debug.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.150
LARA MARTIN: Debug.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.970
EMILY FORTUNA: And so
to enable hot reload,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.290
your performance is going
to be a little bit slower.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.920
So testing this performance
overlay in debug mode

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.530
it's probably not the
most informative thing.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.460
So if you want to
test performance,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.340
you can run the release
version, and then you

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.189
can check the performance
overlay of that.

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:24.230
LARA MARTIN: Interesting.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.470
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.140
LARA MARTIN: So what
else do we have?

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.780
We have a button to
switch the platform.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.980
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, yeah.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.450
LARA MARTIN: I
really like this one.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.650
Right now, I'm running
an Android emulator,

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.747
so all the behaviors
are Android-like.

00:08:44.747 --> 00:08:45.580
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.525
LARA MARTIN: The
scrolling, and opening.

00:08:52.257 --> 00:08:53.090
We should see this--

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.370
EMILY FORTUNA: It's
in the transition.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.690
LARA MARTIN: Yeah, the
transition is the Android one.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.899
So you see also the
title is on a side.

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:00.690
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:06.870
LARA MARTIN: But if
we enable the switch,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.790
now I have an iOS simulator.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.750
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.480
So this is super cool,
especially if you're developing

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.980
on, say, a Windows machine,
where you can't actually

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.690
set up iOS development,
but you want

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.400
to see what your app looks like.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:23.460
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.610
EMILY FORTUNA: Just
toggle that button.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.810
LARA MARTIN: Or you don't
have an iPhone, like me--

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.390
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.056
LARA MARTIN: --and
you want to check out

00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:31.530
how it's working on an iPhone.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.260
EMILY FORTUNA: Well, you know,
you can set up a simulator.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:34.968
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:09:34.968 --> 00:09:36.590
Yes, I do have.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.629
But it's to have
only one running.

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:39.420
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.590
Save yourself time.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.720
Totally.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.840
LARA MARTIN: And
then we basically can

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.310
see that the behavior
is iOS, basically.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.800
We see the bouncing on the
[INAUDIBLE],, for example.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.135
Transitions, iOS.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.910
EMILY FORTUNA: Nice.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.950
Very cool.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.150
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.566
EMILY FORTUNA:
What else is there?

00:10:05.566 --> 00:10:07.240
LARA MARTIN: And
then, what else?

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.660
This one is painting basically
the widgets you have,

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.440
the layout.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.730
Like marking--

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.980
EMILY FORTUNA: Where they are?

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.030
LARA MARTIN: --the limits--

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.946
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, OK.

00:10:19.946 --> 00:10:22.830
LARA MARTIN:
--between the widgets.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:29.820
In this case, we can see that
we have, for example, the logo

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.210
of the Hacker News.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.184
It's making all the widgets
and the buttons around it.

00:10:36.184 --> 00:10:37.100
EMILY FORTUNA: Got it.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.280
LARA MARTIN: Like for
example, these lines,

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.074
I bet it means that we have
something that scrolls.

00:10:45.074 --> 00:10:46.990
EMILY FORTUNA: I don't
know, that giant arrow.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.910
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.460
And for example, that
these buttons are centered.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.650
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, OK.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.647
LARA MARTIN: Well, the
icons and the text.

00:10:54.647 --> 00:10:55.480
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.930
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.960
So it's also nice
to see sometimes.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.970
To use this, I use it a lot
for developing Android--

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:07.970
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, yeah?

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.570
LARA MARTIN: --for example.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.240
Yes.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.380
EMILY FORTUNA: How's
it useful for that?

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.880
LARA MARTIN: There's options
on developer's option

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.960
on the phone, that allows
you to see also the same.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.300
The layout, it
highlights the views.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.100
And it's very useful when you
have weird things happening

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.960
on your layout,
and you don't know

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:37.290
if there's a [INAUDIBLE] in some
place, a weird thing happening.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.252
So this is really handy also.

00:11:40.252 --> 00:11:41.460
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, totally.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.269
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:43.310
EMILY FORTUNA: Very cool.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.920
LARA MARTIN: And then
we have two more icons,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.219
but I honestly don't
know what they are.

00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:50.052
EMILY FORTUNA: I don't
know, let's find out.

00:11:50.052 --> 00:11:51.204
[LAUGHS]

00:11:51.204 --> 00:11:52.620
LARA MARTIN: I
haven't tried them.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.550
EMILY FORTUNA:
Experiment for everyone

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.800
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.290
Show Paint Baselines.

00:12:00.699 --> 00:12:05.070
[LAUGHS] The baselines
of the text, for example.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:11.250
This is the baseline of the
text, and then the icons--

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.562
maybe because you want
to check if they are--

00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:14.520
EMILY FORTUNA: Aligned?

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.505
LARA MARTIN: --aligned.

00:12:15.505 --> 00:12:17.650
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.300
For the typography
aficionados in the room.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.050
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.787
For those that say,
I think it's not--

00:12:24.787 --> 00:12:25.620
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes--

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.410
LARA MARTIN:
--correctly aligned.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.380
EMILY FORTUNA: So
don't have to do

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.100
what we did in our
presentation yesterday,

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.308
where we were looking at
our slides and we were like,

00:12:31.308 --> 00:12:32.020
is this aligned?

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.390
And we literally had a paper.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.190
LARA MARTIN: Yeah, we were
with a paper checking it.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.240
It was an extra space.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.120
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.140
LARA MARTIN: I
think it's the same.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.200
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.100
I'll have to ask to see
if there's other features.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.850
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.399
I also have to read about it.

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:47.232
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:12:47.232 --> 00:12:47.595
OK.

00:12:47.595 --> 00:12:48.095
Switch that.

00:12:48.095 --> 00:12:49.980
LARA MARTIN: And
then the last one.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.540
What is this?

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.860
Oh, slow animations.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.117
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, yes.

00:12:54.117 --> 00:12:55.700
LARA MARTIN: So debug
your animations.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.650
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.760
That is very nice.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.310
Especially like--
so for example,

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.180
when Lara had clicked
in the Android mode,

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.670
and it transitioned
to the new page,

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.960
that one time it was so fast.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.070
It was like, is
something [INAUDIBLE]??

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:08.820
I don't even know.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.080
LARA MARTIN: We can do it now.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.414
Now, I'm an iPhone.

00:13:12.414 --> 00:13:14.230
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.540
LARA MARTIN: So we can
see the transition fast.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.720
Let's go back.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.475
And now, slow.

00:13:21.475 --> 00:13:23.600
Oh, I think I tried it,
and it was very, very slow.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.580
EMILY FORTUNA: So fun
fact, I accidentally

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.304
enabled that on my iPhone
emulator a while ago.

00:13:35.304 --> 00:13:35.970
LARA MARTIN: Oh.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.595
EMILY FORTUNA: And
I kept doing things,

00:13:37.595 --> 00:13:39.310
and I thought my
app was bugging.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.270
I was like, why is it so slow?

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.330
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.360
EMILY FORTUNA: So yeah.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.250
Beware, if you enable that, and
don't enable it all the time.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.260
LARA MARTIN: But no worries,
that happens to everyone.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:55.839
To me, it happened many
times that I was testing

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:56.880
the internet connection--

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.880
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, gosh.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.105
LARA MARTIN: --and
you put your emulator

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:02.850
on like, slow connection,
very slow connection.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.840
And then for days, I'm like--

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.340
EMILY FORTUNA: Why
is this horrible?

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.610
LARA MARTIN: --this
is very slow.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.540
What's happening on my internet?

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.140
And then I ask my
friends, my colleagues,

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.210
do you have problems
with the internet?

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.470
No, it's my emulator.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.455
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh.

00:14:20.455 --> 00:14:22.610
So-- Oh, yeah.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.500
Is there more stuff?

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.879
LARA MARTIN: This is just the--

00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:26.670
EMILY FORTUNA: The
Android emulator itself?

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.870
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:33.690
EMILY FORTUNA: So do you have
any experiences that you've

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.870
run into, in general,
developing Flutter,

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.000
where this has come in handy?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.200
Do you remember any
particular thing?

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.690
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.390
When we were preparing
for our talk--

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.390
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, yeah?

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.690
LARA MARTIN: --and we
wanted to show the WebViews,

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.400
I was interested to see how
Flutter was rendering WebViews.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.900
So first, I was going
through the code,

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.870
trying to understand
how everything worked.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.050
But it was difficult.
[LAUGHS] Too much code.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:10.320
And so somehow, I thought, I'm
going to use the inspector.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.020
And basically, I had like the
summary of the code there,

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.960
and I could see
already the widgets

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.087
that were being rendered.

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:20.920
EMILY FORTUNA: Cool.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.110
LARA MARTIN: So that
was really nice.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.390
EMILY FORTUNA: You
want to show us?

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.120
Just the WebView and widgets.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.140
LARA MARTIN: Oh, yeah.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.280
Sure.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.630
So we can use this, maybe.

00:15:32.937 --> 00:15:34.770
EMILY FORTUNA: For some
reason, that website

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:35.728
looks a little unhappy.

00:15:35.728 --> 00:15:36.957
Let's try a different one.

00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:37.707
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:15:40.693 --> 00:15:43.260
EMILY FORTUNA: A
different article.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:49.680
So a little bit about under the
covers on WebViews on Android.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.680
So actually, there's
a virtual display

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.450
that is-- so you've
got your Flutter,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.240
and then there's
a virtual display

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.880
that is communicating with
the actual WebView layout.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:09.060
And so that is what is
displaying the WebView.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:15.030
And if you recall from
the last "Boring Show,"

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.760
we briefly put on a button
on top of the WebView

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.220
And if you wanted to--

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.840
So Flutter, when you
have a touch gesture,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.986
the question is, does
that go to the WebView,

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.110
or does that go to Flutter?

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.920
How does that all work out?

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.480
And what happens
is Flutter captures

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.020
all the gestures
itself, and then if it

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.970
gets passed onto the WebView--

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.130
like if you were touching
in the WebView area--

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.580
then it will synthesize
those touches

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.330
on that virtual display.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.982
So let's check it
out on the inspector.

00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:48.690
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.920
I just saw this--
how do you call it?

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.434
EMILY FORTUNA: Search icon?

00:16:54.434 --> 00:16:55.475
LARA MARTIN: Search icon.

00:16:55.475 --> 00:16:56.127
That's fine.

00:16:56.127 --> 00:16:57.460
EMILY FORTUNA: Magnifying glass?

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.190
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:58.860
That's what I was looking for.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.320
EMILY FORTUNA: OK.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:16:59.819
[LAUGHS]

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:03.020
LARA MARTIN: But I don't
remember how, but basically,

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.140
when you enable the showing--

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:14.180
how it's called-- widget mode,
sometimes you see the icon.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.818
So you can tap on things.

00:17:16.818 --> 00:17:17.359
I'm not sure.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:17.540
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.150
LARA MARTIN: I have
to look it up again.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.899
EMILY FORTUNA: OK.

00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:21.472
LARA MARTIN: Now I lost it.

00:17:21.472 --> 00:17:22.680
EMILY FORTUNA: You click on--

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.630
LARA MARTIN: Yeah, so you--

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.730
EMILY FORTUNA:
Select a new thing.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.910
LARA MARTIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.680
EMILY FORTUNA: I want to magnify
or look at a different thing.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:28.890
Got it.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:29.389
Got it.

00:17:29.389 --> 00:17:31.387
LARA MARTIN: So now, I
selected the WebView.

00:17:31.387 --> 00:17:33.220
EMILY FORTUNA: That is
not showing anything.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.640
LARA MARTIN: It is highlighted.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.000
It's not showing anything.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.956
Yeah, that's weird.

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:39.060
EMILY FORTUNA: I wonder--

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.210
try a different--

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:40.877
LARA MARTIN: Oh.

00:17:40.877 --> 00:17:43.251
EMILY FORTUNA: That's because
we had the slow animations.

00:17:43.251 --> 00:17:45.230
Try a different article,
see if it's better.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.020
LARA MARTIN: No.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.460
We saw it before.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.240
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.291
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:55.790
EMILY FORTUNA:
Destroy all software.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.240
LARA MARTIN: Everything
is so slow now.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.073
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:17:58.073 --> 00:18:02.810
[LAUGHS] Nothing?

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.100
LARA MARTIN: Maybe it's
the internet today.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.933
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:18:05.933 --> 00:18:11.389
I see a stack trace down
here, but I'm trying.

00:18:11.389 --> 00:18:12.680
LARA MARTIN: Gonna check again.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.138
EMILY FORTUNA:
Seems to be working.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.710
Double value?

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.480
PlatformViews?

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:22.980
Uh-oh.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.230
We got a bug to report.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.517
LARA MARTIN: Uh-oh.

00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:27.850
EMILY FORTUNA: All right, well--

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.474
LARA MARTIN: I don't
think I like this.

00:18:29.474 --> 00:18:30.460
[LAUGHS]

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.350
EMILY FORTUNA: OK,
so this is not--

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.065
do you want to at least
click-- show us the inspector

00:18:36.065 --> 00:18:36.602
and then--

00:18:36.602 --> 00:18:37.310
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.480
EMILY FORTUNA: --we
can report this bug.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.390
LARA MARTIN: Let's make
like this is working.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.920
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.045
LARA MARTIN: Let's pretend.

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:46.370
EMILY FORTUNA: You didn't
se anything wrong here.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.299
LARA MARTIN: So we have
selected the WebView.

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:49.090
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:57.120
LARA MARTIN: OK, now, we're
seeing the WebView on iOS.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.590
I don't know how it works--

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:58.900
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, oh.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.650
LARA MARTIN: --on iOS.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:00.750
EMILY FORTUNA: I
just had a thought.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.541
That might actually be
part of the problem.

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.110
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.710
Maybe.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.940
Maybe that's the problem.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:15.030
EMILY FORTUNA: So I know when
you're doing WebView on iOS,

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.742
in the info.plist--

00:19:16.742 --> 00:19:18.200
this is from the
previous episode--

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.190
and you add a feature--

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.940
or, not a feature.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.080
What am I saying?

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.480
You add a key value pair
that says enable WebViews.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:33.780
And I suspect that this enable
iOS view on an Android thing

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.559
is making--

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:36.850
PlatformViews is a new feature.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.310
It is not at 1.0 yet.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.582
I imagine this is
making it very unhappy.

00:19:40.582 --> 00:19:41.290
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.887
So that's why before, we
saw it, at some point.

00:19:43.887 --> 00:19:44.970
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.010
LARA MARTIN: I guess
it was with Android.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.510
EMILY FORTUNA: I
think you're right.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.480
LARA MARTIN: OK
Let's switch back.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.800
Yay!

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.510
OK, we have it.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:57.270
Cool.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.230
Now, we see the tree for iOS.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.780
I guess, if we don't refresh,
we will see it again.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.530
EMILY FORTUNA: OK.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.370
LARA MARTIN: We can select--

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:06.680
EMILY FORTUNA: The web view.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.804
LARA MARTIN: --the Android.

00:20:07.804 --> 00:20:09.475
OK, now--

00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:10.600
EMILY FORTUNA: All is good.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.680
LARA MARTIN: All is
good and working.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.510
So basically, what I was doing
for preparing for our talk was

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.300
to go through this, like
how this is working,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.410
and I saw this Android view.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.870
I'm like, OK, what is this?

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:32.730
And I went to the source
to see what it was doing,

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.660
and basically--

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.910
I will close this.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:41.150
And basically, here it showed--

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:47.760
yeah, it says embeds an Android
view in the widget hierarchy.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.360
So it was very
explanatory and a cool way

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.750
to go through the code.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:53.610
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.870
That's awesome.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.010
Very cool.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:01.680
So yeah, basically sounds like
widget inspector is a great way

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.460
to--

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.910
number one, if you had
some weird layout thing

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.590
or if you want to be very
particular about your layouts,

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.380
and you were worried about your
pixels, your precious pixels.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.880
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.040
EMILY FORTUNA: And if you are
trying to understand a code

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.040
base, and figure out
where this thing goes

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.920
and how it is implemented.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.560
Yeah.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.430
Super cool.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.450
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.616
EMILY FORTUNA: Thanks, Lara.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.940
All right, so let's shift gears.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.220
And we can go into implementing
the page scroll view.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.244
Does that sounds good?

00:21:38.244 --> 00:21:38.910
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:39.810
EMILY FORTUNA: Cool.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:40.120
OK.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.100
LARA MARTIN: Let's see.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:54.810
EMILY FORTUNA: So over on my
computer, so if you recall,

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.860
we've got this block where
we have our articles.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.570
And right now, we've got
just one list of articles.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.370
It's the the articlesSubject.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.790
What we want to do instead--

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.430
so I mentioned this at the
end of the previous episode.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.310
But the short version is--

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.760
let me ListView.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:22.320
So right now, we have
this single StreamBuilder

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.730
with the ListView in it.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.970
And when we click
on these two tabs,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:32.880
we just toggle between
the two different--

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.380
we basically are
adding and removing

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.870
articles from a single ListView.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.180
But that won't work
if we want to preserve

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.770
page scroll position, because
if there's only one ListView,

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.254
and you're moving in
different locations,

00:22:47.254 --> 00:22:49.170
we want to have like two
different page scroll

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.040
locations.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.920
So we're going to break this
stream out into two streams.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.640
So we'll have a top stories
and a new stories stream.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:05.850
So I think, let's call
this topArticleSubject

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:12.060
and newArticlesSubject.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.940
And of course, if we
started having many tabs,

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.110
we might put this in
an array or something.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.220
But I think--

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:17.330
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.029
EMILY FORTUNA:
--two, that's fine.

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:20.070
LARA MARTIN: Good enough.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.570
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.500
OK, so now, get articles.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.720
We want to have two of these.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:35.110
So get topArticles
and get newArticles--

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:41.150
topArticles, newArticles.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.300
Great.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.960
What else-- articlesSubjects.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.500
OK.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.300
LARA MARTIN: Now it's
more complicated.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.236
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:23:54.236 --> 00:23:57.260
[LAUGHS] All right.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.690
So this gets called.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.860
Let's see here.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.389
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:24:02.389 --> 00:24:03.430
I'm going to check also--

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.710
EMILY FORTUNA: Look at this.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.090
LARA MARTIN: --my
laptop, so I can--

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.700
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, please.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.620
That's appreciated.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.120
OK.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.660
So what we do is, when
this block is constructed,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:23.160
we set up a single listener,
and we set up a storiesType.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.460
So instead-- let me look
at this stream controller.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:33.250
Question is, do we want to
stream controllers or just one?

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:36.160
I would think just one,
but let's see here.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.000
Yeah.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.220
So we should be able to--

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.480
where is storiesType?

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.730
LARA MARTIN: To have only one?

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:51.840
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah,
I think we should

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.170
be able to have two listeners.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.562
Like listen twice, but to
the same controller, I think.

00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:58.770
LARA MARTIN: We can try that.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:24:59.603
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:24:59.603 --> 00:25:01.230
Let's see.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:07.040
Because I think storiesType--
where is that declared?

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.710
LARA MARTIN: Oh, wasn't
it in the article?

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.224
No.

00:25:13.224 --> 00:25:15.140
EMILY FORTUNA: StoriesType,
oh for god's sake.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.900
LARA MARTIN: Yeah, I remember
doing this part, also myself,

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.487
watching the episode.

00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:31.320
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.967
LARA MARTIN: I don't remember
where it was declared.

00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:35.925
EMILY FORTUNA: So it
looks like it's in getter.

00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:38.950
And maybe we don't want
to have listen twice.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.320
LARA MARTIN: OK,
the storiesType it's

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.690
an enum, and [INAUDIBLE]
in the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.200
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.500
Right.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.210
So the question is--

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.270
OK, let's work backwards here.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:04.440
So we have to getIds.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.090
So where is getIds?

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.820
Basically, we want
to call getIds twice.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.052
And one for top,
and one for new.

00:26:11.052 --> 00:26:11.760
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.380
EMILY FORTUNA: So let's look
up where getIds is called.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.260
Oh, of course.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.130
In here.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:26.700
So instead, let's just pass
in storiesType.newStories,

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.090
storiesType.topStories.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.780
LARA MARTIN: This is because
you are listening in two places,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.780
but for two different things.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:44.520
So you here specify
which kind of story.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.450
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.760
But I think-- so hold on.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.440
GetArticles.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.580
You may be saying this.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.170
And I apologize if I'm not--

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.169
LARA MARTIN: No worries.

00:26:53.169 --> 00:26:55.660
EMILY FORTUNA: I just need
to stare at this for a second

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.140
here.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.770
OK, so we have our list--

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.110
oh, OK.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.775
Yes.

00:27:04.775 --> 00:27:06.150
This is maybe what
you're saying.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.470
I apologize if you
just said this.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:14.309
So I think we don't need
to have two separate--

00:27:14.309 --> 00:27:16.350
I think we should be able
to just put it in here.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.741
Because you listen for stories--

00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:20.490
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.670
EMILY FORTUNA: And when
there are new stories--

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.640
this is a little
bit inefficient.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.980
We can come back and fix it.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.900
But the next step--

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.020
which we can get to,
if we have time--

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.970
would be to listen for new
and top stories separately.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.970
Right now, are saying,
if there are new stories,

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.500
we're going to update both.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.210
But I think that's
fine, for now.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.070
So, OK.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.780
Initialize-- what
was that called?

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.365
GetArticlesAndUpdate.

00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:51.210
And then we're going to say--

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:04.850
we want to probably pass
in here the subject.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.700
Because this gets
called, once for the new,

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.570
and one for the top.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:12.320
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.500
EMILY FORTUNA: And
so we want to pass in

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.700
whether it's top or new--

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.408
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:28:17.408 --> 00:28:20.112
EMILY FORTUNA: --to
add it to that stream.

00:28:20.112 --> 00:28:20.820
That makes sense?

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.600
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.670
EMILY FORTUNA: OK, so
what is the type of that?

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:31.130
It's like BehaviorSubject
[INAUDIBLE] Coffee.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.620
[LAUGHS] Where'd that go?

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.030
Here it is.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:37.531
Oh, wait.

00:28:37.531 --> 00:28:38.030
No, up.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.620
LARA MARTIN: No, up.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.290
EMILY FORTUNA: Large
font size problems.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:44.690
OK, subjects.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.145
And then we say subjects.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.672
LARA MARTIN: And
then [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:54.672 --> 00:28:56.870
EMILY FORTUNA: It
used to be there.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.765
LARA MARTIN: Why
is it complaining?

00:28:58.765 --> 00:29:02.629
EMILY FORTUNA: That's
a good question.

00:29:02.629 --> 00:29:04.670
LARA MARTIN: There's
something here [INAUDIBLE]??

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.020
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, I'm
missing a-- there we go.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.770
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:08.994
OK.

00:29:08.994 --> 00:29:10.410
EMILY FORTUNA:
That's much better.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.790
And then we need to call
this with the new thing.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:16.152
So getArticlesAndUpdate.

00:29:16.152 --> 00:29:18.266
OK, we can come
back to that one.

00:29:18.266 --> 00:29:25.080
This one, we say
topArticlesSubject.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:25.860
Or, sorry.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.620
It's in this one.
newArticlesSubject.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.430
I typed away from myself.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.450
LARA MARTIN: Maybe if you--

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.810
yeah.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:45.835
It wasn't showing you, I
guess, that you called type

00:29:45.835 --> 00:29:47.640
in newArticlesSubject.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:54.810
You have these variable upper,
so it wasn't showing you

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.990
that you called you said
because you were typing

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.050
just next to await, I think.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.492
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, and it
wasn't auto-completing.

00:30:02.492 --> 00:30:03.200
LARA MARTIN: Yep.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.116
EMILY FORTUNA: Got it.

00:30:04.116 --> 00:30:08.510
OK, and so then
here, initialize--

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.070
we probably want to call
getArticlesAndUpdate

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.660
twice again.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.940
So let's just--

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.170
LARA MARTIN: Twice?

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:16.890
EMILY FORTUNA: Well, one's--

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:17.190
LARA MARTIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.315
EMILY FORTUNA: --for top,
and one's for new, right?

00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:22.710
Because this is just
getting the things

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.900
established, and
we want them both--

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.654
I mean, I guess, technically--

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.030
LARA MARTIN: It's fine.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.170
It's OK.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.005
EMILY FORTUNA: There will be an
efficiency re-editing session

00:30:37.005 --> 00:30:37.860
after this.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.610
LARA MARTIN: We can
always do it refactor.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.060
EMILY FORTUNA: That looks great.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.302
LARA MARTIN: Oh, OK.

00:30:43.302 --> 00:30:44.510
EMILY FORTUNA: What do we do?

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.885
Well, part of it,
I imagine we're

00:30:45.885 --> 00:30:49.464
going to need a hot
restart, because I redefined

00:30:49.464 --> 00:30:50.505
a bunch of new variables.

00:30:50.505 --> 00:30:50.780
LARA MARTIN: For sure.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.446
EMILY FORTUNA: So
let's start with that.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.102
That still looks great.

00:30:57.102 --> 00:30:58.810
LARA MARTIN: Oh, it
cannot find articles,

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.095
because you changed the name.

00:31:00.095 --> 00:31:00.970
EMILY FORTUNA: Right.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.210
OK, so let's look in here.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:08.675
OK, so we need to have
two StreamBuilders.

00:31:08.675 --> 00:31:09.175
Yes.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.740
All right.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.490
OK, we have this
currentIndex, and we

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:22.960
want to display a different
StreamBuilder, aka ListView,

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.075
depending on the index.

00:31:27.075 --> 00:31:28.450
And because there's
only two, I'm

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.122
going to do the little ternary--

00:31:30.122 --> 00:31:31.080
LARA MARTIN: Of course.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.610
EMILY FORTUNA: --thing.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.840
And then we're going
do refactoring,

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.030
because this is going to
become unreadable very quickly.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:38.770
So let's see.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:43.960
The current index is 0.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.120
We're going to do one thing.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.130
Oh my gosh.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:49.950
This makes me sad.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.536
I promise, we're
refactoring soon.

00:31:53.536 --> 00:31:56.710
LARA MARTIN: But it's a
good way to understanding

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:57.460
what you're doing.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:57.956
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:31:57.956 --> 00:32:00.497
LARA MARTIN: And then you can
refactor it, and it gets nicer.

00:32:00.497 --> 00:32:01.300
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:01.800
All right.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.592
So let me just make
sure, 0 is top.

00:32:06.592 --> 00:32:07.300
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.111
And 1 is news stories.

00:32:09.111 --> 00:32:09.610
Yes.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:13.690
EMILY FORTUNA:
Articles, newArticles.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:14.720
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720
EMILY FORTUNA: Now what?

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.550
Oh, it looks like we have
another article statement here

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.020
somewhere.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:18.644
Oh, here we go.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.020
Oh, this is the search.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.111
I have not spent enough
time with this part.

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:28.610
LARA MARTIN: You
implemented search?

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:29.443
I didn't watch the--

00:32:29.443 --> 00:32:30.701
EMILY FORTUNA: Somebody did.

00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:31.200
I have it.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.450
LARA MARTIN: Oh, the last one.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.950
OK.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.324
EMILY FORTUNA:
Let's start with--

00:32:34.324 --> 00:32:34.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.160
LARA MARTIN: Oh, yeah.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:35.810
I see it.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.660
I see it.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.800
EMILY FORTUNA: So showSearch.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.340
LARA MARTIN: That's
cause we opened before

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.127
with the inspector and
we didn't understand.

00:32:45.127 --> 00:32:45.876
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh.

00:32:45.876 --> 00:32:46.460
LARA MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.590
EMILY FORTUNA: You know,
that keeps messing me up,

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.460
the search thing.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.120
It messed me up in the
previous episode, too.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.700
LARA MARTIN: OK, that's it.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.630
EMILY FORTUNA: And this
is why I was like, we

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:57.588
need to refactor stuff.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.940
I'm going to comment
this out, for a minute,

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.499
and we're just going to see
if our other stuff works.

00:33:08.499 --> 00:33:09.540
And then come back to it.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:13.230
All right.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.860
And if we go to news--

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.300
OK.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:17.800
All right.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.390
So we're showing different
things, that's great.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.280
LARA MARTIN: It works.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.054
EMILY FORTUNA: Let's add in
the scroll position thing.

00:33:25.054 --> 00:33:25.970
LARA MARTIN: Oh, sure.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.205
EMILY FORTUNA: And then we
can come back to search.

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:28.060
Does that sound good?

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.976
LARA MARTIN: Yes, yes.

00:33:28.976 --> 00:33:30.080
EMILY FORTUNA: OK, cool.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.110
So adding scroll is
going to be real easy.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.610
There's this page
storage key, which

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.244
I'm going to look
up for a hot second.

00:33:39.244 --> 00:33:40.160
LARA MARTIN: Oh, yeah.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.932
We were talking about
these yesterday, right?

00:33:43.932 --> 00:33:45.390
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh,
keys in general.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.280
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:46.640
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.473
Oh, a couple things.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.780
So there's a lot of things
that we just did here.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:34:02.270
So the original reason that
there were keys in these--

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:07.590
keys in these-- is when
we switch from one view

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.090
to another.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.310
Again, before, we were
adding or removing

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.639
from the same ListView.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.159
And now, we have
two separate ones.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:25.639
So keys would probably
not be necessary, except--

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:28.940
because we still
have these WebViews--

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.440
I think if we removed the
keys and you tried to open it,

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.120
it would think it was the same--

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.310
it would display the wrong page.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.600
So we keep that there.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.989
We can test that in a minute.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:41.929
But back to page storage.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.840
So I can't remember
if it's a global key

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.679
or not that you put in.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.170
Oh, no, it looks
like it's just--

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.017
LARA MARTIN: Page
storage key class?

00:34:50.017 --> 00:34:50.850
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.760
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.090
EMILY FORTUNA: So I
believe we're just going

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.930
to put it in the ListView.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.165
So key-- PageStorageKey().

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:10.329
And then we'll use the
index, which I guess--

00:35:10.329 --> 00:35:11.120
[INAUDIBLE] coding.

00:35:15.965 --> 00:35:17.410
LARA MARTIN: It works for now.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:18.270
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.235
Best development practices ever.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.300
Oh wait, don't do that.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.350
OK.

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.300
So fingers crossed.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.840
Now, let's scroll
here a little bit.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.960
OK, and then we switch.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.701
And now, let's see if we're--

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:37.200
Oh.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.710
Wow.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:42.821
That's exciting.

00:35:42.821 --> 00:35:44.414
[LAUGHS]

00:35:44.414 --> 00:35:45.580
LARA MARTIN: No such method.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.190
EMILY FORTUNA: Line
indexOf(child) index

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.870
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.370
Huh?

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.870
Whoo.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:01.020
[LAUGHS] I'm just going
to start fresh here.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.710
Hot restart.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.336
I don't think
that's the problem.

00:36:04.336 --> 00:36:05.710
LARA MARTIN:
Sometimes I do that.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.639
I run--

00:36:06.639 --> 00:36:07.930
EMILY FORTUNA: What am I doing?

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:09.388
LARA MARTIN: --and
it doesn't work.

00:36:09.388 --> 00:36:11.750
And I run it again,
just in case.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:12.820
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.250
LARA MARTIN: And then I'm
sure it's not working,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.747
and I [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:16.747 --> 00:36:17.580
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.340
It's like, maybe this
is not my problem.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.870
OK, clear console.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.040
We're in new stories.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.950
Technology's dark forest
is at the top here.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.090
Switch.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.330
Cool.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.080
Oh.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.810
And here, I was going to say,
adding page scroll position is

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.060
so easy.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.320
Oh, boy.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.650
OK.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.531
Double is not a subtype of bool.

00:36:43.531 --> 00:36:44.030
What?

00:36:47.432 --> 00:36:48.410
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:54.010
LARA MARTIN: Do you have to
define the type with a page

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.400
storage key, maybe?

00:36:59.005 --> 00:36:59.880
EMILY FORTUNA: Maybe.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.390
It looks like it's inferring it.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:12.950
Let's see inferring
slivers, why is it unhappy--

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.850
scroll offset correction
is called on--

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:35.260
LARA MARTIN: And
there's the [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.065
EMILY FORTUNA: It
was ExpansionTile.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.040
LARA MARTIN: This was the
stack, ExpansionTileState.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.500
EMILY FORTUNA: InitState.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.670
I'm wondering if
there's something

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:55.365
strange with PageStorage and
Expansion tiles, like maybe,

00:37:55.365 --> 00:37:56.240
because they expand--

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.531
LARA MARTIN: They expand, yeah.

00:37:57.531 --> 00:38:00.330
EMILY FORTUNA: --it
confuses the location?

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.040
Let me try.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.150
I'm going to try it,
again, to like debug this.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:09.560
Instead of having an
ExpansionTile here,

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.302
maybe we have something
really simple, like just text.

00:38:12.302 --> 00:38:13.510
LARA MARTIN: Just to try out.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:14.440
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.704
So here's my really silly thing.

00:38:17.704 --> 00:38:18.620
I just returned twice.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.197
So return text HELP.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:32.380
OK, let's restart,
because it's crashed,

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.080
so it's unhappy with us.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.080
LARA MARTIN: Why do you
have two return statements?

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:37.580
Can you?

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.913
EMILY FORTUNA: What do you mean?

00:38:38.913 --> 00:38:39.740
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.710
That works.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:41.850
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:42.413
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh,
this isn't going

00:38:42.413 --> 00:38:43.760
to be very useful for scrolling.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.010
OK, I'll put it in a ListTile.

00:38:47.665 --> 00:38:50.906
Wrap with new widget.

00:38:50.906 --> 00:38:55.824
ListTile, text.

00:38:55.824 --> 00:39:01.700
Wait, ListTile is--
what am I doing?

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.290
I've been switching
between editors too much.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:05.270
Can't even remember.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:06.311
LARA MARTIN: That's true.

00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:08.100
EMILY FORTUNA:
Command-Function-F12.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:08.600
Whoops.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.790
That's not it.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:10.760
F12.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.600
There we go.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.400
ListTile.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.616
Title, there we go.

00:39:15.616 --> 00:39:18.514
Title.

00:39:18.514 --> 00:39:19.685
Close that.

00:39:19.685 --> 00:39:20.810
LARA MARTIN: OK, you need--

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.240
EMILY FORTUNA: Help, help, help.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.070
OK, I still can't scroll.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.030
I'm going to-- oh my gosh.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.280
Let's wrap it in padding.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.660
[LAUGHS] And we'll make
the padding huge, like 50.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.370
OK.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.320
Now, of course, the
question is, if we scroll,

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.445
is it going to really know?

00:39:45.445 --> 00:39:47.570
But we can see the offset.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:48.070
OK.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:52.320
So I scrolled here, and it's
going to be like part-way down.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.300
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.175
EMILY FORTUNA: Right.

00:39:54.175 --> 00:39:57.350
So we switched to here,
I've got more help.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:59.710
LARA MARTIN: That works.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.585
EMILY FORTUNA: And let
me, again, just test.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:05.810
OK.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:07.650
So it preserves scroll position.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.590
So it's something
with ExpansionTile.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:10.350
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:11.887
Maybe I will search.

00:40:11.887 --> 00:40:12.720
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:18.630
LARA MARTIN: PageStorageKey
with ExpansionTile?

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:20.990
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:23.754
Yes, yes, yes.

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:24.420
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.220
ExpansionTile class,
PageStorageKey.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:34.530
A unique PageStorageKey
must be specified

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.670
to enable the ExpansionTile
to save and restore

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:38.982
its expanded state.

00:40:38.982 --> 00:40:39.940
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, boy.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.390
Wow.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:49.410
Wait, when used a unique--

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:53.430
Oh, so we have keys,
but not PageStorageKeys.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.680
That's maybe the problem.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.760
Let's try that.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.704
PageStorage--

00:40:57.704 --> 00:40:58.620
LARA MARTIN: Oh, yeah.

00:41:01.216 --> 00:41:02.340
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, storage.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.673
That would help if I could type.

00:41:03.673 --> 00:41:04.470
OK.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:06.030
Let's try this.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.710
I'm a little skeptical.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.179
OK, so we scroll up.

00:41:10.179 --> 00:41:11.220
Technology's dark forest.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.410
LARA MARTIN: It works.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:22.340
EMILY FORTUNA: When all else
fails, read the documentation.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.270
OK.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:24.230
Yay.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.920
Cool.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.005
So yeah. so generally, when
you don't have ExpansionTiles,

00:41:29.005 --> 00:41:30.380
you only need one
PageStorageKey.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.860
But with ExpansionTiles, since
there's multiple scrolling

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.310
things going on, you need two.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:35.810
Cool.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.730
OK.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:43.070
Oh, and let me just check
now that with PageStorageKey,

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:45.435
the WebView thing--

00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:47.376
why is that not showing?

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:50.430
OK.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:51.320
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.040
EMILY FORTUNA: So I
just want to make sure

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.855
that when we go here--

00:41:52.855 --> 00:41:53.570
LARA MARTIN: It's there.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.680
EMILY FORTUNA: --that
the right WebViews--

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.370
OK.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.450
This is good.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.410
Cool.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.669
And we'll just pretend
that that website's broken.

00:41:59.669 --> 00:42:00.710
LARA MARTIN: So it works.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:01.510
EMILY FORTUNA: It does.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.259
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:42:02.259 --> 00:42:04.910
EMILY FORTUNA: So we can
do a little bit of cleanup

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.660
with my hackiness.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.921
LARA MARTIN: Yes.

00:42:08.921 --> 00:42:10.670
EMILY FORTUNA: And let
me get rid of-- why

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.460
do I have-- there, OK.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.600
All right.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.530
Oh, yes.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.620
So first, let me uncomment
the search thing,

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:22.550
and we're going to figure out
what to do with this business.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:23.837
So let us read about--

00:42:23.837 --> 00:42:24.920
LARA MARTIN: That's below.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.925
There was one more thing.

00:42:26.925 --> 00:42:28.300
EMILY FORTUNA: I
know, but this--

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:28.680
LARA MARTIN:
[INAUDIBLE] different.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.240
EMILY FORTUNA: --was
already commented.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:30.760
OK.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.670
This is part of refactoring.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.550
Gone.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.774
OK.

00:42:36.774 --> 00:42:42.084
[LAUGHS] So let's see
what's going on here.

00:42:42.084 --> 00:42:43.750
People that watch the
other episodes are

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.650
like, why didn't you read this?

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.240
LARA MARTIN: I was
waiting for you to fix it.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.660
It's fixed now.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:50.410
EMILY FORTUNA: OK.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:54.790
So we have a builder,
and we have a button.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.640
So, OK.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.060
It's this thing.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:58.870
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:00.536
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh,
and it's not running.

00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:04.930
So when it's pressed,
we have this showSearch

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:05.920
and we delegate.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.980
So let's look at showSearch.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:13.900
ShowSearch, which is
a hard thing to say.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.240
Oh, is this built in?

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.471
No, we added it.

00:43:18.471 --> 00:43:18.970
Wow.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:20.710
Did we have all these comments?

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.030
Good job, whoever did that.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.680
OK.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:31.980
SearchDelegate, what
does SearchDelegate do?

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.784
LARA MARTIN: This is part
of the search [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:35.784 --> 00:43:36.700
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, OK.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:37.300
So we did it.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.670
I was like, wow.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:39.740
LARA MARTIN: It's a lot.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.160
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, I know.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:46.000
OK, so let's just look
at the documentation,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.210
because that's easier.

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:51.186
Flutter material search.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.100
That's a package.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.690
But there is documentation here.

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:03.176
API reference.

00:44:03.176 --> 00:44:05.072
OK, material_search.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.630
LARA MARTIN: I never implemented
a search function feature

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:18.043
myself, so this is
interesting to see.

00:44:18.043 --> 00:44:20.190
EMILY FORTUNA: Is
this from materials?

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.810
LARA MARTIN: It seems
like it's from material.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:25.532
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, so is it
maybe not this package though?

00:44:25.532 --> 00:44:26.240
Because this is--

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.390
LARA MARTIN: But we can
search on Flutter directly

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:35.327
for materials.dart and
search store Dart maybe.

00:44:35.327 --> 00:44:36.410
EMILY FORTUNA: showSearch.

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:37.020
Here we go.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:37.669
Here we go.

00:44:37.669 --> 00:44:38.960
OK, yeah, it's not the package.

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.582
I just want to read what
this delegate thing is doing.

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:49.830
LARA MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:54.330
EMILY FORTUNA: [INAUDIBLE] OK.

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.390
So in that case, we'll do
a little ternary thing,

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:03.540
and say like newArticles
or topArticles,

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.870
because we want to search
whatever is in the current set.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.370
OK.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:14.210
So we're going to look up--

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.610
oh, currentIndex.

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:22.016
OK, so we're going to say
currentIndex equals 0.

00:45:22.016 --> 00:45:24.630
I believe that's topArticles.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.495
LARA MARTIN: It was top, yes.

00:45:27.495 --> 00:45:34.005
EMILY FORTUNA: TopArticles
or widget.bloc.newArticles.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.530
OK.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:48.500
So now, should be able
to search on Dark.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.332
LARA MARTIN: So you're basically
just searching [INAUDIBLE]??

00:45:52.332 --> 00:45:54.790
EMILY FORTUNA: Which technically
was the same functionality

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:57.373
before, because remember, it was
adding and removing articles.

00:45:57.373 --> 00:46:02.250
And actually, now that I've
done this, I'm wondering--

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:05.020
we may not have time to do this
part, but I'm wondering if we--

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.700
PageStorageKey.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.560
In a future episode,
we'll have to explore--

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.650
I think PageStorageKey
doesn't like

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.950
when we were adding or removing
from this single thing,

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:24.190
because if you
switch tabs, it will

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:26.560
have the other scroll position.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:30.350
Yeah, OK.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:30.850
Never mind.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.830
No, I think there's
no way you get around.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:34.460
We had to have two
streams for this.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:34.690
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:35.200
Yeah.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.040
EMILY FORTUNA: Yep.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.940
OK.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.440
Cool.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.690
Well, I think this is
a good stopping point.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:43.570
Unless there's any quick
little clean up we can do,

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:48.460
because I do admit, we
kind of made this messy.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.639
LARA MARTIN: Duplicated
things sometimes.

00:46:50.639 --> 00:46:51.430
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:52.510
LARA MARTIN: You want to check.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:53.343
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:55.750
OK, it says-- are we
using this anymore?

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:56.920
TopArticlesSubject.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.925
LARA MARTIN: No, because
you're using directly

00:46:58.925 --> 00:47:01.610
to the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:04.130
EMILY FORTUNA: But
why is this green?

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:07.800
LARA MARTIN: Can
you hover on top?

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.840
EMILY FORTUNA: It's trying to--

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.340
problems.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.070
Close.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:14.650
Is this it?

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:15.220
Close this.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:15.890
Yeah, OK.

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:16.880
So we need to close.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.610
So it's like destroy.

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:20.750
Oh, why did that come up?

00:47:28.544 --> 00:47:29.750
That's a good question.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:33.230
So normally with widgets,
you've got your init state,

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:34.325
and then you can--

00:47:34.325 --> 00:47:37.610
it's either dispose or destroy.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:38.589
I think it's dispose.

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:39.130
I get mixed--

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.463
LARA MARTIN: Yeah, it's dispose.

00:47:40.463 --> 00:47:41.900
EMILY FORTUNA: --up with C++.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.580
LARA MARTIN: I'm
thinking of Java.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.540
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.190
I'm pretty sure it's dispose.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.810
You close.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:51.460
But then it was Block,
because it's not a widget,

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.920
and it doesn't
have the lifecycle.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.690
It's standing alone.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.850
We don't have that same thing.

00:47:56.850 --> 00:48:01.550
So I'm not quite
sure what the best

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.800
practice is for doing that.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.350
LARA MARTIN: I
know, on Avex, you

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.240
have to clear the
disposable at the end.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:16.160
EMILY FORTUNA: So maybe at the
end of our main or something,

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.139
you would say like
hnBlock.clear--

00:48:20.139 --> 00:48:20.930
LARA MARTIN: Clear.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:21.660
EMILY FORTUNA: --or something.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.870
LARA MARTIN: Yeah.

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:23.370
Something.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:24.650
EMILY FORTUNA: OK, let's--

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.720
LARA MARTIN: Because if you are
navigating to another place,

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.679
and you don't need those
subscriptions anymore,

00:48:28.679 --> 00:48:29.844
then you have to clear them.

00:48:29.844 --> 00:48:30.790
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:31.340
OK.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.600
I'm going to leave that.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.010
I will look to
verify that that's

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:36.427
how we want to do it for Block,
because Filip is the Block

00:48:36.427 --> 00:48:37.259
expert, [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:37.259 --> 00:48:37.940
LARA MARTIN: OK.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.330
That's cool.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.330
EMILY FORTUNA: But I
tentatively will say, yeah.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.120
I think you add it
at the very end.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.580
LARA MARTIN: And you can
write a to-do for Filip.

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:43.870
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:44.900
There you go.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:50.200
To-do-- filiph.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:56.711
Do we close-- because I write
all my things in caps here--

00:48:56.711 --> 00:49:02.960
Block subscriptions here?

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.000
All right, perfect.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.380
So thank you for
being with us today.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:13.157
In summary, we talked about
the Flutter Inspector,

00:49:13.157 --> 00:49:14.240
and I learned a whole lot.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.130
That was super cool.

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:15.820
Thank you, Lara.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.890
LARA MARTIN: Thank you.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:19.250
EMILY FORTUNA: And then
we added PageStorageKey

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:22.130
for preserving scroll position.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.140
I added more of a
mess to our code,

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.160
so the refactoring
is still to come.

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.340
And we also learned that,
if you have ExpansionTile

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.170
and PageStorageKey, you need
to have another PageStorageKey,

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:36.800
because that's growing there
and preserving position

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.910
with the overall ListView.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:40.290
So cool.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:42.110
Thanks for watching
in, and please

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.590
feel free to ask
questions in the comments.

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:48.290
And yeah.

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:50.156
Lara, it's been great.

00:49:50.156 --> 00:49:51.780
LARA MARTIN: Thank
you for inviting me.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.610
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:53.735
LARA MARTIN: It's been fun.

00:49:53.735 --> 00:49:55.100
EMILY FORTUNA: Excellent.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.535
Until next time.

00:49:56.535 --> 00:49:57.410
LARA MARTIN: Bye-bye.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:00.160
