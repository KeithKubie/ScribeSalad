00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.580
So far, we've spent a lot of time predicting
movement: where things are, where they're

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.420
going, and how quickly they're gonna get there.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.620
But there's something missing -- something
that has a lot to do with Harry Styles.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.360
And today, we're gonna address that.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.780
We've been talking about what happens when
you do things like throw balls up in the air

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.620
or drive a car down a straight road.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.500
That kind of motion is pretty simple, because
there's only one axis involved.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.770
The car's accelerating either forward or backward.
The ball's moving up or down. There's no messy

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.700
second dimension to contend with.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.250
But this is physics. We may simplify calculations
a lot of the time, but we still want to describe

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.880
the real world as best we can.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.320
And in real life, when you need more than
ONE DIRECTION, you turn to vectors.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:50.280
[Theme Music]

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.360
Let's say we have a pitching machine, like
you'd use for baseball practice.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.880
We're going to be using it a lot in this episode,
so we might as well get familiar with how it works.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.219
We can feed the machine a bunch of baseballs
and have it spit them out at any speed we want,

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.439
up to 50 m/s. The pitching height is adjustable,

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.380
and we can rotate it vertically, so the ball
can be launched at any angle.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.880
It also has a random setting, where the machine picks the speed, height, or angle of the ball, all on its own.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.720
Suddenly we have WAY more options than just
throwing a ball straight up in the air.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.540
And now the ball can have both horizontal
AND vertical qualities. At the same time.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.180
Before - we were able to use the constant
acceleration equations to describe vertical

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.760
or horizontal motion -- but we never used
it for both at once.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.600
And, we're not going to do that today either.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.799
Instead, we're going to split the ball's motion
into two parts -- we'll talk about what's

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.500
happening horizontally and vertically, but
completely separately.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.850
And we'll do that with the help of vectors.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.220
Vectors are kind-of-like ordinary numbers
-- which are also known as scalars -- because

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.840
they have a magnitude, which tells you how
big they are.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.000
But they have another characteristic, too:
direction.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.960
Previously, we might have said that a ball’s
velocity was 5 meters per second, and -- assuming

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.450
we’d picked DOWNWARD to be the positive
direction -- we’d know that the ball was

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.950
falling down, since its VELOCITY was positive.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.229
In other words, we were taking DIRECTION
into account, but we could only describe that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.780
direction using a positive or a negative.
So we were limited to two directions along one axis.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.440
But vectors change all that. Now - instead
of just two directions, we can talk about ANY direction.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.140
It might help to think of a vector like an
arrow on a treasure map. You could draw an

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.000
arrow that represents 5 kilometers on the
map -- that length would be the vector’s MAGNITUDE.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.720
But you need to point it in a particular direction
to tell people where to find the treasure.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.370
Which is actually pretty much, how physicists
GRAPH vectors. You take your two usual axes,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.190
aim in the vector’s direction, and then
draw an arrow, as long as its magnitude.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.740
Like, say your pitching machine launches a
ball at a 30 degree angle from the horizontal,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.319
with a starting velocity of 5 meters per second.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.360
We can just draw that as a vector with a magnitude
of 5 and a direction of 30 degrees.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.770
And let’s say your catcher didn’t catch
the ball properly and dropped it.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.620
Then just before it hits the ground, its velocity
might’ve had a magnitude of 3 m/s and a

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.140
direction of 270 degrees, which we can draw
like this.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.860
That’s why vectors are so useful: You can
describe any direction you want.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.220
But there’s a problem, one you might have
already noticed: You can’t just add or multiply

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.410
these vectors the same way you would ordinary
numbers, because they AREN'T ordinary numbers.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.019
To do that, we have to describe vectors differently.

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.940
When you draw a vector, it’s a lot like
the HYPOTENUSE of a right angle triangle.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.590
The vector’s magnitude tells you the length
of that hypotenuse, and you can use its ANGLE

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.069
to draw the rest of the triangle.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.129
Right angle triangles are cool like that: you only
need to know a couple of things about one,

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.980
like the length of a side and the degrees
in an angle, to draw the rest of it.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.240
It’s all just trigonometry, connecting sides
and angles through sines and cosines.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.200
Which is why you can also describe a vector
just by writing the lengths of those two other sides.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.080
In fact, those sides are so good at describing
a vector that physicists call them its components.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.820
So let’s go back to our pitching machine
example for a minute. We said that the VECTOR

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.400
for the ball’s starting velocity had a magnitude
of 5 and a direction of 30 degrees above the horizontal.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.080
We can draw that out like this.
That’s all we need to do the trig.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.420
The length of that horizontal side, or component,
must be 5cos30, which is 4.33.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.090
The same math works for the vertical side,
just with sine instead of cosine -- so we

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.270
know that the length of the vertical side
is just 5sin30, which works out to be 2.5.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.720
So our vector has a horizontal component of
4.33 and a vertical component of 2.5.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:36.960
In what’s known as unit vector notation,
we’d describe this vector as v = 4.33i + 2.5j.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.930
The arrow on top of the v tells you it’s
a vector, and the little hats on top of the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.319
i and j, tell you that they’re the UNIT
vectors, and they denote the DIRECTION for each vector.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.999
i just means it’s the direction of what we’d
normally call the x axis, and j is the y axis.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.160
You’ll sometimes see another
one, k, which represents the z axis.

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.689
And if we wanted to add or subtract two vectors,
that’s easy enough -- we just separate them

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:05.109
each into their component parts and add or
subtract each component separately.

00:05:05.109 --> 00:05:17.949
So 2i + 3j added to 5i + 6j would just be 7i + 9j.
And -2i + 3j added to 5i - 6j would be 3i -3j.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.680
Multiplying by a scalar isn’t a big deal
either -- you just multiply the number by

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.279
each component, so 2i + 3j times 3 would be
6i + 9j.

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:31.939
The unit vector notation itself, actually
takes advantage of this kind of multiplication

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:37.659
i, j, and k are called unit vectors because
they’re vectors that are exactly one unit

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.249
long, each pointing in the direction of a
different axis.

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:46.769
So when you write 2i, for example, you’re just saying: take the unit vector i and make it twice as long.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.430
But it’s NOT the same as multiplying a vector
by another vector -- that’s a topic for another episode.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.089
So now we know that a vector has two parts:
a magnitude and a direction, and that it often

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.419
helps to describe it in terms of its components.

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.949
And when you separate a vector into its components,
they really are completely separate.

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:09.300
In other words, changing a horizontal vector
won’t affect its vertical component, and vice versa.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.490
And we can test this idea pretty easily.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.340
Let’s say you have two baseballs, and you let go
of them at the same time from the same height.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.860
But you toss Ball A in such a way that it
ends up with some starting vertical velocity.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.840
With Ball B, it's just dropped.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.640
In this case, Ball A will hit the ground first
because you gave it a head start.

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:30.110
Now, what happens if you repeat the experiment,
but this time you give Ball A some HORIZONTAL

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.729
velocity and just drop Ball B straight down?
Which ball hits the ground first?

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.789
It’s kind of a trick question, because they
actually land at the same time.

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:43.279
It doesn’t matter how much starting horizontal velocity you give Ball A -- it doesn’t reach the

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:49.219
ground any more quickly, because its horizontal motion vector has nothing to do with its vertical motion.

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:52.449
With this in mind, let’s go back to our
pitching machine, which we’ll set up so

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.339
it’s pitching balls horizontally, exactly
a meter above the ground.

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:01.239
Then, we get out of the way and launch a ball,
assuming that “up” and “right” each are positive.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.000
How do we figure out how long it takes to hit the ground?

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:08.199
That’s easy enough -- we just completely
ignore the horizontal component and use the

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.879
kinetic equations the same way we’ve been
using them.

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:15.959
In this case, the one we want is what we’ve been calling the displacement curve equation -- it’s this one.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.800
We just add y subscripts to velocity and acceleration,
since we’re specifically talking about those

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.860
qualities in the vertical direction.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.880
Now we can start plugging in numbers.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.620
The ball’s displacement, on the left side
of the equation, is just -1 meter.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.740
There’s no starting vertical velocity, since
the machine is pointing sideways.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.760
And the vertical acceleration is
just the force of gravity.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.560
Now all we have to do is solve for time, t, and we learn that the ball took 0.452 seconds to hit the ground.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.520
Its horizontal motion didn’t
affect its vertical motion in any way.

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:52.829
But sometimes things get a little more complicated
-- like, what about those pitches we were

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:58.400
launching with a starting velocity of 5 meters
per second, but at an angle of 30 degrees?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.500
Well, we can still talk about the ball’s
vertical and horizontal motion separately.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.960
We just have to separate that velocity vector
into its components.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:12.360
Just like we did earlier, we can use trigonometry
to get a starting horizontal velocity of 4.33 m/s

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.200
and a starting vertical velocity of 2.5
m/s.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.459
Now we’re equipped to answer all kinds of
questions about the ball’s horizontal or vertical motion.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.959
Here’s one: how long did it take for the
ball to reach its highest point?

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.560
We already know something important
about this mysterious maximum:

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.479
At that final point, the ball’s vertical
velocity had to be zero.

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:36.060
That’s because of something we’ve talked
about before: when you reverse directions,

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:41.240
your velocity has to hit zero, at least for
that one moment, before you head back the other way.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:46.079
So, in this case, we know that the ball’s
starting vertical velocity was 2.5 m/s.

00:08:46.079 --> 00:08:50.799
And we know that its final vertical velocity,
at that high point, was 0 m/s.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.900
Finally, we know that its vertical acceleration
came from the force of gravity --

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.240
so it was -9.81 m/s^2, since up is positive.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.199
And we’re looking for time, t.

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:06.839
Fortunately, you know that there’s a kinematic
equation that fits this scenario perfectly

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:09.180
-- the definition of acceleration.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:16.259
By plugging in these numbers, we find that it took the ball 0.255 seconds to hit that maximum height.

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:21.139
So, describing motion in more than one dimension
isn’t really all that different, or complicated.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.960
You just have to use the power of triangles.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.540
In this episode, you learned about vectors,
how to resolve them into components,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.940
and how to add and subtract those components.
We also talked about how to use the kinematic

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.480
equations, to describe motion in each dimension
separately.
