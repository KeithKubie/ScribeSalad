1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,860
MMM.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,980
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:08,200
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. And Ah,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,330
just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,070
I'm just seeing how your week is going.
This is, this is a a, it's a hard week.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,360
Okay.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,840
Coming off the holiday vacation, you
know, at some point on your vacation,

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:22,771
you know,

9
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:26,460
a certain thought pops into your head
and I'm not talking about walking out the

10
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:29,550
front door and just abandoning
your family, you know,

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,010
and not even because you
don't like your family.

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:35,370
Maybe it's a relative that's
just their cackle, you know,

13
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:38,640
when it's just making you ear drums
just vibrate in a certain way that,

14
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:42,750
that it wakes up that part of your brain
that just doesn't give a fuck. You know,

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,620
the part of your brain that sociopath's
are always said, you know what I mean?

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,090
Just the wrong cackle can open that door
for a minute and then your brain starts

17
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,590
going like,
what if he just got up and left

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,890
and what came back later?
No, no dude left, like left.

19
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,550
Not like left or right.
I mean leave left gone.

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,650
What if you did that right?

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,410
Um, plus also it's the beginning of a new
year. There's a lot of hope in the year.

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,640
Yeah.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,510
Um, chance for new things and
if you'd like to keep that hope,

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,870
uh, you probably shouldn't
watch the news because you know,

25
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:25,520
I've been fucking working my ass off
already. And uh, I was like, wow,

26
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,830
I've got really nothing to talk about.
Let me take a glance at the news.

27
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,540
Good Lord.

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,100
Okay,

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,500
good Lord.
I just googled news there,

30
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:38,370
this whole article on Donald Trump about
how he never wanted to become president

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,920
and then just some of the
quotes they have, it's like,

32
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:44,940
where did you get that quote?
You know,

33
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:46,610
something about Donald Trump being like,
yeah,

34
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:48,690
I'm not going to win this fucking thing.
And then he finds out,

35
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,070
he made it to the next
level and he just showed a,

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,340
looked ahead and see and allegedly said,
this is so fucked up.

37
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,390
It's like, who knew that he said
that? And I don't, I don't know.

38
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,100
I don't fucking know.

39
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,970
And then I'm watching all this stuff in
Palestine and the whole fucking thing.

40
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,080
It's just about money.

41
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,630
Yeah.

42
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,520
That's all it is.
It's above fucking money.

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:13,630
Okay.

44
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,240
You know, sometimes I wonder
if everybody in the world right

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,790
in, it'd be a weird game to play, right?

46
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,700
But all these fucking rich people just
squeeze in the fucking life out of

47
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:28,380
everybody. Pitting everybody
against everybody. If you just,

48
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,560
if everybody in the world just was just
like, well, what do you, what do you want?

49
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,910
Huh? What? What exactly
is it the to just take it,

50
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,420
does that make you have, I don't think,
I don't even think they could enjoy it.

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,930
They could have the biggest fucking
house on the biggest hill and the biggest

52
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:46,590
side of town. All of that fucking ric
flair shit. Right with minus the humor.

53
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,090
They could have all of that.

54
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,220
And the fact that everybody beneath
them wasn't miserable on some level.

55
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:57,420
I don't honestly think that
they could enjoy it. Um,

56
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,950
who is a bill? Give me one name. I don't
know. I looked at the news for 10 minutes.

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,190
That's,
that's what I felt.

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,000
That's why I don't watch it cause it makes
me think things like that. All right.

59
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:11,800
I don't like fucking seen people
around the world crying. I don't,

60
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:14,470
you know, I gotta commend people
who actually try and pay attention.

61
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:17,950
Maybe that's why they,
they just blame one side or the other.

62
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,930
Cause other than that, if you just sort
of try to look at it in an impartial way,

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,260
you just like, we're just the
fuck are we doing to each other.

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,020
It's really depressing.
So let's get out of this.

65
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:30,870
Okay.

66
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,780
You know, grandma could solve any
fucking problems. Here was kitten hope.

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,260
This podcast is supposed to be an
escape. Um, anybody watched the,

68
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,110
uh, the Sally's Boston Celtics
First, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

69
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:47,030
I had a bad feeling about this one. I was
like that white dude and platoon like,

70
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,880
man, I got a bad thing. Um,

71
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,670
before the [inaudible] stop for shit
this time I thought Lebron was going to

72
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:58,950
come in and I was like, oh boy.
Oh boy. That was the thought.

73
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:02,940
Isaiah Thomas explained, but he wasn't
playing and love went down. But I mean,

74
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,140
he played most of the game, but, uh,
so that's the game. We should have one.

75
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,950
And not only did we win, we won by 20.
And you know what that means? Come April.

76
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,620
It doesn't made shit,
doesn't mean shit.

77
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,580
Maybe if we go down to one game
and it comes down to home court,

78
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,740
we win by one game. Maybe it means that,
but other than that, it's just a winter.

79
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,583
January.

80
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,040
But,
um,

81
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,300
I dunno, when I look at the Cavs,
I'm just like, all right, these guys,

82
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,650
when they get to the fucking playoffs,

83
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,070
they got enough grizzled vets and then
they got superman playing for them.

84
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,050
They got jr Smith was the Shit Isaiah,
we all know what the fuck he could do.

85
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,300
They got fucking Jae Crowder,
right? I mean they, they,

86
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:46,530
and then they got love. I mean,
that's a hell of a fucking team. So,

87
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,300
but when I look at the Celtics, I just
see that when next, you know what I mean?

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,840
It's like Cleveland is that old movie
star that's still fucking selling more

89
00:04:57,691 --> 00:05:02,340
tickets than the young buck coming
up. But that person knows, they know,

90
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,990
right?
They know that that Burt Reynolds and uh,

91
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,660
I don't know with Tom Cruise,
I don't know who to pick next.

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,410
It went Burt Reynolds and
then it was Tom Selleck,

93
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:21,411
which was weird when I was growing up
every fucking like movie star Dude,

94
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,620
we had to be a guy's guy
with that fucking mustache.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,270
So it went from Burt Reynolds,
who I think established the look,

96
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,263
right?

97
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,540
Danny had Tom Selleck,
Danny had that Guy Played Matt Houston.

98
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,260
And then somewhere in there
the mustache went away.

99
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:45,000
But there was like a seven to
eight year period without mustache,

100
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,290
you know, in the black curly
hair, you had to have that shit.

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,360
You know all these fucking groups that
think all you gotta do is just be a white

102
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,070
guy and the door opens.
No,

103
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,620
they're looking for that fucking dude.

104
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,540
You had to be that white dude with the
jet black hair and that fucking mustache.

105
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,190
And if you had to beat the Marlboro man,

106
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,380
you look like me. My fucking role models
growing up. Who was all be Ron Howard,

107
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,820
Ralph mouth burning for room two 22.
None of them got any pussy,

108
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:22,730
you know what I mean?
Rob Ritchie was fucking ear,

109
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,750
longterm fucking relationship
and the prime of his life.

110
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,150
Well Lori Beth lily doing this weekend,

111
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,320
meanwhile Fonz having a fucking
threesome over by the jukebox.

112
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:37,250
Everybody's looking together way.
Why? Because he had that hair.

113
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,490
We had that fucking, you had the right
colored hair. That's how it works. Um,

114
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,330
anyways,
I don't mean what the fuck up talk,

115
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:48,100
what the fuck was I just talking about

116
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,510
Burton while we were talking
about basketball here. Fuck.

117
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:57,070
Am I talking about Fonzie now?
Basketball. So that was a big,

118
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,440
there was a big one for us.
Big Guy, Dearborn for us.

119
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:04,420
But you know who's getting here?
You could beat the cavs in January,

120
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:08,150
but could you win four out of seven
April a bad ad. Let the big boys,

121
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,340
you got bad blood there plugged in. Short
job. One lady to dumb, all that bullshit.

122
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,560
Right? But whenever it was
a fun game to watch and uh,

123
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,590
considering I took my lady to a Celtics
game when I went home for Christmas,

124
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,780
uh,
she's kind of watching now.

125
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,560
I gotta watch and it's fucking incredible.

126
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,980
She's not rabid yet. She's not rabbit. I
got to get them into the day in, day out,

127
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,000
fucking soap opera of it. You know
what I mean? The way she got me into,

128
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,850
uh, uh, what does that
fucking show that she watches

129
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,890
hip hop a love,
something like that.

130
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,460
Love and hip hop.
That's what it is.

131
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,220
I fucking watched that show.

132
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,850
I can actually sort of handle that show
other than there's just one check on

133
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,960
there who just, I swear to God, I
don't know what she just looks like.

134
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,780
She looks like an evil man. You know
what I mean? And I don't mean like a

135
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,550
like sinister, I literally literally
mean like possessed by the devil.

136
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,150
How did they do this fucking weird thing
on all reality shows now I think they

137
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:25,030
kind of stopped,
but these were older episodes.

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,840
Do you know that thing they do where
they put those, those cat eyes,

139
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,310
whatever that filter,

140
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,700
whatever the fuck the proper
technology technological term is.

141
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,390
When they shoot those people talking
right on the reality shows they do that

142
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:42,330
thing where they give them like
three highlights in the fucking eye.

143
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,710
Then it looks like they're starting to
turn into something but they never do.

144
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:50,640
You know what I mean?
Um, they kind of do that.

145
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,370
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.

146
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,900
I never feel wider though when I like
when I watch love and hip hop though,

147
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,350
you know what I mean? Cause I have
no idea what's the fuck's going on.

148
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:06,060
I can't tell who's a good rapper.
Who is it? But I will tell you this,

149
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,690
like most white people,
if you change your fucking we've,

150
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,500
I can't stay I the amount of times
I'm like, that's the same woman.

151
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,330
Cause they'll cut back and forth

152
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,350
and the woman will go from jet black
hair to fucking blonde hair or,

153
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,140
or black with purple and then change
the color of a fucking eyes. You know,

154
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:29,210
as white as I am, I can't. That's a
completely different person. Yeah.

155
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,770
Um, which is why no white
person should ever be on a jury.

156
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,100
All right.
If there's somebody black evolved,

157
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,840
I feel just from just from my own
personal experience how fucking dumb I am.

158
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,150
I just made that blanket
statement on all that.

159
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,230
The entire Jujitsu judicial system
should work in this country.

160
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,290
How about those fucking Boston Bruins?
Huh?

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,920
They fucking want again, they're like
seven. Oh one, two when their last nine,

162
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,310
what did Jakob would say?
And then he said like 16,

163
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,160
three and two in the last 21.

164
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,770
They're on fire right now.

165
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,030
Yeah.

166
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,150
They were on fire when it doesn't count
now. Um, you know the deal, but it's,

167
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,650
it's great that they're playing with
at the plane and I haven't been able to

168
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,720
watch them as much.
I know that they're playing the panther,

169
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:24,980
so I'm watching that game. So, uh,
cause I'm in the both teams right now.

170
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:26,150
So now rather than,

171
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,930
I usually what I did was I would watch
almost every Bruins game and then I would

172
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,120
watch,
you know,

173
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,530
yeah.

174
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,490
Important Celtics Games or
whatever. But, uh, now I kind of,

175
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:40,820
I've gotten into both of them because
they're both young teams playing fucking

176
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:41,654
great.

177
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,950
And I got a kid and just the way it's
been working with the dad responsibilities

178
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:49,160
is every time the fucking Bruins have
a game, I got to do some dad stuff,

179
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:53,060
which of course comes first. No
disrespect to my beloved Bruins. Okay.

180
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,150
Um, but anyways, I have, I'm going to
watch what does it tomorrow night. Yeah.

181
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:03,200
Game comes on at five on the, I can watch
that. I'll definitely watch that. Um,

182
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,500
all right, so that's it. I think I don't
have anything else to talk about. Oh,

183
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:09,020
by the way.
All right.

184
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,410
I want to thank that person that fucking
said that I was an alcoholic and that I

185
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:14,890
should be a friend of bill
w for whatever the fuck it,

186
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,510
which just sounds like another Bush,
you know,

187
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,970
it's going to be running for office,
um,

188
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,290
later on sitting down to South America
with the fucking land that he bought that

189
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:28,880
sits on a fucking
aquifer painting.

190
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,150
Yeah,

191
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,671
I would,
I,

192
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:40,671
the amount of money I would pay
t to just be in George W's had,

193
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,560
you know, not Obama said Obama
just sounds like he would be,

194
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,130
he would sound like the way
you talk all Oklahoman Club,

195
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,710
all the fuck he was talking
about. You know, but I dunno,

196
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,560
there's something about WWE,
they always fascinated me.

197
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,020
He would just be sitting there
like, what the fuck was it?

198
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,590
What the fuck was that?
Did I really do that shit?

199
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,623
You know,

200
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,660
I don't sell about that guy I was looking
at that looks like the kind of guy

201
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:12,330
would take summer school with,
you know,

202
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,790
Obama was like the kiss ass

203
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,280
fucking raise his hand when
you forgot to assign homework.

204
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,370
You know, it really is, is
I don't like smart people.

205
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,140
You know, I have a lot of weird things.
I don't know. I don't let a certain type,

206
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:33,500
I don't like book smart people.
Uh,

207
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,350
just cause I see this is all petty shit
just cause I'm not good at it. And uh,

208
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,160
and the older I've gotten, I realized
somewhere along the line, uh,

209
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,910
I don't like beautiful women.
Obviously they're fun to look at.

210
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,740
Obviously my wife is fucking gorgeous.
I think she's gorgeous.

211
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:52,340
But generally speaking, I don't like
beautiful women. I just don't like it.

212
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,470
And it's for very simple
reason that did fucking rude

213
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,040
ditch there,
just fucking rude.

214
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,520
They just don't have just,

215
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,790
just common politeness I guess on some
level because if they're even remotely

216
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:14,030
polite, maybe a guy's like, oh, she wants
it. And then they can't get rid of them.

217
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,390
But,
uh,

218
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,410
ditches, ditches, fucking rude.

219
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,100
I can't tell you the amount of fucking
times at the end of my show is right.

220
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,900
Someone will come back,
some guy will come back,

221
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,090
you know, a couple of guys
and they got like, you know,

222
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,180
three or four beautiful women with them,
whatever.

223
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:40,510
And they come back to say thank you
for the show and the fucking woman,

224
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:44,710
I swear to God, they just
stay, they're always bored.

225
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,260
Never say thank you. And I always
end up feeling like, just this.

226
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,430
I always want to be like,

227
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,030
why didn't you two guys just come back
here and just say, obviously I don't,

228
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:59,080
didn't enjoy the show, or they're upset
that they didn't get to meet Oprah.

229
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,870
I don't know what I mean. This is
all I got. I went bald, red, edited.

230
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,750
Dad's jumps around like a fucking
monkey or more. Do you want from me?

231
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,270
I swear to God, take, they come back.

232
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,140
They don't even say thanks even if
you didn't like the shell. Right.

233
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,720
Okay. Like say I went to
one of their fucking show,

234
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,230
some fashion show where they
walked down the fucking runway.

235
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,670
Like they're all pissed off.
You know?

236
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:22,600
I don't know why God knows
I haven't bought a drink and
their whole fucking life,

237
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:26,110
I don't know what they're so fucking mad
about. Even if I didn't enjoy the show,

238
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:29,110
even I'd like that what they were
wearing was ridiculous. When I went back,

239
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:33,250
I would be nice enough to be like, Hey,
you know? Yeah. I liked the way. Yeah.

240
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:37,030
When you walk out your legs crossover
and funny, but you did a heck of a job.

241
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:41,200
You know you didn't, you didn't fall over
in those shoes? I could never do that.

242
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:44,770
I would at least have the common decency
to say that or I wouldn't go back there.

243
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,383
Okay.

244
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,930
Bored shitless. I'm bored
shitless. Which I, I dunno.

245
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,420
I always find have always fight the
urge to be like, what do you do?

246
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,780
What the fuck do you do other than
sit there and look at amazing,

247
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,180
what the fuck did you just sit there?

248
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,613
Mm.

249
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,140
How many times a day?
It is a beautiful woman,

250
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,410
sy just out a board as
you know what I mean?

251
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,430
I just feel like you could take them to
an SNL taping and they would be excited

252
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,420
until like, I don't know, somewhere
in the middle of it, you know,

253
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:21,240
when the sketch wasn't about them
they would just start to get upset.

254
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,460
This is really good. I shouldn't say
they're all like that, but just generally,

255
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,440
generally speaking. Um, I dunno,

256
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,290
that's just something that
happened to me recently.

257
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,120
Just struck me as funny and I was,

258
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,710
I called up via afterwards and I was
just going off on it and she was laughing

259
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:43,470
her ass off. I got that. Just
why are they so fucking rude?

260
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,810
I just don't understand it.

261
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,620
Go fucking go hang out with some
beautiful people. I'm sorry. I'm ugly.

262
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,480
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck do you want from me?

263
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,980
I didn't ask you to come back here.

264
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,440
I just kept thinking of
that Richard Pryor bit.

265
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,910
When he went to the fucking White House,

266
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:02,690
they invited him to the White House and
then they treated them like shit and his

267
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:05,370
wife's try to calm him down.
He's in the back room and he's just like,

268
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,550
I am asked to come in this mother fucker.

269
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,530
It was one of my favorite
lines he ever had.

270
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,690
I didn't ask to come to this motherfucker.

271
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,493
MMM.

272
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,680
Anyways, I don't even know what
I'm talking about. You know what?

273
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:26,230
I got my first advertising of the year.
Holy Shit.

274
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,430
I'll tell you I was dying on
the vine there for a minute.

275
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,533
MMM.

276
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,720
Maybe cause I say dumb shit like
I don't like beautiful women.

277
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:38,450
I have not beautiful women by
40% of our products. Ah, right.

278
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,450
Sorry, that was my
password. All right. Okay.

279
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:48,060
Here we go. Look who's
back everybody. Okay.

280
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,160
[inaudible] days, no more sweaty balls.
But it do to be a, these beyond the,

281
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,930
take the bitch to the mall by
everything in the fucking store.

282
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:04,430
She don't care cause she's a whore. She's
looking for someone with a shiny yeah.

283
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,630
Car.
This is why I don't watch reality TV.

284
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,570
That is really my big complaint
when Nia watches reality television,

285
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,580
just because I have major issues with
fucking women that I had been working on

286
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:21,050
for a long fucking time. And you know,
if you've noticed in my last specials,

287
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:24,110
I really have stayed away from,
you know,

288
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,980
the epic levels that I've gone to at some
point to the point I watched them now,

289
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,860
like, what the fuck is wrong with me? Um,

290
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,850
but now she's got me watching this
reality show and it's just every fucking

291
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:35,684
thing.

292
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,480
Every paranoia that I have about
him is just shown in his I,

293
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,000
it's just constant throughout
the whole fucking thing.

294
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Um,
yeah.

295
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,430
You don't have to be like, it'd be
like if you were a Ya, you a woman,

296
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,990

you had to come to my house and watch

radio show we listened to like the

298
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:03,270

You know what I would've
done in first grade?

I would give him so much shit.

364
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,870

tight onto the top of your car,

drive by skid row,

366

00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:25,570
the building is sleeping next to
it and collapse on you. You know,

370
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,780
I'm talking to mattress, not a box sprain.
I don't want anybody to get hurt here.

371
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,490
You just have it fall down and then
you just put your tent back together,

372
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,550
you know, right on top of the
mattress. That'd be the shit,

373
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:44,050

care about you. You know,

380
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,730
trying to say that I was
a fucking alcoholic. Why?

381
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,080
I want to tell you something right now.

382
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:18,280
Friends of Bill W it is July 3rd right?

383
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,670
By the time you hear it's going to
be July 4th and aloe already gone.

384
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:26,110
Three A's in a fucking row.
All right? It was on the wagon.

385
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,750
431 days jumped off for
six glorious fucking days.

386
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,170
Glorious days. Oh, it
tasted delicious. Right?

387
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,950
And I'm right back on it.
You know,

388
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,770
God Damn Aa people date,
they don't like that could do that.

389
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,240
That I can dip in and dip out.
They don't like that.

390
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,340
They think I'm going to lose my old
life in, in, in, in, in the bottle.

391
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,080
I'm not, and I'm stopping right now.
You know, just out of pure vanity.

392
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,310
I just like fucking

393
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,300
not just being a bloated booze bag.

394
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,540
That's why you stopped to begin with.
I didn't stop for the right reasons.

395
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,580
I stopped because I didn't want to
be a fat fuck. That's why I stopped.

396
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,990
You know, I swear to God, I want to go to
a fucking AA meeting. I want to go down.

397
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:24,830
I want to listen to those stories again.
It's fucking, stories are incredible.

398
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,170
You know, I can't imagine if quint
terantin and went to a fucking Aa meeting,

399
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,450
the movie that that man
went right afterwards.

400
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,360
All he's gotta do is
listen to their stories,

401
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:38,240
throw some karate in there
and get Jamie Foxx. I mean,

402
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,740
that's how do you not watch that fucking
movie and then put it in 70 millimeter

403
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:44,810
like he did his last one, the
hateful eight. Anybody else?

404
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:49,280
See the hateful eight and 70 millimeter
and that fucking stage coach came into

405
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,640
this with the whole orchestra piece.
It was incredible.

406
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,900
One of any writers do that Shit,
man.

407
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:58,760
You gotta feel bad how
he's just going down there.

408
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:01,040
All those people fucking
fucked up their lives.

409
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,580
The misery that they've gone through
and you're going down there pretending

410
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,220
you're one of them to see.

411
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,550
You can get some good dialogue for your
fucking script and maybe sell something

412
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:14,120
to see a wife will quit
calling you a loser. You know,

413
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,610
I don't know if this happens.
I have no idea.

414
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:18,770
I don't know why I'm acting
like this is fucking happening.

415
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:23,030
I'm not saying it's happening, but
you know, it wouldn't surprise me.

416
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,230
Right. You know, it's
really surprising me is, is

417
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,700
the fact that I still have another
four and a half fucking minutes to go.

418
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:34,670
And this is one of the few times that I
don't have anything to fucking say. Oh,

419
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:38,560
I got one for you. You know what I did
today? I did Jones, these jukebox on

420
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,570
K,
Los Steve Jones from the sex pistols.

421
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,140
I've always been a fan of
his is his radio program.

422
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:49,130
It's on from 12 to two in the afternoon.
He plays whatever he wants.

423
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,920
Sometimes he picks up the
guitar and just makes up a song.

424
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,730
He always has great guests
and all that type of stuff.

425
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,830
But I'm an old man, so I,
I never knew where it was.

426
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,250
I would always find it.
And then I, you know,

427
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:06,740
I don't know how to set the
fucking buttons in my radio,

428
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,460
at least the back in the day.
So I, I don't know. He had a,

429
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:15,590
he has a great one and then the guy
from the e street band, little Stevie,

430
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,500
what is his little Stevie's garage?

431
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,270
They just amazing fucking Djs in their
knowledge of music is incredible.

432
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,450
And the fact that they are
actually you listening to basic,

433
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,780
you listen to a fucking rockstar
playing the music that he enjoys.

434
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,970
There's not a lot of radio shows
like that. You know what I mean?

435
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,090
So I got to go down there
today and do it. And, um,

436
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,120
I knew that guy was funny,

437
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:42,620
but Jesus Christ hung out on his
show for like 90 minutes and, uh,

438
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,760
I, I could barely keep up with
the guy, you know what I mean?

439
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:50,640
He's not supposed to be standup
comedian level funny, right?

440
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,530
He's supposed to be musician level.
Funny.

441
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,210
It was fucking unbelievable. Guy Was a
guy was hilarious. So if you listened,

442
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,090
I hope you'll listen to it. Um, I
had a great time on that and um,

443
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,540
I also realized how little I know about
music because he plays all this cool

444
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:13,560
shit, you know, and I listened to all
the mainstream stuff, so he was like,

445
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:17,110
you know, think, what
did you listen to? Uh,

446
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,390
I said I was growing up. I was
like, you know, hair metal,

447
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,950
heavy metal ACDC.
Stevie ray bond.

448
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,550
That's about it.
And then my dad's big band swing,

449
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,360
I don't think you played that shit
on your Dhea and he's out playing.

450
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,260
So he ended up playing a motley crew,
uh,

451
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,370
looks at kill and then into ACDC livewire,

452
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,970
which I thought was pretty
cool that he did that.

453
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:45,900
But I was actually kind of nervous that
he was going to lose some of his fan

454
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:49,110
base. Like who is this stupid
comedian requests in this shit? Um,

455
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,310
but I don't think we got any
goddamn complaints. Um, you know,

456
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:58,290
it was cool was he actually
had the, uh, always at the, uh,

457
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,180
Chelsea arsenal game on
in the background and um,

458
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,040
I just cannot get into that

459
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,740
shit unless I'm over.
And if you over in England,

460
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:15,390
it's impossible not to get
into it. Everybody gives a
fuck. Everybody's drinking.

461
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:19,770
People care. He tried to get into
it over here. It's so fucking quiet,

462
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,031
you know,

463
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:24,490
which you and a couple of nerdy friends
that there's just no fucking place to,

464
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,660
to watch it at that level to get into it.

465
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,440
But at least when you watch the premier
league game, you can hear the crowd,

466
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:36,150
how much they're into it.
Um, but like American soccer,

467
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:40,560
Jesus Christ, he gave her
a fucking pin drop. Um, uh,

468
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,870
less Mexico's playing in,
it's out here in la.

469
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,760
Then it sounds like this is amazing.

470
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,680
So he had that game on the background
and just watching how much he gave a fuck

471
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:51,990
plus with his accent,
it was the shit.

472
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:56,991
And I got into the game and his team
went up a two to one and he was nervous

473
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:01,920
with 10 minutes left. And the last
thing I said to him was like, dude,

474
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,720
10 minutes left in a soccer game is like
0.8 seconds left in a fucking hockey

475
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:09,120
game in the pucks on the
other end of the ice. This,

476
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:11,940
this game is over that
nobody is almost like a rule.

477
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:15,420
They're not going to score
four goals in one soccer game.

478
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,980
So I go home and I'm fucking trying
to find the Celtics game tonight.

479
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,270
And I went on Fox sports and they were
talking about the game in fucking arsenal

480
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,070
, came back and scored a goal somehow in
the last 10 minutes. So it was to, to, to,

481
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,600
to ended up in a tie. They got
jinxed it. So my apologies. Um,

482
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,161
but you know what?

483
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:41,590
I've always been trying to have a fucking
team when I was over and I knew there

484
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:45,010
was no way I could root for man United
because that's like when I go over to

485
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:48,310
England, I see somebody with a
fucking Yankee hat on. It's like, ah,

486
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:53,080
you fucking mouth breathing.
Can't, why are you a Yankee fan?

487
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,740
Why? Who could take one, two motor?

488
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:59,260
It's the only fucking team
I know the fuck out of here.

489
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,670
I want to go over there and
see somebody with a blue.

490
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,670
Jay had on some shit like that.
So it's like there's no fucking way I can,

491
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,840
I can do that. So, uh, I've been trying
to pick a team over there and uh,

492
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,180
maybe I'll, maybe I'll follow
Chelsea. I have no idea.

493
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,010
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
All I know is it's late at night and I'm,

494
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,810
Oh my God, I wish I saw that text
earlier. Somebody just fucking texted me.

495
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,400
You going out tonight cigar.

496
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,950
Oh, that would be tremendous. Um,

497
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,650
I'm trying to cut down on
those fucking things too.

498
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,140
Just maybe it's good that I didn't see it.

499
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,830
I'm actually gonna I'm going to try to
live the rest of this month the way I

500
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:42,110
lived when I was eight.
All right.

501
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,930
Which is basically no booze,

502
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,760
no fucking porno,
no cigars.

503
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,340
You know, I'll go buy a bicycle,
paternity of a paper route again.

504
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,920
Um, I dunno. I'm fucking enjoying the, uh,

505
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,400
the clean living and then every once
in awhile fucking a little debauchery.

506
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,660
Maybe I'll do that.

507
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,070
I'll be fine.
I'll office six weeks on for four days.

508
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,380
That wouldn't be bad. Right? Would
that be bad for your liver? Um,

509
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,280
the thing is I have too much expensive
booze here and I can't just leave it

510
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:29,210
there and I'm not giving it away. At
some point I've got to fucking drink it.

511
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:32,120
Right? All right, Bill. You know what?

512
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:34,820
We don't give a fuck about you and
your stupid boots. All right. I get it.

513
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:38,930
I'm done talking about it. Um, all
right. That's the Thursday afternoon,

514
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:42,950
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast. I hope you have an a great,

515
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,140
what are you new year's resolutions?
What are you doing?

516
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,910
You know what I'm trying again then I've
failed with all the fucking time is I'm

517
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:52,700
trying to get back to become
fluent in French again.

518
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,620
I'm back on that dual lingo.
Fucking train and out again.

519
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,430
I got the flashcards,
I got all of that shit.

520
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,840
I need a French friend.
You know,

521
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,550
someone just fucking hang out and
talk to me like I'm a baby in French.

522
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,700
You know,
the way my kids going to learn English,

523
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,080
like they got to teach it that way,
you know? And you know what it is.

524
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,250
There's been enough people going to do,
you never gonna learn that shit. Um,

525
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,860
that's the only way I learned
shit. Is it so much? Yeah.

526
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,320
You're never going to do that then. I'm
like, Guy, fuck you. I'm going to do it.

527
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,530
But if they say low, yeah,
you should have no problem,

528
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:36,590
then I blow it off and all right, fuck
it up. One or the other. I don't know.

529
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,580
Just feels like a fucking therapy
session. Um, all right. That's it.

530
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,380
I get nothing. I got nothing for you.
Um, I've got no gigs is fucking month.

531
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,210
I might be doing something.

532
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,410
I might be doing a show in San
Francisco cause I'm going up there.

533
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,860
Kevin Pollock for sketch fest. I'm going
up there and I don't, I don't know,

534
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:59,150
doing something with him at one in
the afternoon at the Castro theater,

535
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,900
which I believe is on the 15th,

536
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,640
the 15th in fucking January. Hold on
a second. Let me see if this is right.

537
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,370
Let me see.
That may see the 13th.

538
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:18,410
It's on the 13th. Um, and I might,

539
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,370
I might be doing a couple
shows at cops that night.

540
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:23,840
I'm trying to see if that's gonna happen.

541
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,020
I probably shouldn't have said
that because it just falls through.

542
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,010
Then they're gonna be like, what the fuck?
She's sharing a book. A book. Good. Um,

543
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,020
all right. That's it.
Enjoy the music. And, uh,

544
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,160
the new plane of another half hour
greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon

545
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:41,630
podcasts from a Thursday. Uh, I
dunno, early this year from years ago,

546
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:45,410
I have no fucking idea and maybe I'll
lose another fan because they say

547
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:47,540
something about Jesus. All right, see you.

548
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,613
[inaudible] [inaudible]

549
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,573
[inaudible] [inaudible]

550
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:31,680
[inaudible] [inaudible] about

551
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,710
my week.
I had a fucking insane week.

552
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,890
I went to the rose with a fellow
comedian and I'm not gonna name his name.

553
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,530
Usually I'll do that. Maybe
it give somebody, you know,

554
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,550
bump up their friends or that type of
stuff, which I'd love to do for this guy,

555
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:52,050
but my behavior was so,
uh,

556
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,810
colorful. That's the word I'll
use that you know, just in case,

557
00:35:57,811 --> 00:35:59,640
you know what I mean? I'm old
school. I don't name names.

558
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:03,440
When I start talking about a semi crimes
that I committed, not really committing,

559
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,820
well I guess being drunk
in public is a crime bill.

560
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,240
Why don't you shut the fuck up and get to
the story and we'll, I'll be the judge.

561
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:13,950
Fine. Fine. You guys with all the
tension beginning of 2009 you know,

562
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,820
so you guys be more relaxed this year.
You know,

563
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:22,821
things don't be fad in 2009
love the thing you gotta rhyme.

564
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,580
You know, just make it rhyme
and then, then, then, then
I'm supposed to feel good.

565
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:29,220
You know, and I'm not supposed
to notice that last year it was,

566
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:33,200
things are going to be great in 2008
and now you've, you've knocked it down.

567
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,120
Now it's things. They'd be
fine things. It'd be great man.

568
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,910
They're going to be fine.
You know,

569
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,870
don't freak out in 2010 oh did they
combine this with Canada in 2011

570
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,750
why am I fucking checking myself out at
a grocery store and I'm not getting paid

571
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:56,010
for it? Okay, so my name is,

572
00:36:56,011 --> 00:37:00,000
I go to the rose bowl with a comedian.
We're just going to call him Joe.

573
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,180
All right.
Cause that's the classic alias name.

574
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,390
When you don't want to get somebody
in trouble, you just call him Joe.

575
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,960
But the ironic thing is this
guy's name is actually gel.

576
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,760
So me and Joe,
we go to the a fellow comedian in a,

577
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,280
now you can try to figure out who the
fuck he is and it's not fiscal. Um,

578
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,890
we go to the Rose Bowl and, uh,
we had great intentions. Okay.

579
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,590
Let me paint a picture for you.
Okay. When you go to the rose bowl,

580
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,070
it's one of the great
tailgating experiences you'll
ever have. First of all,

581
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:31,490
you go into the Rosebowl,
okay.

582
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,850
The granddaddy of them all home have
a bunch of Superbowls Superbowls with

583
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,660
polluted that super bowl.
Uh,

584
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,310
if you see that famous Lynn
Swann catch that wasn't made,

585
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,190
they're actually realized that was
made at Temple University, wasn't it?

586
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,180
I don't fucking know.
There's been on,

587
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,310
I know that Jackie Slater one where
he dropped the ball. That's right.

588
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,930
That that cowboy Steelers won
the greatest fucking, I dunno,

589
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,550
clash of two powerhouse
teams I ever saw was the, uh,

590
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,930
I dunno,
whatever they played.

591
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:03,270
Once you're fucking things there and I
don't have the information in front of me

592
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:06,240
and I'm really killing the momentum of
the story. So anyway, so you go there,

593
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:08,230
right? And, uh,

594
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:13,290
you get right behind the Rosebowl is
what I'm assuming is an 18 hole golf

595
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:16,014
course.

596
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,490
Cause God knows that's how big it felt
at the end of the game when I was two

597
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:22,980
shit faced and we couldn't find
the car and we walked before.

598
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,370
But that, that I'm getting ahead of
myself. You know what I'm foreshadowing,

599
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:31,350
I'm doing what all great movies.
Do you know what I mean?

600
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,440
You go see a movie whenever they
show a movie about a guy who dies,

601
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,990
everybody knows he's going to die. So
they show them, died in the beginning,

602
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,650
and then the next scene is they go back
to his childhood. You know what I mean?

603
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,730
Except they never do that with the Elvis
movie because then they'd have to start

604
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:50,050
the movie with some fat fuck dying on
a toilet and no one wants to do that.

605
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,290
I'll just won't. Well,
is that my pancreas?

606
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,410
PLOP? Um, anyways, so Jesus Christ,

607
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,790
let's get some momentum
here. So we fucking, we go
to this tailgate. All right.

608
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,690
And this is the deal. Basically,
there's just two of us. And amongst us,

609
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:15,160
we have four hamburger patties,
two bags of chips, hamburger buns,

610
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,930
12 pack of Bud Light,
12 pack of Budweiser,

611
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,600
and a Clint Eastwood canteen,

612
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:26,320
size of fucking crown royal,

613
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,150
and to Cuban cigars that I
snuck back from fucking Canada.

614
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,520
So we're ready to go. I got my
sunblock, we loaded up into the Prius,

615
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,150
which is, uh, which was just fucking
hilarious. You know, everybody,

616
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,630
everybody tries to outman people
at the, uh, at the tailgates,

617
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,390
people cone up there with
their, their fucking, you know,

618
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,670
for two or pickups with the lift
kits, you know, the generators,

619
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:56,530
Skype, fucking satellite dish
in a flatscreen TV. You know,

620
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,380
I came there with a little Hibachi,
but whatever.

621
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,590
We had the big thing of crown royal,
so people and Cuban cigars.

622
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:05,260
So no one fucked with us, right?
So we're having a great time.

623
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,670
All of a sudden this lady comes
walking by and she's like, Hey,

624
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:12,490
do you want to buy a little ticket
holder fee? A ticket? I'm like,

625
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:15,910
absolutely sweetheart. 10
bucks a whack. Let me get,

626
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,810
let me get that two times at baby. You
know, you got a cigar in your mouth,

627
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:21,100
you start getting a little swagger.

628
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,590
Some reason when he likes
starts rocking back and forth,

629
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:27,460
like you've got to sing it. Like you got
to sing an Elvis song. I was feeling it.

630
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,140
And the great thing was I didn't give a
fuck about either team USC or Penn State.

631
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,630
I was just happy to fucking be there,
you know?

632
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,170
But I quickly realized most
people were for the Trojans.

633
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:42,190
So automatically I'm a cunt.
Second concert of the year,
I'm like, you know what,

634
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm going to root for the,

635
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,780
I'm going to root for Penn state because
this gives me way more chance to annoy

636
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:50,620
people. Plus, I, I've
never liked USC and uh,

637
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,120
most of it has to do back in the day.

638
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:57,121
I used to be a Notre Dame fan before
Lou Holtz with their holy or holier than

639
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:01,120
thou. We don't do steroids. Shut
the fuck up. Yes you do. All right.

640
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,340
I had acne when I was fucking a teenager,
right? But it wasn't all over my back.

641
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,610
And I also couldn't pick up a
house. Okay, so you fucking,

642
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:11,950
people are doing steroids anyways.

643
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,650
And also I always hated
the Trojans fight song.

644
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,070
They played every three seconds bad that,
that ad that you know,

645
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,420
they came like half a yard.

646
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,890
And it also reminds me of Fleetwood Mac
who I never liked. So fuck the Trojans,

647
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:27,040
right? So anyway, so we're sitting there
and we're drinking or partying would eat,

648
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:31,630
we eat burgers and a then we break out
the crown royal after we'd had polished

649
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:33,740
off a good half a case
between the two of us.

650
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,180
It's probably nine 30 in the morning.

651
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,540
And we just started
pounding this crown royal,

652
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:42,950
which is going down like fucking Koolaid.
I was really impressed with my ability,

653
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,380
or at least the, the makers of prawn
royal. That is some smooth shit. So,

654
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:48,741
uh,

655
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:53,741
so basically we start walking towards
the stadium and the alcohol is flowing

656
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:58,340
through me and that's when
I go into my transformation.

657
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,340
I don't know what happens
to me at sporting events,

658
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:04,690
but instantly I just become the loud guy.
I feel like I'm,

659
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:07,790
I'm doing a comedy show.
I want to make the people around me laugh.

660
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,750
And I also want to irritate as
many fucking people as I can.

661
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,000
So I start walking in there
and I quickly notice, um,

662
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,000
well I know I went to go buy a program,

663
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,900
I'm trying to put this all back
together cause I was pretty drunk. I go,

664
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,900
just to give you an idea of,
of the mood that I was in,

665
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,960
I get to about a hundred
yards from the stadium.

666
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:34,690
This lady's selling programs and she's
like, Eh, get your program. Come,

667
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,630
c'mon. Get the grants and
like, ah, fuck it. I want, I
want a souvenir. So I walk up,

668
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,440
Mike, how much are they?
She's like, 10 bucks. My God,

669
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:44,870
I find so this other guy comes walking
up because how much for the programs?

670
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:50,280
And The lady's like 10 bucks, right?
And the guy starts bitching to boot.

671
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,380
You kidding me? Right? So I'm standing
there, I got a Cuban cigar. I go,

672
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:58,340
you know what? Let me get another one,
two times. Let me get two of those.

673
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,240
All right, one for you over there.
And the guy's like, really? I go, Hey,

674
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,030
I go take a look at me. They go,
you know what you're looking at.

675
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:07,700
You're looking at a big shot.
Take a good look. There's not a,

676
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,630
there's not a lot of us left. I swear
to God, I said that and I was so drunk.

677
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,910
I was only half joking.

678
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,200
Like I knew I was being an asshole,

679
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,730
but like I was only half a fucking
Cuban cigar. Go Fuck Yourself.

680
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,370
I'm a big shot. Let's get a program
for this fag over here. Who,

681
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:30,200
who's bitching about 10 goes still rose
bowl in bitches about a $10 fucking

682
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:31,760
program.
You know what I mean?

683
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,570
He should have been de pants and he should
have his tickets removed right there

684
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,330
and sent right back to wherever
the fuck you keep key came from.

685
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,880
Send to an Applebee's, watched
the game there. All right.

686
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:47,240
Kind of fucking behaviors. That is
the granddaddy of them all. Thank you.

687
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:52,010
Fucking money out and play
the Goddamn game. All right.
So anyways, so I'm Hammock,

688
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:55,130
right? And we're fucking,
we're walking and uh,

689
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:59,240
I don't know what happened when we got
into the stadium. Everything was cool.

690
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,050
And then they have this weird sort of
like they funnel you in because it's a

691
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:05,960
really old stadium. It's like, you know,

692
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:08,450
it's like trying to go through the
Lincoln tunnel like five o'clock at night.

693
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:10,240
It's a pain in the ass.
So I'm standing there,

694
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,490
I'm getting frustrated
because it's getting close
to kickoff and I hate missing

695
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:17,450
kickoff. So I'm getting pissed. And
I noticed that the Penn state fans,

696
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,390
they've got this chant where one of them,
I don't know where it just yells,

697
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:24,200
we are. And then all the Penn
state fans go Penn state.

698
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,600
And then the dude yells again,
we are.

699
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:30,860
And they all go Penn state and they say
it like five times. And then the end,

700
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:34,350
the guy who starts the chant goes
thank you. And then everybody screams,

701
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,363
yo welcome.

702
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:40,730
And I immediately noticed that it annoyed
the shit out of all these UFC fence.

703
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:42,451
You know,

704
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:44,880
cause they kind of felt like it was a
home game cause they were out there.

705
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,720
So next thing you know, I didn't
even think it. Next thing you know,

706
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:53,250
coming out of my mouth, I'm
going, we are, I'm not even,

707
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:55,670
I'm not from Penn state. I don't know
Shit, right? But I just stuck on,

708
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,840
we got every site's going,
Penn state, Penn state,

709
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:04,200
and I'm like, thank you. And
they're like, Yo, welcome. I'm like,

710
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,340
this is fucking awesome.

711
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,710
I can do this to a whole game and annoy
the shit out of people around me. So

712
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,220
like it took us 20 minutes,

713
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,210
20 minutes to get through the tunnel
and I swear to God, I was like,

714
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:21,420
perfect timing light.
As we got through the tunnel,

715
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:27,110
this check is finishing
singing the national anthem
as we just take in the rose

716
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,390
bowl on a sunny California day,
everybody's wearing that Trojan colors.

717
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,150
Everybody's wearing that Penn state.
There's pompoms.

718
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:40,470
People are going fucking nuts.
And this lady's like, Eh, no.

719
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,190
Ho up the up wave.
And what is,

720
00:45:43,191 --> 00:45:45,960
she finished a fucking stealth bomber.

721
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,210
Flies right over the goddamn top. I'm
shit faced. It's like a fucking acid trip.

722
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:56,340
I almost passed out. Right? So now
you know, we've got end zone seats,

723
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,640
you know, evidently I'm not a big shot.
And we'll wait at the top of the stadium,

724
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,390
which is a really rough thing to
negotiate when you're a redhead drinking

725
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:04,590
whiskey in the sun,
right?

726
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,730
We get all the way up to like row
whatever, fucking triple f and you know,

727
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:15,930
it's an old stadium. Okay. And you know,
back in the day, like you were tall,

728
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:19,620
if you will, like five foot six when
the stadium was built. And now you know,

729
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:22,530
with fucking growth hormones and
all the preservatives in the food,

730
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:24,420
we basically outgrown the stadium's,

731
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,840
not to mention the cheesecake factories
that have these fucking people go to

732
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:31,950
every other day.
So I'm trying to walk a tight rope down.

733
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,230
I'm literally acting this
out on my bedroom by the way.

734
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,110
This is how into these stories I get
to tell show I'm literally walking a

735
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:42,111
fucking tight rope trying to get down
to my seat and I just become that guy.

736
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,990
I fell, I didn't fall. I sorta like,

737
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,910
like Lyft.
It was like almost like I was on his show.

738
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,340
I was the only guy in a ship that
was in a fucking perfect storm.

739
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,710
And all of a sudden the whole thing just
lifted to the right side and I landed

740
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:01,650
on this like 55 year old lady back.

741
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,930
Didn't like land like I was doing.

742
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:07,290
I was on one foot and I put
a knife forearm a little,

743
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,150
I'll Samuelson in front of the net fucking
action right on her back and I was so

744
00:47:12,151 --> 00:47:13,380
drunk it took me,

745
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:18,381
I swear to God at least 28 seconds to
get off her and the entire time I am

746
00:47:18,721 --> 00:47:23,721
apologizing with my fucking cigar whiskey
breaths just got on site on the side

747
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:27,584
of the fight and I just,

748
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,860
I couldn't get off cause I the only way
to get off or was to put all my weight

749
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:37,270
on my forearm and use her as a Bannister
to push me back up because nobody's

750
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,510
fucking helping me because
I'm obviously the drunk guy.

751
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,410
You don't want to touch me.

752
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:46,411
So 28 seconds to try to figure out if I
have the quad strength to pull myself up

753
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,400
without pushing off the back
of this old lady's neck.

754
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,410
I finally just say fuck
it and just drive my,

755
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,640
the meat of my forearm right between
her shoulder blades and I get up,

756
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:03,610
I apologize profusely and I don't
know what Joe was doing at this point.

757
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,030
He was fucking probably just
standing there watching the game.

758
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:12,880
But basically we finally get to our seats.
It was unreal.

759
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:15,670
I didn't know. We got to our
seats and I, we turn around,

760
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:20,050
we faced the game to watch the game and
next thing you know this lady is just

761
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:22,810
screaming at us.
She's like,

762
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:27,550
hey screaming and she's yelling,
you can't smoke in here.

763
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:31,270
And I'm like, what the fuck is she talking
about? Because I put my my cigar out.

764
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,910
I'm going to tell you to do the
fucking Cuban is sweet too, man.

765
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,100
I smoked that thing all the
way down like a Goddamn Roach.

766
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:40,420
It's like burning my fucking fingers and
she's yelling, stopped smoking. I'm like,

767
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:44,140
the fuck she talking about do I smell
like a cigar? And I turned, I looked,

768
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:49,290
I looked to my right and Joe is standing
there with the fucking Cuban cigars

769
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:50,800
still lit in his mouth.

770
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,330
I don't know how the fuck you got pass
security I think is cause we had our

771
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:57,880
tickets, those tickets, things
I bought around our neck.

772
00:48:57,881 --> 00:49:00,850
I don't know if he had
it down by his side,

773
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:05,650
but he's sitting there chomping on
it like fucking Archie bunker. So

774
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,960
you know, in the sense to me, if she
just turned around and she had just said,

775
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:13,660
hey guys, um, you know, that, you
know, I don't know if you know,

776
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:16,510
but there's no smoking in here. You
know, I would've been like, you know,

777
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,110
I'm a happy drunk. I swear to God, I'm
angry when I'm sober, but I sort of,

778
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,500
I'm a happy drunk. I just
would've been like, hey, so I
bought that. We didn't know,

779
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:26,860
oh, what do you use a good
luck, uh, by Ha High, whatever.

780
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:29,800
I would've kept it at that,
but she fucking was yelling at us.

781
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,990
So I don't like being yelled at.
And I like the info.

782
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,730
I like fucking with
people and I'm shit faced.

783
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,460
And Joe is of the same ilk.

784
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:44,020
And then that's when it all started.

785
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,250
She just based, she's like, Hey, she
goes, there's no smoking in here.

786
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:52,870
And then immediately I just
go and I just go and was like,

787
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,580
hey says, whoa. She goes at
California, you, I just smoke indoors.

788
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:02,230
We're like, we're outside. And she goes,
you're not allowed to smoke it. And I go,

789
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:06,190
you're not my mother. This
isn't our section. This is
in your section turnaround.

790
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,340
Right. I just kept being an
asshole. And then finally she goes,

791
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,750
I'm going to call security.
And I'm like, column. She goes,

792
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:17,320
I'm going to call him. I go, go ahead
and call them. And then in my head,

793
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:22,240
my brain is going, Bill, shut up, shut up.

794
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,490
You're going to get,
we're 90 seconds into the game,

795
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,890
you're going to get kicked out.
And I just couldn't myself.

796
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,280
I just kept saying
column, column. And then,

797
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:36,590
then she made some sort of comment,
I think about the size of Joe's knows,

798
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,540
and then he said, hey, he goes,

799
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:45,350
you need to lose a hundred pounds
to talk to me, bitch. He said,

800
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:52,180
and then the guy to the left of us
turns around and he's like, Hey,

801
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,100
I got my kit, I got my kid
here, what are you cursing?

802
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,410
And then Joe goes, well then don't
bring them to a fucking football.

803
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,600
So now I'm doing that laugh,
you know that last way,

804
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:09,440
like your mouth is wide open,
but there's no air coming in or out.

805
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:13,400
I'm having the time of my life
and then the fucking guy goes,

806
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:18,440
he goes, I'm going to call security.
And then I'm just then at once I can,

807
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:23,410
I'm going call up,
I'm gonna Call Him God and call up call.

808
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,660
I was just calling that bluff because
we were so fucking jam packed.

809
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:29,120
And I knew they weren't gonna
walk down there and go do that.

810
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,080
So that lady makes
another fucking comment.

811
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,520
At which point Joe makes another comment
about her weight and then she just

812
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:42,230
turns down and it's like mark and yells
down to her husband and next thing you

813
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:46,220
know, this fucking dude comes running
over and he starts screaming at it.

814
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,330
Since he's screaming at us.

815
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,110
This spray is coming out of his mouth
all over his wife. So it was easy.

816
00:51:52,111 --> 00:51:56,690
I didn't fucking, I was just going,
sir, sir, you're spitting on your wife.

817
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,580
And once you know, that whole thing
was pathetic. He was like 53 but like,

818
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,600
and I'm 40 and I'm thinking like that
and I'm too old to fight this guy.

819
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:08,750
You know, it was just, Oh God,

820
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:12,110
I'm trying to piece this together so we
all sit down, right. So then we sit down.

821
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,860
I think Joe would put out the cigar.
Maybe he was just holding it down.

822
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:17,130
I don't know what was going on.

823
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:21,890
But now by this time we'd
already missed the kickoff.

824
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,730
The Trojan's get the ball
and I think this is the,

825
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:28,340
basically the one good play
Penn state made all day.

826
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:31,340
They Trojans their first play.
I think offense,

827
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:35,960
they handed off the ball and they tried
to do like some sort of sweep the Penn

828
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:40,961
state defense strung out and just stuck
this guy either for no gain or full lots

829
00:52:42,051 --> 00:52:45,270
of one yard. And then Joe, cool.

830
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,570
I forgot to mention is
a good six foot four,

831
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:52,630
just a huge guy just start screaming
like an inch from the back of the Lady's

832
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:59,170
head, who's a Trojan Fan. He just
started screaming like, Nah, Nah,

833
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,880
Nah. I said, I can't believe
like her hair wasn't moving.

834
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,930
He was yelling so loud and then she, I
know she turned around, she had that shit,

835
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,990
that shit, that shit. It was, it was,
it was great. It was fucking great.

836
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,900
And then basically what would
have for the rest of the game,

837
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:22,550
shit would calm down and then we would,
we would,

838
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,950
I don't know,
we would mumble something about,

839
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,350
and then she would fucking yell down
to her husband and that he come over

840
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:32,940
threatening to kick our ass and we
would just laugh at them. And then,

841
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,120
I don't know,
I just realized I was so drunk.

842
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,210
I can't even remember the rest of the day.

843
00:53:37,211 --> 00:53:41,370
I remember it was at the
very end of the game, uh,

844
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,060
somebody,
Joe,

845
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:47,880
if somebody said something about the score
and then the lady in front of us goes,

846
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:50,400
yeah, I'm surprised you can
count that high. I go, yeah,

847
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:54,420
why don't you try counting calories,
right. Something real mean like that.

848
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:57,360
And then once again, she's like
mark. And then at this point,

849
00:53:57,361 --> 00:53:59,630
half the crowd and left
because it was such a blow out.

850
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,150
This dude comes over and he
starts fucking screaming at me.

851
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:06,550
It doesn't scream at Joe
because Joe is six foot four.

852
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:10,290
He yells at me cause I'm fucking barely
five 10 and I'm a fucking red head.

853
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:13,350
Right? Even with the shaved head, I
still look like fucking howdy duty.

854
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:16,620
So he starts yelling at me
and he keeps telling me, yeah,

855
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,950
I'm going to fire you down on the field.
So he kept saying,

856
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,110
he kept telling me he's going to grab
me and fire me down on the fucking field

857
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:26,130
and I was just, you know, and
I was just being an asshole.

858
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,350
Good dead do it. I'm going to fight on
bail. You said that you already said that.

859
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,540
You already said you already said
it. You fucking cunt. All right,

860
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,690
you've got to do it.

861
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,380
You would have and you didn't see you
not so sit down and shut the fuck up.

862
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,450
Which is funny because
by the end of the game,

863
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,940
everyone in the stands somehow
like dust and hated those people.

864
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,760
I mean half of it was
cause they were assholes.

865
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:53,490
The other half was they couldn't
hear the shit that we will mumble.

866
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,880
And at this dude's wife
pool,

867
00:54:56,881 --> 00:55:00,360
I know at this point you might
have a little bit of sympathy for,

868
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:03,160
but I mean I'm telling
you she was, she was, uh,

869
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,420
she was an asshole and she's the
one who made it personal first.

870
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,690
She made the comment
about Joe's knows she, uh,

871
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,500
she was doing real hacky lines too.
She's told me I was ugly.

872
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,130
She goes and I always can lose
weight, you know, which, uh,

873
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:22,080
I believe I saw during the second
season of def jam and um, you know,

874
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:23,101
and I thought,

875
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:26,610
well we will come in with was a lot more
clever and if it was a battle of the

876
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:30,840
bands in a standup situation,
I think we won. So, uh,

877
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,820
basically what ended up happening,
I know this is a long ass fucking story.

878
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:40,080
I don't even have time for questions
this week. But long story short,

879
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,620
we ended up walking out.
Um,

880
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,120
I want to believe that somehow the lady
in front of us to who was being a jerk

881
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:51,480
had a bunch of these dark
streaks on the back of her shirt.

882
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,190
Towards the end of it.
I don't know what it was.

883
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:58,290
It almost looked like a
ashes from a cigar. But um,

884
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:02,340
I know that that didn't happen because
there's no smoking in there. But anyways,

885
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:05,850
we go to leave and we're
basically so drunk.

886
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,910
I don't know man.
It took us like fucking nine hours.

887
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,370
It literally took us 50 minutes to find
our car and I think it was calmer for

888
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,150
being such assholes in,
in, in, in the stadium.

889
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:22,800
And I don't, I don't know who the fuck's
set up the parking lot things out there,

890
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:23,710
but they basically,

891
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,740
the way they do the sections on this golf
course is they have like balloons that

892
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,320
they just have numbers, number
one, number two, number three.

893
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,500
But they're not lit up so you
can't really see him at night.

894
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:39,250
So you walk out of the stadium
drunk and you look up and you see,

895
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:44,020
I saw the number to where we were,
where we were parked and, but you know,

896
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:47,020
you got to follow the path because you
can't walk through the sand traps and

897
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:49,750
shit like that.
So you look down for half a second,

898
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:53,230
then you look up and there's like a big
fucking oak tree in front of you and now

899
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:54,130
you don't know where you are.

900
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,000
It's like the end of the shining without
the shrubs. It's a fucking golf course,

901
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,320
right?
So,

902
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:02,890
and you're far enough away from the
stadium where you can't get your bearings

903
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:07,480
and were just wandering
around and around and around.

904
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,670
And it's getting to the point like,
you know,

905
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,420
like hypothermia is becoming
an issue because it's a desert.

906
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:17,800
It starts getting cold,
was shit faced and we just can find a car.

907
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,690
It was like the Blair witch.
We kept coming back to the
same goddamn ladies keys,

908
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:23,860
whatever the fuck we were.

909
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,180
And then I lost all confidence in
my ability to find the damn car.

910
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:30,700
So I start following Joe,
who is convinced,

911
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,060
even though we both know
we're parked in section two,

912
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:37,660
we went from section three,
section four to section five,

913
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:41,410
and he keeps telling me to go in that
direction because for some reason he

914
00:57:41,411 --> 00:57:44,530
thinks numerically it's going
to go three, four, five to,

915
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:50,090
I dunno, took us an hour to
find the fucking car. And uh,

916
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,950
at that point I started sobering up and
I started thinking about a behavior and

917
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:58,810
I was starting thinking like, yeah,
I kinda can affiliate asshole. Yeah.

918
00:57:58,811 --> 00:57:59,530
You know,

919
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,960
I shouldn't say I shouldn't taken the
higher ground even though that girl was a

920
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:05,770
cunt, you know? And he was just
like, what are you talking about?

921
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,370
What are you talking
about? You, she was a cunt.

922
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:14,200
We treated her like one in and that's it.
That's what I love about that guy.

923
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:18,910
He just, he just breaks it down
to the simplest fucking point.

924
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,280
Hey Buddy, I've got my kid here. What?

925
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:24,130
Don't take your kid to a fucking
football game, which, you know,

926
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:27,340
I know that's harsh, especially if
you have kids, but think about it.

927
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:31,920
Think about it. Why would you bring
your kid to his professional to,

928
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,400
to sporting of that now only that,

929
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,480
that the guy with the kid is
being hypocritical because
he was me before he had

930
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:40,630
a kid. All right? He was having the
time of his fucking life and what now?

931
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,060
Cause he has a kid now all
of a sudden I'm supposed to,

932
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,900
I'm supposed to fucking act my age.
You know,

933
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,790
it's like the fucking
baby boom generation.

934
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:52,510
They banked so much the fucking in the
mud at Woodstock that by the time I come

935
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:55,810
around there's herpes and aids and all
this shit. And then these, you know,

936
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,330
then they come around with it.

937
00:58:57,331 --> 00:59:00,640
Don't do drugs where a condom shit
after they had the time of their fucking

938
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:04,930
lives. I'm so glad all of them are getting
that whole generation is getting hip

939
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:07,330
replacements now,
but their fucking,

940
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:12,430
cause they all had that fucking Olivia
Newton John High impact aerobics tape

941
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:16,510
that they did try to stay in shape.
That's the one good fucking thing.

942
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,810
Consider I gotta fuck with the God
damn trash bag around my dick my entire

943
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:22,250
career. Right. The very least,

944
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:26,210
I at least knew to stretch before you
lifted weights and I also dangerous of

945
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:29,690
high impact aerobics. Okay.
When I did my aerobics,

946
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,890
I definitely was rocking the leg warmers
but I did not let my feet leave the

947
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:37,850
ground. Okay. Um, so anyways,

948
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:43,040
so that's my rose bowl story, um,
to fucking law when I know that.

949
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:46,130
But I think it had some nice moments.
But um, yeah. But getting back to that,

950
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:49,430
what do you guys think about that stuff?
You know,

951
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:55,370
sporting events are not for children.
Okay.

952
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,280
And I know they always try to talk
about the good old days of sports.

953
00:59:58,281 --> 01:00:01,610
The girl days of sports is bullshit.
Okay.

954
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,990
When I was a kid, first football game
I went to, I was fucking terrified.

955
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,500
I was terrified.
It was not a place for kids.

956
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:13,040
It was a place for adults who hadn't
achieved what they thought they were going

957
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:16,400
to achieve in life to get their
fucking anger and frustration out.

958
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:21,140
People within loveless
marriages, you know, people,

959
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:21,974
you know,

960
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,790
people who could tell they were going to
get laid off the next week or maybe the

961
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,810
already got laid off and they just wanted
to get it out. Okay. And they, you know,

962
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,680
they've now turned going to a
fucking football game into like,

963
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:37,220
you're standing in line with a bunch
of people waiting to get their kids,

964
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,850
you know, photo taken with
Santa Claus. You know,

965
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:43,790
and even if you go further back than
my childhood, which was seventies,

966
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:48,020
early eighties, um, if
you go back to the 1950s,

967
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:50,590
they talk about that. Oh, the
good old days of sports. Oh,

968
01:00:50,591 --> 01:00:51,920
what do you mean what when,
uh,

969
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,950
when they finally let a black guy
playing baseball and they said,

970
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,950
we'll fucking black cat on the field and
all that racist shit that was going on.

971
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:02,240
Can you imagine the shit that was
getting yelled in the stands when Billy

972
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:06,050
crystal was going down the go down
and go watch the mic, boy, your boy,

973
01:01:06,051 --> 01:01:08,870
I got myself a hotdog and assess Barilla.
You know,

974
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:12,260
they always tell those stories about
how great it was back then. It wasn't,

975
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:17,060
it wasn't great. They were
way more racist, way more
ignorant, way more sexist.

976
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,510
And people went to the games and
they saw Johnny Unitas. Okay.

977
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,300
So now for some reason,

978
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,960
now it's my turn to be an asshole and be
a drunk and have a good time and all of

979
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:31,280
a sudden I have to take everything down
a level, you know, not now. Now it's,

980
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,370
it's Chuckie cheese time. It isn't.
And I know you guys are saying,

981
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:37,670
well that's because you don't have a
kid right now. No, fuck that. Fuck that.

982
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,380
I wouldn't bring my kid to the game
or if I brought the kids games,

983
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:44,840
I would prepare them. I prepare them,
you know, this is what's going to happen.

984
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,550
Okay. You might see a fight, you know,

985
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,780
hey dad might even get in one. No, I'm
not, I never took it to that level.

986
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:58,000
But you know what I mean?
I think, uh, I don't know.

987
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,680
This is how guilty I am from
my, my behavior though. The,

988
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:07,170
I actually pulled up a quote
from George Orwell who, uh,

989
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,900
granted,
this is from Wikipedia,

990
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,040
which the other day I looked up something
that I knew something about and it was

991
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:15,920
completely inaccurate.
But this is, according to
Wikipedia, George Orwell said,

992
01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:20,160
serious sport has nothing to do
with fair play. It's a bound up.

993
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,800
It's bound up with hatred,
jealousy,

994
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,760
boastfulness disregard of all
rules and sadistic pleasures,

995
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:30,240
pleasures and witnessing violence.
In other words,

996
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:33,060
it's war minus the shooting. Exactly. Now,

997
01:02:33,061 --> 01:02:36,270
why the fuck would you bring a
child to that? And not only that,

998
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:41,190
when was George Orwell alive
a long fucking time ago?

999
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,570
I don't know when he was
alive. When he, right.

1000
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:47,340
1984 he didn't write it in [inaudible]
83 I know that he wrote like the 30.

1001
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:52,620
Stephanie. I'm just saying.
See, that's how he described
sports back then. So guys,

1002
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:54,930
like, you know, these Billy
crystal guys, what do you do?

1003
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:58,170
Those little heartwarming
stories about, uh, you know,

1004
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,830
their baseball cards and going down to
the baseball stadium and acting like it

1005
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:06,300
was this fucking, you know, this
time that was lost, you know,

1006
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:09,180
George Orwell right there,
according to Wikipedia

1007
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:15,360
did guy proved my point. I'm a
moron, but I did have a good time.

1008
01:03:15,361 --> 01:03:16,440
I'm going to tell you like this right now.

1009
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:19,010
If you ever get a chance in your
life to smoke a Cuban cigar,

1010
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:22,890
definitely do it all right.
Because I'm not even a big smoker.

1011
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:27,950
And I could tell how fucking amazing
that cigar was because I've drank fine

1012
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:31,110
wines and I can't tell the difference,
you know?

1013
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,500
And it took me a long time to be
comfortable with myself. You know,

1014
01:03:34,501 --> 01:03:37,920
when you go through the whole long
process of spinning the big red wine glass

1015
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:42,540
around, I see read up on wine
to try to learn. So I, I,

1016
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:43,410
you know about it.

1017
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:46,830
So I wouldn't feel so fucking stupid when
they bring a nice bottle of wine over

1018
01:03:46,831 --> 01:03:50,280
and I'm like, you know, this tastes like
the shit I used to drink in high school.

1019
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,160
You know, I learned
that, you know, red wine,

1020
01:03:53,161 --> 01:03:56,310
the reason why it's in a bigger glass is
because something about the oxygen and

1021
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:58,710
you didn't want it to believe
more and how to, you know,

1022
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:02,400
move it around the fucking table and
then you shove your fucking nose all the

1023
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:06,000
way in it and yet put it in your,
switch it all around your mouth.

1024
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,180
I've got all the moves down and
I'm like swallowed. I'm like, yes,

1025
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:13,920
this tastes like every other fucking
red wine I've ever had. That's not true.

1026
01:04:13,921 --> 01:04:16,680
I can tell the difference between like,
you know, a Cabernet or my lowest,

1027
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,370
something like that.

1028
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:22,370
But like I can't tell like the
difference between a 1499 bottle and a,

1029
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,880
a $60 bottle and uh, you know, I guess
I'm trying to say with this podcast,

1030
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:33,480
I'm not that cultured.
Okay. Alright, well,

1031
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,400
so why don't you guys shaman what that,
okay. Like what do you think David?

1032
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:41,640
He should have a kids section. Should
they just have a chuck e cheese section?

1033
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,313
It's not my fault.

1034
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,900
You're knocked her up and you can't go
to a game and have a good time. Now,

1035
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:50,340
you know, you want to be getting drunk
with me. See what I just did there.

1036
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,970
That's how I made myself write, made this
guy who can't even defend himself, uh,

1037
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:59,240
actually be secretly agreeing
with me. That's how I do it. Um,

1038
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,430
but I mentioned I have a rental,

1039
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:05,950
so

1040
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:40,953
[inaudible]

1041
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:46,391
hey,

1042
01:05:46,391 --> 01:05:49,780
what's going on is Pilbara and this is
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

1043
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,180
January 4th,
2010.

1044
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,740
And I'm having a lot of difficulty doing
this fucking podcast right now because

1045
01:05:56,741 --> 01:06:01,310
I feel like this is like, you know,
it's my second attempt to start it.

1046
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:05,800
I can already feel like this one's going
to fucking suck because I feel like I

1047
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:08,440
can't fucking do what it is that I do.

1048
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:12,760
Cause my downstairs neighbors
of fucking cunt, you know,

1049
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,670
I told you guys that story,
but my downstairs for fucking neighbor,

1050
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,210
how he waits till I'm on the road and
he starts yelling at my girlfriend about

1051
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:21,400
how loud she is, you know?
And then when I come back,

1052
01:06:21,401 --> 01:06:24,910
all of a sudden he doesn't yell. He's like
real sarcastic. He used to do, you know,

1053
01:06:24,911 --> 01:06:29,890
if I drop something he'll be like, do it
again. Right. This old guy. So you know,

1054
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,670
I'm a deck so I fucking whatever. I
dropped, I dropped it from a foot higher,

1055
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:39,160
you know, like I was at yelled,
fuck. You know, this isn't even,

1056
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:44,020
this isn't even like my attitude
towards the guy. Alright? My girl,

1057
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:47,560
you know, she, she, she called me and
she said, look, this guy's yelling at me.

1058
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:50,020
I'm really getting tired of this shit.
You know,

1059
01:06:50,021 --> 01:06:52,720
I want you to go downstairs and
say something to the guy, okay?

1060
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,420
And if you guys listen to my podcast,
you know, I came to the resolution,

1061
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:57,100
like where is that going to get me?

1062
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:01,570
I'm not going to go downstairs and
get into it with some old guy, okay?

1063
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:05,230
I don't fucking yell at old people,
all right?

1064
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:08,650
I might whisper about them and column
cuts on my fucking podcast, okay?

1065
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:13,090
But I have respect face
to face. Okay? He's old.

1066
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:15,370
He doesn't have the Internet. He's
never going to hear this shit, you know?

1067
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:20,860
So anyways, long story short is a
yesterday. And when the fuck was,

1068
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:23,110
it was too,
it was January 2nd you know,

1069
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:26,500
I get a big thing January 2nd
Christmas tree comes down. That's it.

1070
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:30,430
It's fucking over. Alright, I
wait till the end of new years.

1071
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:35,280
I went to all that stuff.
Happy New Year. Oh that Abby.

1072
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:39,640
If I got air, go fuck yourself.
I go through all of that shit.

1073
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:43,090
But the second that's over, it's like,
all right, it's, you know, it's game time.

1074
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:47,260
Alright, back to reality. There's no fat
fuck coming down the goddamn chimney.

1075
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:51,280
I don't have a fucking chimney. I have
a boarded up fireplace. All right?

1076
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:56,140
So Christmas is on me.
If I don't go to best buy,

1077
01:07:56,141 --> 01:08:01,090
it ain't happening. You know? So, you
know, that's one of those fucking things.

1078
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:03,340
If you've got kids, if you've
got kids right now, don't have,

1079
01:08:03,341 --> 01:08:05,740
don't have him listen to this part
as one of those fucking things.

1080
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:08,330
If you're a parent, right? And you know,

1081
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:11,380
you're renting a place like mine that
has a fucking boarded up fireplace.

1082
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:15,010
That's when you know the questions come.
You know,

1083
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,350
you get even further into the lie.
You know

1084
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,290
Santa Claus, Jay do average hey yeah.
Gives you everybody around the world.

1085
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:28,130
Yes he does. Yes he does.
Hey Shay comes down to Chevy.

1086
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:32,390
How's he gonna do well
actually in our place,

1087
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:34,683
um,

1088
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:39,230
there is a chimney he comes
down at and he has a secret key,

1089
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:42,590
a as a secret key and he's able to unlock
and you just sit there and your head

1090
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:45,050
go on Jesus. How deep are, did you
know? You know what? There is no

1091
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,680
fucking Santa Claus. Okay. Jesus Christ.

1092
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:52,150
How fucking dumb is the person that I
made it with that you actually still

1093
01:08:52,151 --> 01:08:55,300
believe this shit cause I know that that's
not my half of the brain asking that

1094
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:59,980
fucking question. All right kid,
do the fucking math. You know,

1095
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:05,460
fat fuck has time to deliver all these
gifts to everyone around the world.

1096
01:09:05,461 --> 01:09:08,160
And even though you can't even
grasp the reality of that,

1097
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,080
we have a boarded up fucking fireplace.
All right.

1098
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,970
Come on. Let's see. Get him back his
fat ass through the fucking thing.

1099
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:22,860
So anyways, so it's January 2nd. Okay.

1100
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,240
Fucking trees coming down and uh,
I don't do it most Douche bags too.

1101
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,180
Okay. I know fucking just, you know,

1102
01:09:30,181 --> 01:09:33,720
drive down the highway and toss it
off on the fucking medium strip.

1103
01:09:33,721 --> 01:09:37,890
Like some sort of mob
snitch. All right. I don't,

1104
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:42,480
I gave two in the back of the fucking
anyone actually do I take it outside.

1105
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,920
All right.
I fucking whack my Christmas tree.

1106
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:50,120
Like fucking a Vigoda.
Remember that?

1107
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:54,870
And the Godfather and he looks at Robert
Duvall, you know. Hey, fulltime sake.

1108
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,200
Sorry. Sorry. Fish can't do
it. That's, that's how I take,

1109
01:09:58,201 --> 01:10:03,201
I take my tree out to the fucking driveway
and then I cut it up like a fucking

1110
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:05,880
body.
I do,

1111
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:09,020
I fucking saw off all
the limbs and then I,

1112
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:13,320
I cut up the trunk and like four or five
different sections and I stick it into

1113
01:10:13,321 --> 01:10:17,610
the green trash bin like I'm supposed to.
All right.

1114
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:22,300
Then I sweep up the pine needles out of
the driveway and all the fucking ones on

1115
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,320
my living room. And that's the end.
There you go. Now the Christmas,

1116
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:29,300
go fuck yourself, right? So
this is the deal. You know,

1117
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:32,840
when you first get the
Christmas tree, you're watering
it. Oh, Christmas tree. Oh,

1118
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:35,760
Christmas tree. In three days into
it, you're so fucking stressed out,

1119
01:10:35,761 --> 01:10:38,820
you stop watering it. You start telling
yourself what's fucking dead anyways.

1120
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:42,450
You know, it's on its last
legs, whatever, right?

1121
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:46,180
So basically by the time you drag the
fucking thing out that the tree is so God

1122
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,290
damn dead, all right, it it, you know,

1123
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:55,370
pine needles fall out, the little needles,
they fall out everywhere. All right?

1124
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:59,280
And I know they're not pine needles for
all you fucking nature freaks out there.

1125
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:02,280
Whatever the fuck they are,
the goddamn evergreen needles,

1126
01:11:02,281 --> 01:11:05,520
they start falling all over the place.
So I bring it out my front door,

1127
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:09,810
stand in awe, and I start dragging
it down the fucking stairs. Okay?

1128
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:13,170
And I'm trying not to be loud,
okay?

1129
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:18,180
I am taking a tree down a flight
of fucking stairs. All right,

1130
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:22,830
fucking water spilling. The needles
are going all over the place, you know,

1131
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:26,370
but I'm being quiet and it's 10
in the fucking morning. Okay.

1132
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,480
If I wanted to build a house,

1133
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:29,510
I could actually legally
start at seven in the morning,

1134
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:30,840
10 in the fucking morning,
right?

1135
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:36,480
So I dragged the thing around and bring
it around the back and all of a sudden

1136
01:11:36,481 --> 01:11:41,481
fucking a grumpy old man sticks his head
out the door and he looks at me and he

1137
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:47,340
just screams
with this bizarre look on his face.

1138
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,730
He just said something like,
what the fuck did he say?

1139
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,600
He just yelled out.
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

1140
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,680
You know?
And I was looking at him like,

1141
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:03,090
why the fuck did he just say something
so nice with that angry look on his face?

1142
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:07,280
And for half a second I was gone at,
man, I think that guy's crazy. You know,

1143
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:11,160
he made me that guy in clockwork
orange food. All right.

1144
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:14,850
You know,
so I was like,

1145
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:17,640
I just sort of looked
at him and I kept going.

1146
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:20,040
I always forget that he's
fucking sarcastic as hell.

1147
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:24,480
And whenever he says he means the exact
fucking opposite, he's basically saying,

1148
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:27,420
yeah, what a beautiful fucking morning
for you to make an almost god damn noise.

1149
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,790
So I walked back around again.
This time I look at him,

1150
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,130
cause now at this point I finally figured
out he was fucking with me. So I'm,

1151
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:36,930
you know, I'm staring
down an old man, right?

1152
01:12:36,931 --> 01:12:40,800
Just this is really embarrassing story.
So I walk up,

1153
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:44,440
I walk upstairs, right? I
stare at him, he stares at me.

1154
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,650
He doesn't say a fucking word
cause that's it. That's his ammo.

1155
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,080
He doesn't like confrontations.
He says shit.

1156
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:51,000
He doesn't mean he means
the exact opposite.

1157
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:55,610
And he yells at people through floors.
All right? And He fucking lives alone.

1158
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:59,670
If it's really sad situation, okay, so
whatever. So I go upstairs. All right,

1159
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:03,610
my girls all heated, he just fucking
yelled at me again. Right? Or at our hour,

1160
01:13:03,611 --> 01:13:06,180
I want you to go down
that time I got it right.

1161
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,600
I'll fucking do it
against my good judgment.

1162
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:13,800
Do not go down there against my gut
saying what the fuck good is going to come

1163
01:13:13,801 --> 01:13:14,634
out of this.

1164
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:19,530
So I go down there and I walked down
and he's fucking sitting there, right?

1165
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,810
He's got this brick path.

1166
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,780
He had to walk up and he's sitting at
the end of it just staring at me, right?

1167
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,200
Expecting me to walk by his path.
But Lo and behold,

1168
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,730
I make a left and I start walking up
his path like some sort of fucked up,

1169
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:36,930
high noon Shit. And I'm
staring right at the guy. Okay?

1170
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,580
And you know what I saw on his face?

1171
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:44,090
I saw fear and I see did what all
guys do while you fucking cunt.

1172
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,510
Jesus Christ,
Carson Palmer,

1173
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:51,840
just through a fuck another interception.
The chats are up 24 nothing.

1174
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,080
Oh my God,
it's fucking over.

1175
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,430
Have you ever seen a fucking
team back into the playoffs?

1176
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,800
More than the fucking jets did? Jesus
Christ. I'll tell you right now,

1177
01:14:01,801 --> 01:14:05,670
I fucking hate the colts as a patriots
fan, but I'll tell you right now,

1178
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:09,240
maybe just sidestep this fucking story.
Let me just tell you something right now.

1179
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:12,520
I feel bad for everybody in Indianapolis
that should not happen to sports fans.

1180
01:14:12,521 --> 01:14:14,050
When you're going for something like that,

1181
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,230
you should lose it because
you got beat by a better team.

1182
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:22,590
You don't put in fucking some guy from
home depot to be quarterback Jesus

1183
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:23,950
Christ.

1184
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:27,100
This is killing my prediction that Rex
Ryan was going to make an attempt on his

1185
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:29,860
fucking life.
I think the NFL knows it.

1186
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:33,270
So they pulled Peyton manning out a bet.

1187
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,370
Everybody in Indianapolis Douche bag
of the week as you're fucking GM or

1188
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,050
wherever the hell made that God damn call.

1189
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:44,250
So now this week they're playing the
fucking goddamn bangles who had their best

1190
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:48,040
receiver fall off the back of a
fucking truck. I mean, Jesus Christ,

1191
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:51,760
I hope we don't play them. I want to do
fuck what's going to happen on our team.

1192
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,200
I think the jet's got some sort of Mojo
going. If they're on your schedule,

1193
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:00,790
something fucking horrific
is going to happen.

1194
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:04,900
You're going to make a bad decision
or somebody is gonna die. So anyways,

1195
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:08,980
so I'm walking up to this fucking old guy,
right?

1196
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:11,290
And,
uh,

1197
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:17,170
and I see fear on his face and he does
what all guys do when they get scared is

1198
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:21,190
they turn the fear into anger so
they can function during this thing.

1199
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:24,160
And my whole thing is, I'm coming down
here, going, build, don't lose your cool.

1200
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:29,660
Let's try to fucking work this shit
out with this guy. So I just say,

1201
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:35,240
uh, Hey, uh, you know, I came
out to fuck. I said, I just
said, you know, hey, you know,

1202
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:37,550
you're kind of always
yelling up at my girlfriend.

1203
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:40,370
We always hear you yelling up
at, as I was just, you know,

1204
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:45,230
one and what the problem was. He's like,
what are your main, what is the problem?

1205
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:50,120
Is faces all fucking twisted up? And
I'm like going, oh Jesus, here we go.

1206
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,750
And like, no, you know, I just, I
know that you think that we're loud.

1207
01:15:53,751 --> 01:15:56,390
We try to walk around, not
put our shoes on, you know,

1208
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:59,960
I just want to come down here and
you know, I just want to work it out.

1209
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:04,130
And he goes, what do you mean
work it out? I'm like, you know,

1210
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,560
I'll try to come to some sort
of resolution or whatever.

1211
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:09,650
And he just starts fucking going.
She just shouted like,

1212
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:14,120
she just dropped a brick on a
damn floor is screaming now.

1213
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:18,590
He's screaming out. His fucking voice
is echoing through the courtyard. Okay.

1214
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:22,730
And I'm fucking sitting there trying
to be civil, but I don't give a fuck.

1215
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:26,510
He just banged on the fucking floor.
I'm doing an impression of you.

1216
01:16:26,511 --> 01:16:29,810
You fucking asshole.
So he bangs on the fucking,

1217
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,160
I think he just banged on the
fucking floor. Dude. This is fucking,

1218
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:36,230
I'm 41 year old fucking man. I'm still
dealing with somebody downstairs.

1219
01:16:36,231 --> 01:16:40,970
It's ridiculous. I've got to get
a fucking house. Um, anyways,

1220
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,500
so, so he starts fucking
yelling. I don't give a fuck.

1221
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:48,500
Even if you were in that loose man,
a whisper on my own fucking podcast,

1222
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:53,870
fucking cunt guys been here 50 years, he's
probably paying $7 a month in rent. Um,

1223
01:16:53,871 --> 01:16:58,820
so anyways, yeah, I don't give a shit. The
second an old person is yelling at you,

1224
01:16:58,821 --> 01:17:01,820
even if you're being relaxed and when
people immediately think that you're an

1225
01:17:01,821 --> 01:17:05,030
asshole, you know, it's Kinda like when
a check throws a drink in your face,

1226
01:17:05,031 --> 01:17:09,260
it's awfully, well, well, yeah,
obviously you did something.
She has a vagina, right?

1227
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:10,520
Obviously I did something,

1228
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:15,200
his fucking whole body body looks like a
fucking wrinkled up, nuts sack, you know?

1229
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:19,910
So this guy is fucking yelling at me
and I'm going, dude, I'm, I'm like,

1230
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,500
I didn't say, dude, I was trying
to be aggressive with this.

1231
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:25,220
I just tried to work things out. He goes,
what are, you mean? What's at work it out.

1232
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,380
He's like, what did, what does that some
sorta new hip expression? I what he said,

1233
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:34,220
it's like, oh my God, did he
just say some new hip expression?

1234
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,410
And he's going, you know, you're
always walking across with your shoes.

1235
01:17:39,411 --> 01:17:42,620
And I'm like, dude, do you think I can't
hear you a TV? It's an old building.

1236
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:47,930
What do you want me to do? And he goes,
AH, why don't you get lost, right?

1237
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:55,340
Like, I'm in some little rascals
episode like fucking three stooges.

1238
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,770
Why aren't you a scram? Right.
So I just kept going, no,

1239
01:17:59,771 --> 01:18:03,380
I didn't come down here to argue
with you. I'm, I'm trying. He goes,

1240
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:08,120
I already called the landlord about Ya.
And I was like, well call him again.

1241
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:09,891
Call him again.

1242
01:18:09,891 --> 01:18:14,600
You think they're afraid of you moving
out with your fucking $3 a month rent

1243
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:16,730
fucking asshole.

1244
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:19,040
They never called me cause they don't
give a shit because you're out of your

1245
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:19,874
fucking mind.

1246
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:25,010
So at one point I'm trying to make
a point to the guy and he just goes,

1247
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,870
how's your band?

1248
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,820
Like making fun of the fact
that I play guitar and I suck.

1249
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:36,970
He said it unbelievably sarcastic can
really hurt my feelings for half a second.

1250
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:41,240
The, he's so caught me out of
nowhere with that, that I wanted to,

1251
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:45,950
I almost started re reading my resume.
I almost said,

1252
01:18:45,951 --> 01:18:49,970
actually I'm not event actually I'm a
comedian and I'm playing the Improv next

1253
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:50,781
week.
Thank you very much.

1254
01:18:50,781 --> 01:18:55,250
Like that's how bad this guy caught me
and pardon me after he said, you know,

1255
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:59,000
how's the band? How's your
band? I wanted to be like, dude,

1256
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:03,410
how's she fucking life?
You know? But I didn't.

1257
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:06,170
I didn't because I don't
yell at old people.

1258
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,340
It probably sounds like I do.
By the way, I'm saying this.

1259
01:19:10,341 --> 01:19:13,790
This is the shit afterwards, when I'm
venting about it, I can really fuck me up.

1260
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,250
So finally I was just like, you
know what? You're being a jerk.

1261
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:20,850
You're being a jerk. Oh, is
that right? Is that right?

1262
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:24,900
Is as I'm showing a new hip term,
if I can sit in there shaking like a leaf,

1263
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:25,940
so fine.
I just,

1264
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:31,010
I walked away and little did I know
that my girlfriend was standing on the

1265
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:35,870
balcony above all of it, listening
to all of it. So not only did she

1266
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,040
instigated the whole fucking
thing telling me to go down there,

1267
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:43,160
she actually got to listen to this guy
trash my guitar playing, which by the way,

1268
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:48,020
we both laughed our asses off about.
But before we did,

1269
01:19:48,021 --> 01:19:49,220
I went upstairs.
Okay.

1270
01:19:49,221 --> 01:19:53,630
And at this point I'm just sitting
there like mad at myself. Go,

1271
01:19:53,631 --> 01:19:54,950
why didn't you listen to yourself,
bill?

1272
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,930
You knew that that wasn't
going to go anywhere, right.

1273
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:03,260
So any fucking way I go upstairs
and I see my girl, I'll tell you,

1274
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:05,990
see is he right? There you go.
Is that what the fuck you wanted?

1275
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,090
Is that what the fuck wanted? I told you
that that wasn't going to go anywhere.

1276
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,160
That wasn't going to go anywhere.

1277
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:15,030
And now what he's going to do is he's
going to call all the fucking landlord and

1278
01:20:15,031 --> 01:20:18,510
he's going to pitch to high fucking
heaven and he's going to exaggerate

1279
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:20,160
everything that fucking
went on down there.

1280
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:22,203
Okay.

1281
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:25,010
Unfucking believable. Unfucking
believable. And the thing was,

1282
01:20:25,011 --> 01:20:28,670
I felt really bad the second I got down
there. I just kept trying to go, no, no,

1283
01:20:28,671 --> 01:20:30,650
I'm trying to work this
out and everything.

1284
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:33,050
I would say he would just repeat
it and be like, what is that?

1285
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:40,610
You know? And I trashed my
guitar playing and, and I, I,

1286
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:45,850
oh my God, I was like, Jesus
Christ. I was like embarrassed.

1287
01:20:45,851 --> 01:20:48,730
I was actually embarrassed. I
was like, wow, he can fucking
hear me. I know I suck.

1288
01:20:48,731 --> 01:20:51,010
I thought I played a quiet enough.
So now I'm happy with my aunt.

1289
01:20:51,011 --> 01:20:54,730
I got headphones on the next day
and I'm playing my awful ACDC.

1290
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:59,410
It's a fucking hobby, you know, that'd
be able to get a hobby old fuck.

1291
01:20:59,411 --> 01:21:02,170
Like getting some friends.
See, see that's why,

1292
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:04,750
that's why I kept my cool cause I would
have said Shit like that, you know,

1293
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,330
that's fucking brutal.

1294
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,960
And you know what's funny is my girl
still fucking pissed at the guy.

1295
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:12,790
It's like a female thing I think.

1296
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:15,790
Cause he's a guy and she kind of feels
like he's bullying her and stuff.

1297
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:19,780
And I just kept telling him going,
you know what? I feel bad for the guy.

1298
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:25,010
I just slammed the door downstairs. I
might be fucking loud. It's ridiculous.

1299
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:29,880
I'm like borderline whispered here so
maybe you can hear the fucking story.

1300
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:34,650
That's his passive aggressive way of
saying he disagrees with my last point.

1301
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,940
Yeah. Slam something else. Your can't
do they have that word back in the 20s?

1302
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,650
Can't water tap me. And it's actually,
I'm new hip word for vagina. Um,

1303
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:48,210
yeah. So I was just saying that,
you know, I feel bad for the guy.

1304
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:51,510
I have to whisper this part cause he
might hear cause due to that case and the

1305
01:21:51,511 --> 01:21:54,010
exact fucking nightmare,
Kate,

1306
01:21:54,011 --> 01:21:57,720
there's two ways you don't want to die
in prison and you don't want to be that

1307
01:21:57,721 --> 01:22:00,630
old person alone. You
don't, okay. You don't.

1308
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:02,010
Okay.

1309
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:03,220
You know,
if your spouse dies,

1310
01:22:03,221 --> 01:22:05,830
that's a different fucking story
because you live life, you know,

1311
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:10,360
but you know it's, you don't wanna be
the person who never got fucking married.

1312
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,080
Guys didn't even have a Goddamn parakeet.
He fucking always has the blinds,

1313
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,340
you know? I know. Anyway, I didn't want
to get a fight with this fucking guy.

1314
01:22:16,341 --> 01:22:20,030
I feel like an asshole.
I really feel like a fucking ass hole.

1315
01:22:20,031 --> 01:22:22,130
So that's my situation
right now. And I, you know,

1316
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,970
that's my situation like
the game that Jersey shore,

1317
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:29,620
do you guys watch it this week?
I don't even know what week I mind.

1318
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:33,380
I fucking watched the first half of
that shit and I gotta tell you, Mike,

1319
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:36,080
the situation is my new fucking hero.

1320
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:40,250
They actually finally showed the footage
because when Snookie got punched in the

1321
01:22:40,251 --> 01:22:42,740
face, I was wondering like,
where the fuck were all the guys?

1322
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,510
How come they didn't do anything?

1323
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:48,590
And they showed the footage
of Mike the situation.

1324
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:54,320
Mack the situation, he didn't,
not only did he not do anything,

1325
01:22:54,321 --> 01:22:57,410
he continued to hit on
the girl that he was with.

1326
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,770
And that's why I thought it was hilarious
if he didn't do anything because he

1327
01:23:00,771 --> 01:23:02,960
was scared,
that would've been something else.

1328
01:23:02,961 --> 01:23:06,100
But like this girl gets blasted
in the face by this guy.

1329
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:11,340
She's on the floor sobbing and he just
looked at it almost like the way a wild

1330
01:23:12,431 --> 01:23:16,330
animal looks at you across
the fucking cage, you know,

1331
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:20,410
when it's just sort of
looking at you and sees your,

1332
01:23:20,411 --> 01:23:21,640
not a threat in or whatever.

1333
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,490
And he just immediately looks at
the girl he's with [inaudible],

1334
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:25,870
you want to get something to eat,
you know, you want to get some knee,

1335
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,440
I'll show you my edge
is fucking hilarious.

1336
01:23:29,441 --> 01:23:32,980
And then watching all those other guys
in the house going, you know Mikey,

1337
01:23:32,981 --> 01:23:37,150
the situation, he Shai the whole
fucking day. What did he do? He did not.

1338
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:41,450
Then he get nothing. What do you
mean he didn't, he did no guts.

1339
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:48,530
The situation, she was sitting there,
feet was enough. Played a Tortellini. Oh,

1340
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:52,400
it's like the most offensive fucking
show on TV. But that was some,

1341
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:55,190
that was fucking hilarious.

1342
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:59,300
He didn't do a fucking thing.
He could, he could give a fuck.

1343
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:02,210
And they were all sitting there
going, yeah, it's not a true friend.

1344
01:24:02,211 --> 01:24:03,290
You fucking right.
It isn't

1345
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:05,883
whatever.

1346
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:10,030
Mike,
the situation knows what he wants.

1347
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,130
He does want to get in
the middle of that shit.

1348
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:18,380
Fucking meatball standing
up there screaming at that
fucking ugly gym teacher.

1349
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,140
Um, anyways, I didn't want,

1350
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:25,140
I'm talking about now my fucking
self conscious because that's fucking

1351
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,830
gay downstairs.
I always wondered about his life.

1352
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:31,650
Like how did he end up down there? You
know, you ever see all people like that?

1353
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:33,030
Like how,
how did that happen?

1354
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:36,183
You know,

1355
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,980
Jesus Christ is out here in la,

1356
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:43,810
probably fucking tested from
Mchale's navy, you know,

1357
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,110
went to network, staring across it.
Ernest Borgnine going this motherfucker.

1358
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:52,770
I thought he did movies. Um, anyways, um,

1359
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,380
I don't know where to go
with this fucking podcast.

1360
01:24:55,381 --> 01:25:00,330
I'm really kind of lost right now
because, uh, because of that, that shit.

1361
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,700
Um,
so I dunno,

1362
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:06,590
I was going to nominate the guy
downstairs Douche bag of the week.

1363
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:09,320
I would have done that five minutes ago
when I was still pissed at and I just

1364
01:25:09,321 --> 01:25:10,850
felt bad for the guy.
Felt bad for the guy.

1365
01:25:10,851 --> 01:25:12,850
I feel bad about the
whole fucking situation.

1366
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:14,913
Okay.

1367
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:18,340
Jesus Christ. The guy was like
trembling as he was yelling at me.

1368
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:20,550
He was so out of his mind.
I kept trying to calm him down going,

1369
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,790
I'm trying to work this out.
Ah, I can't last. You know,

1370
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,790
the whole thing took like fucking
it maybe two and a half minutes.

1371
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,210
Anyways, what I know where the fuck
to go from this. Oh, by the way,

1372
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:36,220
have you guys seen that
fucking scam on TV?

1373
01:25:36,221 --> 01:25:41,221
Whether that they're trying to sell you
that gold coin for 1995 the $50 gold

1374
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:46,531
coin for 1995 and in the end they start
talking about how an ounce of gold is

1375
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,530
worth like is selling for 1200 bucks.

1376
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,600
I mean that's one of those things where

1377
01:25:56,130 --> 01:26:00,150
I don't feel bad for re I like
for people who buy shit like that.

1378
01:26:00,151 --> 01:26:00,984
You know what I mean?

1379
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:06,380
If you're too stupid to realize that
somebody is selling you a $50 coin for 20

1380
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:10,664
bucks,

1381
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:16,390
that that person would be going broke
$30 a coin if you're too dumb to do the

1382
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:19,520
fucking math on that.

1383
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:25,210
And then also not to hear how they go 14
karat gold and then they use this term

1384
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,140
a fee. I was going to write the
term down, I forget what it is,

1385
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:34,850
but it basically mates,
they basically,

1386
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:40,390
they picked up a rock at the beach and
they sort of dusted it with 14 karat gold

1387
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:48,580
and it's so lightly dusted
with this fucking gold that
they can actually sell it

1388
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:52,820
for 1995 and still probably
become multimillionaires.

1389
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:56,870
And one of the great lines in
it is limit five per customer.

1390
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:01,070
Also to put that in your head like,
Oh fuck, oh, wait a minute. People,

1391
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,320
are these things going to be gone?
People are buying five of these.

1392
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,710
This is a great investment. This is
a great investment thing. You know,

1393
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:08,300
in case the economy goes south,

1394
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:11,780
I'll have these $50 1995

1395
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:15,441
made team,

1396
01:27:15,441 --> 01:27:20,441

same shit that they spray the cast of

1397
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:24,350
the Jersey shore with people who
just did fucking morons. Go ahead,

1398

your snuggies. You're dumb fucks. Oh,

1399
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,320
that's what I should
buy the guy downstairs.

1400
01:27:30,321 --> 01:27:33,890
I'm going to buy him a fucking
snuggie as a peace offering.

1401
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,870
You know, get them that in a
package of fucking earplugs, Da.

1402
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,630
What is that mean? Back in my day,
we just weren't deaf. Um, all right,

1405
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,620

you're fucking doing something.

1409
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,640
It's a enough for those of you
driving around, it's 22 minutes,

1410
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:14,450
26 seconds into the podcast. If you
want to fast forward to write this down.

1411
01:28:14,451 --> 01:28:17,470
Look at me being fucking user
friendly. Uh, it's called, uh,

1412
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:21,980
www dot today's big thing.com.
Um,

1413
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:27,050
back slash 2009 back
slash 12 backslash 30,

1414
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:29,600
um,

1415
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,600
it's a fat guy jumping
into a frozen lake and,

1416
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:40,460
uh, he goes right through the fucking
ice and there's a moment there where,

1417
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,730
I don't know,

1418
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:45,290
I didn't really find it to be a funny
video and I thought his friends were

1419
01:28:45,291 --> 01:28:50,060
unbelievably ignorant,
um, with their incredible,

1420
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:54,470
uh, lack of urgency with the
situation, the situation.

1421
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:59,840
I don't know how quick hypothermia
sets in, but uh, I don't know.

1422
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,900
Judging by his,
the,

1423
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:04,650
the fucking way to this guy and that
the stress that's already putting on his

1424
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:05,100
heart.

1425
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,490
The kid easily could have had a fucking
heart attack and they will try to pull

1426
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:11,520
the mother fuck around.
And a, it's unreal.

1427
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,680
He ends up walking out of
the lake like Godzilla.

1428
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:16,460
He's just got to break the fucking
ice all the way back to the show.

1429
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:21,443
Okay.

1430
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,420
Oh fuck.
I'm sorry.

1431
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:31,660
That fucking image just hit me.
Oh, all right. Anyways, anyways,

1432
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,290
uh, this podcast sucks. I got to bring
the energy. I got to bring the energy.

1433
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:38,290
All right. Uh, let's talk about
me right now I'm on the wagon.

1434
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,270
I am seriously on the wagon.

1435
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:43,750
I went to the rose bowl again
this year and this year,

1436
01:29:43,751 --> 01:29:45,340
rather than bringing a camera,

1437
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:50,400
I bought my flip phone and
I was videotaping and I
was just embarrassed by my

1438
01:29:52,691 --> 01:29:56,410
behavior and it's not funny.
It's just embarrassing and no,

1439
01:29:56,411 --> 01:29:59,530
I won't be uploading it and
know it will never be extras.

1440
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:03,220
And a, if you are part of
the tailgate next to me.

1441
01:30:03,221 --> 01:30:07,030
Remember when I said I was
going to email you the, uh,

1442
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:08,650
some of the footage that I took,

1443
01:30:08,651 --> 01:30:11,320
I'm not sending it to you
because I'm in it and I am,

1444
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,410
I'm just really embarrassingly drunk.

1445
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:18,230
I sounded like animal and every foe you
remember animal from the muppet show.

1446
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:23,770
That's what I sounded like the
entire fucking time. And uh,

1447
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:25,783
it was the worst thing too,

1448
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:28,120
was the next day when I watched the
footage not only being that drunk,

1449
01:30:28,121 --> 01:30:30,610
but when I was actually
looking at the unbelievable,

1450
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:35,200
a spectacle that is the rose bowl.

1451
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:40,420
And to realize that I've gone to a two
years in a row and can barely remember

1452
01:30:40,421 --> 01:30:41,800
more than 30 seconds of it.

1453
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:45,070
I'm watching the jets game right now
and I just realized that he was playing

1454
01:30:45,071 --> 01:30:49,660
quarterback for USC last year in the Rose
Bowl. I actually sort of saw him play,

1455
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:54,610
but I was too busy yelling at the fat
chick in front of me and listening to her

1456
01:30:54,611 --> 01:30:57,370
husband and telling me that he was
going to throw me down on the field.

1457
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:01,770
So,
uh,

1458
01:31:01,771 --> 01:31:06,180
this year I actually passed out for eight
minutes of the second quarter just out

1459
01:31:06,181 --> 01:31:08,670
like a light, like an old person
in a fucking rock and chair,

1460
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:13,080
two in the afternoon just to
out, you know, fucking, you know,

1461
01:31:13,081 --> 01:31:17,640
$600 a day after all is said and done
the fucking Cuban cigars and all the

1462
01:31:17,641 --> 01:31:20,700
bullshit in the parking.
I'm just fast asleep.

1463
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:25,290
Granddaddy of them all
just a fucking mess.

1464
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,610
Maybe the footage will be funny at some
point because I got to admit every other

1465
01:31:29,611 --> 01:31:34,611
thing is me cutting to my buddy who's
drunk or each time and every time he just,

1466
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,510
he just looks at the camera and he,

1467
01:31:38,511 --> 01:31:42,320
he sort of slurs granddaddy of them all.

1468
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:47,350
It was bad.
I was hammered and I was making,

1469
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:52,020
we brought like these fucking Ribeye
steaks that she's fucking sweet things,

1470
01:31:52,021 --> 01:31:53,940
right?
So we forget a knife.

1471
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:58,870
My buddy is buttering them up
with his index finger and uh,

1472
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,500
I put enough charcoal on there
to cook a fucking Bronto Burger.

1473
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:07,150
So the second the flames hit that butter,
oh my God.

1474
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:12,160
It was unreal. It was like the outside
was well done in the inside was still cold

1475
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,880
and everyone was just watching me going,
hey buddy, don't flip the steak too much.

1476
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:22,180
It's like I can't, I can't not
flip it. It's fucking hot as hell.

1477
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:27,550
And it was bad and, uh, it was
really bad. It was really bad.

1478
01:32:27,551 --> 01:32:29,800
And I'm fucking, you know, I'm just
really embarrassed with myself.

1479
01:32:29,801 --> 01:32:34,510
I scared and old man.
I was drunk off my ass.

1480
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:38,440
Like I've been to the Rosewall twice and
I really don't even feel like I've been

1481
01:32:38,441 --> 01:32:42,760
to it. I mean, I was in there,
but I don't remember any of it.

1482
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:45,760
And I don't know what happened.
I can't name one fucking player.

1483
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:49,930
I know that Guy Blount who punch
that dude on a Boise state. Uh,

1484
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:53,260
I don't know the name of
one person on Ohio state.

1485
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:56,770
I don't know the name
of one person in Oregon.

1486
01:32:56,771 --> 01:33:00,430
All I know is Oregon hasn't won the rose
bowl since 1913. I didn't learn that.

1487
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,890
And evidently cheap trick was
somewhere there playing and uh,

1488
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:07,470
this is how much I was drinking
and how much I was enjoying it.

1489
01:33:07,471 --> 01:33:11,710
I W we got there at eight
30 in the morning for a one
30 kickoff and within two

1490
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:12,630
seconds it was like,

1491
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,270
it was almost one 30 was two o'clock
kickoff after all the bullshit.

1492
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:22,000
And uh, I was actually
annoyed. I was like,

1493
01:33:22,001 --> 01:33:24,190
why couldn't it been like a four
o'clock game? I'm having a good time.

1494
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:29,350
And once again we had a couple big
bottles of crown royal and we had a whole

1495
01:33:29,351 --> 01:33:32,230
case of beer between the two of us.
And for the life of me,

1496
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:36,940
I don't know where it all
went. It was, it was just gone.

1497
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,540
It was fucking gone. And at the end
of the night I bought, you know,

1498
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:44,350
none of that you want to set to
about overrated expensive sunglasses.

1499
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:50,020
Okay. I've gotten a couple as like gifts
and I always lose them on planes. Right?

1500
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:53,920
So this time I finally go out
and buy a pair. All right.

1501
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:59,140
And I don't take them on the road with me.
And this time I actually brought him,

1502
01:33:59,200 --> 01:33:59,560
you know,

1503
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:03,310
made a little checklist this year for
the Rose Bowl and I fucking brought him

1504
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:07,300
the end of the game. I got, um, you know,

1505
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,950
tucked into my fucking tee shirt and
my buddy comes up, I want a game.

1506
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:16,480
It gives me a big hug. And
I chair, they didn't break.

1507
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:20,560
They just could fit on a,
I dunno,

1508
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:23,830
pick somebody with a huge fucking head.
They could fit on that person's head now.

1509
01:34:23,831 --> 01:34:25,330
So it was bad.

1510
01:34:25,331 --> 01:34:28,270
So I actually came home and I dumped out
all the beer that I had in the fridge.

1511
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,840
I had dumped out the rest
of my aunt, a little f, uh,

1512
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:36,520
fucking little fucking flask things
ahead of that Jim beam. I dump that out.

1513
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:42,220
I had a little bit more left quarter
of a bottle of gentleman jack.

1514
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:44,320
I know people would
cringe and I dumped at,

1515
01:34:44,321 --> 01:34:47,200
and then I got this 15 year old scotch.
I kept that,

1516
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:53,050
but I'm shutting it down, shutting
it down. I'm not going to fucking Aa,

1517
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,710
but I'm shutting it down. And next
year I'm not drinking at the Rose Bowl.

1518
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,670
I'm just not.
Okay.

1519
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:02,930
I'm getting a fucking respectable
grill and I'm going to redeem myself.

1520
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,700
Uh, yeah, it's just fun.
It's fucking pathetic.

1521
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:12,920
My behavior was just completely,
and I just looked like such a douche bag.

1522
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,570
I don't know. Gee, Bill,
what a week, Huh? You got,

1523
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,070
did you do anything good this week?
And let's see, what did I do that,

1524
01:35:19,071 --> 01:35:22,640
you know what I, I ah, Jesus Christ,

1525
01:35:22,641 --> 01:35:27,040
can you fucking tackle somebody
is 27 nothing. The jets.

1526
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:30,170
You know what the jets are the jet
to like Red Sox fans where they don't

1527
01:35:30,171 --> 01:35:33,440
understand. Again, not red sox
fans don't seem to understand that.

1528
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:37,520
Singing sweet Caroline is one of the
gayest things ever. I got to admit,

1529
01:35:37,521 --> 01:35:40,460
you know something? I respect jets
fan because you're a hardcore fan.

1530
01:35:40,461 --> 01:35:44,930
If you follow that fucking team because
they kick you in the seeds every year,

1531
01:35:44,931 --> 01:35:46,940
right before they twist your
heart out of your chest.

1532
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:48,320
So I totally fucking respect,

1533
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:50,570
even though I can't stand you
because you're in a fucking division,

1534
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:54,590
but I'm telling you to,
when they put that fireman,

1535
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:59,270
when that guy lifts the other guy up on
his shoulders and he's dressed like he's

1536
01:35:59,271 --> 01:36:02,210
in the fucking village,
people with that stupid fireman hat,

1537
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:06,260
and don't even fucking email me and
tell me who do actually a real fireman.

1538
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,310
I don't give a fuck.
All right.

1539
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:13,860
If you're wearing a fireman helmet and
you're not on your way to a fire or

1540
01:36:13,861 --> 01:36:18,470
sitting in a fucking firehouse,
you'll look like an asshole.

1541
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,540
All right? And when he did
j e t s jets, jets, jets,

1542
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:24,470
you know something.

1543
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:29,030
That's the only thing of this year that
my downstairs neighbor would understand

1544
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:34,100
because that is a fucking, that's like,
it's like a fucking cheer from the 1920s

1545
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,320
gt use. Jude's do shirts and
they're all pumping their fists.

1546
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:44,870
Like those guys in the Jersey shore
listening to house music, it's really,

1547
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:49,700
really fucking bad. And, uh, speaking of
which, why do you guys need a new stadium?

1548
01:36:49,701 --> 01:36:54,050
What's wrong with that? That stadium
is fine. You know what it is?

1549
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:57,290
There's this some sort of scam going on
with those new stage cause he amount of

1550
01:36:57,291 --> 01:36:58,880
fucking new stadiums that they built.

1551
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:02,950
I kind of understood the new
Yankee stadium, you know,

1552
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,800
it's not like they didn't have the
money to fucking fix it up again.

1553
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:10,550
I guess they already did it, but the
metal lands is only like, what? 30,

1554
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:12,380
35 years old.

1555
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:16,360
Then they build another
one right next to it.

1556
01:37:16,361 --> 01:37:18,640
It looks like the exact same fucking
thing. Oh, let me guess what.

1557
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:22,270
He can get Sushi at this one.
So now it's $200 more for a seat.

1558
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:28,510
We got even bigger seats because
everybody's even fatter now. Um,

1559
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:32,680
anyways, all right. Last week I
did a segment called oh Jesus,

1560
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,990
where, uh, you know,

1561
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:40,230
I stated my opinions on what I felt about
organized religion and all that type

1562
01:37:41,051 --> 01:37:45,700
of stuff and I got a
shitstorm of, uh, emails.

1563
01:37:45,701 --> 01:37:49,360
But believe it or not,
most of them were very a complimentary.

1564
01:37:50,350 --> 01:37:55,150
I'm saying that's exactly how
I agree. I how I feel. Um,

1565
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:00,090
you know, see you in hell. My kids
want. Somebody said, dear bill,

1566
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:04,410
southern mega church is a corporate
monster that needs to die to trick of the

1567
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:09,411
church is that they've been perfecting
their scam since man started blaming

1568
01:38:10,021 --> 01:38:13,770
natural phenomenon on God's.
It's all based on fear.

1569
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:17,730
And the constant charge decided at some
point point that they could make money

1570
01:38:17,731 --> 01:38:20,790
off of it. I don't blame the
sheep for believing the shepherd.

1571
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:24,900
Blame the wolf for dressing like
a shepherd. Uh, you know what?

1572
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:29,280
I agree with that. I think that's
a great point. But you know,

1573
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,130
I have to admit past a certain age,

1574
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,850
you're a moron if you believe stuff
like that. You know what I mean?

1575
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:39,810
It's like if you're in your 20s you can
still blame your parents for shit that

1576
01:38:39,811 --> 01:38:43,560
they did to you. You know? And maybe
that's why you're a little dysfunctional,

1577
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:45,190
but you kind of worked at shit out.

1578
01:38:45,191 --> 01:38:48,570
And that becomes a point in your life
where you got to stop blaming your fucking

1579
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:53,130
parents. You've got to take charge of
your own life. And when you fuck up,

1580
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:56,790
you got to take it on yourself.
All right,

1581
01:38:57,270 --> 01:39:00,630
Jesus Christ to fucking jets are
running a Goddamn wishbone offense.

1582
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:04,350
Do you know what the genius of that is?

1583
01:39:04,351 --> 01:39:07,800
Like the reason why they never did it
in the prose is because the quarterback

1584
01:39:07,801 --> 01:39:10,620
gets fucking stuck,
you know,

1585
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:12,870
and he can't have Joe
Montana getting stuck,

1586
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:18,660
try to gain fucking six yards on the
ground. Right? But now the genius is,

1587
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:21,930
is they, they, they, they stick like a
fucking wide receiver or running back.

1588
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,580
And then why didn't anybody who came,

1589
01:39:23,581 --> 01:39:26,310
does anybody into football enough or
they know who came up with that shit?

1590
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:31,130
I want, speaking of, uh, of which I'm
already going into football withdrawal.

1591
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:33,780
I don't know if other NFL fans have this,

1592
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:37,890
there's always that amazing excitement
when the NFL playoffs are coming up.

1593
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:42,180
But then there's also like that depression
of like, fuck, it's almost over.

1594
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:46,710
You know, I, I hate that like the
NFL seasons, just cause, you know,

1595
01:39:46,711 --> 01:39:51,510
one game of fucking weak, how quick
it goes. Um, and also secondly,

1596
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,990
uh, I think I'm going to
try to get in into the, uh,

1597
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:57,790
the English premiere league soccer.

1598
01:39:57,970 --> 01:40:01,060
I found out that I have a channel that
actually shows that shit and baseball's

1599
01:40:01,061 --> 01:40:04,570
coming up and I'm not, I, I, I'm
just not into fucking watching.

1600
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:09,220
They've red sox angels and Yankees battle
it out yet it for the 90th year and a

1601
01:40:09,221 --> 01:40:11,470
fucking row.
Um,

1602
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,370
so if anybody can over in England
can tell me when that leak starts,

1603
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,580
when the playoffs are,
does it overlap in the baseball?

1604
01:40:18,581 --> 01:40:23,410
Because that would be fucking phenomenal.
Um, all right. So anyways, let's,

1605
01:40:23,411 --> 01:40:27,640
let's, let's get back to this,
uh, this stuff. So, yeah.
So that's how I look at it.

1606
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:32,150
Okay. The same way, you know, at
some point you have to stop. Yeah.

1607
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:34,780
You got to stop blaming your parents.
You, you've got to stop being like, dude,

1608
01:40:34,781 --> 01:40:37,200
chicks are psychos. You gotta
be like, no, I'm picking coach.

1609
01:40:37,210 --> 01:40:39,970
And he'd got to take responsibility.
I feel the same way about religion.

1610
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:43,090
You know what I mean? If you're a
kid or whatever, and you're young,

1611
01:40:43,091 --> 01:40:44,140
right through your twenties,
you believe,

1612
01:40:44,141 --> 01:40:48,130
but at some point you gotta understand
it's a fucking guests and that it is an

1613
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,940
unbelievably profitable fucking business.

1614
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:54,300
You

1615
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:56,920
know? I mean, especially, you know,

1616
01:40:56,921 --> 01:41:00,910
that shit that they say a rich man has
as much chance of getting into heaven as

1617
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:04,990
a camel has walking through the eye
of a needle and you look at how these

1618
01:41:04,991 --> 01:41:08,600
fucking people in your religion 11,
uh,

1619
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:12,850
then they don't seem too concerned about
getting through the eye or that fucking

1620
01:41:12,851 --> 01:41:17,830
needle, you know, wake the fuck up.
People go buy a $90 gold coin yet.

1621
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:21,010
Jesus. All right. I'm not trying
to be judged. Whatever baby.

1622
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:25,810
Maybe I don't understand it.
Um, all right, next one. Um,

1623
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:28,220
it was actually,
you know what,

1624
01:41:28,221 --> 01:41:31,180
there was somebody who actually had a
real rational point here that I wanted to

1625
01:41:31,181 --> 01:41:33,970
read. Uh, all right.

1626
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:38,200
And it's entitled for what it's worth,
you know, and first of all, right there,

1627
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:41,860
that's what the Internet needs a little
more of, you know, for what it's worth,

1628
01:41:41,861 --> 01:41:46,440
rather than it being like, hey
shit head like I do. Okay. Um,

1629
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:50,020
all right, bill, just want
to say I understand your
points on the religious thing.

1630
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:52,510
Like you, I was raised Catholic
and left at this point.

1631
01:41:52,511 --> 01:41:55,630
I actually recently started
going back to Christian Church.

1632
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:59,290
That doesn't have a denomination.
It's not baptists or anything.

1633
01:41:59,291 --> 01:42:00,550
It's just playing Christian.
Anyway.

1634
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:03,130
I totally agree with you when it comes
down to the fact that people don't really

1635
01:42:03,131 --> 01:42:06,160
know and the whole idea is full of holes.

1636
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:10,020
I think the biggest problem is that
Christians love to get into the debates,

1637
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:12,400
only bringing the faith concept along,

1638
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:16,290
which obviously makes no sense to people
that haven't bought into the whole idea,

1639
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:21,040
which makes the whole argument
pointless. Exactly. Um,

1640
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:24,910
and that's the problem with Christians,
just like other groups of people,

1641
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:28,510
a lot of them are frankly stupid and
don't know what they're talking about.

1642
01:42:28,511 --> 01:42:30,250
It's not really their fault.

1643
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:34,270
Just not everyone is meant to
teach others on every topic.

1644
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:38,440
All right. You know, I, I don't know if
I agree with that. No, it is your fault.

1645
01:42:38,441 --> 01:42:42,220
If you're a fucking idiot, if you're born
stupid, you know, that's not your fault.

1646
01:42:42,221 --> 01:42:43,054
But,
uh,

1647
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:47,230
if you just a fucking moron who repeats
shit that people say in bars like me.

1648
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:51,190
All right. Why don't I shut
the fuck up and read the rest
of this? All right, Bill.

1649
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:51,451
Uh,

1650
01:42:51,451 --> 01:42:55,030
I think something you could understand
is no one buys into the Christian thing

1651
01:42:55,031 --> 01:42:59,260
just because of the Bible. If they do,
they probably can be won over by anything.

1652
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:02,380
People buy into the Christian thing
because of something they felt that is

1653
01:43:02,381 --> 01:43:04,420
beyond understanding.
After feeling it,

1654
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:08,290
they start looking for an answer and
they are drawn into the Christian thing.

1655
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:11,740
At that point you can just feel it
in your bones and you know it's real,

1656
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:15,100
but it's a personal experience for
everyone and it can't be taught.

1657
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:17,920
But I think what that guy meant
by asked Jesus and tell you,

1658
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:21,010
it's not literally asked. I knew he didn't
mean that I was just being an asshole.

1659
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:25,010
It's really a soul search, which isn't
something that usually happens overnight.

1660
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:28,770
And eventually you will come to an
understanding within yourself. Uh,

1661
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,850
reading the Bible going
to church can help.

1662
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:35,170
But it all comes down to whether you are
even interested in finding out. I mean,

1663
01:43:35,171 --> 01:43:38,440
right there,
I want 100% agree with all of that.

1664
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:43,690
Okay. And I like to sit think that
I made some sort of point where I,

1665
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:50,980
I guess I believe in some sort of
higher thing because you can feel,

1666
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:53,060
I know it's an exp likable,

1667
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:57,770
but I also know that nobody alive
knows what the like. I feel that that,

1668
01:43:58,010 --> 01:43:59,630
that feeling that you're talking about,

1669
01:43:59,631 --> 01:44:04,631
I feel as a private thing and it shouldn't
be exploited and it shouldn't be this

1670
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:09,320
moneymaking thing and you shouldn't
try to scare the shit out of me.

1671
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:13,550
Then I'm going to hell and all this stuff
and start making up all these fucking

1672
01:44:13,551 --> 01:44:17,510
cartoon characters like they have.
You know what I mean?

1673
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:19,003
That's what they're doing.

1674
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:22,040
They're just making up shit and they're
making up stories and all this fucking

1675
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:27,041
crap based off of this feeling and also
based off of people's fear of dying.

1676
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,260
But I, I have to 100% agree
with all that. I mean, see,

1677
01:44:30,261 --> 01:44:33,920
that's the way you go about it.
Okay. For what it's worth. Okay.

1678
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:38,780
The mere fact that he puts
in for what it's worth is
right there. It's like, okay,

1679
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:41,810
I'm not ramming this shit down
your throat for what it's worth.

1680
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:44,570
This is what I feel.
No point did he say he's 100% right.

1681
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,680
This is just how we feel. Okay?
That's the way to go about it.

1682
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:53,510
As opposed to this other person who,
this is what somebody wrote me, Bill,

1683
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:58,810
there's an empty spot inside of you that
you try to fill with anything you can

1684
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:03,320
fame hitting it, big fortune, family, dog,

1685
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:08,270
etc. But actually there isn't
anything that can fill that void. EMP,

1686
01:45:08,271 --> 01:45:11,090
that empty void,
fill that void,

1687
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:15,200
empty feeling inside you except for Jesus.

1688
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:23,880
I mean,
that is the funniest fucking thing ever.

1689
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:28,710
They're trying to convince
me that I'm not happy.

1690
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:32,190
This is like the happiest period
of my life. I got a great girl.

1691
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:36,060
I'm living with her. I love her. I love
living with her. I got a fucking dog.

1692
01:45:36,061 --> 01:45:40,470
I mean, how great my life is to
come home to them. It's great.

1693
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:44,430
It's fucking great.
My career is right where it's at.

1694
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:47,820
I've carved out a nice niche for myself.
People show up.

1695
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:50,790
I got a cool level of notoriety,

1696
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:54,540
but I could still walk down the street
with no pants on and no one would give a

1697
01:45:54,541 --> 01:45:58,950
shit short of why is this guy not wearing
pants and having a great fucking time.

1698
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:04,160
And this person is super imposing their
own feeling of when they accepted Jesus

1699
01:46:05,701 --> 01:46:09,660
because they couldn't fill it up with
Shin that now they're going to tell me

1700
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:14,840
that I'm empty and they don't
even fucking know me moron.

1701
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:15,870
So anyways,

1702
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:19,550
the only way to fill it up is to come
to our church and do except Jesus and

1703
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:23,940
reach in your pocket. Take out that
legal tender, put it in the basket,

1704
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:28,620
gave it to me. I'll go get a hooker
and we'll build again next Sunday.

1705
01:46:30,410 --> 01:46:34,230
Um, he actually made that spot inside
of you. Okay, let's, this is how,

1706
01:46:34,290 --> 01:46:37,170
this is how fucking you
guys into science fiction.

1707
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:40,920
All you guys who can't afford
movie tickets because of
the recession and you're

1708
01:46:40,921 --> 01:46:45,030
really killing yourself because you can't
go see Avatar. I got one for you here.

1709
01:46:45,031 --> 01:46:49,590
Just sit back, close your eyes, take
a hit off, something you need to.

1710
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:54,060
Here's the rest of this shit.
He actually made that spot inside of you,

1711
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:59,700
uh, that only he fits into crepey. Um,

1712
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:04,620
really so he wants to get inside of me
and that spot that only he fits into

1713
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:10,500
Jesus Christ.
And all you have to do is ask,

1714
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:10,801
you know,

1715
01:47:10,801 --> 01:47:15,480
I don't want to ask some dead fucking
hippie to crawl into a space inside me.

1716
01:47:15,590 --> 01:47:19,530
They don't, he only fits into, he's
knocking at the door of your heart.

1717
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,240
Sort of go around making this up.

1718
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:28,440
Is this lyrics to a bad Jim Nabors
song written by John Denver,

1719
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,750
Sergeant Carter. Anyways, uh,

1720
01:47:32,751 --> 01:47:36,350
you only have to open the
door because he's a gentleman.

1721
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:42,050
He won't force his way in. He will come
in if invited. He's waiting patiently.

1722
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:46,040
But, but, but, and this is from me to you.

1723
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:50,840
There's no time like the present.
Nobody knows how long anybody lives.

1724
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:55,370
It says in the Bible also
tomorrow is promised to no one,

1725
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:58,100
but don't get spooked.
Oh yeah.

1726
01:47:58,190 --> 01:48:00,860
Why would I want to get spoked
when you're telling me, you know,

1727
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:05,480
tomorrow isn't promised to anybody in
this is dead fucking son of this dude who

1728
01:48:05,481 --> 01:48:10,010
was stuck into a vagina without any
seaman who wants to get inside me into a

1729
01:48:10,011 --> 01:48:14,360
space that only he fits into
a but don't we spoke to?

1730
01:48:14,361 --> 01:48:17,030
Doesn't mean as soon as you
do that it's curtains. No,

1731
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:18,980
I'm not saying I you
this guys is the worst.

1732
01:48:18,981 --> 01:48:22,460
I can't even read the rest of that
shit is fucking ridiculous dude.

1733
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:23,720
You know what you're doing right now.

1734
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:28,610
It's like you went down to
the car dealership and they
sold you a lemon and now

1735
01:48:28,611 --> 01:48:33,380
you want to dump it onto me and you're
trying to remember the horrible sales

1736
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:34,760
pitch that they gave to you.

1737
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:37,030
Yeah,

1738
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:41,710
come on in here. Or are you
tired? Are you weak? Are you,

1739
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:46,210
are you broke? How many people out
there? I could fucking do that.

1740
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:50,030
Jesus Christ.
Here I am trying to blow up telling jokes.

1741
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:52,010
Why don't I just start
my own fucking church?

1742
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:57,760
You know who out there who out there has
been tired this week and what you do is

1743
01:48:57,761 --> 01:49:00,220
you have any hand up the whole time.
Who thought there's been tired?

1744
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:04,510
Let me hear you saying I'm tired.
Well, Jesus wants you to be tired.

1745
01:49:05,230 --> 01:49:07,930
He wants you to be tired of
living the life you're living.

1746
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:09,790
Okay?

1747
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:13,650
Staff you to wake up.
I get some energy.

1748
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:18,420
Reach into your fucking pockets of,
I wouldn't want to curse in my church.

1749
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:21,740
Is she a fucking pockets? Give me
some goddamn money you guys want to.

1750
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:25,200
Who here wants to feel better?
But you guys go to a church.

1751
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:28,920
If I just talk like this,
I didn't do that stupid sing song.

1752
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:34,050
He stuff and stomp my foot wearing a
fucking sky blue three three piece fucking

1753
01:49:34,621 --> 01:49:37,680
suit. Now what'd you go to
my church if I did that?

1754
01:49:39,860 --> 01:49:44,300
Yeah, whoever wants to feel better. All
right. What do you want to do this year,

1755
01:49:44,301 --> 01:49:47,470
sir? You want to lose some weight?
Why? You're going to lose weight? Yeah,

1756
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,540
you can do it.
Stop being a pussy.

1757
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:52,810
He chicken breasts and fucking
Broccoli at seven o'clock go to bed.

1758
01:49:52,811 --> 01:49:56,080
Drinks of fucking water. All
right. That'll be five bucks

1759
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:02,230
a five. I don't even want to
fucking go in with this already.

1760
01:50:02,231 --> 01:50:06,100
Getting self conscious and I'm going
to start screaming again. Don't worry.

1761
01:50:06,101 --> 01:50:08,410
The podcast will be fine.
I just got to let this,

1762
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:11,850
I gotta let this shit died
down with fucking, uh,

1763
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:17,930
I dunno that go plead Mr. Hand in fast
times at Ridgemont high. He's dead now,

1764
01:50:17,931 --> 01:50:21,830
isn't he? All right. Um,
all, let's plow ahead.

1765
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:25,250
Do the, I like, he can't
believe all this shit I got,

1766
01:50:25,251 --> 01:50:26,980
I got another guy who actually,
um,

1767
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:30,710
he was saying that he thought the podcast
was hilarious and all this stuff that

1768
01:50:30,711 --> 01:50:32,330
I sent in religion was really funny.

1769
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:37,600
And then he tried to get me to read the
book of Mormons and I was real sneaky

1770
01:50:38,990 --> 01:50:42,650
and you know, I don't, his selling points
were also, I, I don't want to read it.

1771
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:46,760
I don't want to, I, I've
been to Utah. I've seen what
your religion does to people.

1772
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:49,070
Okay. I've been there, I've seen it.

1773
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:51,530
Everybody sneaking around fucking
their girlfriend in the ass.

1774
01:50:51,531 --> 01:50:54,050
So she's still a Goddamn Virgin,
you know,

1775
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:56,750
32 year old guys still walking around.

1776
01:50:56,751 --> 01:51:01,751
Never had a piece of ass in that fucking
life because some who's got 58 wives

1777
01:51:02,061 --> 01:51:04,370
told them not to. I mean, I
don't know what to tell you.

1778
01:51:04,670 --> 01:51:08,810
I'm not trying to shit on Utah.
All right, beautiful scenery. Okay?

1779
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,700
But you only get one life.

1780
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:12,613
Okay?

1781
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:17,940
Go down to the drug store, get some
condoms and start talking shit. All right?

1782
01:51:17,941 --> 01:51:21,750
That's what the fuck is supposed to be
doing in your teens and in your 20s. Okay?

1783
01:51:21,751 --> 01:51:25,500
And then eventually one day you're going
to be fucking a girl that you don't

1784
01:51:25,501 --> 01:51:26,334
give a shit about.

1785
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:28,550
You're gonna roll over and you're
going to feel this empty feeling.

1786
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:32,880
You'd be like, what the fuck am I doing?
I can't do this anymore. Um, my God,

1787
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:36,930
she really going to try to have
some false sense of intimacy. Now.

1788
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:38,023
Isn't that the worst?

1789
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,260
That's what I was headed about
one night stands was afterwards.

1790
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:43,860
I always loved those professional girls
who just got the fuck out afterwards.

1791
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:48,090
Not trying to, you know, suppress
any sort of a guilt, you know,

1792
01:51:48,091 --> 01:51:53,091
any sort of guilt as the worst one night
stand is when that fucking creepy hand

1793
01:51:53,941 --> 01:51:57,330
comes over and you know,
she puts her head onto your chest

1794
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:02,460
and their fucking hair and
you're just sitting there.

1795
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:06,870
I remember Billy crystal and now when
Harry met Sally and he's got that one foot

1796
01:52:06,871 --> 01:52:09,930
on his floor in his eyes are wide awake.
Yeah.

1797
01:52:09,990 --> 01:52:13,680
At some point you get sick of that
and he just like, all right, you know,

1798
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:17,670
if I don't fucking settle down
and get a good one, you know,

1799
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:23,160
I'm ended up like that fucking
grumpy old man downstairs. Uh,

1800
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:28,450
all right. Somebody's trash
me on my ignorance on the
NFL network, you said, uh,

1801
01:52:28,470 --> 01:52:33,390
I'm surprised it's such a big force.
A sports fan is Jesus Christ.

1802
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:35,010
Do you see the emails?
I guess, first of all,

1803
01:52:35,011 --> 01:52:40,011
let me say that I am surprised at such
a big sports fan as you is confused by

1804
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:44,460
the NFL network and Nfl Sunday ticket.

1805
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:48,980
The Sunday ticket is the exclusive
offering on direct TV that gives you every

1806
01:52:48,981 --> 01:52:53,680
game. Every week. I realized that I have
this so I can watch the eagles in DC.

1807
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:56,510
And by the way, it's amazing.
It's like sports have an,

1808
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:57,950
I can't imagine not having it.

1809
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:03,010
I understand now the NFL is just a single
channel that is also on direct TV and

1810
01:53:04,890 --> 01:53:08,960
as a frequent too, I understand
all of this. Okay. I have cable.

1811
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:13,310
It's not available for me out here.
Okay. In order for me to get it,

1812
01:53:13,311 --> 01:53:16,610
I have to sign up with direct TV and
they wanted me to sign like a three year

1813
01:53:16,611 --> 01:53:21,611
contract with a cable service that
I've never seen before or used for.

1814
01:53:22,161 --> 01:53:26,070
All I know they suck. Okay. I was giving
him shit. I understand they're busy.

1815
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:29,720
I have no problem paying
for the NFL ticket.

1816
01:53:29,721 --> 01:53:31,520
I would buy it if it was on cable.
All right?

1817
01:53:31,521 --> 01:53:34,370
But I can't put addition to the side
of my fucking building. I can't,

1818
01:53:34,371 --> 01:53:38,990
my landlord does not
allow it. All right. So,

1819
01:53:38,991 --> 01:53:41,780
and I understand that they have
good matchups and they show a month,

1820
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:46,781
Thursday as a way to entice
me into a and to fucking,

1821
01:53:46,941 --> 01:53:51,470
you know, buying the network. I get
it. It's fucking business. But Dude,

1822
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:52,461
you know,

1823
01:53:52,461 --> 01:53:56,990
to black out a game on Christmas is a
corporate conti fucking mood and you

1824
01:53:56,991 --> 01:54:00,350
fucking with people's holidays, you
know, show me the God damn game.

1825
01:54:00,351 --> 01:54:04,160
Take one day off. You know? That's
all I was fucking saying. Okay.

1826
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:05,570
I understand the whole concept

1827
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:10,970
because explaining the NFL network to
me, I don't understand that. Oh, really?

1828
01:54:10,971 --> 01:54:12,770
Did you enjoy watching
your fucking eagles today?

1829
01:54:12,771 --> 01:54:16,910
Get pounded by the God damn
cowboy cowboys met. What?

1830
01:54:16,911 --> 01:54:21,440
A what a rough weekend Philly. Huh?
What a rough month. They lose cliff Lee.

1831
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:25,520
They get trashed by the
Goddamn cowboys and uh,

1832
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:31,310
they lose the winter classic to my Bruins.
And over time I got to met dude.

1833
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:34,670
Nobody takes over a stadium like
Philly fans. Did Anybody Watch that?

1834
01:54:34,671 --> 01:54:37,130
It was the sound like it was a
fucking home game for the flyers.

1835
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:42,740
Really disappointed with Bruins fans.
But you know what? Tickets was so much.

1836
01:54:42,741 --> 01:54:45,590
It was the fucking rich
people there anyways. They're
never going to do anything.

1837
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:49,890
Um, but still, I gotta give it up
for the fucking Philly's fan. Uh,

1838
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:52,850
Philadelphia fans. All right. That
might be the end of the podcast,

1839
01:54:52,851 --> 01:54:55,520
one of my 49 whispering
minutes into this thing.

1840
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:01,730
Um, anyways, I dunno, this is my deal.

1841
01:55:01,731 --> 01:55:03,620
I think when it comes down
to that whole God thing,

1842
01:55:03,621 --> 01:55:08,060
I think that's a personal fucking
journey and I'm not working on it at all.

1843
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:11,150
So what I'm really doing
is just blown off church,

1844
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:14,660
but I'm never gonna go back to church
anyways, but I'll, I'll, I'll, I have to,

1845
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:19,790
I have to start living by some
sort of a fucking code because, uh,

1846
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:21,320
because I'm not,
you know,

1847
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:24,080
and when you become an adult and you
don't have parents anymore, I mean,

1848
01:55:24,081 --> 01:55:25,340
as long as you're not breaking a law,

1849
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:28,490
you can pretty much do a lot of scumbag
things and no one really calls you on it.

1850
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:30,650
And, uh, you know,

1851
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:35,490
pass it out in the second quarter
of a fucking Rosebowl. What a loser.

1852
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:40,370
What a fucking loser. Um, anyways,

1853
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:43,160
what else do I got here?
I just got sorta like fucking,

1854
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:44,670
this is like holiday leftovers.

1855
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:49,530
This podcast last week I was talking
about some girl who was too dumb to fuck.

1856
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:52,630
I had somebody really latched onto that.
That time I,

1857
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:56,700
my buddy was hanging out with that girl
who thought the sun and the moon were

1858
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,170
the same thing.
And I was saying like,

1859
01:55:58,171 --> 01:55:59,790
you have to get with a
girl who is so stupid,

1860
01:55:59,791 --> 01:56:03,030
like you can't have sex with her
because it feels like a form of rape.

1861
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:11,590
Ah,
fuck.

1862
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:13,060
Anyways, this guy said, hey bill,

1863
01:56:13,061 --> 01:56:16,750
I love the podcast but never
felt compelled to write
you until you mentioned the

1864
01:56:16,751 --> 01:56:20,860
story about the chick who didn't know
the moon and the sun were two different

1865
01:56:20,861 --> 01:56:22,390
stories and too dumb to fuck you.

1866
01:56:22,391 --> 01:56:25,090
The first guy I ever heard mentioned
that I cannot agree with you more.

1867
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:29,200
I have a too dumb to fuck story. Okay.
I think we have a new segment here.

1868
01:56:30,610 --> 01:56:31,061
Um,
here we go.

1869
01:56:31,061 --> 01:56:35,900
This is this guy's story about meeting a
girl who was too dumb to fuck. He said,

1870
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:40,020
when I got out of college I was doing
the traditional stint in the restaurants

1871
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,010
serving industry.
Uh,

1872
01:56:42,011 --> 01:56:46,620
there was this smoking hot 19 year old
waitress working there that every do I

1873
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:49,310
sound like creepy right now cause I'm
kind of whispering, there was this slogan,

1874
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:54,680
God fucking 90 year old waitress and
he's creeping up arrays of working,

1875
01:56:55,690 --> 01:56:56,080
uh,

1876
01:56:56,080 --> 01:57:00,340
there that every dude and at least one
other girl was trying to get a piece of

1877
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:03,670
build. This girl was a
legitimate 10. Anyway,

1878
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:06,190
we were at a party one night and
I was spending all my time with,

1879
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:08,710
they're listening to a talk
about all sorts of nonsense,

1880
01:57:08,711 --> 01:57:12,440
trying to be the nice guy trying to get
some play right. You putting your time.

1881
01:57:12,441 --> 01:57:16,390
And so anyways, he said, well,
the booze was kicking in and uh,

1882
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:18,850
things were starting to work out.
Uh,

1883
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:22,090
we started kissing a bit and things
were looking promising, but, uh,

1884
01:57:22,091 --> 01:57:25,150
I knew it would be some time
before I get anywhere worthwhile.

1885
01:57:25,210 --> 01:57:27,760
I don't know why you would think that to
what you should have closed the fucking

1886
01:57:27,761 --> 01:57:32,170
deal. Um, he said I was
w that's classic dude.

1887
01:57:32,171 --> 01:57:35,130
You know what I would've done? I
would've fucked her right through. Um,

1888
01:57:35,230 --> 01:57:39,130
I was willing to put in the
time. All right, so anyways,

1889
01:57:40,090 --> 01:57:43,990
a little later in the night she started
talking about a rabbit she had when she

1890
01:57:43,991 --> 01:57:47,710
was younger and she was upset
that her rabbit never laid eggs.

1891
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,950
Have you ever heard of
something so stupid?

1892
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,750
If you ever heard something so stupid,

1893
01:57:53,751 --> 01:57:57,080
you can't believe you've heard it
correctly? I could not. Oh man,

1894
01:57:57,081 --> 01:57:59,630
that must have been fucking hilarious.
Cause I'm sure there was music playing.

1895
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:02,630
I'm sure you did. Like,
like we're like what?

1896
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:06,080
And then sort of like put your ear all
almost inside of her mouth to make sure

1897
01:58:06,081 --> 01:58:08,720
you fucking heard her. Right. He
goes, I cannot believe my ears.

1898
01:58:08,721 --> 01:58:12,980
So I questioned her only to have her
repeat the claim with even more vigor.

1899
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:19,010
I had a rather, it didn't even lay
eggs. My childhood was so difficult.

1900
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:24,620
Could you buy me another drink? Um, I
shit you not bill. She was dead serious.

1901
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:26,900
If that was not bad enough.

1902
01:58:26,901 --> 01:58:31,901
She argued with me for 15 fucking minutes
telling me that rabbits laid eggs and

1903
01:58:32,631 --> 01:58:36,500
her proof to this was wait.
Now he says, wait for it.

1904
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:39,710
If rabbits don't lay eggs,
then why does the Easter,

1905
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:42,940
well then why does Easter have
Easter bunny and Easter eggs?

1906
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,070
Wow.

1907
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:50,070
This girl really took that Cadbury egg
fucking story to heart from that point

1908
01:58:50,561 --> 01:58:54,370
on.
This girls 10 status dropped by a half.

1909
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:58,000
I cannot even think about fucking
this girl anymore. To this day.

1910
01:58:58,001 --> 01:59:02,350
She's probably still so good looking
that no dude ever told her that she was

1911
01:59:02,351 --> 01:59:07,210
wrong. So we could just get in her pants
and she's probably still tasting rabbit

1912
01:59:07,211 --> 01:59:10,920
pellets hoping for m and m's
like,

1913
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:16,450
yeah. Do I that's, that's a uh,

1914
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,830
that's a strong fucking move of your age,
your age.

1915
01:59:19,831 --> 01:59:22,060
I probably would have still
plowed through I on, I dunno.

1916
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:23,500
I've always had that man.

1917
01:59:23,501 --> 01:59:26,050
I always had that thing that I
did not connect with somebody.

1918
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:27,173
I do know something.

1919
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:31,810
I tried to do what most guys
do that basically, you know,

1920
01:59:31,811 --> 01:59:34,870
fuck anything that moves and then they
come back and they tell the horrific

1921
01:59:34,871 --> 01:59:38,920
story and uh, I was never
able to do that. If I,

1922
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:43,000
if there was like no connection, like
I've just never been able to, uh Oh,

1923
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:45,790
that's bullshit.
I got a couple in there.

1924
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:51,680
I got a couple in there. I think that's
right. Oh Jesus. Am I going to tell this?

1925
01:59:51,681 --> 01:59:53,060
I can't fucking tell this story.

1926
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:55,080
Yeah.

1927
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:58,550
Okay. Here we go. You know
what? This is just builds a
piece of shit. Wake. Okay. Uh,

1928
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:03,170
yeah. I, I got, I didn't yell at the old
guy, you know, the guy I was. So I find,

1929
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:03,571
you know,
what is,

1930
02:00:03,571 --> 02:00:06,390
I'm so upset with it or how that all
gay thing with an actually feel like I

1931
02:00:06,391 --> 02:00:11,340
yelled at him and I didn't even yell
at him. He's fucking yelling at me. Um,

1932
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:16,590
all right. So I had the old guy incident.
I passed out during the second fucking

1933
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:23,520
quarter of the granddaddy of them
all and a, okay, here's this story.

1934
02:00:24,270 --> 02:00:27,900
Uh,
early on in my life I rode career.

1935
02:00:29,190 --> 02:00:33,990
I was like, I dunno, I dunno how,
Oh, Jesus Christ, they have fat.

1936
02:00:33,991 --> 02:00:34,824
Fuck just soul.
Now.

1937
02:00:35,430 --> 02:00:38,880
I love that one football players
run into those fat guys who like,

1938
02:00:38,881 --> 02:00:43,560
their job is to hold like that
sound thing for the NFL films. Um,

1939
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:48,300
you know, they feel that
for weeks to anyways. Um,

1940
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:53,670
all right, here's the story. I think
it was about 30 years old and, uh,

1941
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:58,510
I was doing this club and,
uh,

1942
02:00:58,511 --> 02:01:02,380
I was in this bar and the Jello
shot girl comes by, you know,

1943
02:01:02,381 --> 02:01:06,220
the Jello shot girl is always like
fucking smoking hot, you know,

1944
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:08,920
she has to be,
she's selling Jello.

1945
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:17,590
Do you want to do a Jello
shot? No, nobody does.

1946
02:01:17,591 --> 02:01:20,260
They just want to talk to you
with your fucking ass and titties.

1947
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:23,040
So this girl looked like a
fucking Barbie doll. Right?

1948
02:01:23,390 --> 02:01:27,970
He had a fucking as Teddy's blonde hair,
just fucking gorgeous. Right? So, uh,

1949
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:31,450
I don't know what to follow. I remember
what happened. Did the classic,

1950
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:35,440
when I had fucking zero game with women,
I just invited her out to a show. Yeah.

1951
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:39,470
I'm working uncle fuckees down the
street. Oh, like God, I like that judge.

1952
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,500
So anyway, she shows up the next
day with a friend, you know,

1953
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:47,190
looking even better and
uh, Yada, Yada Yada.

1954
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:48,100
As long story short,

1955
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:51,260
the end of the fucking night when she
showed up with like four other girls,

1956
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:54,800
which is a of automatically a fucking
problem. But this girl was like,

1957
02:01:54,801 --> 02:01:58,580
she was raring to go. I mean, she sat
down on my lap within fucking 10 minutes,

1958
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:03,170
so I'm trying to get out of there, but
her friends keep fucking cock blocking me.

1959
02:02:04,230 --> 02:02:09,140
It's a long story short. The night ends
were in a parking garage. All right.

1960
02:02:09,141 --> 02:02:12,800
I'm 30. She's like fucking
18, by the way. 19 maybe.

1961
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:16,700
So I look like I'm fucking 106. So, uh,

1962
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:19,040
all of her friends,
wait a minute,

1963
02:02:19,041 --> 02:02:21,710
she couldn't have been that young
because she was serving Jello shots.

1964
02:02:21,860 --> 02:02:25,550
Was She 21? Maybe I was like
32, 33. I can't remember.

1965
02:02:25,551 --> 02:02:27,200
It's all fucking run together.
Whatever.

1966
02:02:28,850 --> 02:02:33,680
I was too fucking old to be with this
girl. Let's put it that way. So, um,

1967
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:37,550
they're fucking, uh, it's
the end of the night. Okay.

1968
02:02:38,210 --> 02:02:41,990
And we're in the parking garage and a
friends are telling her to get in the car

1969
02:02:41,991 --> 02:02:45,260
and she's like, Nah, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna pack and go home with this guy.

1970
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:48,140
And they go, that's cool. Just come
over here and talk for a second.

1971
02:02:48,141 --> 02:02:52,560
And she walked over to the car and she
sticks her head in the window and for,

1972
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:54,230
I swear to God,
10 minutes,

1973
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:58,550
they're trying to talk her out of not
leaving with this creepy older guy.

1974
02:02:58,910 --> 02:03:02,270
And I'm standing there like an asshole.
And I was standing there for so long,

1975
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:06,440
I started rooting for the girls
in the car. I'm like, yeah,

1976
02:03:06,441 --> 02:03:08,510
come on and talk her out of it.
She shouldn't be here with me.

1977
02:03:08,511 --> 02:03:12,410
And of course they fucking
didn't. And uh, you know,

1978
02:03:13,790 --> 02:03:15,850
and there you go.
That's the podcast for the weekend.

1979
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:22,460
I did pour all my booze down the fucking
sink except for the last bottle of

1980
02:03:22,461 --> 02:03:26,390
Scotch. All right, go fuck yourself.
What am I a saint? Maybe I do need Jesus.

1981
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:30,590
All right, you guys have a great week
and I, I'm saying that jokingly, right?

1982
02:03:30,591 --> 02:03:33,140
You fucking maniacs. We'll keep
emailing me. Trying to get me into, Gee,

1983
02:03:33,141 --> 02:03:36,590
I'm not into the guy. All right. Put a
fucking shirt on and stop complaining.

1984
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:39,560
All right. Your father gave you the
fucking ability to walk on water.

1985
02:03:39,830 --> 02:03:42,440
Float off the fucking cross. I didn't
ask you to die for me. All right.

1986
02:03:43,130 --> 02:03:45,180
You're fucking martyr.
Um,

1987
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:48,960
that's it. Everybody have a great
God damn week and, uh, that's it.

1988
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,200
Happy New Year and hope you
guys all have something.
