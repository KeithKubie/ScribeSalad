00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Few parents can keep pace

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:16.576
with the rapid evolution
of digital technology.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:20.136
Many don't have a handle on what
their kids are doing on the internet

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:23.236
and fear of the unknown
leads some to back away,

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.196
while others set strict
limits on their children.

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:30.506
Common Sense Media is a
nonprofit organization

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:34.466
that offers parents information
and practical advice on how

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.356
to support the digital generation.

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:39.266
&gt;&gt;When we started, it was
all about media consumption,

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:41.906
because we knew media
had a huge impact

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:43.516
on the way kids were being raised.

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:47.946
But then, as the world changed and
media became interactive and digital,

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:53.166
we've shifted to expand common sense
advice to how to behave online,

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.486
and what are the implications?

00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:57.956
And how to be responsible and
get the most out of digital life.

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:03.016
The first thing I say to any parent
who's worried about digital life is,

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:05.016
"Hey, this digital
life, it's a good thing.

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:09.586
It's gonna help your kids
create, meet people, explore,

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.866
compose, express themselves.

00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:14.896
They have more powerful
tools than they've ever had

00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:16.476
in any generation in history.

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:18.086
So calm down.

00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:19.086
This is a good thing."

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.696
But the next thing I say to them is,

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:24.456
"You're still in the parenting
business, and that means you have

00:01:24.456 --> 00:01:27.816
to extend your parenting
skills into the digital world,

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:29.756
which means you've
gotta teach kids how

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.206
to be responsible,
how to behave kindly."

00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:34.966
The golden rule exists in cyberspace.

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:39.046
You have to help kids protect
themselves so they don't over share,

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:42.886
since that will last forever
and get sent around to vast,

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.166
invisible audiences, but
to use some common sense

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.436
and to give them some
basic touchstones about how

00:01:48.436 --> 00:01:51.496
to keep their kids safe and
smart and responsible online.

00:01:51.496 --> 00:01:55.756
If a parent knows absolutely nothing,

00:01:56.466 --> 00:02:00.616
my advice is to have their kid
show them what their life is.

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:04.256
Have them go onto a
social networking page.

00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:06.046
Have them download a song.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:11.626
Have them create a blog, upload a
picture, send an email with a picture

00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:15.446
or a moving image to a
grandparent or someone far away,

00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:18.126
so that they can have a
sense of the potential

00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:20.506
of what's good about this world.

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:23.516
I mean, all of a sudden,
they can send to a relative

00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:27.316
in another country a video
of someone's birthday party.

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:30.906
They can Skype somebody
and speak face to face.

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:35.186
You can explain these things to
parents, but the lived experience

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:37.906
of really getting involved
with it drives it home.

00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:41.006
There's an added benefit
which is, kids feel then

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:42.986
that their parents are
embracing this world.

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:44.426
They're not prohibiting it.

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:45.996
They're not trying to tamp it down.

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:47.446
Because this is their world.

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:50.496
It's digital life to us,
but to them, it's just life.

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:55.496
So we really have to embrace it, and
that's whether you know a little bit

00:02:55.496 --> 00:02:57.656
about it, a lot about
it or nothing at all.

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:04.446
The big time suck is really turning
out to be the cell phone with kids,

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:10.716
these endless text messages and the
endless connectivity to other people.

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.096
And that's a tough one to battle,

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:16.866
'cause you can either take the cell
phone away or not, and that turns

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:19.506
out to be a fruitless
enterprise, very quickly.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:23.106
But you can help the
child really understand

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:25.396
that it is an option not to answer.

00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:27.516
It is an option to turn it off.

00:03:27.976 --> 00:03:32.796
It is an option to go to a movie
and enjoy the movie and be here now.

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:36.216
That's a sophisticated
argument to make

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:40.626
with a teenager whose entire
wiring is about being connected

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:42.106
to their friends at that age.

00:03:42.646 --> 00:03:46.306
Some of it will pass, and parents
have to realize that the task

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:49.716
of a teenager, for instance, is
to be connected and to figure

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:51.546
out their identity in a social world.

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:53.756
Now they've got this extra tether

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:56.916
that connects them
at any point in time.

00:03:57.256 --> 00:04:00.206
Hard to balance that when
that's really what they're wired

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:00.936
to be doing.

00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:02.666
It's a tough one.

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:07.736
It starts with parents modeling
good balance themselves.

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:12.766
When it comes to limiting
media, and digital media,

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:14.556
it really depends on
the kind of media.

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:17.956
For instance, a lot of kids
are really addicted to World

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:20.806
of Warcraft, or online gaming.

00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:23.986
You've gotta provide alternatives

00:04:24.356 --> 00:04:28.066
when that is really becoming the
dominant part of their lives.

00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:31.146
And you gotta encourage
them to do other things,

00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:32.646
provide other opportunities.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.326
The cell phone's a tougher one.

00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:37.526
We have some hard and fast rules.

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:38.476
Many parents do.

00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:41.286
The cell phone goes off at
night, that it doesn't go

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:44.156
to the dinner table, that
it's never used in classrooms.

00:04:44.276 --> 00:04:45.726
But if you check your
cell phone bill,

00:04:46.126 --> 00:04:49.386
you'll see that the cell
phone's being used and indeed,

00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:51.276
there was one city that
just came out that showed

00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:54.546
that parents text their kids during
school, and I've done that myself.

00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:59.906
So, you know, that it really starts
with the values of the family.

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:04.626
Am I going to embrace technology
but also discuss its limits

00:05:04.626 --> 00:05:06.456
in its proper time and space?

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.266
Yes. Are kids gonna listen to it?

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:12.066
Yes and no, but even when they
look like they're not listening,

00:05:12.256 --> 00:05:14.346
they hear you, and it
shows up later in life.

00:05:16.696 --> 00:05:20.616
Ultimately, our job as
parents is to empower our kids,

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:24.106
to teach them to protect
themselves and to teach them

00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:26.596
to be responsible citizens
of the world.

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:31.766
So at a certain point, you have
to, as a parent, instill the values

00:05:32.486 --> 00:05:36.926
that you have about being a good
digital citizen or human being.

00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:40.696
And then encourage them
to independently use them.

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:45.146
So you can try and police, and
indeed, kids learn from mistakes.

00:05:45.816 --> 00:05:48.856
So if you check a browser
history, like I did with my son,

00:05:48.856 --> 00:05:51.416
and see three porn sites--
he's a fourteen year old.

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:56.126
It's age appropriate-- but I had to
have a discussion with him about,

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:58.096
"Hey, there's some
nasty things out there."

00:05:58.206 --> 00:05:59.946
And I'm realistic.

00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:03.516
I know at fourteen, I cannot
police where he's going,

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:07.796
but I can get in the discussion
and I can put my two cents in,

00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:11.176
and I can give my values
and my wisdom,

00:06:11.216 --> 00:06:15.116
because parents are still parents
and kids still need our wisdom.

00:06:21.406 --> 00:06:23.326
