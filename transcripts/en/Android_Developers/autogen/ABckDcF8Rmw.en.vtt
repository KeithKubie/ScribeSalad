 Hi, my name is "Xiaoyo Wang" 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.540
 Partner and CastBox CEO 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.050
 Two years ago, the company's initial model was designed as a personal software developer 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.300
 I did not expect this rapid growth in the podcast market 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.620
 CastBox has benefited from Google technologies and services to evolve steadily 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.130
 Now the company has provided content that is preferred by more than 7 million users 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.740
 In less than two years, the team has made up 40 people, not one 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.890
 Since the launch of our application, improvements have not stopped and their assessments have become impressive 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.530
 Shortly after CastBox was launched, a letter of thanks was sent to us from Russia 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.390
 Because our rich audio content has helped her learn about the world 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.710
 The company was also nominated to win as a prominent Google Play award winner 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.540
 2017 to gain a broad reputation 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.060
 My name is "Xiaochong He", a partner in CastBox and its IT director 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.380
 My job is to use technology to get the best content 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.290
 TensorFlow provides a multi-algorithm model 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.490
 And made the process of submitting content proposals more precise 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.720
 And when a user logs on to CastBox 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.280
 Can identify content that suits their interests 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.130
 The CastBox application then combines listening data and user behavior 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.930
 To provide the best content suggestions to the user 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.200
 This is the exact connection between the user and the content he likes 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.430
 Enable CastBox to reach retention rate for second day 70% 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.380
 The average daily use of the application is more than one and a half hours 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.600
 Also enabled instant app on Android 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 You can use the CastBox application without installing it on your devices 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.460
 This has strongly contributed to enhancing users' access to content 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.050
 My name is "Chippin Lee" 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.060
 A partner in CastBox and its marketing director 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.530
 Interacting with creators is a key to CastBox success 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.400
 It allows us to deliver content based on a sound system 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.040
 We provide two monthly payment models based on Google's subscriptions 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.940
 The first model is Pay Per Channel and the second is a separate subscription based on functionality 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.200
 Flexible subscription options contribute 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.650
 In providing services to important and ordinary users 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.290
 As well as giving us more information about their needs 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.940
 Our success depends much on Google technology 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.130
 More than 80% of our users use Android 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.640
 We always strive to provide more features to our users 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.490
 Provide better content suggestions and enhance the listener experience
