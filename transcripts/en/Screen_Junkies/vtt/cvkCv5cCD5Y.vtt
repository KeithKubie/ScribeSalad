00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.020
You’ve seen the prequels,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.640
sequels,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.070
and spin-offs,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.490
but before you see the prequel-sequel hybrid
reboot

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.240
revisit the triquel that started it all:
The X-Men Trilogy

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.970
In a world where people cheer for superheroes
like The Fantastic Four,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.000
The Avengers,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.320
and Spiderman,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.390
those same people will inexplicably hate the
X-Men

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.210
"Get out of my bar, freak."

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.610
because for some reason there’s a difference

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.750
between super-powers and mutant powers

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.860
... I guess.
Suit up for director Bryan Singer’s first

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.230
two X-Men films,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.170
that proved comic book movies can be awesome

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.559
and director(?) Brett Ratner’s The Last
Stand

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.480
that proved comic book movies can totally
suck balls.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.350
Recoil as this spoiled hack douchebag takes
the reigns of the beloved franchise,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.790
only to kill off your favorite characters,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.579
leave out your favorite characters,

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.540
and depower your favorite characters.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.969
"I had to."

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.899
all while completely butchering the Phoenix
Saga,

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.899
a storyline so iconic even the cartoon did
it justice.

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.630
"Scott, please, do it!"

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.999
"I can't!"

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.640
"Ahhh!"

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.920
But don’t worry, they’re sending Wolverine
back in time to make sure Brett Ratner never

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.560
happened.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.799
Meet Professor X, the Dumbledore of Xavier’s

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.420
School for Witchcraft and Wizardry

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.259
(It's basically ITT Tech for weirdos).
Suit up with his best students, the X-Men,

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.009
leather fetish versions of the popular comic
book characters.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.179
There’s Wolverine, a man with a mysterious
past that must have included a lot of steroids,

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.310
Cyclops, a bratty cry-baby who’s only there
to salt Wolverine’s game,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.469
"Stay away from my girl."

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.979
Rogue, who gets the crappy no-touching part
of her powers but not flight or super strength,

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.899
Storm, who can control the variations of the
weather

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.770
but not her bad African accent,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.159
"At least I've chosen a side."

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.700
"Hank, tell all the students the school stays
open."

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.860
Gambit,

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.940
and Jean Grey, whose phoenix energy is released
through the power

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.280
of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.920
stares.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.500
They’ll team up against Magneto, a Holocaust
survivor who basically becomes Hitler,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.140
"We are the cure!"

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.220
a walking internet meme,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.100
“I’m the juggernaut, bitch!”

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.460
and His Na’vi sidekick Mystique --

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.410
wait, is she naked?

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.120
She’s totally naked, right?

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.220
Man, someone got to paint that on her bewbs...

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.190
to make them, you know, blewbs.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.490
Ugh, I’m so lonely.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.670
Watch as all mutantkind must band together

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.220
to defeat evil government officials out to
prove that mutants are dangerous

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.940
which they totally are.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400
Ugh! Jeez!

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.900
Starring...

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.320
Melisandre,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.240
Occulus Rift,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.780
Twiiiinks,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.980
Sookie,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.300
Ron Paul,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.130
Logan Valjean,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.540
Rebecca Romijn,

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.430
Hairy Blewbs,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.130
and Timmy!

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.190
The X-Men Trilogy

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.280
So they couldn’t find room for Gambit, Psylocke,
or Cable,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.260
but they managed to fit in Horn Man, Slim
Fast, and 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.500
the Bad Hugger?

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.340
Ugh.
