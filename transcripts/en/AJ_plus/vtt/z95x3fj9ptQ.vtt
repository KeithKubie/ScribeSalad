00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.400
Where do you go in New York when you need to buy eggs, milk, or a hot sandwich?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.860
The bodega - a New York City institution.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.060
Bodegas  are literally everywhere in New York.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.420
And, yes, while some people think of them as just grocery stores, you can actually get a whole lot more.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.940
Bodegas are owned by different ethnic groups like Puerto Ricans, Yemenis, and Egyptians.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.020
But the majority of bodegas are owned by one community in particular:

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.660
Dominican-Americans.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.480
That business came

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.080
to fulfill that vacuum that was there

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.320
in the community.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.039
Decades of immigration
to the US have made New York's Dominican

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.000
diaspora the largest in the world
outside of the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.460
This immigration to the US has gifted us with Cardi B, Junot Diaz, David Ortiz,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.060
Oscar de la Renta and The Kid Mero -
who actually has a podcast called The Bodega Boys.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.400
Hey guys, I'm Daniel and today I want to explore how bodegas became so essential to New York life,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.500
and also how the story of Dominican immigration to the US was instrumental in making it happen.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.580
We spoke to Dorky Gomez, owner of Gold
Glove Deli and Grocery.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.200
She's owned her bodega in New York's Washington Heights

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.780
neighborhood for over a year and is
known as a friendly face to customers.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.820
In her bodega you can find a wide variety of products.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.680
Gomez immigrated to the U.S. from the
Dominican Republic, or D.R., in 2016.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.940
Her older brother Carlos is a Major League Baseball player with the Tampa Bay Rays

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.820
and helped her establish her bodega.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.800
Gomez and her family live in the building.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.800
She works hard to support her husband
and one-year-old son.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.040
She says that even though Dominicans are far from their homeland, Bodegas help them feel

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.240
closer to one another.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.920
Gomez's store looks like your typical
bodega.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.120
For starters there's a yellow and red sign

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.280
and you can usually buy "lotería", or a lottery ticket, at the counter.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.820
You'll probably spot a candle, or a "veladora," painted with religious imagery somewhere in the shop.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.140
And you'll probably see a bodega cat roaming around or asleep in the middle of the floor.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.940
And in case you didn't know Bodega cats are a big deal.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.807
There are Instagram and Twitter accounts
and Facebook pages.

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:56.440
And the Bodega cats are so iconic that this New York lottery even used them in their commercial.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.440
"Good night, Cyrus."

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.240
Super cute.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.520
Ok so, while Dominicans like Gomez have dominated the bodega scene in New York for decades,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.360
the bodega story didn’t exactly start with them.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.000
Jewish delis that sold a whole range of
products were a common scene across New York

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.740
starting in the 1920s, familiarizing
the city with the concept of corner stores.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.639
But it was in the 1940s and 50s
that bodegas as we know them today first

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.780
became a part of New York's social
fabric.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.040
Initially, they were established by Puerto Ricans who moved to New York post-World War II

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.700
from the US island territory.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.420
And that's something that Professor Ramona Hernandez argues is often lost in the conversation about bodegas.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.280
Dominicans bought bodegas, the bodegas

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:46.120
from Puerto Rican owners who were leaving New York City as Dominicans were coming in.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.580
So they were the ones working in the bodegas for Puerto Ricans when the transition happened.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.180
During the same time, the D.R. was experiencing some

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.440
major political and economic upheaval.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.359
For starters the Dominican Republic's

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.880
U.S.-backed dictator Rafael Trujillo was
assassinated in 1961.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:15.500
The assassination of Trujillo led to successive events interrelated in provoking the exodus of the Dominican people.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.080
In 1962, the country voted for its first freely-elected president, Juan Bosch.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.800
But his pro-Castro sentiments angered the US and parts of the Dominican government.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.960
We need to remember,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.760
the Cuban Revolution has just taken place a few years before.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.980
It wasn't the best idea to

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.780
have another country in the Caribbean -  or even in America Latina - with a similar system.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.240
This led to a military coup and installation of the U.S.-backed Joaquin Balaguer as president.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.960
But all of this upheaval created huge unrest prompting a civil war.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.940
And then in 1965 the U.S. invaded.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.520
It was Dominicans fighting Dominicans.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.720
And now this is 1965 and the U.S. gets involved.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.500
And now it becomes Dominicans fighting the U.S.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.800
This turmoil left Dominicans seeking both safety and economic security

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.643
So, in an effort to win hearts and minds the U.S. government made it easier

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:13.180
for Dominicans to settle here.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.700
Reasons for their massive migration have
to do with the economic conditions of

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.870
the Dominican migrants in the Dominican Republic.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.190
And for the Dominicans immigrating to the U.S., Bodegas made practical sense.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:35.600
These are small businesses that allow
Dominicans to have a job and at the same time

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.562
provide for their family.

00:05:37.562 --> 00:05:41.720
And this, in many instances were created because they

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.900
were not able to find jobs and the
larger economy, in the larger society.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.480
But at the same time it also represents
independence.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.200
There were several waves of Dominican immigration since then.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.060
Today, they are the fifth-largest Latino group in the country,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.800
with more than 600,000
Dominicans in New York alone.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.780
In New York, the Washington Heights neighborhood is the heart of the Dominican community.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.740
In the past, this neighborhood was home to Irish immigrants and European Jews.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.400
Then in the 60s and 70s Dominicans moved in.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.000
They eventually became the majority, establishing one of the most recognized ethnic enclaves in New York.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.640
Washington Heights has this immigrant tradition already.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.728
So, the other thing is that Washington Heights is very close to El Barrio,

00:06:21.728 --> 00:06:23.840
which is a settlement

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.680
and neighborhood populated at that time
predominantly by Puerto Ricans.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:35.780
And one thing that we know is that Dominicans move in the U.S. or tend to live in areas

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.040
where you also find Puerto Ricans.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.360
Walking through Washington Heights you'll see Dominican restaurants and beauty salons.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.740
You'll also hear bachata, merengue, and dembow.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.060
And of course lots and lots of bodegas.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.500
The bodega, it is this place that served
at the same time as a social space

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.100
where Dominicans converge.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.820
But Bodegas are much more than corner stores where you get your diapers or Platanos.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.360
It's a place where the community gathers

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.880
to hang out and grab a bite.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.260
Bodegas are also resource for

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.980
low-income and immigrant communities.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.500
They often serve areas where you won't

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.260
find a supermarket. And bodegas often
act as lifelines for many neighborhoods

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.060
in the city by letting customers who are
short on cash pay for their items later.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.640
Everybody tries to help everybody. People
come and they're short or they need a

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.420
certain item and they don't have the money at the time then we'll do our best to accommodate them.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.140
And this is why Bodegas are so special.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.800
They allow for a relationship between the bodegueros

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.660
and their clients.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.360
For bodega owner, Candido Arcángel, that means that his store is much more than that.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.720
Arcángel houses homeless folks in the basement of his bodega and has done so for years.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.420
Despite his bodega being zoned strictly for commercial use and not having the proper permits

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.960
to house individuals, he's taken it upon himself to provide shelter for them.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.820
Arcangel immigrated from the D.R. to the U.S. in 1989.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.020
He bought his bodega in 1995 and began taking in homeless people shortly after.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.840
William Arroyo has lived in the basement of Arcangel’s bodega for 5 years.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.580
And sure, Bodegas can be profitable but they also struggle with challenges that so many

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.180
businesses in big cities in the U.S. face today:

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.500
rising costs and gentrification.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.340
In 2015, an estimated 75
bodegas shut down in New York because

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.160
of rent increases.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.900
According to the
Real Estate Board of New York, rents went

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.060
up over a third from 2004 to 2014.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.540
And while that's a small number of the estimated

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.360
12,000 bodegas scattered across New York, it's hit the industry pretty hard -

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.680
not to mention the community in Washington Heights.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.580
Gentrification has definitely

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.420
impacted the Dominican people.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.690
Affluent people have discovered the great

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:13.720
location of Washington Heights. That's
what it is. It is an incredible location.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.160
Despite the difficulties bodegas have faced in recent years,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.160
the community is still very proud of its
heritage and contributions to the United States.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.340
And Dominicans are much more than
their bodegas.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:28.060
Being able to contribute and produce in the society where we now live,

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.320
but more than that, preserved a legacy, a cultural legacy,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.740
a historical legacy, right here and share it with the

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.240
rest of society.
