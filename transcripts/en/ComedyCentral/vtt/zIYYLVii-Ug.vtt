00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.570
AND WHYS OF THE SEX TAPE,

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:06.206
I ASKED MY INTERN TO COMPILE
THE ESSENTIALS OF THE GENRE.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.308
- SO, UH, <i>1 NIGHT IN PARIS.</i>

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.444
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE
THE <i>APOCALYPSE NOW</i>

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:11.979
OF CELEBRITY SEX TAPES.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.314
THEN YOU'VE GOT PAMELA ANDERSON
AND TOMMY LEE,

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:18.252
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE
THE <i>CITIZEN KANE,</i> I GUESS?

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.888
- WAIT, WAIT.
TURN ON YOUR FILTER LIGHT.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.457
- IN SHORT ORDER,
THE HOW WAS CLEAR ENOUGH--

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.660
DIRTY TALK
AND CONFUSING SEXUAL POSITIONS--

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.729
BUT THE WHY REMAINED ELUSIVE.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.297
THAT IS DISGUSTING.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.665
THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.834
THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE SEX
IN THE DARK.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.769
IT FEELS BETTER THAN IT LOOKS.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.970
THANK YOU, LUCILLE.
- OH.

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.173
TAKE IT!
- ROB LOWE, HUH?

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.742
[indistinct chatter
on computer]

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.677
- IT SIMPLY DIDN'T MAKE SENSE
TO ME.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.145
JUST BREAKS MY HEART HOW--
- CAN WE NOT TALK?

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:46.647
I REALLY JUST WANT TO FOCUS
ON THIS.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.282
- OH, YEAH

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:49.917
- OKAY.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.519
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
THE APPEAL OF MAKING A SEX TAPE,

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:55.522
I WAS GOING TO NEED THE
ASSISTANCE OF A WILLING PARTNER.

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.958
- HAVE YOU OUTDONE YOURSELF?
- I THINK I HAVE OUTDONE MYSELF.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.793
ASK ME WHY I MADE
MY SPECIALTY TONIGHT.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.828
- WHY DID YOU MAKE
YOUR SPECIALTY TONIGHT, HONEY?

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:05.799
- WELL, JUST FOR THE HALIBUT.
[both laughing]

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:09.203
THAT'S A LOT OF FUN.
- THAT <i>IS</i> A LOT OF FUN.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:13.473
- TO US.
- TO US. MM.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.075
both: MMM.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.945
- HEY, LISTEN, I TOLD ERIC
THAT HE SHOULD STAY OVER

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:20.180
AT CLAYTON'S HOUSE TONIGHT.
- OH, OKAY.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:22.115
I HAVE A SHOPPING LIST FOR YOU,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.684
- SHOPPING LIST?
NO, NO, NO.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.219
NO, I THOUGHT
WE MIGHT DO SOMETHING

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.387
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING
WITH OUR ALONE TIME.

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.090
- OH, OKAY, I GET IT, YEAH.
- UH-HUH, YEAH.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.391
IN FACT, I THOUGHT WE MIGHT...
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.093
- MIX IT UP
A LITTLE BIT TONIGHT.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.563
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
- I WAS THINKING WE MIGHT

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:39.733
DOCUMENT THE PROCEEDINGS
<i>CE SOIR--</i>

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.735
TONIGHT.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.303
- HMM?
- HOW--HOW WOULD WE--

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:45.706
- I BOUGHT A VIDEO CAMERA,
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD--

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.641
- UGH!
YOU WANT TO MAKE A SEX TAPE?

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.009
- YEAH!
- NO, GROSS!

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.310
- WHY?

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:51.712
- WHAT ARE YOU,
A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE?

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:53.981
NO, NO, NO.
WHAT IF PEOPLE SAW IT?

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:55.649
WHAT IF ERIC FOUND IT?
- NO, DON'T--

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.317
SWEETHEART, WE'LL MAKE SURE ERIC
DOESN'T SEE IT

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.553
UNTIL LONG AFTER WE'RE DEAD.
- NO, THAT IS NOT--

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.421
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
YOU WOULD WANT TO DO--

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.890
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:04.224
IT'S CREEPY.
- I'M VERY SURPRISED

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:05.826
BY THIS REACTION OF YOURS.
- [sighs]

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.194
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT THINK
IT WOULD BE KIND OF FUN.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.862
- MAN, FORREST.
- I THINK IT WOULD BE FUN.

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:10.564
- YOU WERE SO CLOSE, YOU KNOW?
YOU WERE ON THE GREEN!

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:11.932
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS
JUST PUTT IT.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.333
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS DOING.

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.602
- NO, YOU SHANKED IT RIGHT
INTO THE WOODS!

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.438
THANKS FOR NOTHING, ALL RIGHT?

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:19.840
- WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.609
- I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
NO.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.678
