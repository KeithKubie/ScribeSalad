00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.714
So if I were giving advice to someone who wants to work in the field of soft robotics,

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:15.570
I would say that learning robotics is already a very, very multi-disciplinary thing.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.920
So you know your mechanical,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.275
you know your electrical,

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:19.724
you know your software,

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.590
you know, there's all these skills you need to take on.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.570
So, easy enough take on a few more.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.379
Who doesn't like learning?

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:33.600
So, learn about your chemistries particularly your polymer chemistries.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.145
Learn about chemical engineering and the way in which manufacturers convert

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.110
raw chemical materials into

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.850
sophisticated mechanical constructs and electrical constructs.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.130
Also learn about biomechanics.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.609
There are some of the greatest machines ever created are found in nature.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.530
Natural systems do things incredibly efficiently with minimal computation

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.200
relative to what's seen in the robots that we as a society build today.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.650
So I would heavily encourage people to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.625
learn a lot more about biological systems to draw inspiration,

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:14.459
to create inspired new mechanisms.
