00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.560
All right, we're on
problem number 8.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.400
And they ask us which equation
is equivalent to 5x minus 2

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.700
times 7x plus 1 is
equal to 14x?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.820
So I'm guessing they just want
to simplify this a little bit

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.530
and see if we get to one
of these choices.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.190
So let's do that.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.950
So we start with 5x minus
2 times 7x plus

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.910
1 is equal to 14x.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.280
This is I think the most obvious
thing to simplify.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.550
This 2 times the 7x plus 1, or
we can even say minus 2 times

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.576
7x plus 1, so then this becomes
5x plus-- I'm just

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:40.940
going to distribute the minus
2 times all of this.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.470
Plus minus 2 times
17x is minus 14x.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.020
And then minus 2 times 1 is
minus 2 is equal to 14x.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.690
And let's see, on all of these
choices they have 14x on the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.240
right-hand side.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.380
So they just want us
to simplify this.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.940
So this simplifies to 5x, plus
minus 14, so that's minus 14x

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.080
minus 2 is equal to 14x.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.785
So we have 5x minus 14x.

00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:14.170
So what's 5 minus 14?

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.410
It's what?

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.600
Minus 9, right?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.270
Minus 9x minus 2 is
equal to 14x.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.350
That is choice A.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.730
Now, one thing that maybe
I realized, I kind

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.490
of skipped a step.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.960
Let me just do this, just so
that you understand this step

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.840
that I did here.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.290
We could have just said minus
and then distribute the 2.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.540
So we could have right there
said 5x minus positive 2 times

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.810
7x, 14x, plus 2 times
1, plus 2.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.950
I'm just doing the
left-hand side.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.150
And then we could have
distributed the minus sign.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.970
So you get 5x minus
14x minus 2.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.610
Either way, it would have gotten
us to this point and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.090
then we could have simplified
here and gotten choice A.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.160
Next problem.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.090
Which equation is equivalent
to-- OK, so another case where

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.772
I'm guessing they just want us
to simplify these equations.

00:02:13.772 --> 00:02:15.800
So let me write that down.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:26.810
4 times 2 minus 5x is equal to
6 minus 3 times 1 minus 3x.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.830
All right, let's distribute
this 4 first. So you get 4

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.090
times 2 is 8.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.470
4 times minus 5x is minus 20x.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.190
Minus 20x is equal to 6 minus--
maybe you might have

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.550
been tempted to say, oh, 6 minus
3, that's 3, and then

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.760
distribute it.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.140
Remember, order of operations.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.150
Multiplication comes first. So
we have to multiply the 3

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.810
times the 1 minus 3x before
we can deal with the 6.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.650
Well, on the other side there
was just the multiplication

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.660
first. All right.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.770
So here, 3 times 1 minus
3x, so it'll be 3.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.760
I'm just going to do
minus a positive 3

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.320
times each of these.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.020
So 3 times a negative
3 is minus 9x.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.090
And now I can distribute
this minus sign.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.600
So let's see, on the left-hand
side I have-- let me do it in

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.940
a brighter color.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.930
The left-hand side I have 8
minus 20x is equal to 6, and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.450
then I'm going to subtract
this whole thing.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.090
So you can view it as
distributing a negative 1

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.000
times both of these.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.070
So 6 plus minus 3, or just 6
minus 3, and then a minus

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.770
times a minus plus 9x.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.610
All right.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.620
Now let's see what we could
do to help simplify this.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.445
What happens if we add
20x to both sides?

00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:48.190
Then on the left-hand side, it
goes away, so we're just left

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.130
with 8 is equal to-- well,
let me just do that.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.020
6 minus 3.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.720
I added 20x, so plus 29x.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.940
I really should have simplified
this 6 minus 3, but

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.050
I didn't want to do too
much in one step.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.910
So 8 is equal to 3 plus 29x, and
then if we subtract 3 from

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.120
both sides here, we get
8 minus 3 is 5.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.500
That 3 goes away and you get
29x, and that is choice C.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.890
29x is equal to 5.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.230
Next question, problem
number 10.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.340
And I should be careful that
you don't think that all of

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.320
this stuff is for
this problem.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.810
The total cost, c, in dollars
of renting a sailboat for n

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.930
days is given by
this equation.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.050
If the total cost was $360,
for how many days was the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.830
sailboat rented?

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.920
So they're giving
us c. c is $360.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.080
So they're telling us that $360,
that's the total cost,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.720
and that's going to be equal to
120 plus 60 times with the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.230
total days rented, times 60n.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.090
And that's what they want
us to figure out, n.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.630
How many days was the
sailboat rented?

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.460
Let's see, so if you should
subtract 120 from both sides

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.140
of this equation, you get
240 is equal to 60n.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.290
I'll go here.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.510
And if you divide both sides of
this by 60, 240 divided by

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.300
60, that's the same thing as 24
divided by 6, so that's 4.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.430
And then 60n divided by 60 is,
of course, 1, so that is n.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.930
So the sailboat was
rented for 4 days.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.650
All right, problem number 11.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.250
And I cut and pasted part of
it, but they want us to

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.020
determine, what was the first
incorrect step that they did

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.740
in this problem?

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.060
So let's see if we can
determine that.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.970
So let's see.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.420
Solve 3 times x plus 5 is
equal to 2x plus 35.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.300
Fair enough.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.960
So in this first step they
distributed 3 times

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.780
x and 3 times 5.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.190
Right, 3x plus 15 is equal to
2x plus 35, so step 1 looks

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.600
good to me.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.340
Let me do that in
a darker color.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.490
Step 1 looks good.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.400
They distributed the 3.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.370
Now let's see what they
did in step 2.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.490
Let's see, if I wanted to solve
this, I would subtract

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.780
2x from both sides, and it looks
like that's what they

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.830
attempted to do because they
got rid of this 2x, right?

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.020
On the right-hand side, they
went from 2x plus 35 to just

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.550
35, so somehow they got rid of
this 2x, and the only way to

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.220
get rid of it is to subtract
2x from both sides.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.620
Now, if I subtract 2x from both
sides, sure enough, the

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.860
right-hand side will just
be left with the 35.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.220
The left-hand side will have
the 15, of course.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.140
And then I have minus
2x plus 3x.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.440
Well, minus 2x plus
3x, that's x.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.350
So this 5x, that shouldn't
be there.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.860
It should be x plus
15 is equal to 35.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.980
So even though they were trying
to get rid of this 2x

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.170
and they should have subtracted
2x from both sides,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.180
they inadvertently added 2x
here, so they said 2x plus 3x

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.280
is equal to 5x.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.760
Well, that was wrong.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.375
You have to subtract.

00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:05.610
And you're just left with x
plus 15 is equal to 35.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.730
So step 2 is when they made
their first error.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:16.870
Problem 120.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.220
A 120-foot-long rope is
cut into 3 pieces.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.160
The first piece of the
rope-- let me draw.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.145
This is begging for a diagram.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.510
All right, so they say the first
piece of rope is twice

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.360
as long as the second
piece of rope.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.330
And then they say the third
piece of rope is three times

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.600
as long as the second
piece of rope.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.000
Everything is a multiple of
the second piece of rope.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.100
So the second one was the
shortest one, just reading it.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.470
The first is twice as
long as the second.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.420
The third is three
times as long.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.750
So if I just drew it.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.680
So if this is the second
length of rope,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.950
let's call that x.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.810
That's the second
length of rope.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:09.980
And they told us the first piece
of rope is twice as long

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.050
as the second piece of rope.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.230
OK, so if this is the first
piece of rope right here, it's

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.000
going to be twice as long as
the second piece of rope.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.910
So that's 2x.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:19.490
Fair enough.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.530
And then they tell us-- I'll
do this in magenta.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.700
The third piece of rope is three
times as long as the

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.500
second piece of rope.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.760
So this is the third
piece of rope here.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.549
It's three times as long as
the second piece of rope.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.280
So it's 3x.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.179
And they say, what is
the length of the

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:40.539
longest piece of rope?

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.440
All right, so let's
think about it.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.650
If I add up all of these
segments, what

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.550
do they add up to?

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.510
Well, they tell us that it's
120-foot-long rope.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.120
So let me add that up.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:57.140
So if I do 2x plus x plus
3x, that's going

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.470
to equal 120 feet.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.570
That is equal to 120 feet.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.790
That whole distance is 120.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:11.660
So 2x plus x is 3x plus 3x, you
get 6x is equal to 120.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.810
You divide both sides by 6, You
get x is-- let's see, 120

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.040
divided by 6 is 20.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.990
All right, that's what x is.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.570
That's the second piece of rope
or the shortest piece of

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.380
rope because they
tell us that.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.510
The other ones are some multiple
of that length.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.590
But they want to know, what is
the length of the longest

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.840
piece of rope?

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.140
Well, the longest piece of
rope is clearly piece 3.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.030
It's three times the
second piece.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.000
Piece 1 was only two times.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.080
So this is what they
want to know.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.520
They want to know what
3x is equal to.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:48.740
So 3x is equal to three times
20, which is equal to 60 feet.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.150
And that's choice C.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.815
Next problem.

00:09:53.815 --> 00:09:55.320
Let's see if I have time.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.616
Yeah, I think I have time.

00:09:57.616 --> 00:10:00.170
I might as well attempt
to fit it in.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.380
All right.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.350
Don't want to rush
them, though.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.230
Let's see.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.850
The cost to rent a construction
crane is $750 per

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.440
day plus $250 per hour of use.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.490
What is the maximum number of
hours the crane can be used

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:33.140
each day if the rental cost is
not to exceed $2,500 per day?

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.610
OK, so how much is
the cost per day?

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:41.030
So the cost per day
is equal to $750.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.480
So no matter how little or much
we use it, we have to pay

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.730
that $750 per day.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:55.120
So it's equal to $750 plus $250
per hour, so plus $250

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.670
times the number of hours.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.620
This is what our total
cost is per day.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.870
And they want to say, what is
the maximum number of hours

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.260
the crane can be used each day
if the rental cost is not to

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.680
exceed $2,500 per day?

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.900
So this whole thing has to be
less than or equal to $2,500.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.080
The total cost has to be less
than or equal to $2,500.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.530
So now let's just solve this
equation right there.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.330
And I'll do it up here.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:28.480
So we know that $750 plus
$250-- let me do

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.170
it down here actually.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.480
More space.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.880
So what's the first thing
we could do here?

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.520
We could subtract 750 from both
sides of this equation.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:45.130
So we get 250 times h is less
than or equal to-- 2,500 minus

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.490
750, that's what?

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.510
1,750?

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.210
Yeah, because 1,500
minus 750 is 750.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.420
1,750.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.210
I just subtracted 750 from both
sides of this equation.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.630
Let me write that down.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.910
So I said minus 750 plus that.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.280
And then I said minus 750.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.400
And, of course, minus 750 plus
750, that goes to 0.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.420
That's why you don't see
anything over here.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.870
And on the right-hand side,
2,500 minus 750 is 1,750.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.050
All right, now let's just divide
both sides by 250.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.180
We don't have to do anything to
the inequality sign since

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.320
250 is a positive number.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.610
So the hours, the maximum number
of hours, the hours

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:33.730
have to be less than or equal to
1,750/250, which is-- let's

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.570
see, 1,750 divided by 250.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.860
That's the same thing as
175 divided by 25.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.235
25 goes into 175,
what is that?

00:12:45.235 --> 00:12:48.760
I want to say seven times?

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.030
7 times 5 is 35.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.510
7 times 2 is 14 plus 3 is 17.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.330
Right.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:59.070
So h has to be less than
or equal to 7 hours.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.500
And that is choice C.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.410
See you in the next video.
