00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.260
Is negative 1 comma 7 a
solution for the system

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.132
of linear equations below?

00:00:06.132 --> 00:00:07.590
And they give us
the first equation

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.100
is x plus 2y is equal to 13.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.430
Second equation is 3x minus
y is equal to negative 11.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.190
In order for negative
1 comma 7 to be

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.670
a solution for the
system, it needs

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.970
to satisfy both equations.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.880
Or another way of thinking about
it, x equals 7, and y-- sorry,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.939
x is equal to negative 1.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:29.980
This is the x coordinate.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.520
X equals negative 1, and
y is equal to 7, need

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.340
to satisfy both of
these equations in order

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.367
for it to be a Solution.

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:40.200
So let's try it out.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.960
Let's try it out with
the first equation.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.477
So we have x plus
2y is equal to 13.

00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:47.060
So if we're thinking
about that, we're

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.530
testing to see if when x
is equal to negative 1,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.210
and y is equal to 7,
will x plus 2y equals 13?

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.110
So we have negative
1 plus 2 times

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.774
7-- y should be 7-- this
needs to be equal to 13.

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:03.190
And I'll put a
question mark there

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.830
because we don't
know whether it does.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.880
So this is the same
thing as negative 1

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.760
plus 2 times 7 plus 14.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.310
That does, indeed, equal 13.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.200
Negative 1 plus 14, this is 13.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.370
So 13 does definitely equal 13.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.960
So this point it does, at least,
satisfy this first equation.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.820
This point does sit on the
graph of this first equation,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.637
or on the line of
this first equation.

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:32.220
Now let's look at
the second equation.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.810
I'll do that one in blue.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:44.300
We have 3 times negative
1 minus y, so minus 7,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.244
needs to be equal
to negative 11.

00:01:46.244 --> 00:01:47.910
I'll put a question
mark here because we

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.770
don't know whether
it's true or not.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.840
So let's see, we have 3 times
negative 1 is negative 3.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.850
And then we have minus 7 needs
to be equal to negative 11--

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.390
I put the question mark there.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.700
Negative 3 minus 7,
that's negative 10.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.340
So we get negative 10
equaling negative 11.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.729
No, negative 10 does
not equal a negative 11.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.450
So x equaling negative
1, and y equaling 7

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.200
does not satisfy
the second equation.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.190
So it does not sit on its graph.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.120
So this over here is not
a solution for the system.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.240
So the answer is no.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.280
It satisfies the
first equation, but it

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.760
doesn't satisfy the second.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.910
In order to be a
solution for the system,

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.590
it has to satisfy
both equations.
