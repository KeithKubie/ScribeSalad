00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.210
- Thank you everybody.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.730
I think that's the
first time I've heard it

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.520
introduced that way where I heard

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.570
thank you for coming to A A 110 Questions.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.490
We don't have 110 questions, it is just 10

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.723
and welcome to the 9th session
of this 10-week series.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.080
What Is Knowledge?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.080
What do I know, is the
topic for this evening.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.520
This is our penultimate
session of 10 Questions.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.420
And one of our guests this evening

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.820
asked if I could work the
word penultimate in early,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.723
so, check, done.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.053
How do we know what penultimate means?

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.940
Most of us know what the word means

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.070
but we don't know
exactly how we know that.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.670
We just do.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.490
And with that I introduce tonight's topic

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.030
which is to stand back
from our daily lives

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.740
organized around the
acquisition of, presentation of,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.780
conservation of knowledge
of various kinds.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.680
And I'm thinking
especially of you students

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.350
who will be tested on knowledge
in a couple of weeks time

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.300
in various classes.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.360
To think instead about
the larger topic or idea,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.360
this very, very special, very
human, almost incomparable

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.830
concept that we have of
knowledge in the world

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.050
and how that concept
relates to or differs from

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.330
things very close to it,
like ideas, like information,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.300
like many other things that
seems to sit closely aside

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.950
this very human quality and concept.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.100
To ask, what is knowledge,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.750
I think if we think about it for a minute

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.750
is very abstract, almost obscure or obtuse

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.290
compared to some of the
questions we've asked

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.710
over the last couple of months.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.533
If you think of beauty, failure, time,

00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:11.560
big, human or at times
intensely personal ideas.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.070
To ask, what is knowledge, you gotta admit

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.493
sounds a little bit know-it-all-like.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.513
And a very UCLA kinda thing, right?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.180
It is, however, by design, a
question that's gonna lead us

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.820
into the final one of this series

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.090
which is to contemplate:
What is a University?

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.270
And we're joined by some
terrific guests this evening

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.950
who are gonna help us with that work.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.780
I'm old enough, I think,
to be comfortable in saying

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.753
I feel like I know what I know
and I know what I don't know.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.953
One of the incredible
pleasures of being a dean

00:02:48.953 --> 00:02:51.550
at a school like the School
of the Arts and Architecture

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.620
at UCLA is I spend my
days literally with people

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.563
who know way more than I do.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.340
Including you students, I promise,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.080
you know things that most of us at my age

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.163
can't even imagine let alone comprehend.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.868
But all of this focus on
though, in our daily lives

00:03:07.868 --> 00:03:10.710
as we contemplate that kind of reality

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.250
is, of course, who it is we might turn to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.930
how it is we might think

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.170
how it is we relay that
thing we treat as knowledge.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.760
And tonight's work is gonna
continue that sort of thinking.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.890
That said, for me, there are three things

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.523
I do know about knowledge.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.580
The first is, it's incredibly valuable

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.490
and arguably more valuable than ever

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.522
at a time described in relation to

00:03:38.522 --> 00:03:41.523
an idea like knowledge economies.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.540
That suddenly place more value

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.270
in literal monetary terms on ideas

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.250
than it often will on hard stuff

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.470
like bricks and mortar, glass or steel.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.633
The second thing I know is
that knowledge is vulnerable.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.080
Particularly, you could
say, in an era of fake news

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.123
or rampant conspiracy theory industries.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.240
Whatever it is, is
something that we all need

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.080
to think carefully about
protecting and not just conserving.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.023
And finally, knowledge is endurable.

00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:22.710
It is enduring, and an enduring feature

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.610
of who and what we are as a species.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.910
Whatever else it is, knowledge
is something we humans

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.620
produce and value, it's
something we share,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.543
we broadcast, we socialize.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.560
We occasionally monetize
or even monopolize

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.510
in spectacular and unexpected ways.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.870
A final way in which we might
think about the importance

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.873
of asking questions about
what is knowledge today.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.300
So with that, as something less

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.970
than a knowledgeable introduction

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.820
I would ask you to welcome
with me our guests this evening

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.810
who are going to do work
sharing their knowledge

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.560
on the bigger question
of what knowledge is.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.230
Everybody, Kristy Edmunds, Victoria Marks,

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.430
Marcelo Suarez-Orozco and Todd Presner.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.650
(audience applauds)

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.847
Come on in, you guys.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.313
Thank you so much.

00:05:29.313 --> 00:05:30.960
A brief introduction
for each of our guests

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.750
and then we're going to
get on with the evening.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.030
On the far side, Kristy
Edmunds is an artist,

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.500
a curator, an artistic director

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.410
and frequent international consultant

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.130
in addition to being the
Executive and Artistic Director

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.010
of UCLA's Center for
the Art of Performance.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.030
Kristy's reputation for
innovation and depth

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.470
relates to her presentation
of contemporary art

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.040
across all disciplines,
with particular emphasis

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.580
on contemporary performing arts.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.340
In collaboration with master artists,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.020
she has curated unique
forms that survey the breath

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.420
of their artistry while
placing equal emphasis

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.980
on the support and
commissioning of new work

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.860
by some of today's leading
performance creators.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.177
Everybody, Kristy Edmunds.

00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:13.210
(audience applauds)

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.810
Thank you, thanks for coming in.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.220
Victoria Marks, here closest
to me, is a choreographer,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.180
and I'm very pleased to say,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.940
our Associate Dean of
Academic Affairs here

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.640
at UCLA's School for the
Arts and Architecture.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.590
Victoria is a professor of choreography

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.110
in the UCLA Department of
World Arts and Cultures

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.400
which has as its home this
wonderful building, Kaufman Hall,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.820
where she has been teaching since 1995.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.710
She creates dances that consider
the politics of citizenship

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.240
as well as the representation

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.780
of both virtuosity and disability

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.540
for the stage, for film
and in community settings.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.660
As you know, Victoria is also the one

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.830
who conceived of and developed
this 10 Questions course

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.088
to build in her words.
(audience applauds)

00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:02.610
Aw, that's wonderful.
(audience applauds)

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.110
To build in her words,
a vital cross-university

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.310
conversations as we work
towards understanding

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.570
the unique perspectives of each discipline

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.060
across larger equations of knowledge.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.990
Marcelo Suarez-Orozco is a
psychological anthropologist

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.740
and the Wasserman Dean of
the UCLA Graduate School

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.770
of Education and Information Studies.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.893
Marcelo's research focuses on conceptual

00:07:27.893 --> 00:07:31.770
and empirical problems in the
areas of cultural psychology

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.370
and psychological anthropology

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.720
with an emphasis on the
study of mass migration,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.930
globalization, and education.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.040
An immigrant from Argentina,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.680
Marcelo was a product of
the California Master Plan,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.450
having studied in community college

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.703
and at Berkeley where
he received his Ph.D.

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:54.390
And in January, Pope Francis
appointed Dean Suarez-Orozco

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.430
to the Pontifical Academy
of the Social Sciences.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.076
Everyone, Marcelo Suarez-Orozco.

00:07:59.076 --> 00:08:01.210

a cultural critic,
historian and rock climber.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.070
We'll see which of those skills we use

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.510
most immediately this evening.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.010
And the Founding Chair of UCLA's
Digital Humanities Program

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.770
and Ross Professor of Germanic Languages

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.770

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.640
Since 2018, he is Associate
Dean of Digital Innovation

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.670
in the Division of Humanities here at UCLA

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.240

Todd's research focuses on
European intellectual history,

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.180
the history of media, visual
culture, digital humanities

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.590
and cultural geography.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.904
Everybody, Todd Presner.

00:08:46.904 --> 00:08:47.820
(audience applauds)

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.810
Thank you, thank you all
so much for coming in.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.640
And welcome all, and we will
begin, as we do every week,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.690
with short presentations
by each of our guests.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.780
We have an agreed order,

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.573
and we're going to being this
evening with Victoria Marks.

00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:03.894
(audience applauds)

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.430
- Thank you, Brett Steele and
thank you all for being here.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.510
And I particularly wanna
thank Anne Marie Burke,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.830
Kylie Carrigan and Louise Cale
who have been my compatriots

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.930
in creating these events,

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.590
this class and these public events.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.940
So thank you to all of you.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.010
I'm a choreographer and
I want to bring the body

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.380
into the question, what is knowledge.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.570
I think of the body as
a source of knowing.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.670
And actually I was
looking at the biography

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.450
I often use when I'm presenting
my biography to people

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.870
and it often says,
Victoria Marks practices

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.620
knowing and unknowing, making
dances for stage and film.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.300
I thought about that and
actually I really, really like

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.420
the idea of unknowing,
because I like knowing so much

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.950
that if I unknown it, I can do it again,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.950
I can know things differently
and see things anew.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.440
So, I wanna step aside from
my presentation for a moment.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.403
I just wanna ask you
all, how are you feeling?

00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:20.550
(audience murmurs)

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.053
Okay, so-so, I get a
little so-so, some great.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.820
I'm wondering if maybe
you're a little bit tired,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.378
because it's the end of a long day?

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:30.230
- [Man] Tired.
(audience murmurs)

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.757
Yeah, hungry, 'cause it's dinner time?

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:33.620
(audience murmurs)

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.500
Yeah, maybe a little bit horny?

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.896
Because you're young and wild.

00:10:38.896 --> 00:10:39.729
(audience titters)

00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:41.683
Most, everybody is young and wild.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.610
Okay, well, actually I just, it's time now

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.090
to get back to my lecture
and I just wanna ask you

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.360
to put your mind over matter, please.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.000
And for those of you who are
still thinking about horny

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.460
and kinda checking in on that,

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.681
get your mind out of the gutter.

00:11:00.681 --> 00:11:03.440
(audience laughs)

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.240
Okay, the way I understand this is.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.300
If we look back into European history

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.720
Rene Descartes attempted
to prove the nature

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.903
of human existence through
the action of thought.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.890
In what has become a fundamental
paradigm for knowledge,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.563
we remember his words.

00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:29.900
- [Audience Members] I
think, therefore I am.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.093
- Okay, in two languages,
I think, therefore I am.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.733
Oh, excuse me, would you mind?

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.093
Stand up, please.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.560
Thank you so much.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.015
They've already agreed to this before.

00:11:43.015 --> 00:11:48.015
We have the mind and the body.

00:11:48.735 --> 00:11:49.620
(audience laughs)

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.270
And I just wanted to
give you a visual on this

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:57.270
because in Descartes' thinking,

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.000
the mind and the body were
separable and distinct.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.760
So, the mind often to referred

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.370
to a higher plane of knowledge

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.310
and the body would be living
(audience laughs)

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.513
in the muck or the
gutter of living itself.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.443
We might think of the mind as culture.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.160
And we might think of the body as nature

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.223
or the place where all the shit happens.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.073
Literally.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.850
First of all, these guys were
just so generous to do this.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.103
I just wanna thank you
and I will carry on.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.633
I will carry on.
(audience applauds)

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.160
The other week, Susan Foster,
in talking about the body,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.160
said that it's redundant
to say embodied knowledge.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.240
What she was telling us is
that knowledge is embodied.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.210
So let's not look at the body
as an object to be studied

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.253
but actually as a source for knowing.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.323
Okay, next choreographic enterprise.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.340
Everything we know comes
from our experience.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.370
We're in a continuous sensory conversation

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:18.500
with what's going on outside
of us and inside of us.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.583
Now, we might think
about the body's inside

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.760
being contained by the
membrane of the skin

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.580
or it's connection to the outside

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.910
through the membrane of the skin.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.670
But actually, as a
choreographer, I think of it

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.831
I think of the ends of our
body more as our kinosphere

00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:40.063
the space around our bodies.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.803
But if you drive a car,

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.453
which, how many of you do drive a car?

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.370
Quite a few of you.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.960
Okay, sometimes when you're in a car a lot

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.470
that car feels as though

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.743
it's the outer membrane of your body.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.360
And sometimes, in the best of times

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.600
when we're in a room together

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.860
and something happens
that we're all a part of

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.130
in which we are transformed

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.760
we feel that we are
collectively an organism

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.540
and we share a membrane of understanding

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.290
and we take what happens
in that room outside

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.943
and we affect what's going
on outside of the room.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.180
Listen, I just want to
apologize to you, now.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:31.180
Because, I'm really
sorry, I had to lie down.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.900
And I know it was the wrong thing to do.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.440
(audience titters)

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.880
But I did it for a reason,
because I'm trying to point out

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.030
the knowledge we have of the
appropriate bodily comportment

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.093
within the circumstances of a lecture.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.620
You are all admirably demonstrating

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.680
your understanding of how
it is to be in a lecture.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.093
You're sitting quietly.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.800
Most of you are looking at me.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.100
Your eyes are open.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.873
You're breathing quietly.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.530
If you've got your computer open,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.593
you're probably taking notes.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.020
So, I think that that demonstrates

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.500
that we have a shared knowledge

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.950
about what's appropriate
for being in a lecture.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.370
But just to take that a step further

00:15:24.266 --> 00:15:27.116
first of all, I'd like to,
can anybody whistle like this?

00:15:28.429 --> 00:15:29.720
(person whistles)

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.198
Okay, thank you.

00:15:31.198 --> 00:15:32.210
(audience laughs)

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.330
The next time you hear that whistle,

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:39.060
I'd like to invite
everyone here to misbehave.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.100
Now, just a couple of rules.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.730
Don't hurt yourself, don't
hurt the person next to you

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.923
and please don't wreck the property.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.340
You have 10 seconds to misbehave.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.910
When you hear the whistle the second time

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.713
please, please stop, okay?

00:15:55.649 --> 00:15:57.023
All right, ready?

00:15:59.378 --> 00:16:01.056
(person whistles)

00:16:01.056 --> 00:16:03.329
(audience clamors)

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:06.162
(audience laughs)

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:10.893
And.

00:16:12.243 --> 00:16:14.370
(person whistles)

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.530
Thank you very much.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.640
So you know what misbehavior is,

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.770
proving what the appropriate behavior is.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.870
And for those of you who refused my offer,

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.943
was there anyone who refused my offer?

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.930
Okay, well I can think of two things.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:34.930
Either you have so absorbed
the authoritative requirements

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.310
for being in a lecture,

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.340
maybe you felt that you
couldn't really misbehave.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.270
Or, and I bet it's the second.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.760
You were asked to transgress,
and you thought to yourself,

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.700
oh, the authoritative voice in the room

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.650
is asking me to transgress,

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.470
and so, if I transgress
that is not transgressing

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.930
and therefore if I sit still
(audience laughs)

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.210
and I don't transgress, then
I will be really thwarting

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.740
the appropriate behavior in the room.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.087
I see you nodding your
heads yes, so now I know.

00:17:07.087 --> 00:17:09.920
(audience laughs)

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.603
Here's my next act.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.793
We elevate some kinds of
knowledge and dismiss others.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.200
Okay.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.930
Consider the many everyday
techniques you know

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.870
and let's, for example,

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.480
think about the technique of driving.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.703
How many of you drive?

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.563
Okay, good.

00:17:33.563 --> 00:17:37.120
And we know that, uh oh. (blowing)

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.710
We know that you drive (laughing)

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.480
okay, listen, we know that
you drive very, very well

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.563
because you're here.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.630
And how many of you,
I mean, oh, nevermind.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.870
I'm not gonna ask for numbers.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:55.140
But also, most of us know
the appropriate comportment

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.210
and etiquette for eating, is that correct?

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.900
Good, so we can have dinner together.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.520
But basically, these are techniques.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.970
They are techniques
which you have perfected

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.130
or quickly, hopefully, will soon perfect

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.140
your skills in these areas.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.140
And you do that through repetition.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.280
You just do it over
and over and over again

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.973
until it begins to feel natural.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.040
So nothing actually is natural,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.930
but we have the experience of something

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.470
we've learned as being natural

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.230
when we have repeated it so often

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.240
that we no longer have to bring

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.720
an attenuated focus to every next move.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.943
We have absorbed that knowledge.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.210
As long as that's clear.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.240
When you do a headstand, by
the way, I can do a headstand

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.890
but I'm just a little
nervous to do it right now.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.339
(audience laughs)

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:04.760
But when you do a headstand
at a club or at a party

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.760
or maybe like in a lecture hall.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.703
Or at home in your living room.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.270
You are displaying technique.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.280
And you are demonstrating
a set of skills, knowledge.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.190
And when you are really, really good,

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.330
you're able to generate new ideas

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.530
within your headstanding technique.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.980
And I'll just let you
imagine what that could be.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.680
All dancers study technique,

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.930
whether in the studio or on the street.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.560
And mastery of technique

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.563
allows for freedom within that technique.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.360
But what I want to say here is technique

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.210
is not about learning movement alone.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:44.500
Not at all.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.610
When you practice a technique,

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.690
whether dancing or eating dinner,

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.530
or driving your car, or washing,

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.000
you enact a set of beliefs and values.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.920
All techniques are philosophical practices

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.433
that locate personhood and
also collective beliefs.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.533
Each technique puts us in
the world in its own way.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.803
Dancing is ephemeral.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.053
Like life.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.343
It leaves no tangible trace.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.173
It's here and gone.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:31.560
And when dancers work, their
labor leaves no object,

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.513
no commodity that can be owned or sold.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.360
Only, as in life, a visceral
memory of lives fully lived

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.993
precariously and with great love.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:51.860
If we view our bodies as things,
as objects to be studied,

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.090
controlled and subdued, then by extension,

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.760
we have a template through which

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.223
to objectify and control others.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.890
We're accustomed to thinking of power,

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.750
the dominion of some
people over other people,

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.800
some communities over other communities,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.240
nations over nations,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.130
humans over animals,
humans over the earth.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.340
And when we, in the hubris
of our own elevated status

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.820
look down at animals or other people

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.300
this reductive act diminishes knowledge

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.370
and then we call it instinct.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.693
And that enables us to kill.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.750
When we attempt to control the body,

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:42.550
to treat the body as an
object that we subdue,

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.440
which may be in part
necessary for our survival,

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.130
that same act of control

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.143
can be a form of assault
on knowledge itself.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.800
What if instead of positioning knowledge

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.760
solely as an act of the mind

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.260
a state of dominion over the body,

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.800
we considered the body
as a source of knowledge

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.363
and a way of knowing?

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.503
Thank you.

00:22:07.503 --> 00:22:08.450
(audience applauds)

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.983
- Thank you, Victoria.

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:14.373
Thank you so much, thank you.

00:22:14.373 --> 00:22:16.240
Everybody, Todd Presner.

00:22:17.116 --> 00:22:19.323
- I'm gonna grab the clicker.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.000
Thank you so much.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.800
It's really a pleasure
to be able to participate

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.870
in this experiment with you all.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.710
And thank you Victoria and
Brett, and my colleagues

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.320
for allowing me to be here
and share some thoughts.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.630
When I think about the
question, what is knowledge,

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.230
immediately I begin to proliferate

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.960
a whole set of other questions.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.640
Whose knowledge are we talking about?

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.940
Where is this knowledge,
where do we find it?

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.200
How did it become knowledge
in the first place?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.500
Who's credentialed it?

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.470
Who certified that that's
knowledge there, that's not?

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.400
Why this knowledge

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.830
as opposed to some
other kind of knowledge?

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.030
And, as someone that
works in the field of,

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.230
imagine you heard a little bit,

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.090
digital humanities is one
thing I do, I work with media,

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.400
but I'm also a historian.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.830
I work particularly on German
and German-Jewish history

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.290
and I'll get to that in a moment.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.170
But I also think about
knowledge that's varied

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.140
and silenced or submerged.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:22.780
And I wonder a lot about
knowledge that becomes lost

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.700
and what it means to find
that knowledge, to excavate it

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.970
and particularly when it comes to voices

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.570
that have been erased or obliterated

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.100
from the cultural record.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.620
That, to me, becomes a
politics of knowledge

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.850
and really, in some ways, lays
forward the ethical stakes

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.083
of the entire enterprise of
what we do at a university.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.643
Where is knowledge?

00:23:44.643 --> 00:23:46.870
Well, oftentimes we think
of things like this.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.720
Grandiose spaces, the Library of Congress,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.630
beautiful, masterful,
architectural, ornate.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.370
Reading rooms and then the
storehouses of knowledge

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:00.290
in stacks in libraries, and
they're organized in nice boxes.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.530
They're cataloged and they're
organized and classified

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.240
because knowledge is always
organized and classified.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.260
And in so far as we think
about classification systems

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.610
we realize those too are political.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.450
Well, if we go to the history
of even the word archive

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.870
we already connect it with power.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.790
It comes from the Greek term archeion.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.940
It means a house or a domicile,

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.280
but not just any domicile
or anyone's house,

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.210
but the domicile of the
superior magistrates

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.800
who are the archeions, those who command.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.840
And so knowledge is
something that's guarded.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.700
Some people have access to
it, can get into the archive,

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.910
other people do not.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.210
And that already tells me

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.950
that we have to think about the nexus

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.160
between knowledge and
power from the get-go.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.850
The Mercator projection,
1596, an amazing feat.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.280
Google maps uses it today

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.120
because it's useful for navigation.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.080
It doesn't distort in
the way other maps do.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.330
Very useful for ship
trade, ship navigation.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.600
Slave trade as well.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.080
Printing press, of course, it disseminates

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.030
knowledge to the world.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.480
But of course, it creates
a public that can read

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.780
and another public that
maybe is illiterate.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.590
We think of the scribal
tradition of writing down text

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.790
of translating them.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.240
Who's overseeing them,
what texts get translated,

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.540
what texts get lost?

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.090
Or the idea of codification
of knowledge into great books.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.370
Philosophical tradition.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.330
I read these great books
when I was in college

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.790
and I was like, oh, these
are the great books.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.350
This is knowledge, it's right there.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.183
(audience laughs)

00:25:24.183 --> 00:25:26.803
As it turns out, it's a really
small fraction of knowledge.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.620
So, I always have to think about,

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.430
knowledge is not just about
power, it's also empowerment.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.210
Because we have the ability to speak back.

00:25:38.218 --> 00:25:39.850
And you have to ask the
question, who can speak?

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.510
In what languages, in what media?

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.640
How are they credentialed, by whom?

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.310
What institutions and communities

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.890
are involved in organizing
and preserving knowledge?

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.640
And especially in so far as

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.990
we think about applications of knowledge,

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.660
how does knowledge lead to action?

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.020
What does it mean that we know something?

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.200
Do we actually act on it?

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.200
Do we do something about it?

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.850
Amazing exhibition right now
by Adrian Piper at the Hammer

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.330
that deals with exactly this issue.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.510
I work in the field of
Holocaust and genocide studies.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.010
This, obviously, it's
a deep, difficult field

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.190
in a lot of ways.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.620
But genocide, the term genocide
means the killing of a race.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.750
In German, they use the term
(speaking in foreign language)

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.370
which means annihilation.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.360
To refer to what the Nazis were gonna do

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.260
not just to the Jews, but
especially Jews and other groups

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.870
that they considered to be sub-human.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.090
It's not only about the
destruction of a people.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.120
It's also the destruction of knowledge.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.400
It's a destruction of culture.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.140
It's a destruction of society.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.600
It's the destruction of
the historical record

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.320
and that's really what's at stake

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.713
when we begin to think about
power and power over others.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.710
Hannah Arendt's a great
German-Jewish philosopher

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.440
who herself escaped Nazi Germany

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.360
wrote about the origins of
totalitarianism in 1951.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.800
About fascism, about Stalinism.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.690
She says, the goal of totalitarianism

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.550
is to see that the victim
never existed at all.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.330
And very hauntingly
quotes a survivor who says

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.710
when no witnesses are left,
there can be no testimony.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.360
Well, witness means to know.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.260
Someone who witnesses things, knows them.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.060
He or she experienced something.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.440
It's not just ocular,
not just that you saw it,

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.710
but that you experienced it.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.150
You went through something.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.290
And to testify is to
bring knowledge to others.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.030
It's to attest, it's to bear witness,

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.500
it's to provide evidence and proof.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.890
I saw this, this happened,

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.833
I was there and this is what happened.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.820
So to destroy those things
is to destroy knowledge.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.760
This is the last months of the liquidation

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.490
of the Warsaw ghetto in 1943,

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.900
before these people were
shipped out to Treblinka

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.800
where they're almost all gassed.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.770
In the archive that was
created in the Warsaw ghetto

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.810
a man named Emanuel
Ringelblum, a historian,

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.590
decided to collect documents

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.410
of what people were experiencing

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:57.110
in these horrific years of 1941, '42, '43.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.667
And he decided to know
about everyday life.

00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:01.980
What were people experiencing?

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.150
He wrote, not a single
fact should be omitted.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.570
Let the world read and know
what the murderers have done.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:08.660
What did they do with the archive?

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.770
They buried it.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.670
They buried it in the ground,

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.010
deep in the ground in metal boxes.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.180
After the war, three people survived

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.030
who know about where this archive was.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.660
They dug it up in 1946 and 1951.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.690
Only parts of it, part of it's been lost.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.360
It was in milk crates,
it was in metal boxes.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.970
And what was inside were
testimonies of people

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.550
who were themselves killed.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.550
These were their last words.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.840
These were wills, these were
letters, these were sermons,

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.790
these were newspaper clippings,

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.250
they were reports in multiple languages.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.453
But it was knowledge meant
to be shipped to the future.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.750
Shipped out of the Warsaw ghetto.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.870
And it was so precarious
because what's the chances

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.960
that anyone would survive to
actually know where it was

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.810
to dig it up and then to
recognize it as knowledge

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.310
and say, this is important,
it's worth preserving.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.840
I've been interested in this concept

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.820
of sending messages to the
future for a long time.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.330
And I'm particularly struck by the idea

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.940
of putting a message in a bottle.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.750
Like, why would you put
a message in a bottle?

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.010
Like, where are you sending it to,

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.880
especially if you don't know
you're ever gonna survive?

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.730
A woman from Ravensbruck, a
women's concentration camp

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.810
who made art and buried it in a bottle

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.250
that was only dug up years later.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.900
Or a sketchbook,
amazingly, from Auschwitz.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.340
Found in a bottle in 1947.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.440
We don't have photographs from Auschwitz.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.670
We have these sketches, we
don't know who made them.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.720
We'd have no idea, they're not signed.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.970
And yet, they bear witness
to people being exterminated

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.563
almost in a photographic-like way.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.800
I'm haunted to think more, as
I think about this question,

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.980
I've been thinking a
lot more comparatively

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.620
beyond my field of Holocaust
and genocide studies,

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.020
and begin to think about
what messages in bottles

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:51.853
have never been found?

00:29:51.853 --> 00:29:54.130
What about that other milk
crate that was also buried

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.360
in the Warsaw ghetto?

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.210
It's never been found.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.310
We don't know where it is.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:00.270
What messages and what
knowledge, what witnesses,

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.463
what lives are contained in it?

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.080
Well, think about it this way.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.453
This is the history of slavery
told through slave ships.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.407
What you see running there
is an amazing database

00:30:14.407 --> 00:30:17.900
presented by a number of collaborators

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.010
across the world, at Emory University

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.940
detailing slave ships coming
from West Coast of Africa

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.680
to the Americas, to Brazil, to Jamaica,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.010
to Cuba, to North America.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.130
It details hundreds of years.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.900
Each dot is a slave ship.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.490
Each dot represents somewhere
between 300 and 500 slaves.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.420
Where are their messages, their voices?

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.320
Who bears witness to them?

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.880
How do we begin to excavate
the submerged knowledge?

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.740
This question, to me,
is a very profound one

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.400
as we begin to think about
the historical record.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.130
Most of the time what we
have in the historical record

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.820
are the documents of the perpetrators.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.250
We have the documents
of the legal decisions

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.010
about particular things that happened.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.370
We have the charters of the ships,

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:11.510
we have the records of
how many slaves were taken

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.470
how many died in the Middle
Passage and how many arrived

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.650
and where they were enslaved.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.230
We have their ages, we have their gender.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.230
We often don't even have their names.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.140
This particular report is very important

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.130
because it's the Zong slave ship

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:31.820
which, the owners of the ship,
in the course of the journey

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.540
threw overboard 150 slaves

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.380
and then decided that
they had lost their cargo

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.660
and made a claim against their
insurers to be compensated.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.380
The only record of this
is the historical record

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.860
the legal documents that
was produced in this debate.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.330
We know nothing of the people.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.253
Again, submerged voices,
submerged witnesses.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.320
Toni Morrison, I think, is
someone who begins to think

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.610
about how literary and historical
knowledge can go together.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.960
And one thinks about the
millions of people that she says,

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.220
disappear without a trace

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.590
because they never arrive safely onshore.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.770
It's like a whole nation
that's under the sea.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.610
Her approach is to think
about literary knowledge.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:15.000
How does literary knowledge
complement historical knowledge?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.430
How can literature, poetic thinking,

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.500
and ways of looking at the archive

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.300
bring a truth or shed a light

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.180
on people that were
destroyed, who have no voices?

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.850
Who had no archive?

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:30.073
She says only an act of the
imagination can help me.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.710
Her idea of only an
act of the imagination,

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.320
this is not fictionalizing
in the sense of making it up.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.070
But of adding to the historical record

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.163
in order to show the
silences that exist there.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.540
My last example is a poet who makes use

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:51.190
particularly of the Zong
case, NourbeSe Philip.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:55.040
Extraordinary book of
poems that came out in 2007

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.760
where she takes that legal
report that I showed you earlier

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.750
this report, here, and
takes apart the words

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.360
pries apart the language
in order to look for

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.460
not only the ways in which
language is connected to power

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.550
but also those voices, the
people that have been left out.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.650
She says in here, it's
really quite amazing,

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:13.773
it's a reference.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.710
Our fellow creatures may
become the subject of property.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.690
This, therefore, was a
throwing overboard of goods

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.670
and part of it was to save the residue.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.690
Why they threw the slaves overboard.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.180
They were essentially goods, like wood

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.040
is what that report says.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.360
She takes these words and rewrites them.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.230
She takes them, they kind of are submerged

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.570
some of them come forward,
some come backwards,

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:38.390
some of them are rewritten.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:42.220
But in every case, it's
to bring poetic knowledge

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.010
to show the absences in
the historical record.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.260
I'll leave you with a
quote from NourbeSe Philip

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.000
because I think it's so telling.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.580
There's no telling the story.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.850
In fact, the story can't be recovered.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.220
But it must be told.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.860
There's paradox, right, there's tension

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.100
of it can't be told, it must be told.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.240
Zong, her book about this
slave ship, bears witness

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.740
to the resurfacing of the
drowned and the oppressed.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.220
Transform this desiccated, legal report

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.770
into a cacophony of voices,
wails, cries, moans and shouts

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.290
that had earlier been
banned from the text.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.234
This, I think, is really the
ethical stakes of knowledge.

00:34:17.234 --> 00:34:18.611
Thank you.

00:34:18.611 --> 00:34:20.556
(audience applauds)

00:34:20.556 --> 00:34:22.417
- Thanks, Todd.

00:34:22.417 --> 00:34:23.750
Thank you, Todd.

00:34:28.036 --> 00:34:30.420
Thanks so much, everybody,
Marcelo Suarez-Orozco.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.213
- Thank you so much, thank you.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.880
Thank you, Brett for inviting me

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.880
and thank you to my
colleagues here at the stage

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.640
and my colleagues in the audience

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.563
and I look forward really
more to the conversation.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.950
I have a few reflections

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:57.933
that flow from the work of our colleagues.

00:34:59.462 --> 00:35:02.723
I just wanna enumerate them in order.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:07.400
Brett, you started us with knowledge

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.253
and its unique attributes.

00:35:11.468 --> 00:35:13.280
I was thinking as you were speaking

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.280
that perhaps what is uniquely
human is the accumulation

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.673
and the accumulated
transmission of knowledge

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:29.113
as perhaps one of the
uniquely human attributes.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.320
We don't have to reinvent

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.043
the grammar of the French language.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.860
Once it's articulated

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.860
it has a life that is transgenerational.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.720
So the accumulation of knowledge,

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.970
we'll get to the question of what that is,

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:55.480
may be a uniquely human attribute.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.150
I think perhaps another
uniquely human capacity

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:01.530
I was reflecting upon
your comments, Brett,

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.380
had to do with your reflection on

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.670
how do we know that we know something?

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.760
And that of course speaks to something

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.760
that may be the jewel in crown.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:23.870
What cognitive neuroscientists
call the metacognitive.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.310
The so-called executive function

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.740
of the central nervous system.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.740
This, again, may be uniquely
human capacity to reflect upon

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.880
our knowing.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.473
The so-called metacognitive architecture

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:50.370
that is so much a part of
who we are as a species.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:00.840
Victoria, your work with
the body, it's so amazing.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.040
And of course, the body knows.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.040
Pascal has a beautiful line when he says,

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.100
and I think he means more
broadly, he has a line,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:16.100
the heart knows a reason for
which reason has no reason.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:22.500
There are ways the body
knows that our other that

00:37:24.441 --> 00:37:29.441
the binary logic of the
Cartesian sort-of world

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:35.690
of mind and body, culture, nature.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:40.690
So, I applaud you for reminding us

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.940
how much of the human
experience and human evolution

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:50.110
is the work the body does

00:37:52.515 --> 00:37:55.993
in terms of our orientation to the world.

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:03.370
Todd, of course, I was very
moved by your reflections

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:08.220
and this, I think, is why acknowledgement

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.210
and the politics of acknowledgement

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:15.710
becomes so central to the endeavors

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.380
to heal the extraordinary damage

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.240
human beings can do to each other.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.590
And think of the Truth and
Reconciliation committees

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.520
in South Africa, in Latin America,

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.298
in so many parts of the
world, where, of course.

00:38:32.298 --> 00:38:34.622
Elaine Scarry has a beautiful line

00:38:34.622 --> 00:38:38.000
in her book The Body in Pain on torture.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.220
She says, of course, in torture,

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.120
the pain can't be represented.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.670
We don't have language, it is unknowable,

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:44.620
the pain of others.

00:38:45.776 --> 00:38:47.160
Not unlike what Adorno said

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.663
about the truth is buried in the ashes.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.820
We can endeavor to excavate
it but it's a very incomplete

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.840
and very imperfect.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.140
So knowledge and
acknowledgement are so central

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:05.260
to the work of suffering
in the human condition.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.290
So these are some
reflections to my comments

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:15.310
to my colleagues in the
spirit of conversation.

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:16.643
So, knowledge, knowledge, how do we know?

00:39:18.033 --> 00:39:20.330
I'll start, wear my hat here

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:21.610
as the Dean of the Graduate School

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:25.590
of Education and
Information Studies at UCLA

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:28.200
and I'll start with the following claim

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.760
that knowledge is dangerous
and proceed with caution

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.520
when you're dealing with knowledge.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.660
But let me make this claim.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:39.990
It is a fundamental pillar of,

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.580
let's put it very broadly, civilization.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.330
The great H. G. Wells, 150 years ago, said

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:51.330
history now is a race between
education and catastrophe.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.730
Well, if you know something,

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:58.080
you know who's winning that race today.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.730
(audience laughs)

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:03.240
Knowledge is a fundamental pillar

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.303
of democracy, of civilization.

00:40:05.303 --> 00:40:07.770
This is why the great John Dewey,

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.540
in his book Democracy and Education,

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.570
puts education, puts the knowing citizen

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.920
at the center of the work of democracy.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.920
And prophetically, Dewey
says, the work of democracy

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.600
is the work that each
generation needs to renew.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.600
And it's renewed through,
in his wisdom, education.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.780
His main argument is education is not

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:40.310
a preparation for life.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.210
Education is life, and democracy lives

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.010
in the work education does for all of us.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:50.420
So this is sort of the first
broad claim about knowledge.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:55.420
A pillar for, especially,
again, as Brett got us started,

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:02.990
in the current world where
knowledge and facts and reality

00:41:07.291 --> 00:41:11.410
are contested in the most
savage, sort of fundamental ways

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:14.140
where language is kidnapped from us

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.410
and all the shared understandings
that are fundamental

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:21.567
to the work of knowledge are ephemeral.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.470
Now, more formally, when
we think about knowledge

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.120
of course, and this is something

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.120
that Victoria articulated
for us, we think in terms of

00:41:36.312 --> 00:41:41.312
knowledge is cognition, knowledge.

00:41:43.593 --> 00:41:45.550
(speaking in foreign language)

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:48.200
These are all cognate words.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.000
And they flow from two separate

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.670
sort of very basic constitutive units.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:57.710
One is experience and familiarity.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:02.283
The habits that the body knows
often better than the mind.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.450
This is what the great William James

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:10.440
called experience near knowledge.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.890
The knowledge that comes from the habit.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:17.870
Knowledge is a cognate
word of familiarity also.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:22.340
Is that which comes to
us as a way of knowing

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.320
that is familiar, that
we are at ease with.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.420
So that's one of the ways

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:34.327
of entering an approach to knowledge.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.363
What I think you called natural knowing.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.837
Of course, we are in the university,

00:42:42.837 --> 00:42:47.360
and the university is in the
business of what we will call

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.260
ways of knowing that are organized

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.680
and they tend to be organized
into the disciplines.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.680
We had a brilliant discussion by Todd

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:05.600
that very much flows from the architecture

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.400
of a set of disciplinary understandings

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.032
that are shared, they're common,

00:43:11.032 --> 00:43:13.000
they're habits that we form.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.800
And in a university,
knowledge tends to live

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.923
in disciplinary habitats.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.760
We have historical ways of knowing.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.403
Geographical ways of knowing.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.810
Philosophical ways of knowing.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:36.180
Architectural ways of
knowing, and the like.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.930
Immediately, something very
fascinating begins to happen

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:44.670
which is, there is a reason why
knowledge over the centuries

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.510
became organized around systems

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.670
that we come to call disciplines.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.250
And that is, what happens

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:56.483
where the disciplines come to converse?

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:03.353
What happens when, before
I joined the dark side

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:11.160
and I became an administrator,
I was a regular academic.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.160
I was a regular scholar
who did regular research

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.630
and wrote regular books and articles.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.720
And that lives very much
within disciplinary traditions.

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.850
But what's very interesting today,

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.150
and I think it's been
very interesting really

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:31.170
since the beginning of the
organization of disciplines

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:35.410
is the idea of interdisciplinary work.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:38.920
Work that spills over
and can't be contained.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.340
And the work that
interdisciplinarity does for us

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.800
is in many ways comes full circle

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.190
to the issue of familiarity.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:54.190
Because interdisciplinary
work fundamentally interrupts

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:58.750
the taken for granted, familial practices

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:03.750
that come to colonize disciplinary work.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.920
If you're a psychologist,
psychologists have a handshake.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.460
I've been married to a
psychologist for 42 years.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.960
I think finally I discovered
what their secret handshake is.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.727
They have secret rituals,
they have secret knowledge.

00:45:20.727 --> 00:45:25.727
They practice their discourse
in very exotic journals.

00:45:28.877 --> 00:45:32.110
(audience laughs)

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.910
They read each other's journals.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:36.150
It's almost like the secret societies

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.160
of the Ourunta or Orunda.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:44.160
And what's very fascinating
is the approach and avoidance

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.130
that comes with our endeavors

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:52.910
to work within disciplinary
bodies of knowledge,

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:56.550
ways of knowing and the
kinds of disruptions

00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:01.550
that come with a conversation
between disciplines.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.010
I'm gonna take three minutes to show you

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.470
representations of a domain of scholarship

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.700
which is the area of
work where I'm engaged in

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:18.700
which is the study of the
mass movements of people.

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.890
And what I'd like to show
you is representations.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:26.060
These are bodies of knowledge

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.730
that have become instantly recognized.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:33.000
This is something that every
demographer in the galaxy

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.993
including the ones they're
gonna find in Mars now

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:40.670
will recognize immediately
as a body of knowledge

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:42.510
about, this is the world,

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:46.893
and this is where people originate.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:52.880
Three or four issues that
dominate the movement of people

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.470
in the 21st century.

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:58.410
All continents are
involved in sending people,

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:01.253
what we call emigration, transit,

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:05.260
immigration and return migration.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.483
So here you have the world as represented.

00:47:10.555 --> 00:47:13.897
It's a bit orderly, more obvious

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:20.190
for you to sort of reflect upon

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.570
what's going on in the world.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:28.260
Asia is the epicenter of
the movement of people.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.800
Asia is the epicenter of
everything in the 21st century.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.480
So, I you think you have a
caravan coming to your country

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.270
that's not really where the action is.

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:40.860
(audience laughs)

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:45.240
I hate to tell you,
you can Tweet that one.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.640
That's not where the action.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.440
Maybe you know who, Caligula
could respond to that.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.330
And this is another representation.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:55.830
This falls very much

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:58.750
within the domain of the social sciences.

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:01.453
This to me represents why people migrate.

00:48:03.594 --> 00:48:05.810
My definition of migration
is an ethical act

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:08.707
of and for the family,
and it's love and work.

00:48:08.707 --> 00:48:13.707
It's a migration, it's an
act of love for the family

00:48:14.547 --> 00:48:18.120
and so love and work are the
main drivers of migration.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.670
I think that this, in a way, captures,

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.760
as a kind of, this is monumental art,

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:28.760
this is a beautiful sculptural
representation of that.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.730
And this, to me, represents
the problematique

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:34.400
of the 21st century.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.675
This is, do we know what this it?

00:48:38.675 --> 00:48:39.508
(audience murmuring)

00:48:39.508 --> 00:48:40.341
What is this?

00:48:40.341 --> 00:48:41.284
- The Guernica.
- The Guernica.

00:48:41.284 --> 00:48:43.053
What is Guernica?

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:45.603
- War.
- Anti-war painting.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.480
- The Spanish Civil War, the Guernica.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.980
This is a Picasso.

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:51.813
Where did it hang?

00:48:51.813 --> 00:48:54.240
This hang in the U.N. for many years

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.610
until Franco died, because Picasso

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:59.860
wouldn't let it be back in Spain.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.580
Now it's in the Reina Sofia.

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.130
It's very spectacular.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:05.900
And here we bear witness
to war and terror.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.550
This is what's driving the
movement of people today.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:12.950
If you don't understand what's
going on miles from here.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.810
The people are escaping war

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:17.470
and terror and environmental collapse.

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.470
So the Guernica, to me,

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.050
really the most fundamental representation

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:27.050
as a kind of a bear witness
of the horror of war.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:33.850
Todd, Franco allowed
Luftwaffe, the German air force

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:36.823
to bomb Guernica.

00:49:37.924 --> 00:49:42.190
Franco was Galician, and
Guernica's in the Basque Country.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:46.100
Orozco's a Basque name, I'm
Basque, I'm part Basque.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.923
And he allowed the Germans
to do practice runs.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.400
So this was just practice,
this wasn't real war.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:57.400
So this was the destruction of
a town, the town of Guernica.

00:49:57.518 --> 00:50:02.460
And of course it has the
horror and representability

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:05.960
this unspeakable of the horror of the war.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.230
The bull, of course,
is us, is the witness.

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:14.580
Because we need to bear
witness to the destruction

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.943
that human beings are capable.

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.543
We are wolf, man is wolf to man,

00:50:25.543 --> 00:50:29.563
is a line in Hobbes I think in essay.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:35.490
So these, in a way, give you

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:39.520
a kind of artistic representations

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.672
of the movements of people.

00:50:41.672 --> 00:50:45.160
Why people have to leave,

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:49.870
why people come to new destinations.

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:54.870
And this falls more within the
realm of the social sciences

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:00.597
the demographics, cultural geography

00:51:00.597 --> 00:51:03.880
and the disciplines that
are so well represented

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:10.400
in the scholarly study of
the mass movements of people.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:17.660
Ways of knowing are incomplete.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:22.660
Ways of knowing are in fundamental ways

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.370
deconstructed and reconstructed.

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:30.540
And it is fundamentally
impossible to separate

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:37.080
broadly speaking what we call
the scientific ways of knowing

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:43.300
and the artistic ways of knowing,

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.730
the humanistic ways of knowing.

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:48.570
And I think that these
representations of knowledge

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.440
about this very defining
issue in our world today

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:56.820
tell the story of the
partial ways we endeavor

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.390
to through knowledge approximate

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:02.280
and model the world we live in,

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.320
our experiences as a species

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:10.320
and our ambitions as a
moral creature in the world.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:12.449
Thank you.

00:52:12.449 --> 00:52:14.030
(audience applauds)

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.380
- Thank you, Marcelo.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.850
Marcelo, thank you so much.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:21.000
And our final presentation,
Kristy Edmunds.

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:24.050
- Okay, wow.

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:25.930
I just gotta say that, right now.

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:27.733
Wow, wow, triple wow.

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:32.460
A few things in terms
of my ways of knowing

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.780
is that I'm going to throw
out a lot of what it was

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.587
that I thought I was going to say.

00:52:36.587 --> 00:52:38.950
(audience laughs)

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:43.120
So that I can connect a way of
knowing what I'm experiencing

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.820
to what you might be experiencing.

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:47.920
So, I just wanna talk to the students

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.440
and obviously the public a little bit.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:53.793
But let me ask a few sequenced
kind of questions, okay?

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:59.520
You can raise your hands, these
are kind of bifurcated or's.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:04.230
Information or facts?

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:06.210
Information, hands up.

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:07.870
That you value more.

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:08.703
Facts.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.443
Facts or data?

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.363
Facts.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.060
Data.

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.690
Oh, data's pulling ahead.

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:22.710
Information or experience?

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:23.613
Information.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.393
Experience.

00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:31.501
Do you guys love this, aren't I a genius?

00:53:31.501 --> 00:53:34.210
(audience laughs)

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:36.000
Knowledge or skills?

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.630
Knowledge.

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:38.463
Skills.

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:43.653
Skills or wisdom?

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.983
Skills, wisdom, how are
y'all gonna get there?

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.513
Perception or knowledge?

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:56.893
Perception.

00:53:58.810 --> 00:53:59.643
Knowledge.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.653
Knowledge or wisdom?

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:06.833
Knowledge.

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:09.780
Wisdom.

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.913
Wisdom wins again.

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.997
Food or air?

00:54:13.997 --> 00:54:16.150
(audience laughs)

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:17.160
Food.

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:17.993
Air.

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:20.013
Okay.

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.390
High levels of interdependency
across all that terminology.

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:25.223
Right?

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:31.130
Total, utter interdependency.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.160
How data might move to information,

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.300
and information to
fictions, fictions to facts,

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.920
fictions to consciousness,
fictions to lies,

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.760
lies to truths, truths to knowledge.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.760
Whose knowledge, whose truth, whose lie?

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.750
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.770
So everything that we were talking about

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.163
around what is experienced.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.260
Lived experienced is a body of knowledge

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:57.860
that lives in our body

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:02.090
through every sensory apparatus
that we possibly have.

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:04.520
So when I was first
thinking about how do I,

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.033
I haven't even talked about
what I do, I'm sorry about that.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.440
Part of what I've been thinking about

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.900
amongst the true and utter
challenge of trying to figure out

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:16.070
how to, do you define
it, do you explore it,

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:17.540
do you noodle with it.

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:19.290
I've been doing all that for weeks.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.210
But to me, one of the the things

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:23.770
that's really critically,
critically, critically important

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:25.880
is what you guys just did.

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.450
You put your hands up by the mass majority

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:32.733
around the idea of wisdom
as the thing you value most.

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:35.890
And yet, human history,

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:39.450
as has been demonstrated
here by quite a bit,

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:43.270
my question is often, not
so much what is knowledge

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.773
but what is it that we do with it.

00:55:46.658 --> 00:55:49.360
And in the doing of
that is all other kinds

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.160
of other words in the vernacular
and so on and so forth.

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:58.550
What we do with it and
what we hope to do with it

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:02.430
probably has some leaning
towards how do we acquire wisdom.

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:05.940
Wisdom through knowledge and consciousness

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.580
and the body and the mind

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:10.610
and every other interdependent
system that we possibly have

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:14.990
is utterly, utterly, utterly independent.

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:18.130
And consciousness to me is
one of the single pieces

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:19.680
of what I do professionally

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.630
with working with artists as a curator.

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.520
So I wanted to just back up quickly

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.830
because I've been thinking of this project

00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:29.000
and this topic and this discussion.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.860
For me, I think about,
what is the knowledge

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:38.083
that I have, because it was gifted?

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:43.180
And a gift can be learned
or earned, but it's a gift.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.070
An education, benevolent, infrastructure.

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:49.450
So on and so forth, the people,
the family, the influencers.

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.950
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:54.300
What is the knowledge that
I have that was given to me?

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.973
Someone cared enough to
transmit that knowledge.

00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:02.320
What is the knowledge that
I sought out and found?

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.670
What did I pursue to know?

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:08.280
Which is something else
in another kind of way.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.050
And what is the knowledge that I now have

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:11.833
that's even worth passing on?

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.803
What will I transmit?

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:17.520
I have to say, honestly,

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.400
that as a curator and artistic director,

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.870
I have worked, I have probably
learned not everything

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:25.480
I don't want to make a
sweeping generalization,

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:30.070
but I have probably learned
almost everything that I know

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:33.470
through the avenues of the arts.

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:37.370
From very early age, with
my mother, my grandmother,

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:39.237
various other people, all the way up.

00:57:39.237 --> 00:57:41.980
And the reason is because in the arts

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:45.280
the outcomes are unknown,
they're not locked and fixed

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.730
and the burning thing that runs across it

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:51.480
is a passionate life that
is seeking to find form

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.030
and continuously asking
certain kinds of questions.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:58.420
The question that I think, no
matter what discipline it is

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.150
whatever, whether it's
visual, practice, cinema,

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:05.560
whether it's design media,
choreography, theater,

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.930
storytelling, poetry,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:10.360
The question that an artist asks

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.340
and logs gazillions of hours in the asking

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.083
is a question of whereto from here?

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.440
How to proceed, how best to proceed.

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.220
At a micro level, how
do I cross the stage.

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:27.670
Whereto from here in
a choreographic realm,

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:28.883
in time and space.

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.490
In theater, what line next?

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:33.890
What words next?

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:38.180
In writing, the pen on the
page, whereto from here?

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:41.050
Architecture, et cetera, et cetera.

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:44.716
The question is asked,
the question is practiced.

00:58:44.716 --> 00:58:47.620
And it leads to a body of knowledge

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:51.260
that continuously opens the
door for more questions.

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:54.210
And of course artists
are involved quite deeply

00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:56.520
in the question at a very
small, molecular level

00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.920
like I was describing.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:02.090
But it's also a question
that is very meta about us.

00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:03.600
Whereto from here?

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.600
How best to proceed?

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.050
How to proceed?

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:09.840
In what form, in what way?

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:13.790
And my job as a curator is
literally to work with artists

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:17.760
in all different mediums
where their imaginative,

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.232
passionate, and hyper-knowledgeable

00:59:20.232 --> 00:59:23.560
mind/body/soul/spirit
consciousness is asking

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.310
a bunch of these questions.

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:28.100
And I'm entrusted with it
at it's most vulnerable.

00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.560
The trust piece is an acknowledgement,

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.280
acknowledge, knowledge.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.910
The trust piece is how do
I share a vulnerable idea

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.070
in order to get it out there in a way

00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:45.530
that others can co-mingle
and collaborate with it,

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:48.513
amplify, push me in different
kinds of directions,

00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:52.483
and then find form, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.580
So, to me, almost every
form of artistic knowledge

00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:58.670
that I've ever encountered

00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:00.610
is the knowledge proposition

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:04.250
around knowledge exchanged as a gift.

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:08.260
And that the gift in a society
is something that forces us

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.530
also in this era know
a lot about economics.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:13.133
Right, shall we say?

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.068
Artists, because the
outcome is not always known,

01:00:17.068 --> 01:00:19.600
it can't always be collected,

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.080
it can't be turned into a commodity.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.313
Art is a gift, that artists
who endeavor to make it,

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.970
are utilizing every
system sensory knowledge

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.830
plus training, plus
skill, plus, plus, plus

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:33.950
to find an avenue through which

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:37.170
to keep the potency of that
knowledge, a.k.a. a gift,

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:40.470
whether it's signs or symbols
or whatever, in motion.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:43.950
Because when we keep our gift in motion

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.193
it continues to accrue power.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.850
So I have a quick story that
I want to describe to you

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:52.470
because I think it goes partially

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:55.580
to why I work in this particular way

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.863
and then I'll wrap it up.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.150
And I have to kind of read
my sequences through it

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:01.700
but it has to do with.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.810
How many of you know in
Native Plains-related,

01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:07.620
Lakota, Nokota, Dakota,

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.980
Native American
traditions, the peace pipe?

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.780
Do you know what it is?

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.720
Okay, so a peace pipe,
in its raw materials

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.250
is not a super elaborate thing.

01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:20.970
But what its job is, inside of a tribe,

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:22.197
is that it's bestowed to a Chief.

01:01:22.197 --> 01:01:26.440
And the Chief, in the
tradition, holds the peace pipe

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.360
and in that peace pipe, it's brought out

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.650
at the most significant moments,
conflicts and difficulties

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:33.153
across the tribal system.

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:37.330
It is a point of reference,
stories are told,

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:40.520
music is played, song lines
are song, et cetera, et cetera.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.140
And the peace pipe being present

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:45.690
is imbued with cultural knowledge.

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:49.190
The person who protects
that knowledge is the Chief

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:52.750
because the knowledge has
to then be retained, shared,

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.540
and it's imbued in a person
who has the discernment

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.150
and consciousness and capacity to care

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:01.650
for more than themselves
to carry that through.

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:03.910
And it's passed across
generation to generation,

01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:05.760
generation, generation down the line.

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:09.300
So at the point that
knowledge, in this case,

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.730
living in this pipe, gets
changed fundamentally

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.880
and permanently from what it is

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.910
is the moment that another
system comes towards it

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:22.563
in this case, they system
of commodity, and it's sold.

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:25.890
Those peace pipes, in different tribes,

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:28.980
were eventually sold for
access to reservation land

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.560
without death after carnage.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.580
But this is the kind of gift
that you can only sell one time

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.940
because after that, it loses
all of its knowledge power,

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:44.120
its cultural trust and
what it's imbued to do

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.653
across generational time.

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:50.290
It becomes a commodity and from that point

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:54.000
the raw materials later
on, in a commodity market,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.120
mean that the Native people

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.070
will make a whole bunch
of small peace pipes

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:01.090
and sell them through a commodity

01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:02.980
at the market, at the blanket,

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.090
at the trinket hawking of the wares.

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:09.300
The monetary system takes
over the gift system

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.770
in this instance.

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:14.430
And the knowledge exchange is denied

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:16.730
to the person of the
acquisition through money

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.163
from the person who
actually carries wisdom.

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:25.650
But there's a cultural reality also

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:28.240
in terms of what I was
describing around the arts.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.690
And this is why I work in it.

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:33.680
If an artist decides to
take that peace pipe now

01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:36.810
and imbue it with the aesthetic integrity

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:38.970
of finding form and meaning and value

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.550
and labors with skill and intentionality

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:46.700
and care and imaginative
realms, and manifests that now

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:49.050
disconnected from its original history

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:53.950
it now accrues again the
knowledge, again the possibility

01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:57.540
and again the value of becoming a gift.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.660
A gift that from that point
forward stays in motion

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.550
in service to cultural knowledge.

01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:07.890
The arts are a cultural
asset and resource.

01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:11.800
And how we exchange our
knowledge can be provoking

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.530
can be widely, widely received.

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:16.830
It can be experimental and contortionist

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:19.180
and it can be a variety of other things.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.680
But what it says is,

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.270
the vulnerability of
my pursuits in thought

01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:25.600
and idea and knowledge

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.520
I seek to manifest in the form of a gift

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.740
that it will awaken a
perceptional capacity

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:34.513
within your knowledge and
therefore we collaborate.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:37.220
Thank you.

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:40.486
(audience applauds)

01:04:40.486 --> 01:04:42.040
- Thank you.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.850
Thank you, and all four of you,

01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:45.843
thank you so much for those presentations.

01:04:45.843 --> 01:04:48.040
I think as Vic suggested at the beginning

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.610
let's stand up, take 90 seconds,

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:52.220
if you want to jump around
and shake it out for a minute

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.670
lean over to a neighbor, do that.

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:55.500
We'll do the same up here
and we'll be back online

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.120
in about a minute and a half.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.630
Thank you everybody so much.

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:01.710
Those were just such terrific,
terrific presentations

01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:02.543
each on their own.

01:05:02.543 --> 01:05:06.460
I think I want to first
turn to the four of you.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.840
Having listened now to
the other three are there,

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.880
what I really appreciate
is the extent to which

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.640
you were acknowledging and aware of things

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.813
already being spoken of
here on the sofa and stage.

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.950
Now standing back from
it a few minutes later

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:25.190
any thoughts about unexpected convergence,

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:30.190
coincidence, or ignorance of ideas

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.340
beyond the ones you might
have been thinking about?

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.173
Any thought?

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:39.993
- Well, maybe I could jump in with.

01:05:41.573 --> 01:05:43.673
I started to say this to you a moment ago.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.090
There seems to be a convergence

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:49.450
or an opportunity for us to think about

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.923
education and the university
and this notion of a gift.

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:58.903
So on the one hand,

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:03.300
while we're a land-grant
public university,

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:08.300
we have a tuition, students
have tuition that they pay

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:12.290
in order to learn, in order
to have access to knowledge.

01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:16.560
But on the other hand,
this passage of knowledge

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.850
this sort of firmly-held beliefs

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:24.043
in the value of what we
have learned is a gift.

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:28.503
And I think oftentimes
it's given as a gift.

01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:33.560
So I wonder if we could
just talk a little bit about

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:38.000
the balance between education
becoming a commodity

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.137
and education as a gift.

01:06:41.137 --> 01:06:42.400
And I think that probably

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.190
you all have a lot to say about this too

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:45.863
but maybe we could start up here.

01:06:51.059 --> 01:06:56.059
- Who has to start?
(laughing)

01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:00.893
- Okay, ladies first.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:08.080
I often think and reflect
on the fact of education

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:13.740
me through, my mother was born
on the Indian reservation,

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.463
I was born not far from there.

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:18.490
The kind of ability to climb

01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:19.970
and do different kinds of things

01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:23.640
and have facility or
flexibility or fluidity

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.280
in a broader world due to
education, public education.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.670
So for me, I always think
of it from the perspective

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:34.400
of an infrastructure that
was put into practice

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:39.360
that it means that future generations.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.840
I'm cognizant of the fact that someone

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.610
or a series of someones
took a benevolent interest

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:47.960
in the fact that I would
have access to an education.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.830
I am also the kind of person who thinks

01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:51.720
when I'm driving on roads of the people

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.250
who worked their asses
off to build these things

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.480
in the hot sun, et cetera, et cetera.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.623
I think of these shared
spaces and I think of them.

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.290
Hugely, the consciousness to acknowledge

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.840
that the efforts, the
knowledge, the skills, the labor

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.840
the practices of others
make a framework possible

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.680
for how I am able to stand within.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.680
And that, to me, is the gift of education,

01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:23.570
in a certain kind of way.

01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:27.780
And the warning in it
is that we feel possibly

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.400
only thinking of its value

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.220
in terms of what the
investment monetarily is.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.913
And that piece is a
deep, deep provocation.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.160
If an educational system turns itself

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.630
into a commodity-based market,

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:49.970
then the gift of the sense
of public intellectualism

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:52.160
and sharing and stretching and striving,

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.730
having your soul stretched,
your life stretched,

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:57.923
your means stretched, changes.

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.030
It's the same working in the arts.

01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:08.990
When people will say, please
curate and put on stage

01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:12.710
that which is most popular so
that the tickets will sell out

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:15.970
so that there will be a resource
platform inside of there

01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:18.130
which isn't looking at the
scholarship of the form

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:18.963
or things like that.

01:09:18.963 --> 01:09:21.350
It's like, I have Sweet Honey in the Rock

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:23.350
in the house at Royce Hall right now.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:25.010
They're rehearsing, they're vocalizing,

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:26.830
they've been through the
Civil Rights Movement,

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:29.210
they're the soundtrack of an entire set

01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:30.663
of multiple generations.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.073
They are not there for the paycheck.

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.850
The paycheck is a resource

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:40.220
that keeps the gift of
their song in motion

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.020
so that they can do the deep work

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.790
of continuing to provoke the
song lines of civil rights,

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:47.830
how they merge with hip hop now,

01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:49.220
and how they, as a group of women,

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.180
stand in the power of their bodies

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:54.500
to make meaning manifest amongst strangers

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.670
so that we have collaborative lines

01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:00.973
of relationship with on another
in secular time and space.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.583
That's part of an education here.

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:08.800
Okay, I talked long enough.

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:14.140
- If I may, Victoria,
think your invitation

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:19.830
is a very good point of entry

01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:24.830
into the models that flow
from the logic of the market

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.710
which really fundamentally forms consumers

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:40.600
to the ethic of the gift, the
ethic of giving and receiving

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:50.687
of forming that is what
animates the work of education

01:10:57.507 --> 01:11:01.030
and the work of knowledge.

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:03.730
So you have very different points of entry

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:08.550
and very different destinations
when the logic of the market

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:13.550
becomes the driver of how
we think about education.

01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:18.950
The work of education, this
is why I started with Dewey,

01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:22.183
is really the work of citizenship.

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:30.340
When the Greeks first imagined

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:35.120
what we know would recognize
as formal education systems

01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:41.410
it's very fascinating because
the nexus to the market

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:47.360
and to the labor force was
very low in the thinking

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:50.660
of what are the purposes of education.

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:54.120
The Greeks imagine
education in the context

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.830
of the idea of the eudaimonic flourishing

01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:03.073
of human potential to
its maximum capacity.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.470
In the formative moment,

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:11.150
when education becomes a public good

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:19.320
when societies arrive at the
moment where public education

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:24.760
becomes a normative ideal the world over

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:32.960
the spirit animating that movement

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.220
was the spirit of
citizens, of citizenship.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:39.430
And it was in fact, in the context

01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:44.430
of the last previous
wave of mass migration,

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:49.640
when public education became
an instrument of the state

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.880
to create shared experiences,

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.440
to create common bonds in the citizens

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.790
that were arriving in our case.

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:04.263
And we can talk about Germany
as a different sort of model.

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:10.570
But in a society of consent,
like the United States,

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:12.250
what do we have in common?

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.780
And then it's education, it's citizenship,

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.780
it's the point of entry
into the public sphere.

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:24.350
And it's interesting that in the moment

01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:26.140
when public education

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.308
becomes a normative idea the world over

01:13:29.308 --> 01:13:32.920
the fundamental debates

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.283
where driven by philosophical
claims on our limits.

01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:42.150
In Europe, Durkheim became the
first professor of pedagogy.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.193
- [Kristy] You're gonna have to get him

01:13:43.193 --> 01:13:45.713
on next week's thing,
what is a university.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.120
- The first professor of
pedagogy is Emile Durkheim

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.100
who is maybe one of the fathers

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:56.280
certainly of French sociology,
sociology more broadly.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.490
If you look at the
evolution, and in our country

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:03.693
it was, of course, James, Dewey.

01:14:05.887 --> 01:14:09.540
In Italy, it was Maria Montessori.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.670
In South America was
the great Paulo Freire.

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:17.670
The idea was the nexus between
the individual and society.

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.520
This is Durkheim's famous formulation.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.100
50 years, you fast-forward,

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.280
this is 100, 150 years ago, I think.

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.450
Durkheim takes a chair in
pedagogy, I think at Bordeaux,

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:32.740
maybe in Paris, I can't remember now.

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.550
And he becomes the first
professor of pedagogy

01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:37.513
in the world, really.

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:43.390
In this second fundamental
moment in the idea

01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:44.760
of public education,

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:48.320
it's all the cognitive psychologist

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.810
and the cognitive revolution.

01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:53.750
It's Jerry Burner and his students.

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:56.103
Howard Gardner, so many others.

01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:03.670
Today, the logic of the
market has completely invaded

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.890
how we think about education.

01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:11.700
Economists are all of a
sudden the grand seers

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:16.350
of what is an education worth
pursuing or worth supporting

01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:17.800
for a democracy.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.840
This would have been incomprehensible

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.650
in the formative moment

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:25.710
when so much of the basic
questions about education

01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:28.460
were about the good society
were about citizenship,

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.850
were about empathy, were
about the common good.

01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:34.903
Not about, how do we
extract value from labor.

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.300
- Well, it's interesting
that you mentioned in passing

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:42.050
Paulo Freire and Pedagogy
of the Oppressed.

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:44.240
Of course, this is another avenue

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.070
where you have an opportunity

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:48.310
to think of an educational system

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:51.090
that's very much not top-down or driven

01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:52.790
by that kind of master model

01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:55.320
which is there in the history of pedagogy.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.640
Even the term pedagogue is
a master who led children.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.040
That was where it came from.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.870
This of course changed over
time, and thankfully so.

01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:05.490
But it had a sense of
hierarchical, you know,

01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:08.110
you had knowledge, it was passed down.

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.943
Pedagogy of the Oppressed

01:16:08.943 --> 01:16:11.130
was really inverting that
in very fundamental ways

01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:14.350
and creating a much broader
community of practitioners

01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:18.000
and participants in a
kind of dialogical, open

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.230
and obviously dialectically inflected way.

01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:22.400
He's very much inflected
by Hegel and Marx.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.010
And that was the basic of the critique

01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:27.610
which again brings in
the critique of capital

01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:29.247
and the critique of capitalism

01:16:29.247 --> 01:16:33.700
and those who have and
wield power in various ways.

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:37.168
So I think this is an avenue,
to me, that we wanna reclaim,

01:16:37.168 --> 01:16:39.530
That we really wanna prioritize

01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:42.320
when we think about
education is that tradition

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.960
that I think Freire and really going back

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.020
probably to Marx also
really brought to the fore.

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.740
The other thing I wanted to respond to.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.330
The German tradition is interesting, too,

01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:54.834
because the word for education there is.

01:16:54.834 --> 01:16:56.600
(speaks in foreign language)

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.950
It comes from sculpture,

01:16:57.950 --> 01:17:00.210
which means you can turn,
you can make something.

01:17:00.210 --> 01:17:01.757
It also has a sense of image.

01:17:01.757 --> 01:17:04.040
You can be like in the image of God,

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.610
because that was one
way to think about it.

01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:08.960
But it was also a sense of
formation or creation or making.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.540
But you really have a sense
of artistic practice there

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.850
and it's very much open-ended.

01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:16.070
It didn't necessarily lead
in one particular direction.

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:17.790
And when the German universities

01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:20.300
in the early 19th century were founded,

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.570
I'm kind of thinking in
terms of Humboldt and others

01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:25.260
and this idea of liberal education.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:27.030
This became important
to the United States.

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:28.830
This was really a tradition that was

01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:33.170
of the multi-sided education
of the human being.

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:35.670
Disciplines were not meant to be silos

01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:36.720
but were meant to be traversed.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.010
And education was really holistic.

01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:43.350
It was about thinking about
the human being as a whole.

01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:47.400
So, to be educated is also to be formed

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.283
and form is never teleological.

01:17:51.765 --> 01:17:53.963
- The other inversion, Todd, is of course

01:17:53.963 --> 01:17:58.963
Maria Montessori and Christina
Rinaldi of Reggio Children

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.000
where the child is the point of entry

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.990
into teaching and learning.

01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:09.180
It's who's teaching whom.
- Exactly.

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.760
- We were in Erice recently, in Sicily.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.760
And Christina Rinaldi, who
is runs the Reggio Children,

01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:20.900
these are the best preschools in the world

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:25.861
starts with, so who is
teaching who here? (chuckles)

01:18:25.861 --> 01:18:30.861
And of course, Montessori,
Rinaldi, so many others

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:33.270
the moment you put the child

01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:36.520
at the center of teaching and learning

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.070
you have a radically different idea

01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:44.070
that inverts this hierarchical
story that we know so well

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:53.300
in education.

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:55.120
- I'm gonna open the
conversation to the floor

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:55.953
in just a moment.

01:18:55.953 --> 01:18:57.680
As a transition to that, one
thing I'm really struck by

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.790
across the four presentations

01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:03.310
is that a sense of responsibility
brought very close to bear

01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:05.510
on any idea of knowledge
that we might contemplate.

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:07.860
And I guess an obvious
question for each of you

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:13.060
or any of you that might want
to take a stab at it would be

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:16.350
who do you feel most responsible to

01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:20.160
in thinking about your own work
and thinking and performance

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.160
or scholarship or participation
as a producer, understander,

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.500
communicator of knowledge today?

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.990
Where does the responsibility
lie in your own thinking

01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:33.273
in the work you do?

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.110
Is it to your peers, is
it to your audiences?

01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:42.110
Is it to yourself, is it to
a larger category of being?

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.413
- Okay, I'll give it a try.

01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:52.980
I couldn't say that there would be one.

01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:56.120
I think that there are constantly

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.010
multiple spheres of responsibility.

01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:03.080
Of course, I don't feel
responsible to myself

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:08.080
I simply feel passionately
engaged with learning more.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:13.380
I feel responsible to all
the people who work with me

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.520
in the process of creating something.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.390
In fact, that process sometimes becomes

01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:22.190
the most important thing.

01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:25.470
And I feel fascinated by the
process and responsibility

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:28.390
of what happens to this thing that I make

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:33.390
when it enters the world,
when it becomes something

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.653
that for a few moments
can be engaged by others.

01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:41.756
That's my try.

01:20:41.756 --> 01:20:42.870
- And it's a responsibility.

01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:45.500
What I find most gratifying
is, I write about immigration,

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:49.870
when I give a talk and a young
person comes and tells me

01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:53.440
yes, this speaks authentically
to my experience.

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.740
I feel that is maybe the
most gratifying space

01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:02.740
for me to be in, when
somebody, a young person often,

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:07.080
says, you know, this tells my story.

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.730
To me, there's nothing greater

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:13.730
than that faithful
representation of the voices,

01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:18.960
the dreams, the ambitions, the anxieties

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.900
of people that teach me.

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:23.010
Remember, I'm an anthropologist.

01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:25.310
And in anthropology,
the only right you have

01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:27.930
is the right to be
ignorant about the people.

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.662
As the great Cliff Geertz said,

01:21:29.662 --> 01:21:31.750
knowledge is local knowledge.

01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:36.750
It lives with your colleagues
and the endeavor becomes

01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:39.180
constructing a set of understanding

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:44.180
that is faithful to the
experience of your collaborators.

01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:52.690
- It's a question I
wrestle with constantly.

01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:56.490
And I feel that there's
an ethical dimension

01:21:56.490 --> 01:22:00.070
in the work that I try to do

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:02.860
and I also am conscious of my failures

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.420
to be able to take on that responsibility.

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.800
And I mean that by, I have a voice

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.700
and I have a certain amount of
privilege that comes with it.

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.410
In various domains,
whether it's being male

01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:18.100
or able-bodied, Caucasian.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.540
And I think that there's an obligation

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:24.620
to understand and be
critical of that privilege

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:27.780
but also what it means to stand open

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.850
and be willing to listen to voices

01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:36.560
that don't have the same
opportunities for amplification.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.863
And that's where the
responsibility comes from

01:22:38.863 --> 01:22:40.920
when I'm thinking about the archive

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.870
or these voices that I was mentioning.

01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:47.310
You become kind of a
steward for knowledge.

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:49.380
A possible conduit,

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:52.120
but also one who can refract
it in different ways.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.600
But knowing that you're also extremely,

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:57.030
it's a very precarious position.

01:22:57.030 --> 01:23:01.548
And you have to ask yourself,
I ask myself constantly

01:23:01.548 --> 01:23:03.870
what responsibility comes with that.

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:05.640
- [Brett] Thank you.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.903
- Yeah, I love that.

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:13.540
For me, similarly,
responsibility, privilege

01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:18.000
all these different kinds of things.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.270
I can look it on the one hand

01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:21.100
as a human being walking
around in the world

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:26.100
and I can say that, you
know, my kids, my mother.

01:23:28.650 --> 01:23:32.350
My mother died this summer,
my kids are in growth.

01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:35.760
The bodies of knowledge that
I have did not prepare me

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.460
for either of those things.

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:42.460
And yet somehow I am able
to draw from something

01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:46.400
that came to me from
somewhere, et cetera, et cetera

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.290
to navigate those points
where you do have to flip

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:52.810
towards wisdom and rely
deeply on ignorance.

01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:55.210
And the lack of knowing in a blind way

01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:58.960
doesn't absolve you of
responsibility to care.

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.440
So I think of it in that term.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.200
When I think of it territorially speaking

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.440
which is a similar kind of thing.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.440
From Freire, to care enough,
to care for the thing.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.460
And that is a job description
in my humble opinion.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:14.790
The rest are just are just
acronyms and business cards

01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:17.210
and things, but that's a job description.

01:24:17.210 --> 01:24:18.230
When I think of it, I think of it

01:24:18.230 --> 01:24:21.140
through the eyes, often,
of a theater director,

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:25.160
a profound theater
director, Ariane Mnouchkine

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.100
She's based outside of Paris.

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.520
I asked her one time how
she prepares the cast

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.150
to perform the work for
like the 300th, 400th time

01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:36.620
with such intensity, because
of the subject matter

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.770
that they deal with often in the work.

01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:41.000
And they get together beforehand

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.440
and stand in a kind of
huddle and she says to them

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.020
tonight there will be
someone in the theater

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:52.083
who has never been here,
we perform for that person.

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.730
Tonight is also a person
that will be the last time

01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:58.713
they're in a theater, we
perform for that person.

01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:04.863
My sense of responsibility is
the belief in that potential.

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.670
- Terrific, thank you, amazing you all.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.250
Let's turn it and open
it up to the floor here.

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:12.890
I've got, just to start.

01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:14.930
Our TAs have got microphones
with some of the students,

01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:15.763
let's begin there.

01:25:15.763 --> 01:25:18.110
Kyle, you've got someone
here, yeah, please.

01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:21.910
- Hello, thank you all for
coming tonight and presenting.

01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:24.320
All the presentations were amazing.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.500
My question is, how do
instructors or institutions

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:30.110
determine what is better
for students to learn

01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:31.770
and what is the process that goes behind

01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:34.253
what knowledge is best
passed to the students?

01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:37.480
And this is for everyone.

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.251
- [Todd] I'm gonna leave
that to the academics.

01:25:40.251 --> 01:25:43.013
(panel chuckles)

01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:45.550
- So as a Dean I would say the following,

01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:48.840
which is this really
lives with the faculty

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.730
and the autonomy of the faculty

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:54.750
and the faculty's judgment as pertinent

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:59.750
to the very thoughtful and
thorough question you posed.

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:08.590
So really, there is a ways in which

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.823
the disciplines organize themselves.

01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:20.030
The individual faculty members
have a great deal of latitude

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:25.560
as to how to engage in the
endeavor of teaching and learning

01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:30.873
and the working with students.

01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:33.760
So there's a great deal of autonomy.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:38.760
While, I think, the disciplines
hold a very important space

01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:45.117
in how teaching and
learning are organized,

01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.920
ultimately, faculty members

01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:53.940
really have the autonomy and the range

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:58.940
to actualize those general
principles in the classroom.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:06.120
- I think when I decide

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.800
what knowledge should be passed forward,

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.450
like to say, when I put
a syllabus together,

01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:11.197
I made some decisions as
to what we're gonna read

01:27:11.197 --> 01:27:12.760
and what we're not gonna read

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.560
and what we're gonna watch
or not watch, if it's a film.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:20.833
And those decisions are always,

01:27:21.863 --> 01:27:23.763
you question them constantly.

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:27.290
It's not that you do this one time.

01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:29.310
It's constantly asking
yourself what knowledge

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:32.680
should be practiced or passed forward.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:37.680
For me, I'm interested in texts
or documents that will haunt

01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:42.220
that will stay with you as you grow

01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:44.440
and that you'll come
back to in different ways

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.620
because they mean things,
perhaps differently,

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:51.300
as you encounter them at
different points in your life.

01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:53.973
And I often select things
that that's happened to me.

01:27:54.849 --> 01:27:56.870
So I may have read something when I was 20

01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:59.170
and when I'm 40, I'm gonna
read it quite differently

01:27:59.170 --> 01:28:02.210
and I imagine when I'm 60
I'll read it again differently

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:05.400
and that's actually part of the point

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:09.150
because it speaks of the process of growth

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:12.130
that I go through and
that you will go through.

01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:14.246
Nothing is static.

01:28:14.246 --> 01:28:17.060
Who you are is constantly
changing and evolving.

01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:18.600
The language you're using.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.010
I don't mean just the
language you're speaking

01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:20.930
although I do mean that.

01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:23.300
But I also mean the expressiveness

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:27.890
and the way we encounter a text.

01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:29.390
And it doesn't have to
be written, of course.

01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:30.543
It can be performed.

01:28:31.810 --> 01:28:32.780
These things all change.

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:35.970
And so I'm interested
that'll haunt us though

01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:38.753
and in things that we'll have
to reckon with more than once.

01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:40.693
- Thank you.

01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:43.560
Over on this side, Gigi or Anna,

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:44.830
do we have someone on that side?

01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:46.213
- There's someone right there.

01:28:47.230 --> 01:28:50.230
- Where, I'm sorry, I'm looking,
oh yes, right here, please.

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:57.330
- It's on.
- Sorry, okay.

01:28:57.330 --> 01:28:59.410
Hi and thank you all again.

01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:02.240
My question is, if knowledge
is as valuable and scarce

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.540
as we've been taught,

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:06.350
why does society push
education on everyone?

01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:08.950
Wouldn't that take away from
the quality of knowledge itself

01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:11.730
or is it that we're only
subject to limited truths

01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:14.530
and the full lengths of
information should be protected?

01:29:18.542 --> 01:29:19.542
- Thank you.

01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:25.773
- So, knowledge is imperfect
and it's in perpetual change.

01:29:25.773 --> 01:29:27.640
There's also such thing as progress.

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:32.480
Meaning the fact that more
people become educated

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.093
and more people are familiar,

01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:42.863
to go back to Victoria's point of entry,

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.920
makes for a more democratic society

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:57.200
where more voices in the
citizenry can weigh in

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:03.923
on the issues of the day.

01:30:04.930 --> 01:30:07.325
The pursuit of knowledge
is eternal because

01:30:07.325 --> 01:30:10.863
knowledge is imperfect and incomplete.

01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:16.347
Knowledge is never
extracting truth from facts

01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:20.559
and from nature and from archives.

01:30:20.559 --> 01:30:24.570
It's more like making sausage.
(audience laughs)

01:30:24.570 --> 01:30:27.333
It's not so pretty up close.

01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:33.690
And we make mistakes and we come back.

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:37.253
We accumulate knowledge.

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:43.913
We go past previous
traps, previous mistakes.

01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:48.260
So it's a perpetual endeavor, it's never.

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:49.600
I think, and I told Franz,

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:53.030
that a work of art is never finished.

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.400
It's abandoned.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.890
You can say the same about knowledge.

01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:57.970
The pursuit of knowledge
is never finished.

01:30:57.970 --> 01:31:01.637
Some of us abandon it earlier than others.

01:31:01.637 --> 01:31:03.284
(audience laughs)

01:31:03.284 --> 01:31:06.260
But it's something that you
have a career in politics

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.950
in some countries if you do that now.

01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:11.093
Tragically, that's not meant to be funny.

01:31:15.631 --> 01:31:17.394
(audience titters)

01:31:17.394 --> 01:31:21.220
That's why it revisits
us in different ways

01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.523
in different generations.

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:26.660
- I didn't fully, totally understand

01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.520
the elements of the
question or I missed them

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.970
or they got left in the sea of response.

01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:34.990
But I did have a response
that came to mind

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:37.330
that I think has some relational value

01:31:37.330 --> 01:31:41.520
and that's, to me, when I
think of going to university

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:44.100
or the pursuit of an education,

01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:46.990
there's the difference between
a pursuit of an education

01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:49.940
in order to have a
certification at the end

01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:53.440
and that certification at
the end brokers access points

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:58.230
to a particular working life

01:31:59.610 --> 01:32:04.610
that leads, further tighten
up the screws of perfection,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.910
towards expertise, right?

01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:10.340
Really profound expertise.

01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:11.230
And that's one thing.

01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:13.680
There's also that place
where the encounter

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:17.760
with so much other gives
us a way of recognizing

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:21.180
elements of what makes us
feel awake to ourselves

01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:23.150
in the world, which is significant.

01:32:23.150 --> 01:32:26.790
To be pressured and stretched
in those places of choice

01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:28.960
to me, is a really important piece of it.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.980
Which can be that the path
of expertise is abandoned

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:36.660
in service to working
in a garden in the land

01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:39.660
or doing something else that is ultimately

01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:41.570
another kind of knowledge.

01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:45.190
But how all those things are
interdependently knowable

01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:48.240
to me comes through the
frameworks of a pursuit

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.003
and willingness to be educated.

01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:52.803
- Thank you.

01:32:56.409 --> 01:32:58.890
Right here in front.

01:32:58.890 --> 01:33:00.940
And then we'll go over on the side, okay?

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:04.720
- Yeah it's on.
- No.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.580
Okay, I wanted to ask you all
about the fundamental desire

01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:11.740
the human desire for knowledge.

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:15.670
And what role you feel passion and desire

01:33:15.670 --> 01:33:19.260
and love play in knowledge

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:23.573
and fundamentally our desire
to exchange knowledge.

01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:30.950
- [Marcelo] We're Homo sapiens sapiens,

01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:32.936
and there you have it.

01:33:32.936 --> 01:33:33.769
(audience laughs)

01:33:33.769 --> 01:33:35.050
- [Man] Because you guys talked about food

01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:37.500
and air and I think sex, over here,

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.350
at the beginning you talked about it.

01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:41.337
How does knowledge fit into that?

01:33:41.337 --> 01:33:43.170
- [Kristy] Did she talk
about sex or horniness,

01:33:43.170 --> 01:33:44.039
let's be clear?

01:33:44.039 --> 01:33:44.872
(audience laughs)

01:33:44.872 --> 01:33:45.880
- [Man] Oh, okay, sorry.

01:33:47.530 --> 01:33:49.300
Carnal knowledge, I guess.

01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:50.250
- [Marcelo] Carnal.

01:33:51.984 --> 01:33:56.984
- I think that we have a continuous desire

01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:02.440
not to say sexiness, to be in relationship

01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:08.340
to engage our environment,
whatever that is.

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:13.060
And so I think that if knowledge
is continuously learning

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:18.060
how to converse with the
world and the people around us

01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:20.940
at whatever scale that is

01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:26.890
it seems like that curiosity
that inquiry come, as you say,

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:32.193
because we are part of the world.

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.773
I don't even want to
say because we're human.

01:34:37.765 --> 01:34:40.210
- I think passion has a
great deal to do with it,

01:34:40.210 --> 01:34:41.780
I think love, all of those things.

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:44.967
But really, in a certain kind of way,

01:34:44.967 --> 01:34:49.510
if there's an openness
towards observation,

01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:51.420
listening, and so on and so forth,

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:54.630
every sensory apparatus
that we have available to us

01:34:55.950 --> 01:35:00.660
is going to make us fall towards knowing.

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:03.710
We will fall towards knowing
in one way or another.

01:35:03.710 --> 01:35:06.040
And to me, it's that thing of when

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:09.140
you start to recognize that
your mind can start going

01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:11.940
in all kinds of places, your
body, et cetera, et cetera.

01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:17.460
But I think, I certainly know
when someone has a passion

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.510
to run out of the room
because the subject matter

01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:22.630
that they're experiencing
is making them feel nuts.

01:35:22.630 --> 01:35:25.133
My son is going through
that like madly now.

01:35:26.850 --> 01:35:29.670
There's a passion to move away from things

01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:32.210
and I think that's another
point of knowledge.

01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:36.620
It's just utterly inevitable
that within the frameworks

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:40.830
of our belonging to life in our path

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.650
knowledge is gonna fall out of our sleeves

01:35:44.650 --> 01:35:47.730
like notes on a page, you know?

01:35:47.730 --> 01:35:50.030
What we do with it is a
different kind of animal.

01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:52.770
Artistically speaking, I would say

01:35:52.770 --> 01:35:55.390
that those bodies of knowledge
associated with artists

01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:57.350
are utterly driven by passion

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:01.840
and a willingness to
stand in acknowledgement

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:05.660
of what is not known and
bypass a knowable outcome

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:07.100
in service to a possibility

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.720
that didn't exist without the pursuit.

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:13.340
That requires passion and
a variety of other things.

01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:16.000
- Thank you, let's do one more question.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.240
I see a microphone right
up here in the middle.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.770
- First of all, I just
want to thank you guys

01:36:21.810 --> 01:36:23.850
for your vulnerability as a panel.

01:36:23.850 --> 01:36:25.020
I think the potential

01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.850
that the five of you guys have created

01:36:27.850 --> 01:36:32.110
by not cementing yourself in your fields

01:36:32.110 --> 01:36:35.830
and being open to the
vulnerability of your fields

01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:40.210
has been really awesome
for this discussion.

01:36:40.210 --> 01:36:45.210
And I'm curious how you
perceive the word amateurism.

01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:47.630
Amateur, to do something
for the love of it

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:52.220
and how that has been, you spoke about

01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.700
by monetizing the peace pipe

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:57.003
it actually takes away the power of it.

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:00.433
As a part of this Millennial Generation,

01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:07.790
how has amateurism been used
to keep people in their place

01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:12.300
or in their lane, for
lack of a better term,

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:17.300
especially the youth
generation throughout history,

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:21.423
not just ours in the current moment?

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:26.950
- I would just ask, how is amateurism

01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:30.690
a significant aspect of your experience?

01:37:30.690 --> 01:37:32.040
I'm not sure what you mean.

01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:36.773
- I think it seeps into a
lot of different fields.

01:37:37.921 --> 01:37:40.880
It the arts, definitely,

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.270
also you can look at
amateur college athletics

01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:46.350
and that not being monetized,

01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:49.460
the billions of dollars that
are generated in that field

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:52.110
is kind of more specifically
where I'm coming from.

01:37:52.110 --> 01:37:55.460
But I think the idea of amateurism, again,

01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.000
going off the earlier question

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.040
of where love and doing
things for the love of it

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.900
has been kind of stripped.

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:05.240
You look at the rise of
B corporations, right.

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.250
There's this new business
model specifically designed

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:12.120
to say, we are a business
that actually cares

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.350
when however many years ago, historically,

01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:16.460
that was just the natural component

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:18.010
of business and transaction

01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:23.010
but now we've created an
actual, I don't know, yeah.

01:38:25.690 --> 01:38:28.789
- In Spanish, what's the word for love?

01:38:28.789 --> 01:38:32.300
(audience murmurs)
(speaks in a foreign language)

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:34.565
Amateurism, it's the love of.

01:38:34.565 --> 01:38:36.748
- [Woman] That's what
I'm exactly getting at.

01:38:36.748 --> 01:38:41.120
- It's the love of, and to me,
all knowledge is relational.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.980
This is what 150 years
of cognitive-neuroscience

01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.800
finally has discovered.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:47.810
All knowledge is relational.

01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:51.617
It flows from the magic
word that Victoria used

01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:56.380
which is curiosity.

01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:59.770
It's the wonder of being alive.

01:38:59.770 --> 01:39:04.770
And it's the love of that
pursuit of understanding

01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:09.516
what eventually becomes
codified into knowledge

01:39:09.516 --> 01:39:14.516
that drives this perpetual
human capacity for knowing

01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:20.870
for wanting to know, for acknowledging

01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:25.040
and for the eternal magic

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:30.040
that comes with knowing
more about the fundamental

01:39:30.068 --> 01:39:34.260
big, existential questions before us.

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:36.640
So love is at the center.

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.640
We did very fancy longitudinal
models of how kids learn

01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:44.700
and it's relational.

01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:48.040
That gets you the most for your buck

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.110
if we can use that
mercantilistic metaphor.

01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:54.400
Kids learn in relationship.

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.810
I always walk into a school

01:39:56.810 --> 01:40:01.143
and if the teachers are
rooting for the kids,

01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:03.970
it's a good school.

01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:05.500
It's a great school

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:10.500
when the kids are
rooting for the teachers.

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.630
Because that's true love.

01:40:14.630 --> 01:40:18.973
And there's a brief letter
that is lost in the archives.

01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:21.600
Albert Camus.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.960
So he wins a Nobel
Prize, he's a young guy,

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:28.450
an Algerian immigrant in France.

01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:32.760
His father's not around,
his mother is mute and deaf,

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.710
and he sits down, he wins a
Nobel Prize and he's in his 30s.

01:40:36.710 --> 01:40:39.280
He wrote L'Etranger,
one of the great novels.

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.308
He sits down and writes
a letter to two people.

01:40:42.308 --> 01:40:46.420
To his mother and to his teacher.

01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:51.003
And that is a letter
of love to his teacher.

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:56.510
- I would just say, in
relation to amateurism,

01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:58.400
for the love of.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.993
Protect that place inside
of your march to greatness.

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:04.713
Utterly.

01:41:04.713 --> 01:41:08.250
Because the tyranny of
expertise can be full of traps,

01:41:08.250 --> 01:41:11.030
traps of exclusion, traps of unhappiness,

01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:12.623
traps of a variety of things.

01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:15.340
There's and artist that I
work with named Taylor Mac

01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:17.390
and I'll just quote
him right here and now.

01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:20.437
He would say, perfection is for assholes.

01:41:20.437 --> 01:41:22.140
(audience laughs)

01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:24.720
Okay, meaning, you're a little tight

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:26.630
on that expertise thing.

01:41:26.630 --> 01:41:30.630
So, but that thing, if you think of it.

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:32.790
What is something that you know

01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:33.970
that you wish you didn't know?

01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:36.550
The likelihood is it would
be something very personal

01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:37.870
in your experience.

01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:40.460
What is something that you
know that you treasure knowing?

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:41.870
Is probably something

01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:44.283
deeply personal in your experience, right?

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.530
What is something that you know

01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:49.470
that you feel compelled to share

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:52.780
is probably something
that you were both taught

01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:55.490
or gained extraordinary enjoyment from

01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:57.340
that you want to pass on.

01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:00.090
And what is the thing that
you have in your knowledge

01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:03.943
that you want to share
purely for self advancement?

01:42:06.031 --> 01:42:08.547
The crux between these
different intentions

01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:17.440
to me, the amateur place
of how do we use our hand,

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.780
how do we use certain things,

01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:21.400
how do you derive both
pleasure and meaning

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:25.280
from self discovery, self
manifestation of a hobby.

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.990
Hold onto those things
that you clock in yourself

01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:30.700
because they will carry and buttress you

01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:34.980
across much more than
purely the success lines

01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:39.820
marching towards the end game
of a particular expertise.

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.023
The hobbyist matters enormously.

01:42:44.464 --> 01:42:45.297
- [Brett] Okay, thank you.

01:42:45.297 --> 01:42:46.130
We've come to the end everybody.

01:42:46.130 --> 01:42:48.200
I love that at the very
end of every session

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:51.950
I turn to our guests and
say, any final comments,

01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:56.643
final thoughts, and if I were
to ask, please, knowledge is?

01:43:00.966 --> 01:43:03.500
(laughing)

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:05.400
- I kinda feel like it's really hard

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.910
to make a conclusion other
than where we had just landed

01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:13.280
because there were so many profound ways

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:15.850
to think about knowledge
and to find the register

01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:17.550
for yourself inside of that.

01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:21.347
- I just want to say
thank you to all of you.

01:43:21.347 --> 01:43:23.422
- Yes, thank you very much.
(audience applauds)

01:43:23.422 --> 01:43:26.913
- Thank you, everybody,
Kristy Edmunds, Todd Presner,

01:43:26.913 --> 01:43:29.067
Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, Victoria Marks.

01:43:29.067 --> 01:43:32.170
Thank you so much for
sharing your knowledge

01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:33.390
and helping us with all of ours.

01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:34.223
Thank you.
