00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.660
- It's a great pleasure to be here.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.709
It's a wonderful experience of a lifetime
to be a Radcliffe fellow.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.220
I'd like to thank Dean Liz Cohen.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.390
I'd like to thank Associate Dean Judy Vichniac,
all the staff at the Radcliffe for the wonderful

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.599
work that they do to keep us safe and happy
through the year.

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:39.090
I'd like to thank my fellow fellows that have
also given me such a good ride through this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.090
year.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.530
And I'd like to thank the people with whom
I've been working this year, in particular

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.890
at the lab of Any Knoll in Earth and planetary
sciences, Andy himself and his lab, in particular,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.880
Elizabeth Sibert, who's a Harvard fellow,
who's been working with me during this year,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.900
teaching me about new things.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.259
And also my Radcliffe research partner, Hannah
[? Burn, ?] who has been working together

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.280
with a post-doc in my lab in Paris to move
forward with some of our work.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.369
So there's many people I'd like to thank.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.100
Also, Dan Needleman in molecular cell biology
here, who has been a great inspiration to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.380
me too.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.479
So with that, let's dive into the ocean.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.030
So I'd like us to think about the ocean for
the next hour or so.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.580
I'd like to think about our planet ocean.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:52.729
I think we all appreciate that the ocean occupies
more than 70% of the surface of the Earth.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.340
And we look at it, and I think we all appreciate
that it's huge, that it's awesome, that it's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.399
powerful.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.469
Right?

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.939
But when we think about how does it connect
to us, how does it connect to our daily lives,

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:16.970
it's maybe a bit more abstract to bring the
ocean into that intimacy with ourselves.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.120
So let's go back to the very beginning.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.650
Let's go back to the stromatolites, the fossilized
remains of the very first cyanobacteria, as

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.630
far as we know.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.560
And it's within these organisms that this
incredible machinery called photosynthesis

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.590
first evolved.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:48.120
In my opinion, this is perhaps the greatest
evolution, the greatest invention of evolution

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.180
that we know about that evolved very early
on and performs incredibly important things.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.400
If we think about it for a second, what photosynthesis
does is it converts light energy into chemical

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400
energy.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400
OK?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.530
That's what we try to do when we generate
energy out of solar energy.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.700
When We're not very good at it yet.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.540
We're getting better.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.910
But the plants and photosynthetic organisms
do this incredibly well by generating chemical

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.960
energy that can be utilized in different ways
from sunlight, from the energy in sunlight.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.460
Photosynthesis also converts carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere into organic materials.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.070
So everything, including ourselves, we are
all built from this organic materials.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.090
We are literally what we eat.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:50.180
All of that organic material comes ultimately
from primary production generated through

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.530
photosynthesis by the conversion of carbon
dioxide into organic materials.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.100
And then, photosynthesis splits water to generate
oxygen, which, of course, we and many of our

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.180
co-inhabitants of our planet also breathe.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.600
So it was a remarkable invention of evolution
that really changed the history of our planet

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.130
and permitted life on Earth to really evolve
as to how we know it today.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.320
Here, we see the evolutionary record of life
on Earth, beginning in the Archean, sort of

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:38.120
3 and 1/2 billion years or so ago, where we
have the first evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.020
within the cyanobacteria that formed ultimately
these stromatolites.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.520
And this started generating whiffs of oxygen.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.610
So there was no oxygen on Earth before life
first evolved.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.610
Right?

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.370
And then, finally, these whiffs of oxygen
began to be generated, ultimately leading

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.410
to what we know as the Great Oxidation Event.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:08.500
And then, slowly, as oxygen began to stabilize,
still at pretty low levels, not yet at today's

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.280
levels, then we see the evolution of different
forms of life that were very likely stimulated

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.460
by the photosynthetic processes.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.780
So the first reactions that we know of are
coming from organisms such as the cyanobacteria,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.030
which later on, following the increase in
oxygen, gave rise to more complex eukaryotic

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.680
cells, which are cells like our own cells,
which contain DNA packaged inside the nucleus,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.450
which have mitochondria to generate energy
inside them and so forth.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:51.590
So this is the great, first innovation that
was likely permitted by evolution, by photosynthesis

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.050
in the first place.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.260
And then, as these eukaryotes continue to
evolve, they were still single-celled.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.260
OK?

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.910
They ultimately gave rise to photosynthetic
eukaryotes.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:14.030
These eukaryotic cells learn how to do photosynthesis
by acquiring cyanobacteria and incorporating

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.560
cyanobacteria inside those cells.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.970
And then, following the evolution of these
first photosynthetic eukaryotes, we likely

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:29.830
had another bump in oxygen up to pretty much
modern day levels of around 20%, which then

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.889
permitted the evolution of multicellular life,
the evolution of more complex life forms,

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.630
most notably in the Cambrian Explosion, where
all kinds of weird and wonderful multicellular

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.130
organisms first appeared in the fossil record.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:54.080
And then, we have a third moment, when photosynthesis
appears to be particularly important, which

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:01.840
is the evolution of land plants, multicellular
organisms that can photosynthesize beginning

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.690
to colonize the land.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.680
We have another bump of oxygen, going up to
sort of 30% here.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:16.770
And this likely permitted the evolution of
giant insects, of giant animals up to dinosaurs

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.100
and so on.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:23.590
And then, indeed, these levels finally went
back down again to modern day levels of about

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.180
20%, fortunately.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:33.000
Otherwise, we may be living with these giant
insects and animals even today.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.770
So here we see that the history of life on
Earth was very much permitted by photosynthesis

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.800
and very much enabled by different evolutionary
events that had happened in the ocean.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.889
So life evolved in the ocean.

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:52.490
We're pretty certain of that.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.669
And through different aspects, we now know
that the ocean very much sustains life on

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:01.270
our planet for all kinds of different organisms.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:08.210
And in our own particular way, for ourselves,
the ocean protects us.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.300
It protects us by feeding us, providing us
with fish, and so on.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:20.100
It protects us by absorbing excess heat, by
absorbing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.729
Without the ocean, the temperature of our
planet would be even higher than it is today.

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:32.570
And the ocean also generates oxygen through
these photosynthetic organisms that are present.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:38.630
The ocean, finally, is also a resource in
many different ways, not only for tourism,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:45.880
also for desalination, extraction of minerals,
all kinds of different resources that we know

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.580
are important.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:54.000
And we sort of tend to think that the ocean
is so big, it can sort of absorb whatever

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.790
we throw at it.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.790
Right?

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.550
But in fact, that's not true.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.320
If you take all of the water that is in the
ocean, and you bring it all together into

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:12.620
one single drop sitting on top of a dry Earth,
you begin to see how little water we actually

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.620
have.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.090
And the majority of this is ocean water.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.620
And it's really very, very little.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:26.320
If we look at fresh water, it's a little drop
of water sitting on top of the ocean water,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.300
the salt water that you probably can't see
at the back.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.690
So the ocean is really not as big as we think.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:40.910
We're throwing all kinds of insults at it,
but it can only withstand a certain amount.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.250
And we know today that the ocean is very much
under pressure.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.830
It's under pressure in several different ways.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:56.860
On the one hand, through the increase in temperature
in the atmosphere, due to greenhouse gases

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:02.740
that are present in the atmosphere, are causing
increases in the temperature of the ocean.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.750
The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide
is mixing with water.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:14.750
And that simple reaction of carbon dioxide
plus water produces carbonate, produces bicarbonate,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.140
which are acids.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:24.040
And so the oceans are slowly acidifying in
a pretty dramatic way.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.950
And then through phenomena that we don't really
understand, the oceans are also losing their

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.950
oxygen.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:35.410
There is a process of de-oxygenation that
has been observed in many locations around

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.790
the world.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:43.320
So this is a sort of third insult that is
happening to the ocean collectively.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:51.680
And in a global context, we can see the increase
of sea levels caused by the melting of the

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.690
glaciers that are affecting coastal ecosystems.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:02.260
We have effects on coral reefs caused by acidification
of the ocean, and so on.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:11.180
So the ocean is very much feeling the pressure
of we, of humanity today.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:19.020
So it's in this context that we really launched
this expedition called Tara Oceans, back in

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.620
2009.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:29.600
And what we wanted to do here was to sort
of get an idea of the state of the ocean at

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.130
the beginning of the 21st century, because
nobody's ever done this before.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:40.890
We don't really have a zero time point for
the state of the ocean.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:46.959
So we set out to do this project way back
in 2009.

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:54.630
And we specifically wanted to study the state
of marine ecosystems, in particular the microscopic

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:58.910
plankton that I'll introduce you to in a second.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:05.760
And we were very much inspired by previous
expeditions as well, learning from the past

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:13.310
to try to move forward, standing on the shoulders
of giants, people who had done this sort of

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.090
thing before.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:22.380
And here are a couple of examples of previous
expeditions that I'm sure you have heard of,

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:28.970
certainly this one on the HMS Beagle from
1831 to 1836.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:35.019
There were two particular gentlemen on board
here, Captain Robert Fitzroy.

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:38.140
He was the captain of the ship.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:46.400
And his job was to map out the coastlines
of the different countries that they travelled

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.839
around.

00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:48.839
This is South America.

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:55.370
And you see he did a fantastic job doing this
work on this expedition.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.460
But he was also very much a scientist in his
own right.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.740
In those days, scientists didn't exist.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.649
They were called natural philosophers.

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:09.970
And I think that describes very much who these
kinds of people were.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:17.630
And in the case of Fitzroy, he went on to
develop what we now call the storm barometer,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.640
which is a remarkable invention to allow us
to predict the weather based on the atmospheric

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:28.470
pressure to know when it's going to rain or
when it's going to be fine.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.550
So he developed that during his lifetime.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.210
Also on board this expedition, there was the
young Charles Darwin.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:45.260
And I'm sure he needs no introduction as to
what he achieved in his lifetime in providing

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:51.459
us with a theory for the origin of species
and mechanisms of evolution and so on.

00:13:51.459 --> 00:13:55.830
And then, there's the second example that
I want to talk about briefly, which is the

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.160
HMS Challenger expedition.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.339
This was performed about 50 years later, 1872
to '76.

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:06.400
This was performed by Thompson and Murray.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.279
And they went out over five-year expedition.

00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:15.260
You can see where they went here to basically
test the idea that was prevalent at that time

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:20.680
that there was no life in the ocean below
the surface layers, below where the light

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.870
can penetrate.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:27.810
It was believed at that time that the ocean
was azoic, devoid of life.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.209
So they went out on this expedition.

00:14:30.209 --> 00:14:35.620
And they dredged and pulled up all kinds of
incredible organisms to show that yes, indeed,

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.220
there is life at these depths of the ocean.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:44.781
And many of these samples were subsequently
taken by this guy called Ernst Haeckel, who

00:14:44.781 --> 00:14:45.781
is a German.

00:14:45.781 --> 00:14:51.000
He was really very much a natural philosopher
in the sense that he was sort of half scientist

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.320
and half artist.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:15:00.910
And he generated these incredible images of
these microscopic organisms that he was observing

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:10.630
in his very primitive microscope that ultimately
gave rise to the movement of Art Nouveau,

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:19.820
very much inspired this whole idea of living
forms being used to create new architectural

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.820
forms.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.440
This is the World Expo in Paris in I think
1902.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.630
You can see the Eiffel Tower back here.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.320
This doesn't exist anymore, sadly.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.639
But you can see how it was very much inspired
by these microscopic life forms that were

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:38.300
drawn by Haeckel.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.460
Haeckel was also the father of ecology.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:48.100
He coined the term "ecology," which has now
become obviously a formal science in itself.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:54.750
And this movement of architecture of Art Nouveau
subsequently continues today through organic

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.070
architecture, which we see many examples around.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:09.020
So we see how life continues to inspire beyond
the science itself of studying life on Earth.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:14.649
So these were the sorts of inspirations that
we got from our project, for initiating the

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:15.959
Tara Oceans project.

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:22.860
And what we specifically wanted to study in
this project were the planktonic organisms,

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:28.040
which we can consider as sort of the invisible
multitude.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.149
When you think about life in the ocean, I'm
sure you don't think about plankton.

00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:36.700
You think about sharks and whales and so on.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:43.149
But in fact, the plankton, these microscopic
organisms that drift with the currents, really

00:16:43.149 --> 00:16:45.899
do represent the majority of life in the ocean.

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:53.209
They're at least 50% of the biomass of life
in the ocean, probably considerably much more

00:16:53.209 --> 00:16:54.980
than that.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.750
And they consist of all kinds of different
organisms of different shapes and sizes that

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.360
you can see in this mandala that I'll introduce
you to in a second.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.189
And these organisms have all kinds of very
important functions.

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:14.720
They are the base of the oceanic food chains
that lead up to the fish and the larger organisms.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:21.240
The photosynthetic component of the plankton,
just like plants on land, they sequester carbon

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.910
dioxide out of the atmosphere.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.949
And they bring it into organic materials in
the ocean.

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:33.820
Through photosynthesis, they also generate
the oxygen that is so important for us and

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.160
many other organisms.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:42.290
And because the ocean is deep, some of these
organisms, when they die, they will sink to

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.429
the bottom of the ocean.

00:17:44.429 --> 00:17:48.410
And they'll take the carbon that they have
produced, the organic carbon, they'll take

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:54.140
it with them all the way to the bottom of
the ocean, effectively taking carbon out of

00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:00.679
the carbon cycle on the surface of the Earth,
sequestering it for geological periods of

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:08.450
time that can ultimately form the fossil fuels
that we're so avidly burning today.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:16.280
And we know through studies from many people
around the world, including also many eminent

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:23.750
scientists in Harvard, that the plankton,
on the one hand, can affect the climate.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:30.790
They've affected climate of the Earth during
the history of life on Earth in several different

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:31.790
ways.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.160
And we know also that these organisms are
affected by climate change.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:42.860
So there's a kind of feedback between the
two, between climate and planktonic organisms,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:51.490
such that plankton are really at the very
heart of the climate machine that regulates

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:56.500
the climate system of the planet.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.980
So what's in the plankton then?

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.070
You can see this mandala here of nice little
organisms.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.730
But let's go and dig a little deeper.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.190
And let me introduce you to the different
kinds of organisms that are present.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.309
I'll start with these guys that we call the
protists.

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:20.330
These are cells that consist of eukaryotic
features, just like our own cells.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.260
The difference is that these guys are single
celled.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.590
Typically, they exist as single cells.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.480
Sometimes, they will form chains, as you see
here.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.510
And you see they have different kinds of shapes
and sizes.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:42.660
Each one of these cells is between 100th and
1/10 of a millimeter in size, I would say.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.080
Some of them have structures like little pillboxes,
like you see here.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.480
Some of them look like little spaceships,
all kinds of weird and wonderful shapes.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.430
Some of these are photosynthetic.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.830
Some of them parasitize other organisms.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.730
Some of them eat organic material like we
do.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:06.650
And if we add all of these up together, in
an average liter of seawater, we can find

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:12.940
up to 10 million of these organisms in that
volume of water.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.310
So these are the protists.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:19.060
On top of the protists, we have what we call
the zooplankton.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:25.030
These are, again, different kinds of shapes
and sizes that generally tend to be bigger.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.000
And these are the grazers in the ocean.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.120
These are the cows and the sheep of the oceans
that go around eating typically those protist

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.770
organisms that I showed you in the previous
slide.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:45.880
And these can be present at up to 100 individuals
in an average liter of seawater.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:53.150
And then, getting smaller, we've got the prokaryotic
organisms, the bacteria, the archaea, which

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:58.120
can be present at up to a billion cells in
an average liter of sea water.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.660
Some of these are photosynthetic.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:12.820
Some of them are related to those initial
cyanobacteria that gave rise to the origins

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.900
of oxygen on Earth.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:21.789
And then, even smaller than the bacteria and
archaea, we have the viruses and the giant

00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:26.220
viruses, which, again, are all kinds of different
weird shapes.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:32.539
And these can be present at up to 10 billion
individuals per liter of seawater.

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:35.059
These are not pathogenic for us.

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:42.320
But the role of these guys is to infect the
other components of the plankton to essentially

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.080
ensure that there is equilibrium in the ecosystems.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:52.580
If one organism tries to takeoff, tries to
go too strongly, a virus will show up to cut

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.220
it down, to ensure that equilibrium is maintained.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:01.970
So I sort of consider these organisms as like
the lubricators of the ecosystem to ensure

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:08.360
that excesses are not tolerated and to ensure
that evolution moves forward, as organisms

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.980
adapt.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:18.070
So we have all of these organisms that are
present in ocean water and that are present

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.720
in different amounts.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.180
And they're also present very much in different
sizes.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:31.720
What you see here is a video of a zooplankton,
the large shrimp-like organism called the

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.730
copepod with a diatom sitting on top of it,
this round cell here, which is one of the

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.000
protists.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.720
That's the diatom here.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.480
And then sitting on top of the diatom is a
bacterial cell here.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:50.410
So we're going through several orders of magnitude
here, equivalent to going from an ant to a

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.390
brontosaurus, if that maybe means more to
you.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.000
And we don't even have the virus.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.460
The virus would be sitting on top of that
bacteria.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:05.420
So these were all of the organisms that we
wanted to study in the Tara Oceans expedition.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.419
It had never been done sort of from end-to-end
before.

00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:15.850
So it was a challenge to put together protocols
to sample all of those organisms.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:23.110
And we also wanted to do this on a worldwide
scale, because the ocean is one.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.440
It's a single ecosystem.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:29.700
But to understand that ecosystem, you have
to sample it globally.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:38.701
So we performed this four-year expedition
that is summarized on the slide here, where

00:23:38.701 --> 00:23:41.850
you see in 2009, we left France.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:46.860
We went through the Mediterranean, through
the Red Sea, down the Indian Ocean, across

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:52.260
the South Atlantic, into the Southern Ocean
in Antarctica, and then went out the South

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:59.909
Pacific towards Tahiti, up to Hawaii, back
to San Diego, through the Panama Canal, up

00:23:59.909 --> 00:24:03.940
to New York, and back to France, over three
years.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:12.440
And then in 2013, we performed a second expedition,
going around the Arctic Circle up here, because

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.500
the Tara sailboat is able to withstand the
ice, able to withstand the pressures of the

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:27.640
ice, and is able to be able to do that sort
of extreme expedition quite aptly.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:34.110
So during this summer season here, took us
six months to get around first the Northeast

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:40.050
Passage of Russia and then through the Northwest
Passage above Canada.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:43.830
Many explorers have lost their lives looking
for those passages in the past.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:50.840
But these days, it's possible to get through,
because of the melting ice up in the Arctic.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:57.020
But Tara is, anyhow, the first sailboat to
have gotten through both Northeast and Northwest

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.030
Passages in one season.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:04.780
So during this whole campaign, we sampled
at all these different sampling points that

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.610
you see here marked out on the map.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:14.380
Our objective was really to do the same thing
wherever we went, so that ultimately we could

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:20.840
compare samples that we got in Antarctica
with samples that we got in the Arctic, for

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.840
example.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:28.440
So there's a lot of mundane work to really
generate high quality samples that would allow

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:33.220
us to subsequently compare sort of everything
with everything.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:39.980
So at the end of this whole adventure, we
had sampled at 210 different sampling sites

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.970
around the global ocean.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:48.600
And we brought back 40,000 samples to the
labs involved in the Tara Oceans project for

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.309
subsequent analysis.

00:25:50.309 --> 00:25:57.039
We brought back other data sets, other samples,
which were also useful for some of the analyses

00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:58.340
we wanted to do afterwards.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:05.530
So that's when the real hard work begins,
to dig through these 40,000 samples and try

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.620
to make some sense out of them.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:16.799
And we were very happy that we were able to
describe the first foundational results from

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:25.640
the project in a special issue of Science
that was published almost two years ago now,

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.640
on May 22, 2015.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.630
And in the special issue of Science, we were
able to publish five papers back-to-back,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:35.450
describing the foundational results from the
project.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:36.590
We got the editorial.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.520
We got the front cover.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:44.570
We got a lot of coverage in the scientific
press and also in the daily press.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.890
We got also the front page of The New York
Times.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:53.980
This is their view of plankton, not exactly
microscopic, but at least it serves to get

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.650
the message across.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:27:02.030
So we're very happy to create this splash
of media coverage finally about plankton.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:09.700
And just let me show you briefly what is contained
in some of those papers in Science.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.130
In one of those papers, we described what
we call the ocean microbiome.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:22.120
So you've maybe heard of the human microbiome,
the microbes that live on human beings.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.090
In this paper, we described the equivalent
for the ocean, the microbes that live in the

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.080
ocean, in particular the bacteria.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.919
We described this microbiome from 68 sampling
sites within our data-set, so we had pretty

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:41.000
good global coverage of the global ocean.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.830
And within this microbiome, we described 40
million different genes.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:52.039
That is close to saturation, so this is pretty
much all of the genes that are present in

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:58.470
bacteria in the ocean, at least in the top
100 meters or so of the water column.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:05.730
So it's a huge resource that is now publicly
available that is being used by scientists

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.549
worldwide.

00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:17.330
This is about 30,000 times more sequence than
was generated by a certain Craig Venter in

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.460
a similar expedition performed several years
before us.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:28.529
And of these 40 million genes, you can imagine
most of them are new to science.

00:28:28.529 --> 00:28:34.360
More than 80% of them were discovered on the
Tara Oceans expedition.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.620
And the vast majority of them we don't know
what their functions are.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.530
So there's a lot of discovery to be done to
try to understand what those functions are.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.039
So that was one paper.

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:49.970
In another paper, we described the ocean virome,
the collection of viruses that we could find

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:55.040
in the ocean by methods that I won't go into.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.580
But in this paper, we described 5 and 1/2
thousand different kinds of viruses in the

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.890
global ocean.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.040
Prior to Tara Oceans, only 39 were previously
known.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:12.309
So that gives you, again, an idea of the incredible
rate of discovery coming from the project.

00:29:12.309 --> 00:29:21.210
And then, for these protists, the unicellular
eukaryotes, this gets a bit more complicated,

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:27.000
because we have an incredible diversity of
organisms within the eukaryotic tree of life

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.740
that is shown here, for many of which we have
no cultured representatives.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.730
We don't know what they look like.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:39.010
And there's an incredible unexplored diversity
that we know very little about.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:47.730
To give you an idea, within this tree of life
here, we are sitting here within the animals.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.929
And the closest branch to us are the sponges.

00:29:50.929 --> 00:29:53.740
So here we've got animals and sponges.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.659
And then beyond animals and sponges, you have
all this incredible diversity of organisms

00:29:58.659 --> 00:30:00.860
that we know very little about.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:08.059
So from this survey of these protists, what
we described in one of these papers was about

00:30:08.059 --> 00:30:09.980
130,000 genetic types.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:15.510
Let's not call them species, but sort of species.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:20.220
130,000 different kinds of eukaryotes in the
ocean.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.270
Again, this is saturating, so we've more or
less found everything that is there.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:29.450
So if you give me another sample of sea water,
we'll more or less just find what we've already

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:35.039
found from this project here.

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:40.730
And again, there's an incredible novelty represented
in this data-set.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:48.320
This represents more than 10 times the number
of formerly described species of marine eukaryotic

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.320
plankton.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.669
So 90% are new.

00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:58.260
And about a third of them, we cannot assign
them to any known taxonomic group within this

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.990
tree of life.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:07.179
So whether these organisms represent very
primitive groups sort of at the center of

00:31:07.179 --> 00:31:10.720
eukaryotic diversity remains to be seen.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:16.110
But there's an incredible amount of diversity
that was revealed here.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:21.490
Now all of this was done by DNA sequencing,
very, very high-throughput throughput DNA

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:26.730
sequencing, which gives you a one-dimensional
string of Gs, As, Ts, and Cs.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:32.419
It doesn't really necessarily tell you what
these organisms are.

00:31:32.419 --> 00:31:38.571
So it's very, very important to try to associate
some sort of morphology, some sort of shapes,

00:31:38.571 --> 00:31:42.809
some sort of forms with those DNA sequences.

00:31:42.809 --> 00:31:53.730
And so that is why we developed additional
protocols to perform automated, high-content

00:31:53.730 --> 00:32:00.990
imaging of these organisms sitting on specialized
microscopes we call confocal microscopes,

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:07.649
such that we can get these very, very detailed
views of what individual kinds of planktonic

00:32:07.649 --> 00:32:10.010
organisms look like.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:14.230
Here are a couple of examples in more detail.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:19.580
So using these different kinds of fluorescent
dyes, we can look at the exoskeletons of these

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.220
organisms.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.840
We can look inside these cells as well.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.620
This is dye in a flagellate inside.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.430
The red is a chloroplast.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:34.539
The green are membranes sitting inside the
cell.

00:32:34.539 --> 00:32:38.980
This is about a hundredth of a millimeter
in size.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.360
This organism is a diatom, which is a glass
silica cell wall.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.080
You can see how elaborate that is in light
blue here.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.899
Going inside the cell, we can see the chloroplast
in red.

00:32:50.899 --> 00:32:59.860
The DNA is sitting inside the nucleus here
in blue in this very elongated vesicle here.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:04.390
So we have all kinds of shapes of these organisms.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.610
We have more than a million of these kinds
of images.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:15.029
And we're now trying to associate the DNA
sequences with these morphological information

00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:16.880
to try to figure out who is who.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:23.110
That's obviously a work in progress that is
going to take some time.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:30.690
So now that I've sort of described to you
what we know about the bacterial components,

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:37.050
what we know about the virus components, what
we know about the protist components in the

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.350
ocean, we can take all of that data.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.840
We can throw it all together.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.730
We have that information from 68 different
locations around the ocean.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.559
We can throw all of that data together.

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:52.580
And we can ask, well, who lives with who?

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.799
Who is found in the same location as the other
organisms?

00:33:56.799 --> 00:34:01.299
Or who is never found with other organisms?

00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:07.890
So through this very large compute, we can
define what we call in technical terms the

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:12.099
interactome of the plankton ecosystems.

00:34:12.099 --> 00:34:18.509
You can also consider this a social network
of the ocean, the ocean's Facebook.

00:34:18.509 --> 00:34:20.730
So this took several months to compute.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.940
It's not particularly nice how it looks in
the end.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.450
But this is the plankton interactome here.

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:30.419
The different dots are different kinds of
organisms.

00:34:30.419 --> 00:34:39.089
And the lines between organisms are either
associations in green, so organisms that co-occur,

00:34:39.089 --> 00:34:41.069
that live in the same place.

00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:46.819
Or in red, organisms that tend to exclude
other organisms.

00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:49.499
So you can see some patterns in here.

00:34:49.499 --> 00:34:57.579
You can see some kinds of plankton that are
sort of universally excluding other organisms,

00:34:57.579 --> 00:34:59.880
so universally anti-social.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:07.319
We can consider these as the Putins, the Donald
Trumps of the plankton world that are very,

00:35:07.319 --> 00:35:09.779
very strongly negative.

00:35:09.779 --> 00:35:13.839
We've also got these very positive guys, the
universally sort of green.

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:21.529
These would be the Tom Bradys, at least in
isolated communities, the Beyonces, Lady Gagas,

00:35:21.529 --> 00:35:22.609
and so on.

00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:29.150
So we have all these kinds of different plankton,
which we can tease apart and try to understand

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.660
more about what they're actually doing.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:38.140
The sorts of conclusions that come out from
this work is that, on the one hand, biotic

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:44.130
interactions are more important than abiotic
interactions, which basically means it's more

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:47.759
important who you live with than where you
live.

00:35:47.759 --> 00:35:53.630
That was one important conclusion that we
were kind of surprised to see.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:58.759
And then the other conclusion if we prize
apart the positive associations, the organisms

00:35:58.759 --> 00:36:05.140
that live with each other, and compare them
against organisms that never live with each

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:10.931
other, the sort of positive and the negative
associations, we see quite strikingly that

00:36:10.931 --> 00:36:15.849
the number of positive associations are more
than three times higher than the negative,

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:22.299
sort of telling us that corporation appears
be more important than competition in these

00:36:22.299 --> 00:36:28.210
ecosystems, which was quite a surprise to
us when we caught this signal.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:35.309
We always think of evolution as being competition,
survival of the fittest, who is strongest

00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:36.359
outcompetes the others.

00:36:36.359 --> 00:36:43.180
But in fact, no, the message of the plankton
world is more telling us that it's all about

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:50.481
cooperation, working together to ensure that
the ecosystem together works that is more

00:36:50.481 --> 00:36:54.670
important than trying to screw your neighbor
and so on.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:59.250
So that is an interesting message that we
got out of that study.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:06.440
And then, when we look at these interactions,
we look at these communities.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.690
I mean, this is complex, but don't worry.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:15.289
But when we look at the communities of these
different kinds of plankton, and we see what

00:37:15.289 --> 00:37:25.959
determines who is present together in a particular
environment, we see that it's very much temperature

00:37:25.959 --> 00:37:33.999
that is the main environmental driver determining
what the community structure looks like.

00:37:33.999 --> 00:37:39.160
So basically, what that means, if you give
me a sample of seawater, and I look at the

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.890
community of organisms that is present in
there, I can tell you with pretty good degree

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:48.579
of certainty the temperature of that seawater.

00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:52.440
So it's a very sophisticated thermometer that
we have found here.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.910
But that's not really the point.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:38:01.599
The point is that these organisms, even the
microscopic organisms, are exquisitely sensitive

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:09.049
to temperature, which brings us back to the
issue of today's ocean being very much under

00:38:09.049 --> 00:38:16.579
pressure by these increased temperatures that
are happening as a consequence of global warming.

00:38:16.579 --> 00:38:24.249
So this really leads us to realize that we
really have to understand how these organisms

00:38:24.249 --> 00:38:31.660
are going to change, are going to migrate,
or are going to adapt as a consequence of

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:38.009
changing temperatures in the ocean in future
years.

00:38:38.009 --> 00:38:44.740
And We have quite some information about that,
thanks to the work of the Intergovernmental

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:50.970
Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, who have
done a lot of work bringing a lot of data

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:58.630
together to generate models about how the
future Earth is going to look in the years

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.700
to come.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:08.150
And what I'm going to show you here is a video
that begins in 1950, showing how temperature

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:14.410
has changed on the surface of the Earth up
until today, and how it's projected to change

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.059
up until the year 2100.

00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:24.009
And this is a pretty conservative model.

00:39:24.009 --> 00:39:32.579
It's based on pretty reasonable emissions
of carbon dioxide in years to come.

00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:39.569
And what you're going to see is changes in
temperature I've revealed by warmer colors

00:39:39.569 --> 00:39:45.910
showing increasing temperatures or bluer,
cooler colors as cooling events.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:50.549
So let's see if that starts.

00:39:50.549 --> 00:39:52.869
Here we go.

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:54.599
So you see this moving.

00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:56.049
We're in 1960.

00:39:56.049 --> 00:39:57.969
You see it's going pretty quickly.

00:39:57.969 --> 00:40:02.420
And these are sort of temperature anomalies,
as some regions get a bit redder or a bit

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.970
bluer.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:11.799
Everything is moving around fairly insignificantly,
up until now.

00:40:11.799 --> 00:40:15.259
We're getting through to where we are today.

00:40:15.259 --> 00:40:21.819
And we can see how much the Arctic is really
suffering from increased temperatures.

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.859
Here we're going into the future.

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:29.049
So this is a model simulation, based on the
best available science today.

00:40:29.049 --> 00:40:33.029
And you can see how the Arctic, in particular,
is affected.

00:40:33.029 --> 00:40:40.630
We can see the Tibetan Plateau loses its glaciers
fairly soon.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:47.319
And by the end of the century, things are
not looking very good at all.

00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:55.910
So this really raises the importance of trying
to raise the alarm bells, if you like.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:41:01.569
Our signal from the plankton world about their
sensitivity to temperature really made us

00:41:01.569 --> 00:41:13.380
realize that we really have to get the message
across from the science about the state that

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.380
we're actually in.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:26.219
So we used the climate convention, the climate
conference in Paris in 2015 as a moment to

00:41:26.219 --> 00:41:33.390
mobilize the troops, to bring everybody together,
and create what we called the Ocean Climate

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:38.949
Platform that was created in 2015 and continues
to exist today.

00:41:38.949 --> 00:41:45.279
And this brings together all kinds of different
players with interests in the ocean.

00:41:45.279 --> 00:41:53.359
Some of these you will recognize, like Scripps,
the Smithsonian, the Pew Trust, various others

00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:54.359
from the US.

00:41:54.359 --> 00:41:56.589
It's very much an international operation.

00:41:56.589 --> 00:42:05.219
And the idea was to forget about the individual
interests of the different organizations,

00:42:05.219 --> 00:42:11.430
the different NGOs who may be interested in
plastic pollution or extension of marine protected

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.160
areas or whatever.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:19.440
The idea was basically to forget about the
individual interests of each of these groups

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:25.690
and just come together and promote one single
voice at the climate conference in Paris,

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:31.319
which was simply to give a voice to the ocean,
very, very simply.

00:42:31.319 --> 00:42:33.310
And we managed to do that.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:38.440
We organized an Ocean Day during the climate
conference in Paris.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:42.109
We brought together a lot of very important
people.

00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:46.180
Here, you see-- that's Irina Bokova from UNESCO.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.369
That's Prince Albert of Monaco.

00:42:48.369 --> 00:42:54.449
And we're all talking the same voice of giving
the oceans a voice.

00:42:54.449 --> 00:42:56.009
Sylvia Earle was with us.

00:42:56.009 --> 00:42:57.710
Al Gore was with us.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.569
Tara came into Paris.

00:42:59.569 --> 00:43:03.249
Ban Ki-moon came to visit us.

00:43:03.249 --> 00:43:07.869
All together to give the ocean a voice.

00:43:07.869 --> 00:43:13.339
And incredibly, we succeeded for the first
time.

00:43:13.339 --> 00:43:20.150
We succeeded to get the oceans mentioned in
the climate convention, the climate agreement

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:25.309
that was signed in Paris last year.

00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:27.349
It's a very minor mention.

00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:28.720
It's just in the preamble.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:35.589
But you'll see here-- this is what is mentioned,
noting the importance of ensuring the integrity

00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:41.799
of all ecosystems, including oceans and the
protection of biodiversity, recognized by

00:43:41.799 --> 00:43:46.979
some cultures as Mother Earth.

00:43:46.979 --> 00:43:48.359
This is COP 21.

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:54.940
So it took 21 years to get the ocean into
the agenda, into the climate agenda.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:44:04.420
It's incredible to realize that it took so
long to give the oceans a voice at this high

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.549
political level.

00:44:06.549 --> 00:44:11.809
But we're very happy that working together,
sort of getting inspiration from how the plankton

00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:17.869
were cooperating, rather than competing, that
we managed collectively to raise the voice

00:44:17.869 --> 00:44:23.670
of the ocean and make it part of the climate
convention.

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.799
So this is really just the start of a journey.

00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:33.349
I tried to show you some of the science that
has been generated from the Tara Oceans project

00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:39.099
that is continuing, fast forward very much.

00:44:39.099 --> 00:44:47.019
I showed you how we're able to try to influence
the political, the regulatory situation through

00:44:47.019 --> 00:44:52.819
the science, through the voice of science.

00:44:52.819 --> 00:44:59.249
We try to transmit the science that we're
doing through cultural initiatives, through

00:44:59.249 --> 00:45:04.759
artists in residence that we have on board
that produce different kinds of works of art

00:45:04.759 --> 00:45:08.309
that talk about plankton, that talk about
the oceans, and so on.

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:15.569
And then moving forward, in the future, we
expect that the science will lead us through

00:45:15.569 --> 00:45:20.920
to an increased understanding of how the ocean
works, to improve our models of what the ocean

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:26.000
is going to look like in the future, to predict
our predictive power, and how to respond to

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.239
the changes that are actually underway in
this moment, either through intervention,

00:45:31.239 --> 00:45:36.900
through remediation, or through prevention,
if we're lucky enough to be able to do that.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:43.119
And then, finally, there are all kinds of
ways in which this data, this knowledge can

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:48.859
be exploited through biodiscovery, through
bioengineering, discovery of new kinds of

00:45:48.859 --> 00:45:56.279
genes with new kinds of functions for biomedical,
industrial applications, and so on.

00:45:56.279 --> 00:46:00.729
So this is a summary as we move forward.

00:46:00.729 --> 00:46:05.250
So let me end there, and let me thank the
people behind this project.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.640
It's been very much a collective effort.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:15.089
A lot of people, our sponsors, who provided
the money for the expedition, and research

00:46:15.089 --> 00:46:17.690
agencies for the science.

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:22.299
We're about 20 partners, scientific partners
in the project.

00:46:22.299 --> 00:46:24.170
MIT is part of it.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:26.170
NASA is part of it in the US.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.339
University of Arizona.

00:46:28.339 --> 00:46:31.859
And so thank you to them for their commitment
to this project.

00:46:31.859 --> 00:46:44.159
And thank you to you for your attention.
