00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.950
Let's start with Play.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.280
On Google Fonts, I search for Play and we see it here.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.710
This looks sort of similar, but not close enough for me.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.720
All right, let's check out Rambla.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.290
I search for Rambla and we see this here.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.260
Once again, it's close but mm, not quite.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.830
Next up, Lato.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.300
Mm, Lato's looking really good.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.350
I'm not 100%, so let's check the last one, and then we'll come back to this.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.200
Finally we've got Arbitron.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.460
I've searched for Arbitron and that is definitely not it.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.100
So it looks like Lato's the winner.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.370
let's add it to the website and see how it looks.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.525
I'll click here.

00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:36.840
I'll scroll down and copy this.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.170
Inside the website I'll replace the sample here with the code for Lato and save

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.220
it, and now we just need to make sure we've got the right styles in our CSS.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.640
So I'll copy this, come over to our CSS, and paste it in here.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.840
So now, everything in the page should have Lato as the font.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.640
We'll save it, come over to Chrome, and refresh the page.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.780
Aha.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.940
That's looking pretty good.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.300
Let's compare it to the mock up.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.220
Comparing our page to what we had in the mock up, we can see that

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.730
they're really, really similar but they're not quite exactly the same.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.250
And that's because we have a few options that we need to play with.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.850
I'm going to leave this as an exercise for you.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.360
Come back into Google Fonts and start playing with how thick the lines are and

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.130
make sure that everything's in the right case, and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.240
you should see this font look just like the design mock up.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.820
So the correct answer here is Lato.
