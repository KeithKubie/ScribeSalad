Hey guys for this video Lenovo

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.449
Sent me some of their cool new moto mods including their brand new

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.419
Smartphone the Moto Z Force so I brought you out to the middle of the Nevada desert to turn the Z Force into the G

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.170
Force by strapping it to an oversized rocket and sending it to 20,000 feet now if you haven't seen these Moto Mods before

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.479
They're actually pretty cool, and they sent me three different kinds the first one is called the JBL Sound Boost

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.090
and this is like a speaker that clips on to the back of your phone and

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.639
Totally amplifies the sound the difference in the phone's volume before and after the mod is substantial

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.610
This one's the Hasselblad True Zoom Lens featuring a 10 time optical zoom which means from a safe distance

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.558
You can still get the really tight shots you need the third mod is an insta-share projector

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.899
So you can capture this footage and play it back on a screen up to 70 inches wide it's very cool

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.969
So the time has come to strap our cell phone to a rock and this is what we're going to be working with here this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.889
Is a ten and a half foot long rocket 60 pounds in weight and fueled by a motor that's going to deliver

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.859
750 pounds of thrust

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.119
If you've seen my series on building the randomizer rocket you probably know I'm pretty dang proud of this thing

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.229
But the funny thing is in this case my randomizer isn't even as big as the motor in this thing

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.830
The sugar Rockets for my randomizer cost anywhere between a dollar to a dollar fifty to make the motor for this thing cost over seven

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.159
hundred and fifty dollars and here's why it's an N class rocket motor weighs about 26 pounds burns for four seconds and puts out

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.339
750 pounds of thrust so we need an extremely reliable way to secure our phone to the rocket and for that

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.470
we're using duct tape

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.769
Also made this little abs form on my vacuum forming machine

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.150
I literally just heated up a piece of plastic in the oven stuck it over top of the phone and turn on my shop Vac

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.769
And that made a perfect mold of the shape of the phone you can see I cut a hole through the side here

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.990
So we can remove the phone and put it back in place

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.000
And I also cut a hole out of the front here still when the phone clicks into [place] we get the full field of view

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.119
as the rocket launches to

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.419
20,000 feet and the drill to hold on the side so as it's recording we can just verify it still going before we send the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.979
Rocket into outer space no idea if it'll work or not, but the Moto Z Force has a shatterproof screen

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.529
So if any cell phone is going to be the right candidate. I think the is it let's go strap it up

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.340
Check this out guys

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.650
We got the phone mounted to the rocket we use duct tape and electrical tape to secure this thing and here's the idea

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.230
We made this slit in the side so that we can pull the phone out

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.749
Get it recording and slide it back into place just before the launch and we're going to secure it with a little more duct tape

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.750
just to be sure

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.849
So our phone is strapped to the rocket and everything's in place. The only thing left to do now is flip the switch

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.129
This is the moment of truth guys will at launch the z Force is getting some g-Force

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.000
Yeah

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.840
That was awesome

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.440
Go check out the damage

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.470
[Yelling]     Man that rocket blasted a crater and sprayed dirt until tomorrow

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.110
That is incredible

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.049
Perfect flight I can't wait to get that phone back and see what kind of footage

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.450
we got

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.210
The only question is now are we going to get the rocket back more importantly are we gonna get the phone back in one piece

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.500
Let's go find out

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.880
So the parachute deployed the rocket has landed right now. We're on our way to find it using one of these things

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.480
Man, that's awesome. Okay? Well we found clays rocket. So we just found it one of our buddies rockets went straight into the ground

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.490
We're hoping that didn't happen ours.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.820
Sweet nectar we found the rock of the where the heck's the phone oh

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.340
That's where the phone used to be. Oh no no no no, it's on there! I can't believe it survived

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.540
This is amazing guys this just survived a mock flight. I am really anxious to see if that recorded any footage not quite sure

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.639
Look at that still recording that means we got it guys. I cannot wait to see if this works

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.440
That is cool. We got it. I almost hit delete

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.100
I am gonna put this away and transfer it and take this home and play it on the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.290
Insta Share projector on my hotel room wall nice job guys that was amazing wooh

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.489
We did it the little beeping buzzing and whizzing computers on this thing just told us sixteen thousand eight hundred feet is actually how

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.549
High this smartphone just went it's a supersonic smartphone

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.969
So there you have it guys the world's first mach 2 cellphone mod. It's actually really impressive we pulled this off

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.559
Yes! Thanks so much for joining me for this video, and I'll be looking for you the next one talk to you then

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.780
Out here in the middle of the desert you wouldn't believe how long it took us to actually to find this thing.
