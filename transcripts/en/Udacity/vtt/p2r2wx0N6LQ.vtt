00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.880
When you've used Ping,
it's given your numbers for

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.640
the round trip time between you and
the machine you're pinging.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.270
But what exactly is a round trip time?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.420
It's pretty much what it sounds like.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.860
Your machine can't tell
how long it takes for

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.320
a packet to get from
it to the other end.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.220
But it can tell how much time
has elapsed between when it sent

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.950
that packet and
when it received a response.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.350
That's the round trip involved.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.390
So there's this famous book about
a ping traveling out from its

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.280
host to a destination and going through
all these hops in the middle and

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.650
eventually coming back to where it
started taking a long round trip.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.470
Okay actually this book is about a duck
but Pings are kind of like ducks.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.520
They usually move in groups all in a row
just like those pings that we saw in

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.190
the terminal were just like
these famous ducks in Boston.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.770
Round trip time is an important
measurement of closeness on the network.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.580
But Ping time, as it's often called,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.830
isn't the only measurement of
performance across a network.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.700
We'll see some other ones
later in this lesson.
