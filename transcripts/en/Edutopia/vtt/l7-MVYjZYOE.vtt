00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:09.136
&gt;&gt;Roy: So guys, let's answer
this question together.

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:10.466
&gt;&gt;Maybe put some, like, more--

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:10.876
&gt;&gt;Put a piece of tape--

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.516
&gt;&gt;So you're going to put
something else to brace the back?

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:12.866
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:16.236
&gt;&gt;Roy: All right, but what
about bracing this piece?

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.586
&gt;&gt;Mark: Because we explicitly teach
process skills through design thinking,

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:22.196
our students are better collaborators,
they are more resourceful,

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:24.876
and they are critical
thinkers and problem solvers.

00:00:35.046 --> 00:00:36.616
&gt;&gt;Mark: We are a public school
with a mandated curriculum

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:38.626
and we have standards
that we need to deliver.

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:40.196
Students need to be literate.

00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:44.076
They need to know high levels of math,
but the ultimate questions we're going

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:49.436
to be asked by future employers is,
"Can this person work well in a team?

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.616
Does this person have the ability to
problem solve and critically think?"

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.366
so those are the things that
we can refine and enhance

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:57.976
with a design thinking process.

00:00:59.176 --> 00:00:59.936
&gt;&gt;Roy: How you coming over here, guys?

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:02.886
&gt;&gt;Roy: Design thinking was
something that my teaching partner

00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:05.596
and I were exposed to a few years ago.

00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:10.016
We thought it was fantastic to try and
help our kids frame problem solving.

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:11.786
&gt;&gt;Matthew: That's a great
first question, you guys.

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:12.296
I like that.

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:15.876
&gt;&gt;Matthew: We were looking at, how
do we get them into a small project

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:19.546
that includes design thinking as a theme
where they're going through learning how

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.386
to work in a team, learning
how to ask good questions

00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:24.516
and dig deeper into the problem.

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:27.006
&gt;&gt;Mark: What's assessed
are process skills.

00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:30.616
The students are graded on teamwork.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.286
&gt;&gt;Student: I mean, you
could do it like this.

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:34.856
&gt;&gt;Mark: On managing projects.

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:36.116
&gt;&gt;Roy: This comes down--

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.336
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Roy's doing rollercoasters.

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:39.326
I'm doing Invent a Sport.

00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:42.246
&gt;&gt;Matthew: We want to start with
broad questions and work our way down.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:46.466
&gt;&gt;Mark: Through this design thinking
process, we want inquiry, ideation,

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:49.046
prototyping, and then testing.

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:51.326
We start with inquiry.

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:54.786
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Getting started on your
sport, you have to know your audience.

00:01:54.786 --> 00:01:58.686
You have to be able to design it
for them versus yourselves, okay?

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:00.776
&gt;&gt;Mia: Would it involved a lot of skill?

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:03.656
&gt;&gt;Mia: We decided we're going to focus
on the third and fourth graders and try

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.596
to create a sport for them.

00:02:05.916 --> 00:02:10.416
So the first step was creating a
survey to see what they like in a sport

00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:12.846
so that we can put it into
the sports that we make.

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:16.116
&gt;&gt;So we got, "What is the most
important thing you value in a sport?"

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:18.966
"Can you list two things you
want to see in a new sport?"

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:21.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, do you prefer a game that
uses animals, like horseback riding?

00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:24.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:27.156
&gt;&gt;Roy: That survey helps
us to kind of understand it

00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:29.886
from someone else's perspective,
not what I like, my idea,

00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:31.356
because I'm not the end user here.

00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:34.406
Someone else is, so again trying
to help them to develop empathy,

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:36.686
understanding a different
perspective from their own.

00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:41.596
&gt;&gt;Matthew: And then they use that
information to make the design happen.

00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:44.386
&gt;&gt;Mia: Mr. Brown provided us with, like,

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:46.576
a bin of tools, like
duct tape and string.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.406
&gt;&gt;Student: The string would be used
to tie the balloons to the cups.

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:53.006
&gt;&gt;Mia: We're supposed to implement
the results from the survey and try

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.466
to make a sport that the third
and fourth graders would like.

00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:57.886
There's a lot of different
things we have to think

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:58.976
about when making that sport.

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:02.906
&gt;&gt;Matthew: You have an idea.

00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:03.276
I have an idea.

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:04.976
Let's take those ideas and let's
make a better idea in the end.

00:03:08.046 --> 00:03:11.056
&gt;&gt;Roy: In my class, the kids
are in the prototyping phase.

00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:14.426
They are working on a design
project for a rollercoaster.

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:16.286
&gt;&gt;Student: Let's keep
on putting them together

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:19.226
until we see how big we want to make it.

00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:21.046
&gt;&gt;Student: Just put these
on top of each other.

00:03:21.216 --> 00:03:22.246
&gt;&gt;Jaden: A lot of thinking goes

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:24.786
into building all the ideas
that you come up with.

00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:26.786
You got to see if you can combine them.

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:28.106
&gt;&gt;Roy: Explain your concept to me.

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:31.776
&gt;&gt;Roy: This will be the first iteration
and then they're going to test.

00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:33.416
&gt;&gt;Roy: All right, so let's
test it and see what happens.

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:35.116
&gt;&gt;Roy: Here are the things
that are working great.

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:37.116
Here are the things that
are not working so great--

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:37.776
&gt;&gt;Roy: All right, we ready?

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:40.806
&gt;&gt;Roy: -- and we want to try and now
highlight these things and fix them.

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:42.986
&gt;&gt;Roy: Oh, we fall off right here, yeah?

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.756
&gt;&gt;Jaden: One of the biggest
challenges was probably stabilization.

00:03:45.756 --> 00:03:48.146
&gt;&gt;Jaden: What Charlie did was,
he made, like, a diagonal cut.

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:50.376
&gt;&gt;Jaden: To have some
support for the rollercoaster,

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:54.056
we took these popsicle sticks that
we've been avoiding this whole time.

00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:58.516
We taped them together and
we put them at the bottom

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:01.486
of the coaster and it really works out.

00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:04.346
&gt;&gt;Storm: Oh, yeah, I'm just
typing it in right now.

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:08.586
&gt;&gt;Storm: Design thinking can help us
because we can go through the steps

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:14.176
and find out what we're doing right and
wrong and help us solve a big problem.

00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:17.516
&gt;&gt;Student: We might be able to,
like, put another tube in there

00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:18.846
so that's more, like, rounded.

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:20.686
&gt;&gt;Roy: So you're saying
just put a tube here?

00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:24.006
&gt;&gt;Jaden: What you want to do in
life might include design thinking.

00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:26.476
If you're trying to figure
out how to do something,

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:31.146
you could probably apply something from
design thinking to accomplish that.

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:32.856
&gt;&gt;Roy: Did we ask the right questions?

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:34.966
Did we get the right information?

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:36.916
Did we go to other groups for feedback?

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:38.586
What can we highlight and fix?

00:04:38.676 --> 00:04:39.866
&gt;&gt;Student: Look at right
here, under this.

00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:42.986
&gt;&gt;Matthew: They'll know how to use
these skills and they'll implement

00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:45.926
and apply those skills to
bigger and better things.

00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:48.866
&gt;&gt;Roy: My hope is that they are
internalizing enough of the process

00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:52.316
that they feel empowered to find
problems and solve problems.
