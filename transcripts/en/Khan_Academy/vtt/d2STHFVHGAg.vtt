00:00:00.664 --> 00:00:03.725
- [Lecturer] Hugo plans to
buy packs of baseball cards

00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:06.881
until he gets the card
of his favorite player,

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:11.057
but he only has enough money
to buy at most four packs.

00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:15.379
Suppose that each pack has probability 0.2

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.313
of containing the card Hugo is hoping for.

00:00:19.313 --> 00:00:21.198
Let the random variable X

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:24.487
be the number of packs of cards Hugo buys.

00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:28.893
Here is the probability
distribution for X.

00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:32.638
So it looks like there
is a 0.2 probability

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:35.725
that he buys one pack,
and that makes sense

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:39.589
because that first pack,
there is a 0.2 probability

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.100
that it contains his
favorite player's card,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.987
and if it does, at that
point he'll just stop,

00:00:43.987 --> 00:00:46.646
he won't buy any more packs.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.479
Now what about the probability
that he buys two packs?

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.575
Well, over here they give it
a 0.16, and that makes sense,

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:57.228
there is a .8 probability
that he does not get the card

00:00:57.228 --> 00:00:58.890
he wants on the first one,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.751
and then there's another .2

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:02.409
that he gets it on the second one.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.742
So 0.8 times 0.2 does indeed equal 0.16.

00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:12.312
But they're not asking
us to calculate that,

00:01:12.312 --> 00:01:13.938
they give it to us.

00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:18.462
Then, the probability that
he gets three packs is 0.128,

00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:20.289
and then they've left
blank the probability

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.001
that he gets four packs.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.491
But this is the entire discrete
probability distribution,

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:28.191
because Hugo has to stop at four,

00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:31.701
even if he doesn't get
the card he wants at four

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:35.527
on the fourth pack, he's just
going to stop over there.

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:37.849
So we could actually figure
out this question mark

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.936
by just realizing that
these four probabilities

00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:42.769
have to add up to one.

00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:45.751
But let's just first answer the question,

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:47.735
find the indicated probability,

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:50.445
what is the probability
that X is greater than

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:51.957
or equal to two?

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:53.184
What is the probability, remember,

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:56.592
X is the number of packs
of cards Hugo buys.

00:01:56.592 --> 00:01:58.158
I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:00.241
and try to figure it out.

00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:03.531
So let's look at the
scenarios we're talking about.

00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.327
Probability that our
discrete random variable X

00:02:06.327 --> 00:02:08.291
is greater than or equal to two,

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:12.692
well, that's these three
scenarios right over here.

00:02:12.692 --> 00:02:15.856
And so what is their combined probability?

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.216
Well you might want to say,

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:19.652
hey we did figure out what the probability

00:02:19.652 --> 00:02:22.528
of getting exactly four packs are,

00:02:22.528 --> 00:02:26.667
but we have to remember that
these all add up to 100%.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:29.701
And so this right over here is 0.2

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.528
and so this is 0.2, the
other three combined

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:34.839
have to add up to 0.8.

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.672
0.8 plus 0.2 is one, or 100%.

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:42.904
So just like that we
know that this is 0.8.

00:02:42.904 --> 00:02:45.451
If for kicks we wanted to figure out

00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:47.501
this question mark right over here

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:50.925
we could just say that
look, have to add up to one.

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:55.014
So, we could say, the
probability of exactly four

00:02:55.014 --> 00:02:56.549
is going to be equal to one

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.299
minus 0.2 minus 0.16 minus 0.128.

00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:09.173
I get one minus .2 minus .16
minus .128 is equal to 0.512.

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.905
Is equal to 0.512, 0.512.

00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:25.037
You might immediately say, wait, wait,

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:27.486
this seems like a very high probability,

00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:32.324
there's more than a 50% chance
that he buys four packs,

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:35.050
and you have to remember,
he has to stop at four.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.011
Even if on the fourth he
doesn't get the card he wants

00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:39.724
he still has to stop there.

00:03:39.724 --> 00:03:41.739
So, there's a high probability

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.515
that that's where we end up.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.364
There's a little less than 50% chance

00:03:45.364 --> 00:03:49.270
that he gets the card he's
looking for before that point.
