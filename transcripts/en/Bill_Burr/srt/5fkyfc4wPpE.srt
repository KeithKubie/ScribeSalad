1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,250
Hey, what's going on ? it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:10,050
Just before Friday. Monday morning
podcast and Ah, I'm just checking in on.

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:14,970
You can't yell. I can't yell.
I am in a Cologne, Germany.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,900
Um, and it is, it is one 49 whoops.

5
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:22,530
Sorry.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,530
One 49 in the fucking morning
and I'm fucking wide awake.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,460
I'm still on fucking hell a time.
What time is it back there?

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,490
Nine hour difference. Saints.
To what? Claw Gates. About what?

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,950
Nine 30 in the morning.
I don't what the fuck it is.

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,260
It's about four 34 or five o'clock
or some shit. Anyways, I worry you.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,350
How are you doing? I made it over
here. The flight was a fucking joke.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,500
I literally watched like
I watched one full movie.

13
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,340
All right. It was a, I
watched Dr Strange love,

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,310
one of my favorite movies of
all time and favorite director,

15
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:05,810
Stanley Kubrick and Peter
Sellers. Everybody. That
movie is fucking brilliant.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,200
I watched that and then I watched
a half hour of goodwill hunting.

17
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:15,830
I was like,
I have not literally not seen this movie

18
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,950
since I saw it in the movie theaters.
I've seen bits and pieces cause it's on,

19
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:25,880
but I never just sat down to watch it.
Um,

20
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,700
for those of you who've never seen it,
he's wicked smart. He cleans the floors,

21
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,580
but he's wicked smart.
Um,

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,550
so a little bit of that,
it was crazy because that will be,

23
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,960
doesn't seem that old to me. I was
like, wow man, that's fucking movies.

24
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:45,250
21 years old. And when I was just seeing
just the shot of the skyline of Boston,

25
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:49,210
how much it's changed, um, since then

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,850
and how much it's gentrified

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,450
and gentrifying is Boston,

28
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:01,130
is that the white people became
even wider for most of those, uh,

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,450
most of those areas.

30
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,660
And then I watched the beginning of pappy
on the original with Steve McQueen and

31
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,350
Dustin Hoffman, and then I fell asleep
and just fucking woke up in Germany.

32
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,600
Um, it's not that bad, man was not that
bad a fight, but here was the problem.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,800
I landed in Munich and at a connecting
flight to Cologne and they gave me a

34
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:28,670
fucking one hour window to catch it.
An 11 hour flight.

35
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,710
And you're gonna give me a
one hour window. I was like,

36
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,300
before he even got on the plane,
I'm like,

37
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:36,160
there's no fucking way I'm going to
make that thing. Yeah. So much shit.

38
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,660
Just a context of a headwind for
11 hours and I'm going to miss it.

39
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,000
And I missed it.
So I to fucking sit there in Munich,

40
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:50,290
get the God damn airport for like
fucking three hours waiting for the last

41
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,210
little southwest flight I had to take.

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,320
It was like an hour flight, uh, up
to Cologne. Wasn't that bad though.

43
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,890
But I mean I was cracking me up.

44
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,500
It was making me think about
the way they play football now,

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,990
where before halftime
you score a touchdown,

46
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:08,770
you down by a point and rather than going
for the extra point, they do dumb shit.

47
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,430
Like they go for a two point
conversion and then they don't get it.

48
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,640
And rather than being tied up that
down by one and then the end, you know,

49
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,870
there's some county thing,
you know,

50
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,870
you're down by four points instead
of three negative score, a touchdown.

51
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,220
That was the travel version of that.
So anyways,

52
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,240
um, I gotta tell you, I don't,

53
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,210
I never think about World War
II until I come over here.

54
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,550
I watched that Ken Burns the war,

55
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,870
which was like a 90
fucking part one out each.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,680
Each one was like one
hour long about the war.

57
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,410
And every time I fly over here,

58
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,830
it's not till I get over Great Britain

59
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,260
and you just think about those spits
foe fires and the blitzkrieg and all of

60
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,150
that shit.
Winston Churchill,

61
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,780
then you've come onto the mainland,

62
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:03,550
you start thinking about the
battle of the bulge Dresden,

63
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:04,780
all of this fucking shit.

64
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:09,370
And I was actually watching
this documentary here, uh,

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,220
and it was in German, so I couldn't
tell. I was like, wow, they fucking,

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
they're also talking about world war two.

67
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:18,100
I figured they'd want to shy away from it.
You know what I mean?

68
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,340
The same way I don't watch highlights
from last year's super bowl.

69
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,310
I don't want to see those
eagles win either. Right. Um,

70
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,850
but they were talking about,
I could tell what they were talking about,

71
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,320
cause I had heard about it before,

72
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,440
is this top secret now basically a jet
that they were just on the verge of like

73
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:42,310
developing, which just would
have been a fucking game changer.

74
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,370
Like how far ahead Germany was
with all of their technology.

75
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,600
I remember hearing,
I've talked about this shit before.

76
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,940
Like if you killed the
German soldier in American,

77
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,080
you dropped your machine
gun and picked up there.

78
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,960
It says with like fucking liquid
cooled or something like that. Um,

79
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:01,900
I remember hearing some German
tank commanders saying, uh,

80
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,410
one tiger was better than three Sherman's,

81
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:08,950
but the Americans always had
four. You know, typical us.

82
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:12,130
We just treated it like a food court.
We just piled on instead of the food.

83
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,830
It was a weaponry and were able to
get 'em but some historians, so I,

84
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,960
and look up this fucking jet
first German jet World War Two.

85
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,740
Yeah, this fucking thing. And it
looked just like the spitfire,

86
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:30,100
but it had like two jet engines on it.
So the only thing I could think like,

87
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,280
well what the fuck would you do? How
quickly that thing could get up on you?

88
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,180
What would you try to be like Tom Cruise
and that drug movie we just slowed down

89
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,630
in the feds got to keep going by you.
You know,

90
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,590
I think that's works if somebody is not
trying to fucking shoot you out of the

91
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:49,510
sky. So I think that that's probably
what they focus on over here.

92
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,640
They focus on how, how good their
weapons were rather than their, uh,

93
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,520
you know,
steps in society.

94
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,760
It was called the Schmitz.

95
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,160
Me Is two six to nickname the Schwabie.

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,550
Yeah,

97
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,990
I'm sure I'm saying this phone
is German for the swallow. Um,

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,390
was the world's first operational
jet powered fighter aircraft.

99
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,250
That's what it was like.

100
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:26,251
Basically a jet powered fucking two seat
or a design work started before World

101
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,460
War II began.
But problems with the engine,

102
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,100
which means people died test in
and out. Uh, Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh.

103
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,330
Yeah,

104
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,330
the me 62 62 is faster and more
heavily armed than any allied fighter,

105
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,920
including the British oh jet powered.
Gloster meteor.

106
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,340
Oh, at that big clunky hunk of shit. Uh,

107
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,720
well I mean I shouldn't talk.
The Americans didn't have one,

108
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:02,260
but Jesus is that an ugly ass fucking
playing? The German one doesn't look bad.

109
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:05,920
It just looks like they're, uh, what
they had the English had the spitfire.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,890
I don't forget what the, we
had the Cadillac, I don't know.

111
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:11,410
I don't fucking know shit about this
stuff. But anyways, I was watching,

112
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,610
I found that,
that um,

113
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,980
that was definitely interesting and um,
you know what it is,

114
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,090
you know how they always make
fun of the ignorant American,

115
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,730
the fat American and all that Shit.
You know,

116
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:26,510
what is the through line of Conti
behavior is people getting off an

117
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:30,800
international flight and
doing that fast walk.

118
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,520
I mean, you see people cutting off
old people in all of this shit.

119
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,630
Just trying to not get in, you know,
trying to get as far up. Do, you know,

120
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:41,060
to get through customs is possible.

121
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,930
It's really fucking horrific.
Um, I always laugh thinking like,

122
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,980
where are you going? You know, where
the, where the fuck is anybody going?

123
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,670
It's already another flight in front of
you. You know we didn't, you're going to,

124
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:58,840
you're going to get there first and
you'll be first and fucking line. Um,

125
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,660
maybe it works. I don't know. I don't,

126
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:05,950
life's too short to run through a
fucking airport with your luggage.

127
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:09,730
If you're not trying to catch a plane,
you're already landed. What are you doing?

128
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:10,870
Just sit on your phone,

129
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,690
play a little fucking solitaire and
then talk to the guy up there. You know,

130
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,750
I didn't know what to say cause you
only landed where I landed in Munich.

131
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:21,140
I didn't know. Usually I have work papers
and I was sitting there thinking like,

132
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,880
ah, fuck man, I don't have any fucking
work papers and I get up there.

133
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,390
So I tried to look all chill and shit.
Right.

134
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,690
The lady doesn't ask me anything and the
guy behind her is like training of it

135
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,260
and he's like, oh, I just need some
describes him, desires, it's rising.

136
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,340
And I'm like,
he's just trained at a man.

137
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:39,820
He's just training and I'm working up
this lie in my head that I'm meeting my

138
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:43,420
wife and Cologne, Germany and she's
coming over from London. Could,

139
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,820
could it be any more convoluted?
Like really,

140
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,840
you guys are beginning of your
European vacation and Cologne. Jeremy,

141
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:50,890
do you have family there?

142
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,400
Did they just put up a new fucking
Ferris wheel with the eight Garner that

143
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:57,600
fucking giant there?
Which I didn't know existed.

144
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,370
I had no idea that fucking thing existed
until I fucking looked up things to do

145
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:05,010
in Cologne because I got
a whole day tomorrow.

146
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,810
I just want to go out and buy a pair of
fucking Adidas over here that they don't

147
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:13,620
have stateside. I'm not looking
for 20 floors a horse here.

148
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,220
Um, anyways, uh, so I make it through.

149
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,710
They stamped my passport,
I think I'm all good.

150
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:27,300
And then this fucking cop is just
like a guten tag. Hello. And I'm like,

151
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,370
Hey, what's up? He goes,
Oh, where you're going?

152
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,050
I want to be and what the fuck are you
going? Fuck you mean, what am I doing?

153
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,430
He already stamped the fucking thing.

154
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,460
So then I tell them to stupid shit
about my wife coming over. He goes, uh,

155
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,030
is this the only place you're going to
be in German? I was like, I made Cologne,

156
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:45,570
Munich, Berlin, where
else? And I'm like, Warsaw,

157
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,610
Prague hungry. And he goes, how long
are you going to be over here? I'm like,

158
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,850
until the 14th. He's like,
of January. I was like, yeah.

159
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,790
Then I'm like, and he starts
walking towards this door
with my passport. I'm like,

160
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,970
Jesus fucking Christ. Here we go. Right.

161
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,810
And then he just turns around and gives
it to me and I was just like, all right.

162
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,460
So then I text my fucking tour guy over
here. I was like, do I need work papers?

163
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,090
And he's like, no, you're all good. So
I went through that whole fucking, uh,

164
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,020
what was that movie there?

165
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,270
Okay.

166
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,300
Well that fucking guy,
he has the drugs tape to him.

167
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,770
I can't remember fucking anything.
I ended up having that moment.

168
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:24,700
I didn't even need to.

169
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,160
MMM.

170
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,330
So anyways, so I'm here. Um, uh,
um, obviously jet lag, but, uh,

171
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,860
my hours ready to go and I plan on kicking
the shit out of people right through

172
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:38,020
Europe.
And this is going to be a thrash.

173
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,080
So my only thing I need to do is I
need to get my Kiddo some shell toes,

174
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,760
get my wife some sneakers and get myself
some sneakers. And other than that,

175
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,460
all I do when I go to new countries cause
I don't like clutter is I, you know,

176
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:56,830
that little flag you buy that
people selling their coat.

177
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,410
I just buy that thing and I've
never sold them on to anything.

178
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:01,060
I just keep them in a little plastic bag.

179
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,243
MMM.

180
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,261
Which by the way,

181
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:08,010
I saw this thing where people try to
break the record to see all of the content

182
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:12,810
go to every country in the fucking
world. Um, first of all, I,

183
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:15,960
it's like what country do you come from
where your country doesn't have beef

184
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:19,230
with any other nation?
You know what I mean?

185
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,540
Jesus Christ the way that they're
fucking whack and people nowadays.

186
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,671
Um,
but anyways,

187
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:29,280
so like some people have done it by the
time they're like in their twenties.

188
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,920
Then I read this one guy, we say, sorry,

189
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,420
daddy started to do it.

190
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,760
But then after he got up to 127
countries and he realized that he wasn't

191
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:45,630
traveling, he wasn't seeing anything, he
was just going there and just, you know,

192
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,620
you know, flying all the way to China
and getting like a fucking, you know,

193
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,460
some fucking shrimp fried rice and then
just flying on to fucking Thailand and

194
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:56,170
doing whatever the fuck he did there.
You know,

195
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,750
stand next to an elephant
and take a picture.

196
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,600
So it's like not traveling is what
the guy was saying. So I don't know.

197
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,070
Am I babbling right now? I'd probably
have fucking jet lag too. Um,

198
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,500
oh my God.

199
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,160
Did you guys see I'm going to try to
get more into like pop culture to expand

200
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:16,100
the reach of my podcast. Oh my
God. Madonna went up at this,

201
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,800
this legendary gay club and showed off
what some people were staying with a

202
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,330
brand new ass.

203
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,280
It's trying to say she got acid plants.

204
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,163
All right.

205
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,960
And I'm like, okay, you know,

206
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,550
why the fuck would you get a
brand new ass in your sixties?

207
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,770
Why would you get a new ass anyways?
I don't understand that one.

208
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,360
You know what I mean? I, I don't
really understand the tits.

209
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,740
I don't understand taking anything
and putting it in your body,

210
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,400
uh, that you can't kind of get rid of.
You know what I mean? Shit it out. I mean,

211
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,010
you got fucking,
what do you know?

212
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,980
I gotta see what those fucking
things look like. But anyway,

213
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:02,170
so I'm just going like, oh my
God, she's lost her fucking mind.

214
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,420
And then I find out that she has a new
album coming out and nobody's really been

215
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:11,050
talking about her. It was fucking
brilliant. I bet it wasn't even real.

216
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,180
I bet she just went down to a joke shop.
You know, they're phony British accent.

217
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,920
Roy you to put this fake as in the
back of me pads, promote me new album.

218
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,270
MMM.

219
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,140
What's her new album's? What's his new
album called? Huh? Songs about coming,

220
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,270
something about the summit.
About something about sex.
Um, anyways, let's see.

221
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,620
Fake ass implants.

222
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,780
Let's see what these things look like.
Are these like, oh my fucking God.

223
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,490
Oh my God, what enough. All those attempts

224
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,740
thought that was somebody ass. I'm like,
why is this so much space in the bud?

225
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,980
Crec was cleavage. Um, all right,

226
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:07,780
this is just all calling out
people with butt implants.

227
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,480
This is something that guys get blamed
for it. You know, this is chicks.

228
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,510
Just this is classic check on chick
hate and they're gonna fucking,

229
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,030
they're gonna fucking trash. It's,
I want to see what it looks like.

230
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,180
Oh my God. Oh my God. What the fuck?

231
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,680
That can't be fucking real.

232
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,070
I don't understand why.

233
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:40,071
Why do people do shit like
this to themselves because
of the pressure if fucking

234
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,390
me or puts it? Is that the pressure
you gave into it? All right.

235
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:48,450
There's a lot of pressure out there to
have a full head of fucking wavy here.

236
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,960
You know, this transparent fucking
jackass doesn't give into it.

237
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:57,440
Why the fuck are you fucking
blame society? All right.

238
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,570
What do ass implants look like?

239
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,420
Yeah.

240
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,400
Google must be like, oh
my God, this guy's dumb.

241
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,130
I want to know what they look like,
people feel but implants.

242
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,050
Oh my God. That just like those
giant silicone fucking things.

243
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,950
He's fucking lazy assholes.
Just go do some squats,

244
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,200
go do some squats and just admit that
you're not fucking Jennifer Lopez.

245
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:34,370
Whoever the fuck has the
best ass right now. Um,

246
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,730
anyways, dude, I should do that.

247
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,720
I've been threatening to get hair
plugs right out here in eastern Europe,

248
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,540
eastern Europe yet,
but what I consider eastern Europe,

249
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,100
anything that was behind
the communist block,

250
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:49,560
when I go to fucking the other side
of Berlin, the east side of Berlin,

251
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm going to get some fucking take stem
cells shut in my head and I'm gonna come

252
00:15:55,201 --> 00:16:00,201
back with this ridiculous fucking
lion's mane of ginger hair.

253
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,150
And you guys are all going to be like, oh
my God, what the fuck did you guys see?

254
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,270
Bill's fucking hair plugs. And
eventually we'll be like, hey man,

255
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:12,240
he's got a new special coming out
and I'm gonna, I'm gonna fucking,

256
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,960
I mean Madonna's the master at it,
you know,

257
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,740
I'd be lucky to stick around for
half as long as she has. So, I mean,

258
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:23,670
if that's what you got to do, maybe
I should do it. You know what guys?

259
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,030
I don't watch fight club
because it triggers me.

260
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,080
It makes me not like my body and I
just feel like Brad Pitt is just,

261
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,330
he's just, he's, what do they say?

262
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,260
He's just setting the bar too high.
I can't like,

263
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,390
I just don't understand why
nobody calls these women out.

264
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:51,391
Like how fucking self involved are you
that you're looking at a movie star and

265
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:56,920
you start thinking like, Oh God,
I have to compete with that. No,

266
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,620
no,
just appreciate compete with that.

267
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:06,621
You're not even in the same fucking solar
system is that I can throw a football,

268
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:08,880
but I don't look at an NFL
quarterback and be like,

269
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:13,050
why does he have to throw it so hard?
What is there to be so accurate?

270
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,960
Um, anyways, um,

271
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,140
Jesus Christ, the Internet, my gut
comedians from a fellow comedian,

272
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,840
please stop attacking other comedians.
What are we doing?

273
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,850
We need to circle the wagons here.
Jesus fucking Christ.

274
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,830
Don't comedians get enough shit.

275
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:37,920
We're going to sit here and
fucking attack each other.

276
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,340
The fuck are we doing?

277
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,020
I feel like this is like at
the end of the Blair witch.

278
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,580
When those kids kept them,

279
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,150
ended up in the same place in woods and
they were losing their fucking minds.

280
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,340
This is what's going on. Well, I
don't, I, I, for the life of me, I,

281
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,350
I just don't understand how a
comedian could trash another comedian.

282
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,460
Um, publicly like that. I mean, amongst
your friends, you guys guys a hack,

283
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:12,390
this guy stinks, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. I like this guy. You know,

284
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,480
everybody does that.

285
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,670
And every fucking but the to go on there
and then to actually talk about what

286
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,640
subjects should or shouldn't be discussed.
I mean,

287
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,020
there's like comedians out there.

288
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,580
They sound like Tipper Gore back in the
80s when she was freaking out about hair

289
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:28,990
metal.
Um,

290
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,820
I think there's bigger problems in the
world than someone going on stage trying

291
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,750
out new jokes that he's not putting out
to the world. He's just working on them.

292
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,480
That's all that was happening.
Jesus Christ.

293
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:45,180
I think some of the fucking Shit I've
said on stage just fucking around.

294
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,350
And it leads to something.
It's, it's part of it.

295
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:53,160
So that's like somebody
saying like listening to the
first version of a hit song.

296
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,640
God, Oh my God, that fucking sucks. It's
like, yeah, well we're working on it.

297
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,320
How the fuck could somebody fucking blow?
Everybody's acting like not everybody,

298
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:08,980
but there's people out there.
They're acting like fucking my God,

299
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,760
they were acting like soccer moms.
It's just a,

300
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,680
it's just a fucking weird goddamn time.
And any ways it's hard enough.

301
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,120
Ah, right now to try to avoid a fucking
scandal. It you're not even looking for.

302
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:23,980
We don't need to be attacking each other,
right?

303
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,930
So God bless all the comedians out there.

304
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,020
God bless [inaudible] whatever the
fuck it is they're trying to do that.

305
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:31,390
Try to be funny,
you know?

306
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:34,020
And let these fucking non
comedians say what you shouldn't.

307
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:37,780
You shouldn't joke about. Let them sounds
stupid like that. Jesus fucking Christ.

308
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,580
You Remember Tipper Gore?

309
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,390
Remember that lady way back in the day?
Poor al.

310
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,650
You imagine that?
I bet he listened to all that,

311
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:51,870
but he listened to motley crew
at all of them back in the day.

312
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,450
Wish I could do a fucking Al
Gore impression. It's sync.

313
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,990
Fucking kickstart my heart,
the Al Gore voice. Um,

314
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,700
all right, let me, um, I just set
the other night at the comedy store

315
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,213
late night

316
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,230
and I was just in a stupid mood and the
piano player was laughing and I just

317
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:19,760
started playing to him and I said like
two or three fucking things that I would

318
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,390
never, I would never put in a special,
I would never ever, it was just,

319
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,810
and it wouldn't, it wouldn't even have
worked in that room at like eight,

320
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:28,580
nine o'clock at night, nine, 10 o'clock.

321
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,710
But once you go on the
other side of midnight,

322
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,010
it just becomes like a different
fucking thing now. All right.

323
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,330
If anyone were to film that,
whatever the fuck it is,

324
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:43,020
I was talking, what the fuck did
I talk about? Oh, don't say it.

325
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:46,410
Don't say I fucking say it.
Right. One of those sets,

326
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,430
if all of a sudden now somebody at eight
in the morning is eating their toast

327
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:53,020
and then somebody says it,
you know what I mean?

328
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,060
It's like for as much as a dick is,
I am, you know, if I go to church,

329
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:02,660
if I ever go to church, go like
once a fucking year when I go there.

330
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,080
I don't act the way I act at the
fucking comedy store, nor would I,

331
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,590
and I wouldn't feel like if,
if what I said at the comedy store,

332
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:14,340
I then said in a church,
if people got offended,

333
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,940
I wouldn't then feel like I was having
a Lenny Bruce moment and I was fucking

334
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:19,410
being censored.

335
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,953
Okay.

336
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,150
Yeah. There's a time and a place for
things and it's just like, you know,

337
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:27,700
to just fucking
take somebody.

338
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,200
They working on this shit,

339
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,140
doing what they're supposed to be doing
and then you take it and fucking throw

340
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,740
it in everybody's face at nine in the
morning on Twitter, every z, he said,

341
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,860
Whoa, no fucking, it's
like Jesus fucking Christ.

342
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,330
Okay.

343
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,930
I Dunno. It's a really,
people, just to let you know,

344
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,990
making jokes about really dark things a
lot of times is a way to avoid the pain.

345
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:58,610
It doesn't mean you don't care about it.
That's really the way it is.

346
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:02,690
Such like page one of comedy.
And if you don't understand that,

347
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:06,830
then you don't know what you're talking
about and you really need to stand down,

348
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,570
I think anyway, there's my little fucking
too sensitive. Jesus fucking Christ.

349
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:13,610
I cannot,
I can't fucking imagine.

350
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,320
I can't ever fucking imagine telling a
comic what the fuck they should be saying

351
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,870
on stage.
Um,

352
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,010
yet let alone trying to incite other
people who aren't Comedians to fucking

353
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,060
share that point of view.

354
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,760
MMM.

355
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,910
If I did that, evidently nowadays
I would be a progressive liberal.

356
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,050
It used to be the hardcore, right? What
is going on? The world has gone mad.

357
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:43,760
Down is up, up is down, black
is white. What the fuck? All
right. Dollar Shave Club.

358
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:46,790
And I'm not trashing anybody.
I'm just fucking say it guys.

359
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,170
Don't fucking pick on each other.

360
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,170
We're going to get enough
shit out there evidently.

361
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,303
MMM.

362
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,820
From butthurt alley over there.
All right. Dollar Shave Club.

363
00:22:56,821 --> 00:23:00,720
Everybody Dollar Shave Club has
everything you need to look, feel,

364
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:04,740
and smell your best.
You never have to go to this store.

365
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,840
If you're ever pushing a mop,

366
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:11,841
it fucking MIT and you
fucking buddy itches and you
can't fucking solve the math

367
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:15,210
problem. It's because you
didn't use a one wipe Charlie,

368
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,890
a little goodwill hunting little dollar
shave club there. That's called a Mashup.

369
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,890
I believe the kids call it a Mashup.

370
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,730
That's because they deliver everything
you need right to your door and they keep

371
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:30,870
you fully stocked on what you use. So
you don't run out. Here's how it works.

372
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:33,330
Dollar Shave Club has everything
you need to get ready.

373
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,450
No matter what you're getting ready for.
They have you covered.

374
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:40,110
Head to toe for your
hair, your skin if, okay.

375
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,440
Just say your hair and just assume that
people aren't bald who are reading this

376
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,730
really triggers.

377
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,340
And I really feel that everybody
at dollar shave club could use,

378
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:53,780
should lose their jobs so I
can feel better. Um, your face,

379
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,250
you name it,
they have it.

380
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,710
MMM.

381
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,630
And they, what do you mean? You name it?
They have it. Even child pornography.

382
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,730
I'm triggered again.

383
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,430
I need Gillette to oto apologize just
because they make shapes stuff too.

384
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:14,810
And when I see that reminds
me of this read, um, sorry,

385
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,410
that was my impression
of 2020 around September.

386
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,830
If this continues and they have this new
program where they automatically keep

387
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:23,540
you stocked up on the products you use,

388
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,610
you determine what you
want and when you want it.

389
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:28,590
And it shows up right at your
deal with, uh, from what,

390
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,900
once a month to once every six months
plus with their handsome discount.

391
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,140
The more you buy, the more
you save. And right now do,

392
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:40,520
I only shave club has a bunch of
status sets. You can try for just $5,

393
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,040
like their oral care kit.
After that,

394
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:48,020
the restock box ships regular
sized products at a regular price.

395
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,310
Get your start, start a set, uh,

396
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,490
for just $5 right
now@dollarshaveclub.com slash burr.

397
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,340
That's dollar shave club.com/bar.

398
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,540
This is how dumb I am and how bad I
wasn't math when I was watching goodwill.

399
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,220
Hunting they have is amazing.
Establishing shot, um,

400
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,140
of MIT, some sort of giant dome and
I didn't even recognize what it was.

401
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:10,190
I thought they were in Rome.

402
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,080
I thought it was some old building and
then all of a sudden he was inside mouth

403
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,900
the floor and it's like, oh, I
guess that's what MIT looks like.

404
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,180
I mean, I'd seen it. You'd drive
by, if I remember correctly,

405
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,350
you could go buy it over a bridge,
isn't it? Right off Kenmore Square.

406
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,920
You go over that bridge. But there was
always trees sort of obstructing it.

407
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,843
You know,

408
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,893
I dunno.

409
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:38,950
Math triggers me butcher box everybody.
What's your box?

410
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:43,480
Delivers healthy 100% grass fed
and grass finished beef free range.

411
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:45,640
Organic chicken at heritage bread,
pork.

412
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,560
The incredible quality of butcher box
meat starts with the commitment to raising

413
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,410
animals humanely and free
of antibiotics and hormones.

414
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,220
Cook with piece of mind knowing you
are eating healthy, high quality meat.

415
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,250
Each box comes with at least
eight to 11 pounds of meat,

416
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,190
which is enough for 24
individual size meals.

417
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,400
Unless you're a fucking binge
eat fat, fuck, then you know,

418
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,060
it's probably an overnight snack,
right?

419
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,620
To have me 12 pork chops
before I go to bed. Uh,

420
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,440
you can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken.

421
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:21,940
Beef and pork mixed box custom box,
which lets you choose your own cuts.

422
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,390
And now announcing our
new brand of protein,

423
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,390
wild Alaskan Salmon.

424
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,150
This isn't just Alaskan Salmon.
This is wild Alaskan Salmon.

425
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,410
That right. You get this. You
give this fish a couple of
shots. It's shown as tits.

426
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,030
I don't, I'm sorry. What's
your box? What's your buck?

427
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,390
They're pure sustainably harvested
salmon from Bristol Bay, Alaska.

428
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,480
Unlike any salmon you'll
find in your local stores,

429
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:55,070
how do you know it's from there? They
got a certain style, certain swagger,

430
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,910
the way they move their tail.
Literally,

431
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,710
its red color means that this salmon is
as fresh as nutrient a nutrient rich as

432
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:03,690
it gets. Oh yeah. Uh,

433
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,900
for $20 off your first box
in two pounds of free salmon,

434
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:12,110
go to butcher box.com/burn enter bur bur
that's butcher box.com and enter Burr B

435
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:17,610
u. R. R. Um, all right.
What am I up to? 27 minutes.

436
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,640
Oh Jesus. It flies by Liverpool.
Got Their first loss of the year.

437
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,290
I missed the game.
I couldn't find it here.

438
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,800
I was watching some sort of soccer over
here where they had this really small

439
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:28,980
net.
What does that indoor soccer looked like?

440
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,880
It was outside and there was some sort
of basketball going on and they were all

441
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:34,380
they were doing with speaking in German.

442
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:38,100
Everybody was talking in German and
then the crowd was chanting defense in

443
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:41,550
English. It's weird. Where are
the words that come? You know,

444
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,090
I mean, I don't know. I guess I use what
screen do I, I don't think I do. Um,

445
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,280
anyways. Yeah. So I've just been, I
couldn't find the fucking game. Uh,

446
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,460
congratulations to man city.
I didn't realize,

447
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,850
I know it was like a huge deal
when they want an understatement.

448
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,610
A few years ago that came out of fucking
nowhere and won the whole God damn

449
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:04,444
thing.

450
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,283
MMM.

451
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,950
And I guess they handled
Liverpool pretty nicely.

452
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,370
Some sort of controversial fucking goal.
I don't know what happened,

453
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,990
but the way my brain works is like,
fuck, when do we play these guys again?

454
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,620
And we got to figure out how to beat him
or are we going to lose in the playoffs?

455
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,530
And then it's just like, oh
wait, they don't have playoffs.

456
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,900
It's just the end of the year,
whoever has the most points,

457
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:28,500
whatever the fuck they call it,
which I can't quite,

458
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,630
do you get three points for
a win and one for a decision.

459
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,560
I don't fucking know dude.
I'm so fucking jet lag.

460
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,040
I just was on youtube and I think
I just learned how to play snooker.

461
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,240
Um, but anyways, then they know
they don't want to fucking play.

462
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:45,640
They could like lose to them
every time they fucking play him.

463
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,560
But still when the whole thing makes
no sense, it makes no fucking sense.

464
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,060
Anyways, I gotta I gotta kill a day
tomorrow here in Cologne, Germany. Uh,

465
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:58,570
what is there to do here? Um, is
there a good sneaker store here?

466
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,460
I don't want to go to
like the Adidas store.

467
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,960
Is there a place where they have like,

468
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,553
you know,

469
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,720
a bunch of different, like, you know,

470
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,610
Adidas that you wouldn't get at the
Adidas store, you know, like a, um,

471
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,940
a undefeated type store,
you know what I mean?

472
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,350
One of those types of stores, you know
what I mean? The ones with a super,

473
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:23,640
super fucking crazy sneaker
head type fucking people go to.

474
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:27,120
That's what I want to go to. Cause I have
to come back with some original shit.

475
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,220
I can't just come back with a pair of
run DMC looking fucking shell toes that,

476
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:35,490
you know, my wife and kid could've got
down the fucking street at the mall.

477
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,870
You know what I mean? So help me out if
you can. Uh, send me a tweet. All right.

478
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:44,350
And, uh, all right, I think
that's it. Uh, God bless you all.

479
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,050
Thank you to everybody who's coming
out to my show tomorrow night.

480
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:50,080
I'm so psyched to be over here.
What am I great friends in the world,

481
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,230
Paul Versey Club Soda Kenny.

482
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,840
We're going to have a great time over
here and thank you to everybody that's

483
00:29:55,841 --> 00:30:00,280
coming out to the shows. Um, yeah,

484
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,760
that's it. Uh, I'm really
looking forward to this and uh,

485
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,020
I don't know, it feels weird
to end on something positive,

486
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:12,300
but I think I'm going to, all right, so
have a great weekend and I'll check in.

487
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,130
I'll, I'll talk to you on
Monday. Enjoy the music.

488
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:16,780
And there'll be another half hour,
great,

489
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,720
greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon
podcasts from a, I don't know,

490
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:22,810
some fucking Thursday earlier this year,

491
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,230
four years ago. I have no idea. All right.

492
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,050
Hey,
what's going on?

493
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:22,710
It's built par and it is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

494
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,280
January 3rd,

495
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,630
2011 did you guys have a nice new years?
Hope you had a nice holiday.

496
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:31,890
Seriously before I,
uh,

497
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,590
before I say con for the first time
on a podcast this year, officially,

498
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:41,760
that one wasn't official. That was just
me stating it like in a court of law.

499
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,141
As in,

500
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:48,141
I asked the defendant where he was coming
from and he told me quote to go fuck

501
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:50,480
myself.
See,

502
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,710
now that lawyer is not saying
is saying the f word, but it's,

503
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:59,400
it's not that example. Make no
goddamn sense whatsoever. Um,

504
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,930
anyways,

505
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,680
I'll hope you guys all have
a merry Christmas and a
happy new year and all that.

506
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:09,240
Now that you're back at work, you know,
is this a way, this is a weird week.

507
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,120
This is another weird week.
Last week was the weird depressing week,

508
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,370
unless you're ray. Uh, a college
student or something or, or, you know,

509
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:18,930
a kid you live in at home or some shit,

510
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:23,310
then it's great because you got time
off from school. Everything's awesome.

511
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,580
You going sledding, right?
You make an ice balls,

512
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:29,670
you throwing them at the fat kid
down the street, right? The ice ball,

513
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:32,250
fucking snowball, right? Put
a nice chunk of ice in there.

514
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,880
You pack it with some pottery
stuff and you say, hey, fatty,

515
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,830
you want to have a snowball fight,
right? You can't. Oh my God,

516
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:42,710
they're finally including me.
Geez.

517
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,950
It's been so rough since July
when they laughed at my man

518
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,740
down at the town pool and he
thinks he's included, right?

519
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,800
I love all the mean fuck's who
are laughing at this right now.

520
00:32:53,801 --> 00:32:54,634
And then what do you do?

521
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,790
Bring them all variety. Throws a couple
of fucking Colorado snow balls now,

522
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:04,650
that powdery shed at you and then you
fucking set them up like Pat Patterson

523
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:09,651
when he took out the fucking brass
knuckles when he beat Ted DBRC for the

524
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,770
Intercontinental Championship in 1980.
But you knew that maybe it was 81.

525
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,710
I don't fucking remember.
Right,

526
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,230
and you fucking nailed that fatty right
in the side of his head. It goes down,

527
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,920
he cries half his face goes numb.

528
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,830
He gets bell palsy from laying in that
half frozen puddle and all your friends

529
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:27,240
laugh.
You don't even help him up.

530
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:32,810
And he's laying there and his dirty
orange fucking puffy coat that he just got

531
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,130
fixed

532
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,790
Christmas.
And

533
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,770
where does he go?
He goes back inside.

534
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,680
It sits down a place fucking video games
until he's 36 and that's the first time

535
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,620
he discovers craigslist,
you know,

536
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,750
with a quivering voice
and trembling fingers.

537
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:57,490
He picks up the old rotary phone.

538
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,290
I don't know where I'm going with this.

539
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,600
I think initially I was going to make fun.

540
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,940
The kids don't even do this shit anymore
because they're too busy being inside

541
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:11,470
playing video games and then just sort of
spun off to a Vignette of my childhood.

542
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,860
You know what's funny is that that
whole thing never really happened.

543
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:20,120
I was on both sides of that
snowball. Jesus, that was pathetic.

544
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,771
You know,

545
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:26,450
I think it's important in life to
remember that at some point you are on the

546
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,630
wrong side of an ice snowball.
Um,

547
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,050
am I really just going to do the mock
gave voice to just get out of every

548
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:35,420
difficult comedy moment?
I think I'm going to,

549
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,980
I've been doing it for the first
three years of this podcast. People,

550
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:40,791
do you understand that?

551
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:44,450
I am basically about a year and a half
away from being five years into this

552
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:48,830
podcast and actually getting to do a
reunion show with myself, you know,

553
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,150
thicker head of hair,
five pounds lighter,

554
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,220
just as much as a Douche.
Um, just as much of a Douche.

555
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,060
That's something in 2011. I would like
to have more sentences. That makes sense.

556
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,170
Do you guys make any new year's
resolutions? Well, I can't hear him.

557
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,120
So shut up. Are you an idiot? You
can sit there and rattle them off.

558
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,300
Look at that Goddamn cubicle.

559
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,860
You're really going to sit in that
fucking thing for another year are, yeah,

560
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,970
that's right.
Look down in shame at your belt buckle.

561
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,080
That's snazzy little belt buckle that
you bought that you thought which set off

562
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,030
your suit,
you know,

563
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,320
make people see at the gas station
standing there thinking that you actually

564
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:34,640
have some sort of a fucking desk.
Well you can look across at somebody else.

565
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,440
Will you wield the little bit of power?

566
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,910
Is it actually creeped me out? I don't
want to make somebody do something crazy.

567
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,021
It's okay.

568
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:47,640
A a cubicle is just a stepping stone to a,

569
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,980
a cubicle that's even larger.
Um,

570
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:55,340
and then one day being the final three
people to get the corner office and then

571
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:59,600
you realize that you've been replaced
by a fucking robot. Speaking of which,

572
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:04,340
I got to find this email
that somebody sent me. Um,

573
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:08,810
if I was organized, I would've heard
it blue. Now, uh, in the meantime,

574
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:13,550
my goals this year is I'm finally going
to rehab the fucking torn abdomen muscle

575
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,420
that I, that I fucked up
at a pirates game. Uh,

576
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,260
I'm going on three fucking years.

577
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,060
Three years ago I tried to show that I
could go into the pike position at 40

578
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,280
years of age.
Okay.

579
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,090
Goddamn it, I did it, but
I didn't stretch. And uh,

580
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,420
I think I talked to you guys about
this right after I did it. God Damn it.

581
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:44,220
I've been doing the podcast long enough.
Go back to like July of 2008,

582
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,211
somewhere in there.

583
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:49,860
I went to a pirates game when I was
working the Pittsburgh Improv and I wanted

584
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:53,040
to show off what great shape I was in.
And here I am three years later,

585
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:56,460
still dealing with two and a half years
later still dealing with that. Um,

586
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,600
what the hell is it? Oh,
they are watching. Yeah.
So anyways, let me, let me,

587
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,640
before I get into the conspiracy theory,
um,

588
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,860
which I took a break from in 2010 because
I wanted to actually enjoy my life.

589
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,580
Um, yeah, I want to Rehab it.

590
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,600
Anybody can give me some
web MD free advice. Come on.

591
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,790
There's gotta be a
personal trainer out there.

592
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,680
I know when you tear an abdomen muscle,

593
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:24,120
you supposed to rest it and then after
you rest it from one to four weeks

594
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,590
in court, according to my stomach
hurts and I don't know why.

595
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:33,591
Dot Com is supposed to rest it for a one
to four weeks and then begin doing some

596
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:38,970
sort of Rehab, which uh, you
know, I don't know how to do it.

597
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,440
I found just sitting there in
the plank position helps for you.

598
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:46,970
Yoga people out there. It's sorta
like the pushup position, but you're,

599
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,020
you're on your forearms. Um, that
seemed to have helped it, but I, uh,

600
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:54,270
I don't, I fucked it up the other
day and it's really frustrating.

601
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,140
It's frustrating. So anyways,
um, yeah, I want to rehab that.

602
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,970
I wouldn't want to eat better this year

603
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,670
and I want to continue to not
drink for as long as I can.

604
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:09,930
I'm going for a hundred days.
I'm going for 100 days.

605
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:14,470
In fact, listen to this. Fuck goes.

606
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,490
I went to a,

607
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,950
I went to the rose bowl this year
and I did not drink. I did not drink.

608
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:25,640
And I know there's a lot of you who are
disappointed that I didn't drink because

609
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:29,570
you want me to fill up your life with a
hilarious story of me making an ass of

610
00:38:29,571 --> 00:38:34,250
myself once again to kick off a new
year. Well, God damn it, I didn't,

611
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,170
but I stood around and watched
enough other people. Fuck it, do it.

612
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:41,920
And I still have plenty of stories and
I got the brain cells to remember them.

613
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,520
Um,
so fucking awesome game.

614
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:50,140
It was Wisconsin versus Tcu at uh,

615
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,710
how was like most people are like,
who the fuck is Tcu?

616
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,460
And then you look on the program.
Let me go grab the Rosebowl program.

617
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:02,350
Hang on one second. Just you
guys sit tight. Just relaxes.

618
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:03,900
I walk across the road,

619
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,330
drive to find the Rosebowl program.
Oh, here it is. Look at this.

620
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:11,164
I found it.

621
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,070
I really need to get in with an assistant
on this podcast. All right, I'm back.

622
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:19,700
So here's the Rosebowl
program and basically

623
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:25,640
the rose bowl this year, if you
were going to turn it into an awful,

624
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,820
you're going to turn it into
an awful made for TV movie.

625
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,930
This was a s I guess it
was a story about respect.

626
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,570
All right. In that, you know,

627
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:38,810
people barely respect Wisconsin
because they never go to the rose bowl.

628
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,210
I can't remember the last time
they won the big 10 championship,

629
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:42,380
but they finally won it.

630
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,960
They want it and they beat the
likes of, uh, let's, let's see you,

631
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,730
let's see who they'd be.
All right,

632
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:52,850
let's go through their whole
fucking season here really quickly.

633
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,030
Stop Rolling your eyes. You fucking
commy non sports fan cunt. All right.

634
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,980
Start off the year they beat Unl v. These
are the cupcake games early in the end.

635
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,730
And they beat San Jose State,
Arizona State. There is a
PAC 10 team. Austin Peay.

636
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:11,630
Who is that somebody somebody's
name. Did they play like one guy? Uh,

637
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,640
then they beat Michigan state, then they
beat Minnesota. They beat Ohio state,

638
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,290
right? Big 10 Iowa. Purdue. You've
heard of these teams? Indiana, Michigan,

639
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:24,440
one of those teams. They actually
lost two, but I went by too quickly.

640
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,970
Northwestern, you know, they
played some fucking teams

641
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,980
take, see you on the other
hand, didn't play shit.

642
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,980
Okay. Shit down there. Know,
outside of Dallas, Texas, Texas,

643
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:42,560
Christian, Oh, Jeesh is university.

644
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,040
And you wonder why no one gives a
fuck about the mountain west program.

645
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:50,530
I want you to write me and tell me
just exactly. Okay. Oregon state too.

646
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:54,350
That's PAC 10. That's Tennessee tech.
This is, they're undefeated season.

647
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:59,060
They'd beat Oregon State,
Tennessee tech, Baylor, Smu,

648
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:04,370
Colorado state, Wyoming, Byu, air force,

649
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,200
UNL, V, Utah, San Diego State,

650
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,150
New Mexico.
That was,

651
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,200
they're undefeated season and they're
sitting there scratching the top of their

652
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:16,610
fucking heads,

653
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,870
wondering why there didn't that
people are questioning their record.

654
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,700
All right, so here's the deal. I'm
sitting there going, all right,

655
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:30,470
I like this big 10 even though the big
10 isn't what it used to be considering,

656
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:33,680
they went, oh, and five on
fucking new years day. Um,

657
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,400
who doesn't like an underdog?
So I'm going, well, fuck it man.

658
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:40,440
I'm going to roof a Tcu even
though they have Christian. Oh Gee.

659
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,460
He's in the middle of their fucking
name, which, you know what that means?

660
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,890
They automatically think they're
better than everybody else.

661
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,840
And Jesus loves us best,

662
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,470
despite the fact that they're preaching
that everybody needs to be more

663
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:53,030
understanding like Jesus.

664
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,450
Somehow they missed the irony of the fact
that they feel like they're the chosen

665
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:59,690
ones. Like all stupid
fucking religions do, right?

666
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,050
Jewish people think
they're the chosen ones.

667
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,760
Christians think they are the chosen ones.
Muslim thinks that the, you know what?

668
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:11,780
You guys are all a bunch of Douche
bags. All right? None of you matter.

669
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,480
That's why there's so many of us.
If we were special,

670
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:19,430
that only be like nine of us once
there's 7 billion of anything. I mean,

671
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:23,220
we're about why we're not special anymore.
Okay? Do you understand that? Well,

672
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,910
like socks,
you know,

673
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,010
actually some poor
people can afford socks.

674
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:33,800
The socks is still important
to some people. You know,

675
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,380
I don't what the fuck
I'm saying it's a Tcu.

676
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:41,030
They got a fucking bay in their bonnet
about how nobody's respecting them.

677
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,080
So I'm sitting there, this is before I
talked to anybody from Tcu. I just saw I,

678
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,430
you know, purple and black does a decent
colors. Man, I liked those. Wisconsin.

679
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:53,780
I'm looking at all these fatties
from Wisconsin, you know,

680
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,570
walking around just horrible, horrible
shape. I think when, you know,

681
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:04,560
when Europeans look at America and they
think of of the Fat Fox, you know, I,

682
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:06,070
I think, I dunno, I think they,

683
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,400
they send away for a Wisconsin broche
university brochure every year.

684
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:16,130
I don't know what, because Jesus Christ,
those were some healthy fucking people.

685
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:17,601
All right?

686
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:21,890
Evidently the recession has not hit
Wisconsin yet because those people have

687
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:26,750
plenty of money for extra food. So
anyway, so I'm sitting there and uh,

688
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,420
we start to walk into the game,
right?

689
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,960
Me and three of my buddies were all good
and I don't name names on this fucking

690
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:37,360
thing. We go to walk into
this goddamn thing and I start
looking around after, oh,

691
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:40,790
after a wonderful tailgate.
We really did it up this year.

692
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:45,410
Plenty of booze
and which I did not partake in.

693
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,700
I brought a 12 pack of water. Go
ahead, email me, call me a fag.

694
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,890
I don't give a fuck. I feel
great. You fucking cunts. Look,

695
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,070
I'm still defensive about it, you know?
At least I'm one of those, those, those,

696
00:43:58,071 --> 00:44:03,050
I'm not a preachy, sober person. I'm not
going like, you know, why do you do that?

697
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:04,250
What are you,
what are you running from?

698
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:07,280
I know why you're doing it because it's
fucking fun. And I'd still be doing,

699
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:11,060
if my head didn't get three times
the size of its usual enormous size,

700
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:15,380
you know my head when I'm not boozing,

701
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:18,260
looks like one of the moons of
Jupiter. Okay. I don't need,

702
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,750
I don't need to continue adding to it,
you know,

703
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:27,500
and then have it be like Pluto and then
scientists can fucking debate on whether

704
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,890
or not it's a fucking planet. All right.
Fucking fucking fucking, there you go.

705
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,650
See I needed the help there.
The F word for me is, is my,

706
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,190
my, uh, uh, w what are those things?

707
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:41,430
The Hgh of my fucking comedy.
All right.

708
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:45,030
And I'll continue to use it and I don't
give a shit cause they're not banned in

709
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:49,660
my industry. Um, anyways, so
what was I saying? Alright,

710
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,310
so we had a great tailgate. We show up.
I became in the back way this, this,

711
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:56,280
this year. All right. We
parked right along the fence.

712
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,940
We were right near the clubhouse on
the golf course. And then you can,

713
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:02,680
I could literally see one of the lights,
you know that lights up the stadium.

714
00:45:02,681 --> 00:45:05,010
So we were right there. There was no
way we were getting lost this year.

715
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,630
Actually brought a frying pan,
brought some eggs. We had burgers,

716
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:15,150
hotdogs, steak. We had shit to
throw in the omelettes. Cheese,

717
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,690
everything you want. We had a spatula,
we brought tongs, we had napkins.

718
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:20,550
We had a fucking garbage bag.

719
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,370
We had a grill bag of charcoal,
four bags of fucking ice to cool.

720
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:27,260
We had every tick,

721
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,400
we had fucking core chips.
We had salsa,

722
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,930
we had two bottles of mustard.
Ho Jara fucking pickles catch up.

723
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,260
We had everything we had.
We had,

724
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,860
we had real forks and steak
knives for the stakes.

725
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:48,861
We had everything except
for a fucking table.

726
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,750
Yeah.

727
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:58,700
God, next year is going to be the per
every year two bottles of crown royal.

728
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,510
A case of fucking beer. We,
we will, we will ready to go.

729
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:04,100
We even had orange juice
for the fucking eggs.

730
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,050
We will ready to go.
And we forgot a God damn table.

731
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,060
It's one of the ways we start the day off
with one of the best fucking omelettes

732
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,520
. You ever got to have new year's Day
sitting on a golf course on a Sunny Day,

733
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,130
knowing the rest of the
Goddamn country snowed in,

734
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,390
screaming at some ticket agent that they
got to get back to Albuquerque before

735
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,660
they yak, you know, shits the bed, right?

736
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,333
Okay.

737
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,810
You forgot a God damn table,
which isn't bad when you eat an almond,

738
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,080
but when you're eating a fucking stake
that's an inch and a half thick that's

739
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:39,530
been cooked at best rare,

740
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,840
it's supposed to be
medium rare. Okay? It was,

741
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,060
it was just medium rare.

742
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,710
What happens is you got it on a paper
plate and as you use pressure to cut into

743
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:56,450
that, it creases in the middle
and you see this puddle of,

744
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,820
of, of grease. It just starts coming.

745
00:46:58,821 --> 00:47:00,740
It comes close to your
balls and then goes away.

746
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:04,610
Just like the tide coming in and
you sitting there going, you know,

747
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:08,000
I really should a just drip the rest
of this grease down into the grass,

748
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,530
kill a couple of lady bugs and then
continue on with the eating process.

749
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:14,450
But it tastes so fucking good.
You going, you know what?

750
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:16,810
I think I can do it one more
time and then you do it.

751
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,660
What happens if fucking rolls right off
onto your jeans and you haven't noticed?

752
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:25,310
I don't give a fuck what you spill,
where you spell it.

753
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:28,940
You could have your arms outstretched
if you spill any sort of liquid.

754
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,010
It not only does it land in your crotch
at lands right at the head of your Dick,

755
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,070
so it always looks like he pissed you
pants. So that's what I look like.

756
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,020
I had grease on the front of my pants.
Um,

757
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,170
I mean while I'm sitting here watching
all these Wisconsin fans walking around

758
00:47:43,171 --> 00:47:46,770
and they got these candy
striped fucking overalls,

759
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,990
they look like Richard Simmons shorts.

760
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,700
If you fucking mugged him and cleaned
out his closet of early eighties fucking

761
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:57,790
gay, his running shorts ever, and you
somehow turn them into overalls, you,

762
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,420
it'd be one thing of women were wearing
them that be kind of hot, right?

763
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,740
But there was a bunch of
guys wearing them too. They,

764
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,810
they all look like they look like it
looked like a jugglers convention is the

765
00:48:06,811 --> 00:48:09,420
best way to put it. So I'm sitting
there going, man, I liked the big 10,

766
00:48:09,421 --> 00:48:11,910
I want to root for Wisconsin.
Then every once in a while,

767
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,480
because it seemed to be like 80%,
75%,

768
00:48:15,481 --> 00:48:19,620
maybe 70 a at the smallest Wisconsin
fans. And then Tcu, so you know,

769
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:25,210
who doesn't like an underdog? So I start
walking towards the stadium, right?

770
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,470
And, uh, I'm thinking I want to go for
Tcu. Fuck this. I helped this little,

771
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:35,130
uh, mountain west, whatever. Fucking, I
didn't know what conference if from, Huh,

772
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,930
um, I hope these guys win. And, uh,

773
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,970
I start going up to the stadium and,
uh,

774
00:48:41,971 --> 00:48:45,570
one of my buddies elbows me and he turned
around and he points to these Tcu fans

775
00:48:45,571 --> 00:48:49,680
in.
This guy is wearing Brown loafers,

776
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,640
these light purple,
uh,

777
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,680
like corduroys Docker's with the Tcu
emblem and then like a v Neck sweater

778
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:04,790
and like these ray bond fucking
risky business sunglasses on.

779
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:09,040
And He,
I like if you,

780
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:12,520
if you were casting a movie,
did you guys see Facebook,

781
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:15,810
that Facebook social network? Do you
know how like the Harvard guys wear it?

782
00:49:15,811 --> 00:49:18,820
This is what this guy looked like. And
I was like, oh my, are you serious?

783
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:25,420
Is this guy an anomaly or is this
really what Tcu was all about?

784
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:29,210
My buddy literally goes to me, he goes,
that's it. I'm rooting for Wisconsin.

785
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,960
You know, I look at this fucking guy
and I, and I was sitting there going,

786
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:36,890
you know what? I think he's right. No, no,
no. Maybe it's just this one fucking guy.

787
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,040
And then I see another guy he has on a
purple fucking blazer with gold buttons.

788
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,120
Oh,
white shirt,

789
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:51,450
some polluted slugs and
low first to the game.

790
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,390
Then all of a sudden I started looking
at these. There's not all of them,

791
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,390
but a good 15% of them
are dressed this way,

792
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,520
looking like those rich kids who
fucking, you know, uh, air quote,

793
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,250
accidentally kill their date,
you know,

794
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,930
and then they say it was consensual
because she wanted rough sex too.

795
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,780
And their daddy has enough fucking
money to get them out of it.

796
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:16,440
That's what they started looking
like. So I'm like, Holy Shit.

797
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,510
Fuck this. I'm, I'm,

798
00:50:18,511 --> 00:50:22,050
I'm rooting for Wisconsin now we're
in the crush to get in the game.

799
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:27,590
And I look in front of me and
there's this pasty fat fuck Wisconsin

800
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,820
fan in front of me with the Wisconsin
had turned around and I dunno if it was

801
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,650
dry skin or Eczema,

802
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:38,990
he had a perfect band of it going
around the back of his, you know,

803
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:42,560
his hairline at the back of
his head and the flakes of it,

804
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:45,950
we're on the back of his sweatshirt.
I know. I hope you're not eating.

805
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,480
Okay. So I'm looking at
him going, oh, horrified.

806
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,950
Absolutely horrified.
And then I'm turning around.

807
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,780
I'm looking at these fucking slack.

808
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,550
In a sport coat wearing douchebags.
And at that point I didn't know who I was.

809
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,310
Four, I was actually hoping
that during the flyover,

810
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,830
one of the jets would go into the crowd
and they could just start all over again.

811
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:14,600
It was, it was horrific. Worst Group
of fans I've seen. And in three years,

812
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:18,230
granted I was sober this time and
I could actually remember this.

813
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,920
So I go into the stadium,
right. And, uh, Lo and behold,

814
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:26,150
I'm in the TCU section,
right? And I'm like,

815
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,650
okay,
uh,

816
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,630
I dunno if I liked this and
I just, and I'll sign it to
here. Start here. Take, see

817
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:38,230
this girl like three rows
back, Jay. Yeah. Come on.

818
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,910
Come on. Frogs. And I go, frogs.

819
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:48,470
They're the fucking, I didn't know what
they were. We got to give it to Wisconsin.

820
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,490
Badger is a Badass.
Fucking m TCU horned frogs.

821
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,450
Okay. And that their mascot, look,

822
00:51:56,451 --> 00:52:00,230
I don't need it looks like something
I'd like to that star wars bar scene,

823
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,990
you know, and against
go frau come, I'll tasty

824
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,860
tasty you. And I'm looking at the girls
and they, uh, they, they have their jeans

825
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:16,220
tucked into their cowboy
boots, like they're in that
band, great white, you know,

826
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:20,630
and then on top they have like these
dime store Dolly Parton cowboy hats on.

827
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:25,130
And I was like, oh my God, I fucking
hate these people. And at that point,

828
00:52:25,131 --> 00:52:28,520
and I was sitting right in the middle
of them and I immediately just became a

829
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:31,760
Wisconsin Fan. Now, in defense of Tcu,

830
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:35,390
I think if I was hanging in the
Wisconsin section, I would route,

831
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,160
I would have rooted for Tcu.

832
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,040
I would have ruled for Tcu in the middle
of me just screaming that tacy Gee,

833
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:42,921
who come out frogs.

834
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:47,210
I can't tell if Nia just laughed or
the guy downstairs yelled at me, oh,

835
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:51,710
that's a dog. Okay, my
fault. Or it's Mel Blanc.

836
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,510
Um, good. Anybody imitate a dog barking
better than that guy. Um, anyways,

837
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:01,790
let's plow ahead here. Uh, so
then I just sat there and, uh,

838
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,260
just was rooting for Wisconsin and
I just want it and I, and I, I just,

839
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,800
another thing too that it's really
fucking annoying about TCU fence.

840
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:15,730
Okay is no matter what's
going on during the game,

841
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,840
they have a reason to fucking
put their hands in the air. See,

842
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:23,690
can't see the fucking game.
Anytime it was third down,

843
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,040
they had this gay little thing where you

844
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,230
know,
you make the a Amo k sign,

845
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,480
they would do that signifying third down
and then they would just sort of shake

846
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:38,481
their hands like you just in case you
don't know what town and everybody,

847
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:44,610
so it's like third down and anybody who
watches football knows third down is a

848
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:48,870
really important fucking
down as a fan who played,

849
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,430
have paid a fuckload for the ticket.

850
00:53:50,431 --> 00:53:54,210
You want to see what happened and these
fucking idiots is so busy going to the

851
00:53:54,211 --> 00:53:56,640
loo. You couldn't see anything. Then,

852
00:53:56,641 --> 00:54:01,500
not to mention there's fat whore in
front of me who from the size of her

853
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,970
should've been a Wisconsin fan. But then
again, I've been to Houston, Texas. Okay.

854
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,130
Those people like their barbecue to the,

855
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,770
these are the people that
really make America look bad.

856
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:13,020
It's the fucking middle of the country.
You got damn people.

857
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:15,450
I don't know what your problem
is because you're landlocked.

858
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:19,950
Don't they have swimming pools where you
people could do a couple of laps people

859
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:24,480
on the coasts or in shape. All right.
Seattle. All the way down to San Diego.

860
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:28,110
These mother fuckers are
in shape. Go ahead. Yeah.

861
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:33,300
San Diego grew right up the
coast. Los Angeles, San Francisco,

862
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:39,110
or a Portland, Oregon. They're in shape.
A Seattle. They're in shape. Vancouver.

863
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,090
I even leave the country and
they're fucking had shape.

864
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,870
You start getting out there in Nebraska.
Our Wisconsin.

865
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:53,530
Huh? Fucking people are, are,
are horrific other than Florida.

866
00:54:53,531 --> 00:54:56,470
Florida doesn't count. All right.
Florida is a, I don't know what it is.

867
00:54:56,471 --> 00:54:58,810
It's like the ball bag, but he
says, it looks like a dick to me.

868
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:03,430
It looks like a fucking 56 year old.
Scroll them. Just hang in there.

869
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,720
Um,
after the Dick got lopped off anyways,

870
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:12,220
so they handed out the like, like them
doing that third down thing wasn't enough.

871
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:16,510
They handed out these fucking
little purple like rags.

872
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,890
Okay. First of all, stealing from the
Pittsburgh Steelers, the terrible towel.

873
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,490
They steal that.
And then on them it said fear of the frog,

874
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,760
which they stole from a
Maryland fear the turtle,

875
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,053
right?

876
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,260
The first school to actually
admit that they have a bad name,

877
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,120
a bad mascot fucking name.

878
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:41,920
So then what they would this fucking fat
whore in front of me. I swear to God.

879
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:45,780
Every God damn play.
Okay.

880
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,820
Her fucking team would be,

881
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:53,280
we had ends on seats were was in the
other end zone at Wisconsin's 10 yard line

882
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:56,670
trying to drive in for a score.
Okay. They're, they're 90 yards away.

883
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:57,900
If you're standing on the goal line,

884
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:02,400
forget about being 40 50 fucking rose
up in the Goddamn Stan and she would be

885
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:06,700
sitting there as she's talking to a
friend too. That's what killed me.

886
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,820
Classic brought it again. She sitting
there shooting the shit. You know,

887
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,710
she probably went there for the tournament
of fucking roses and she just kept

888
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,620
and I finally,
I tapped her on her fleshy shoulder

889
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:21,520
and she immediately took it. As I
was saying, put it down. I said,

890
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:25,900
can you just wave the, can you wave
it more in your like in front of you?

891
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:30,220
Which this is the funniest thing ever.
She does.

892
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,080
And immediately realizes that when she
does it, she can't see the fucking game.

893
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,050
Welcome to my world,
you fat whore.

894
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,200
That's what I've been dealing with
for the last three fucking quarters.

895
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:45,940
So then what she did was she then
switched into her left hand. Okay.

896
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:50,350
Because not only is she a fat
whore, she's a dumb fat whore. Okay.

897
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,840
And the first moment when I
tapped her, she was like, oh,

898
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:55,810
this guy must be a Wisconsin fan,
you know,

899
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:01,270
because he's telling me to put it down.
Then she realizes, oh, it's in his way.

900
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,170
Then she waves it in front of her face
and realizes, oh, now I can't see.

901
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,580
And you would think at that point light
would dawn on our fucking fat head.

902
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,690
And she'd be like, oh, I get
it. If I waved this thing,

903
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:19,700
people behind me can see the fucking
game. Not this fat whore, not this one.

904
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:24,170
She fucking puts it in the left hand
and starts waving like that. Like,

905
00:57:24,171 --> 00:57:25,130
that's the solution.

906
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,480
Like she doesn't notice that there's
another fucking 80,000 fans to her fucking

907
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,290
left. It was the worst. And it's
times like those where I just a

908
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,670
times like, those were made for
taster's choice. Remember that coffee,

909
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,420
which is brew up a Nice Hot Pot and you
just dump it right over a fucking head.

910
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:45,290
That's what I would've liked in a
perfect world. And as she screamed

911
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,360
from the scalding Burns, um,
she would collapse afterwards.

912
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:55,400
So maybe pass out either way, she would
be out of my wife and I gotta tell you,

913
00:57:55,401 --> 00:58:00,401
that would be the equivalent of three
normal Americans who live on the coasts,

914
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:01,820
who lived near the ocean.

915
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,450
Hey, you know what? I just realized that's
how I'm gonna make my million dollars,

916
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,370
my multimillion dollars,

917
00:58:08,371 --> 00:58:11,640
so I can parachute out of this goddamn
business I've been trying to come up with.

918
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:13,883
Yeah.

919
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:17,290
Um, some bullshit that I could
sell for 1995 late at night.

920
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,830
And I think I just did,
you know,

921
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,530
I'm going to sell, I'm going to sell, uh,

922
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,680
ocean water and little
salt shakers for 1995.

923
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:35,620
That's what I'm going to do and
I'm just going to go, you know,

924
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,320
have you ever noticed how,
you know,

925
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:42,130
people who live on the coasts of
this country are in shape? You know,

926
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:44,830
and now I'm now just show a bunch of good
looking people running down the street

927
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:47,830
with their knees nice and high,
like the Wisconsin fucking marching band,

928
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:51,490
which was the shit,
um,

929
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,970
just running down the fucking street,
you know, high stepping it and then, uh,

930
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,320
the white version of high stepping,

931
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,890
which is basically bring our knees up
to our waist as opposed to the Grambling

932
00:59:01,891 --> 00:59:05,390
black version where you basically,
you know, you're, you're, you,

933
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:09,180
you couldn't do it in a dome stadium
because you would break your fucking toes.

934
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:17,040
Okay. Whatever. Black
people were trying what?

935
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,470
Try It anyways. So, uh,

936
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,180
yeah, I would, I would sell it and I would
just say, and then you get, if you know,

937
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,250
are you tired of being fat
in the middle of the country?

938
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:28,760
And just so somebody who sit in a bunk,

939
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,780
taking a bite out of it and then just
look into the camera, like, you know,

940
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:36,130
throwing their arms up like, Ooh, yeah,
I am sick of being a fat fuck, you know,

941
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,550
you know, they have sent a bunch on the
east coast, why are on the west coast?

942
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,460
Why aren't they fat fucks?
And I'll just, I just spin it.

943
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,070
It's because they live
near the ocean and it,

944
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:50,250
they're smelling that salt water in the
air and I just make up a bunch of shit.

945
00:59:50,651 --> 00:59:53,390
I'll pay off some fucking
people in the FDA. Uh,

946
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:56,620
it doesn't seem like a hard thing to
do considering half the drugs that get

947
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,160
approved nowadays, and I'll just say
it's because of smelling salt water,

948
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:04,840
air that you're able to eat Cinnabon and
shut off those fucking pounds. And A,

949
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:07,000
I'll sell it like little
bottles of fucking colognes,

950
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:10,240
every fatty in the fucking
Midwest and I'll make my money

951
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:16,190
and then I'm going to move to Denmark
and I'm going to pay 90% taxes yet have

952
01:00:16,561 --> 01:00:18,180
free health insurance.

953
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,380
And, uh, you know, when a little vesper,

954
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,490
I'm going to go around
those little fucking, a

955
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,390
little streets out there. I'm trying
to put together a Scandinavian tour,

956
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:32,890
by the way, this year. I'm really looking
forward to that. Um, so there you go.

957
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:36,130
You know, something like you, I also
lost interest halfway through that.

958
01:00:36,131 --> 01:00:41,110
So that was the rose bowl for me
this year. I didn't drink. I had a,

959
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,500
uh, I had a fucking awesome
time. I remember the game.

960
01:00:44,501 --> 01:00:48,510
Congratulations to tasty
you. Let's go. Proulx.

961
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:51,340
Congratulations to you.

962
01:00:51,341 --> 01:00:56,020
A horribly horribly dressed human
beings just horribly dressed.

963
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:00,580
Trash, white trash is the only way
to describe what I saw out there.

964
01:01:00,581 --> 01:01:04,660
You guys really looked like you
never left the Greater Dallas area.

965
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,980
Um, you're not going to go out
on limb here. And I would say,

966
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:11,500
I'm never going to get an opportunity
to perform at that school.

967
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,740
And if I ever get an offer,
I'm going to be really suspect of it,

968
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,850
thinking that they actually listened to
this podcast. Oh my God, the dime store.

969
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:24,910
Fucking, oh, every, the woman,

970
01:01:24,911 --> 01:01:28,810
women all dressed like the Dolly Parton
movie. Best little whorehouse in Texas,

971
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:33,100
except they were serious. They probably
put out my best hat for this one.

972
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,880
I saw a guy actually took a picture
of him. What did I zoom into them?

973
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:41,140
I have some video. I got to give
it to my web guy, um, of this guy.

974
01:01:41,141 --> 01:01:46,141
He was dressed in a suit with a big
black Stetson looking like fucking a JR

975
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:50,460
Ewing standing. You know, if it was
the early eighties, I went, well,

976
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:53,980
he would've looked good, you know,
but it's fucking 2011, dude, it's,

977
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,390
it's time to let that go.

978
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,860
You're fucking oil man slash coke dealer.

979
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:04,720
Look from fucking 1981 30 years later,
you're still rocking.

980
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,290
That look like dead serious,
dead serious.

981
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:12,160
These are the kinds of people that think
like there's, you can cure homosexuals,

982
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:17,080
you know, and uh, you know,
like one of those countries,

983
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:19,060
singers like need a hit.

984
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,440
So they just write a song about
how great America is and that too.

985
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:25,890
And the fans are too dumb to see through
the fact that they're just trying to

986
01:02:25,891 --> 01:02:30,150
make money. You know, I lock American.

987
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:32,190
If you don't lock,
get the fuck out

988
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,400
cause it's the best goddamn nation,

989
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:38,250
even though the schools are
going down the shitter. Um,

990
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,610
and just ignoring everything speech.
Speaking of which, I got a great

991
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:48,400
underrated overrated here this week
that somebody sent in and you know,

992
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,870
you guys know I'm a moron, so I couldn't
put it any better than this guy.

993
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,980
Um, this guy says overrated. The
New Year on TV, every fucking year.

994
01:02:58,981 --> 01:03:03,180
All these celebrities come on and
say how amazing the New Year is.

995
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,110
How is it?
How is it any more amazing than the last?

996
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:11,520
The population is still rising and people
are just getting more fucking stupid

997
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:15,030
and fat. You know, for comedic
purposes, you sort of said more fat,

998
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:19,500
more fucking fat and stupid. See the
alliteration, but fucking stupid if fat,

999
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:24,040
you know, that's just like, you know,
after you've gone down the roller coaster,

1000
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,330
you've gone down ticking the big drop
that you get those little ones that don't

1001
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:29,550
even scare you,
those little bunny hills.

1002
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,500
But if you say more fucking fat
and stupid fucking fat, fuck,

1003
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,190
you get two of those in a row.
That's like,

1004
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:39,750
that's like going right down the big
one. Um, anyways, I'll help you out here.

1005
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:42,720
The population is still rising and
people are getting more fucking fat and

1006
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:45,480
stupid.
The banks are still stealing our money.

1007
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:50,940
Our money spelled are our money. And
uh, and the politicians still lie.

1008
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,720
I don't see how it is anything
more than depressing and pathetic.

1009
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:59,100
Loved your special. Thank you.
Um, yeah, I agree with you.

1010
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:02,160
100% agree with you. Um, to the point.

1011
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:05,700
It's so fucking depressing that I just
got a dog a couple of years ago because

1012
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:11,130
no one else seems to give a shit.
Um, and in that, the line of that,

1013
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,670
uh, here's some, here's some
conspiracy theory for you.

1014
01:04:14,671 --> 01:04:16,770
Somebody said bill that they uh,
he wrote,

1015
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:19,890
they are watching and um,

1016
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,430
I got trashed for talking
about conspiracy theory.

1017
01:04:23,431 --> 01:04:27,990
I've been trashed for talking about
those automated checkout lines in the

1018
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:32,640
grocery store and saying that I'm paranoid
and I'm afraid of technology and all

1019
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:36,660
this technology's just going to help
my life and make my life more easier.

1020
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:41,460
And why don't you trust these big fucking
corporations basically is to shit.

1021
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,790
The people who have given me the same
way people gave me shit for trashing the

1022
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:48,210
jets saying that the jets,
you know,

1023
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:51,390
haven't done anything so I don't know
why they're fucking Superbowl favorites.

1024
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,390
What? Because the coach said they're going
to win every fucking game. Not this is,

1025
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,790
this is the best way I can
sum up. Rex Riley, rex, Ryan,

1026
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:01,380
Rex Ryan is the Tila
Tequila of NFL head coaches.

1027
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,740
Famous for nothing in particular.

1028
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,250
He's never won anything yet.

1029
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:11,640
Everybody knows who he is and is hanging
on his words like he has something to

1030
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,740
fucking say.
What?

1031
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:18,950
Cause he dropped 9,000 f bombs
on Hbo is famous for that.

1032
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,610
He wore a wig and a press conference
and we found out he has a foot fetish.

1033
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,150
Oh yeah.
Toss some right in there with chuck Noll.

1034
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:29,760
Yeah.

1035
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,400
Fucking ridiculous. By the way.
Speaking of that, the fuck,

1036
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:35,850
did you know the Steelers
finally looked like the Steelers?

1037
01:05:35,851 --> 01:05:38,250
I thought that they were going to look
like when ruthless burger came back.

1038
01:05:38,251 --> 01:05:42,300
That is a scary ass team. And I know
they were just playing the browns,

1039
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:46,830
but when a Polamalu comes in,
the is playing,

1040
01:05:46,831 --> 01:05:48,690
it's an entirely different team.

1041
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:52,410
So all you jet fans out there who
are excited that you beat that team.

1042
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:55,980
I'm telling you, that's a
different fucking team. Um,

1043
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:58,950
I'm not even excited that
the Patriots beat them.

1044
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,700
Um, because, uh, I just
don't think that this,

1045
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:06,310
the Steelers are now
starting to click and a,

1046
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:10,090
they remind me of a certain giant team
from a few years ago that no one was

1047
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:13,540
really paying attention to and all of
a sudden got hot in December and Lo and

1048
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:16,390
behold, beat the 18 and
oh patriots. So, uh,

1049
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,180
oh. And speaking of that, my season
long bet with Paul [inaudible],

1050
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,420
um, I want it. I'm psyched. I want it. Uh,

1051
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:32,990
I basically rattled off six victories
in a row against the spread and put Paul

1052
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,080
versary Paul Versey out of his misery.
You know,

1053
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,850
the poor bastard the entire year really
felt like he was gonna beat me just

1054
01:06:41,851 --> 01:06:44,150
because I had never,
I,

1055
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:49,180
I never really gambled cause I did it
like fucking in 1989 that's the one.

1056
01:06:49,261 --> 01:06:52,860
And only time I did it,
I had season tickets to the patriots.

1057
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,400
We made the playoffs the year before and
all of a sudden we were five and 11 and

1058
01:06:56,401 --> 01:06:59,940
I was like, fuck this. I'm getting
some of my money back for, you know,

1059
01:06:59,941 --> 01:07:02,130
shelling out 250 bucks for season.
Yeah.

1060
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,320
Tickets. That's what you could
get back in the day before ESPN.

1061
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,740
Overhyped every sport and people who
don't even like sports or going to games

1062
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:11,410
now. So, uh,

1063
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,120
uh, yeah, I want to get
some of my money back.

1064
01:07:15,121 --> 01:07:18,570
And I remember the buffalo bills right
before they became the buffalo bills.

1065
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:20,160
They had all those guys,

1066
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,410
they were a year away from
going to their first Superbowl.

1067
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,573
MMM.

1068
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,220
You know, four in a row when in
for AFC championships in a row.

1069
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,460
One of the most underrated accomplishments
ever. You know, basically cause it got,

1070
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,030
because he lost four super bowls in
a row. So I mean, what do you expect?

1071
01:07:36,031 --> 01:07:40,170
But anyways, I decided to bet the
fucking buffalo bills that year.

1072
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:43,680
This is off on memory.
This is what gambling does.

1073
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:47,010
And I remember that was the one fucking
week to Goddamn patriots showed up at

1074
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,690
one the game.
So I couldn't even enjoy it

1075
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,330
and I lost like 50 bucks,

1076
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:57,070
which when you're only making
125 a week is a tremendous blow.

1077
01:07:58,330 --> 01:07:59,470
So I never bet again,

1078
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:03,550
I never gambled against the spread for
like until this year I had Paul Versey

1079
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:05,680
who you know, has been
doing it for years. Go

1080
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:10,220
Dude. I called it, I did this. I did
that. You got beat by a guide. Yeah.

1081
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:15,050
Damn nerd. I'm just breaking your balls
park cause I know you're listening.

1082
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,070
I know you'll

1083
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,120
listen. All right, so they would go,

1084
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,610
I almost went 500 for the
year against the spread,

1085
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,480
which from what I've been told is,
is, is pretty goddamn decent. So yeah,

1086
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:31,250
I'm patting myself on the back. Um,
anyways, let's plow ahead here. Um,

1087
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:33,210
so I have to get in trash for all,
you know,

1088
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:37,740
talking shit about all these corporations
and actually having the audacity to

1089
01:08:37,741 --> 01:08:42,210
think that bankers, we're all trying to
team up and have one World Bank, you know,

1090
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:47,990
to become the loan sharks for not for
not only individual but actual countries.

1091
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:50,683
Okay.

1092
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,450
Which is something that I was thinking
about when I was at the Rose Bowl stone

1093
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:59,440
sober and I was sitting there on the
golf course and I was looking at these

1094
01:08:59,441 --> 01:09:04,441
houses up on up on the ridge of this
hill that actually looked down on,

1095
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,240
on the Rose Bowl,
the granddaddy of them,

1096
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:09,640
all of these people have a
house that looks down on it

1097
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,900
and I was actually envisioning that
those were all bankers up there.

1098
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:19,660
And while the game was going
on in 104,000 people or 96,000,

1099
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,300
whoever showed up for that game,
we're sitting there going fucking crazy.

1100
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:26,980
One of those pieces of Shit bankers up
there could put his hand on his son's

1101
01:09:26,981 --> 01:09:31,090
shoulder and be like, see all those people
down there, they all, all of us money,

1102
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,570
they all owe me money,
son.

1103
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,930
I'm getting a piece of all of their
fucking paychecks and they don't even know

1104
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:43,720
it. They don't even know that their
daddy is looking down on him right now.

1105
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:45,910
Now,
had I been drinking

1106
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:52,260
that thought would have probably
caused me to, uh, you know,

1107
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:55,620
entertain the thought of climbing up that
hill and thrown a rock through one of

1108
01:09:55,621 --> 01:09:58,650
the windows, which of course I wouldn't
have done because even my drunkest I am,

1109
01:09:58,651 --> 01:10:03,180
I am aware that I don't want to go to jail
and get raped. And secondly, I really,

1110
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:04,760
I'm not going to go all the
way up that fucking help.

1111
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:08,010
So what I would've done is I probably
would have yelled at that kid with the

1112
01:10:08,011 --> 01:10:12,570
light purple slacks. I would've commented
really loud about that dude's fucking,

1113
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:16,020
uh, Eczema flaking off into the
back of his goddamn sweatshirt.

1114
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,640
Um, so anyways, this guy sends
me this email and he says,

1115
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:25,200
build the days in this blog. When I
say they are watching our big business,

1116
01:10:25,201 --> 01:10:29,100
not the Illuminati, but they are just
as evil as any bank or secret society.

1117
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,580
They don't even need your signature.
Listen to this shit.

1118
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:37,680
They don't even need your signature for
these information gathering trader where

1119
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:42,600
programs to monitor everything from where
the device is to what your heart rate

1120
01:10:42,601 --> 01:10:47,550
is. Thanks for giving me something
to look forward to on Mondays. Also,

1121
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:50,970
I like your Christmas tree.
You should turn it into a walking stick.

1122
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:56,190
Now that the holidays are over, you guys
are so dumb. You guys are buying shrubs.

1123
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,710
Do you realize that?
Look out your window and look at trees.

1124
01:10:58,711 --> 01:11:00,780
You can see the trunk he had dumped Fox.

1125
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:07,650
It's like, you know, you're morons. Look
at a shrub. Can you see the d, The d?

1126
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:12,560
You can't. You're buying shrubs that are
pruned into the shape of Christmas tree.

1127
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:14,040
I had information from an

1128
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,700
actual fucking guy last week. All
right? I bought a Christmas tree.

1129
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:20,880
You brought a Christmas shrub.
She go fuck yourselves.

1130
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,970
But I liked this guy because he
sends me his, what his trader where.

1131
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,460
That's the question I had.
Um,

1132
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,560
you digital camera may embed metadata
into photographs with cameras,

1133
01:11:31,891 --> 01:11:34,470
serial number or your location.

1134
01:11:34,471 --> 01:11:38,310
Your printer may be incorporating a
secret code on every page at prince,

1135
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:42,690
which could be used to
identify the printer and
potentially the person who used

1136
01:11:42,691 --> 01:11:46,830
it. Now, now the fucking morons, the
sheep out there, it'd be like, yeah,

1137
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,140
that's in case she
threatened the president.

1138
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,280
They're just doing it for
the good of all people. Um,

1139
01:11:53,281 --> 01:11:56,160
if apple puts a
particularly creepy patent,

1140
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:01,130
I guess Apple's applying for this as
a recently applied for the use, um,

1141
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:01,921
for,
um,

1142
01:12:01,921 --> 01:12:06,480
you can look forward to a day when
your iPhone may record your voice.

1143
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:10,410
Take a picture of your location,
record your heartbeat,

1144
01:12:10,411 --> 01:12:13,260
and send that information
back to the mothership.

1145
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,520
This is trade aware devices that
act behind your back and portray,

1146
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:23,160
portray your privacy. Now this is what
the moron sheep are going to be to say,

1147
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:27,840
well, if he ain't doing nothing
wrong, what's the problem?

1148
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,180
That's,
that's the philosophy.

1149
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,330
That was the philosophy behind why
they can record your phone calls. Now,

1150
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,220
if he ain't doing nothing,

1151
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:41,020
we're tacy you come on frogs
gate doing nothing wrong.

1152
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:47,380
Do you realize how fucking
dumb that mindset is?

1153
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:49,660
So basically,

1154
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:53,890
as long as you do what the people
in power tell you what to do,

1155
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,600
you won't have a problem.

1156
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,350
Do you understand how dangerous that is?

1157
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:06,080
Do you understand how fucking stupid it
is to have that level of faith in the

1158
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:08,970
people who rule you?
You know what I mean?

1159
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:16,550
Eh, you haven't noticed how much
power can fuck somebody over.

1160
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:20,330
Like for some reason we only seem to
focus on when celebrities get famous and

1161
01:13:20,331 --> 01:13:23,690
then they wig out and start
becoming these fucking mini tyrants.

1162
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:28,691
For some reason people don't feel they
just have like this because they waved

1163
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:32,900
the flag and they and they play those
songs that make you choked up that they

1164
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:36,170
never feel like that they'll have
any sort of ulterior motive for this.

1165
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:41,380
This is the type of technology that allows
a small group of people to take over

1166
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:44,744
the world.

1167
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:50,770
Something that's sociopath's have been
trying to do since the beginning of time

1168
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:55,880
and they were never able to do it
because at some point your army would be

1169
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:58,610
stretched too thin,
right?

1170
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,030
Germans the fuck at Roman empire,
all that shit.

1171
01:14:02,031 --> 01:14:04,610
At some point the fucking Japanese,
all of them,

1172
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,320
everybody who's ever
tried to fucking do it,

1173
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:10,820
at some point it gets stretched too thin.
So America,

1174
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:11,654
what we've done,

1175
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:13,060
yeah,

1176
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,060
is we then we, we've, we've done the,

1177
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:19,570
we're putting this base here to protect
you thing, that brilliant thing.

1178
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:24,070
That's how we got our world empire.
So we just have a base.

1179
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,370
Then also we have these insane
weapons where we can nuke everybody.

1180
01:14:27,371 --> 01:14:29,920
So we were able to kind of do it that way.
But the problem is,

1181
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:35,190
is when you really get into sociopathic
thought and just like those people who

1182
01:14:36,191 --> 01:14:41,191
are so into power that it makes
their dick hard is they want to know,

1183
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:43,810
they want to be able to see everybody,

1184
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:48,610
know what they're thinking and know what
they're doing at all times because not

1185
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:49,421
only they psychos,

1186
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:53,260
but with that level of power becomes
this unbelievable level of paranoia.

1187
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:57,040
Like those people with those houses
sitting on the ridge looking down into the

1188
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:00,600
Roosevelt, there's a fear. Like we sit
there looking up at it, go look at,

1189
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:01,600
they got the fucking world.

1190
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:06,760
There was a fear of when you attain that
level of wealth, of losing all of it,

1191
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,750
and you've,
you begin on this,

1192
01:15:10,751 --> 01:15:15,070
this quest to quiet your mind,
you want,

1193
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:20,071
you want to get a level of wealth
and control in your life that you are

1194
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:26,101
guaranteed that it will never go away in
your lifetime or your kids' lifetime or

1195
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:27,550
your kids' kids.

1196
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:32,080
So basically everybody that you know and
love will be okay and you will be okay.

1197
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:37,510
You get into that psychotic
fucking mindset and uh,

1198
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,550
you give those kinds of people this level
of fucking technology and you're going

1199
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:45,710
to have a problem. I think that's
unbelievable, but that, this shit is,

1200
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:48,380
so they have this, this website here, uh,

1201
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:52,070
the eff electronic frontier
foundation that is trying to fight

1202
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:57,780
these things being put into, into
the, the tech, you know, the cameras,

1203
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,430
the cell phones and all that shit.

1204
01:15:59,431 --> 01:16:02,430
Like the fact that there's a
tracking device in your cell phone.

1205
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,740
Like how come we didn't
get to vote on that?

1206
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,260
How come we don't get to
vote on that type of stuff?

1207
01:16:08,261 --> 01:16:12,040
I don't want people knowing where the
fuck I am at all God damn times. Okay?

1208
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:16,720
And I don't need you to show me, Oh, we
cut this fucking child molester with that.

1209
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:20,170
So because of that, now everybody has
to be like, give me a fucking break.

1210
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,800
They always have like, you
know that there's, you know,

1211
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:26,920
a handful of good examples for
that level of fucking control.

1212
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,870
And then there's a zillion bad ones.
So I am 100% against the shit.

1213
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:37,430
And um, there's always been evil
people in the fucking world.

1214
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:41,810
There's always going to be evil fucking
people in the world. And when you get,

1215
01:16:41,811 --> 01:16:45,260
when you have this kind of technology that
you're going to, you're going to stop.

1216
01:16:45,261 --> 01:16:46,730
They're going to stop small,
evil,

1217
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:49,920
like individual,
you know,

1218
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:56,170
a fucking a serial rapist. What? You
definitely want to stop, all right?

1219
01:16:56,890 --> 01:17:01,890
But the price we're going to pay is
you're going to allow a Stalin or a Hitler

1220
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:03,880
Pol Pot,

1221
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,580
whoever the fuck you wanted that you're
going to leave you with that level of

1222
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:11,581
technology up to someone like that could
get in power and run the fucking world.

1223
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,340
So, you know, I don't know. And I, I

1224
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,070
totally 100% believe that you could
roll all your fucking eyes all you want.

1225
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:21,110
I honestly believe that.

1226
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:25,250
And I also believe that the reason why
there's so many of us right now and that

1227
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:30,251
the people at the top are not fucking
concerned about it is because we're all

1228
01:17:30,871 --> 01:17:35,520
expendable. And when the waters rise up,
the temperatures goes up and everything,

1229
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,290
they're not going to be
the ones who are drowning.

1230
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:40,920
You can guarantee that they use in our
taxpayer money to build some sort of

1231
01:17:40,921 --> 01:17:45,330
something to make sure that they're okay.
And I think that their bail out plan,

1232
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:47,460
because they know they can't
stop people from fucking,

1233
01:17:47,461 --> 01:17:52,461
because it feels too goddamn good and
Dixon pussies are readily available to

1234
01:17:52,681 --> 01:17:54,960
anyone. It's like air, you know?

1235
01:17:56,530 --> 01:18:00,460
So I think what they're going to gradually
do is phase us out with robots and

1236
01:18:00,461 --> 01:18:04,210
automated shit,
which is why I refuse to use it now.

1237
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:06,010
How fucking crazy do I sound right now?

1238
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,400
Has there been anything funny
in the last fucking five?

1239
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:12,410
This is shit that I truly believe.
You know,

1240
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:15,200
corporations own like the
DNA of a grizzly bear.

1241
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,010
That's why they don't give a fuck
that they're cutting down its habitat.

1242
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:21,980
They're like, I will fucking
grow another one in a petri dish.

1243
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:27,520
We're trying to take over
everything and then wipe out.

1244
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:30,370
I think they're going to try to wipe
out the poor and the middle class.

1245
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,000
Keep a couple of us,
like a small handful of us.

1246
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:39,190
You know the way that pandas are only in
like a zoos at this point or some shit.

1247
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:41,850
I don't know. Maybe I picked the wrong
fucking animal, but that, that's,

1248
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:45,490
that's the direction I think it's going.
All right. This is your first crazy rant,

1249
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,980
which was based mainly in gut feelings
in a couple of emails. But, um,

1250
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:55,300
I truly believe that
and I've browsed through enough,

1251
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:58,300
enough history, a Cleo, what's up.
