00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:03.803
<i> - Emily Yep has been
 operating her antique shop,</i>

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.972
<i> Magnolia and Willow,
 in the Long Beach area,</i>

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.007
<i> for over five years,
 but lately,</i>

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.510
<i> she's been finding it tough
 to get customers in the door.</i>

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.545 line:0%
- It does get hard
when it's really slow.

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.882 line:0%
I mean, it always feels like
it's the end of the world.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.617
<i> - But after surveying
 the neighborhood,</i>

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.552
<i> I realized that Emily
 might not be taking</i>

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.854
<i> full advantage
 of her surroundings,</i>

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:24.290
<i> so I paid her a visit
 with a way to help.</i>

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.825 align:end position:100%
I noticed there are
a lot of bars

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.126 align:end position:100%
and nightclubs
in the area.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.227 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.662 align:end position:100%
- Is that something
you like?

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.531 size:78% position:39%
- Um, it's a little hard.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.699 align:start position:0%
Sometimes we have some problems
with over-serving

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.868 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing,
but most of the time,

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:39.072 align:start position:0%
we're closed by 6:00,
so it doesn't affect us as much.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.706
<i> - But maybe it should.</i>

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.076
<i> You see, Magnolia and Willow
 has a strict</i>

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.977
<i> "you break it, you buy it"
 policy,</i>

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.980
<i>meaning that if an item breaks,
 it's as good as a sale,</i>

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:50.016
<i> so if, instead of closing
 at 6:00 p.m.,</i>

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.517
<i> Emily extended
 her hours</i>

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.386
<i> to be open
 straight through the night,</i>

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.421
<i> her chances
 of inebriated customers</i>

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:58.424
<i> generating new sales
 would greatly increase.</i>

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.693
<i> The plan:
 attract late-night drunks</i>

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:03.329
<i> by staying open
 24 hours a day.</i>

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.766 align:start position:0%
- Well, possibly,
I guess, yeah.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.803 align:start position:0%
I mean, I would--
I guess so, yeah.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.038 align:end position:100%
- I mean,
the way I see it,

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.474 align:end position:100%
if you get the right drunk
in here...

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:15.808
- Yeah.
- You could make

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.643 align:start size:69% position:31%
more in a single night
than you do all month.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.846 align:start position:0%
- I just wouldn't prefer
a broken item.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.014 align:start position:0%
I'd rather sell a good one,
but yeah, I mean,

00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:24.517 size:84% position:42%
it would be the same thing,
no matter what happens, so.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.385 align:end position:100%
- I mean, a lot of this stuff
is--probably the only way

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:29.355 align:end position:100%
you're gonna get anything for it
is if someone breaks it.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.725 align:start position:0%
- Well, some of the items,
but yeah.

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.427 align:start size:41% position:59%
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.761 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.797
<i> - Emily agreed to try out
 my idea</i>

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.233
<i> to see if it got the results
 I had promised,</i>

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.201
<i> so the next day,
 I returned to the store</i>

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.403
<i> and officially changed
 the hours.</i>

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:47.840
<i> Then to help our cause, I had
 the aisles narrowed slightly</i>

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:49.942
<i> and moved some
 of her poorer-selling items</i>

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.878
<i> to an area of the store
 that would increase</i>

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.881
<i> the likelihood
 of accidental contact.</i>

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.150
<i> So that evening,
 once the sun went down,</i>

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:00.586
<i> it was time to see if the new
 extended hours would work.</i>

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.088
<i> But knowing
 that tonight's sales</i>

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.757
<i> would determine
 if Emily kept using my idea,</i>

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.426
<i> I wanted to guarantee
 we had some results,</i>

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.095
<i> so I headed
 to a nearby bar</i>

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:11.197
<i> with a plan
 to befriend a drunk patron</i>

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.099
<i> and lead them
 back to the store.</i>

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.834 align:end position:100%
Do you know the antique shop
next door?

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.002 align:start position:0%
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.837 align:end position:100%
- They're open
24 hours now.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:20.773 line:0%
- Yeah.
- Okay, well...

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.675
<i> - After a few
 unsuccessful attempts</i>

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:23.910
<i> to connect
 with the locals...</i>

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.413
<i> - I finally found someone
 who was willing to chat.</i>

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:28.848
- What's your favorite movie?

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.016 align:start size:44% position:56%
- "Inception."

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.083 align:start position:0%
- "Inception," really?

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:32.552 align:end position:100%
- Yeah.
Have you seen that?

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.453 align:start position:0%
- Why?
Why is it your favorite movie?

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:37.490 align:start size:47% position:53%
- What's yours?

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
- "Forrest Gump."

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:42.061
<i> - He told me
 his name was JJ,</i>

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:43.663
<i> and he seemed like
 my best shot</i>

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.631
<i> at getting a big sale
 for Emily,</i>

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:48.334
<i> but for this to work,
 I needed to get him drunk</i>

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.002
<i> while staying
 sober enough myself</i>

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:51.571
<i> to execute the plan,</i>

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:54.840
<i> so prior to my arrival,
 I had a vacuum-powered device</i>

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.809
<i> sewn into the lining
 of my jacket</i>

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:58.578
<i> that was designed
 to discreetly suck up</i>

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.613
<i> the alcohol I was served
 through a tube,</i>

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.315
<i> into a pouch
 on my back.</i>

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.584
<i> Then a second motor
 would deliver apple juice</i>

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.720
<i> from a different pouch,
 quickly refilling the glass</i>

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:10.089
<i> and allowing me to go
 shot-for-shot with JJ</i>

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:12.024
<i> without losing my focus
 one bit.</i>

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:13.292 align:start position:0%
- Cheers.

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:14.727
<i> - Over the course
 of the next hour,</i>

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.195
<i> we had several rounds,</i>

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.731
<i> and I noticed that JJ
 was getting pretty tipsy.</i>

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:21.100 align:start position:0%
- My roommates put this
piece of paper in my pocket.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.903 align:start position:0%
Like, "Just in case you get
too drunk and get lost tonight."

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:25.571
- That's your address?
- [laughs] Yeah.

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:26.739 size:84% position:58%
- They put a piece of paper

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:28.307 align:end position:100%
with your address
in your pocket?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.610 align:start size:72% position:28%
So you get drunk often.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:31.644 align:start position:0%
- Oh, yeah.

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.179
- Really drunk.
- Every night.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.715
<i> - And I felt that we were
 finally ready to head out.</i>

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.783
<i> I explained to him
 that the cameras were there</i>

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:40.620
<i> for a documentary
 about nightlife in Long Beach,</i>

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.588
<i> but in reality,
 my only goal</i>

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:44.790
<i> was to get him
 inside the antique shop.</i>

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:48.127
<i> There was just one more step
I had to take to get him ready.</i>

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.097 align:end position:100%
There's this costume party
in the area that--

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.665 align:start position:0%
- A costume party?

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:53.833
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.234
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:57.803
<i> - Safety is always
 my number one priority,</i>

00:03:57.836 --> 00:04:00.339
<i> so I came up with the idea
 of a costume party</i>

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:02.908
<i> as a way to get JJ
 into a padded outfit</i>

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:04.176
<i> that would protect him</i>

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.978
<i> against any antiques
 he might shatter</i>

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.880
<i> once he stumbled
 into Emily's store.</i>

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:08.881
- Cool--oh.
- Oh, shit.

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:10.349 align:start size:44% position:56%
- Ow, [bleep]!

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:12.952
<i> And with that, we headed out
 to my made-up party.</i>

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:14.553
<i> I just hoped I could
 convince him</i>

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:17.890
<i> to make a stop
 along the way.</i>

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:21.027 align:start position:0%
Oh, sweet, look.
Open 24 hours.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.428 align:start size:41% position:59%
- What is it?

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:24.764 align:start position:0%
- Looks like some sort
of store, but look.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.132
- Free p--
- Free pizza.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.701 align:start position:0%
- Do you see it?
It's right back there.

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:30.703 align:start position:0%
It's right there at the back
by a heat lamp.

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:32.038
- Let's go.
- All right.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.439
- You're coming with me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:36.476
<i> [doorbell ringing]</i>

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:41.547
- [groans]

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.551
Ooh.
<i> [dishes clattering]</i>

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:46.886
Uh--

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
- You okay, man?

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:49.055
- I'm all right
right now.

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:50.756 align:end position:100%
- All right.
You better be careful.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.525
- It's all right.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.301 align:start position:0%
- Watch your back.

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:03.703
- There's no way.
- Should--

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.805
- I can't even fit through that.
It's too tight.

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:08.608
- Well, what do you--I mean,
do you want the pizza or what?

00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:13.079
- I'm kind of wedged here.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.114
- You broke this stuff.
- Right, I see that,

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:16.716 size:78% position:39%
and that's why I'm, like,
eh, I don't really want

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.752 align:start position:0%
to break anymore 'cause
it's [bleep] super expensive.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:21.387
- You have a "you break it,
you buy it" policy?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.923 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Yeah.

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:25.891
<i> - The plan was a success.</i>

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:29.895
<i> JJ had destroyed
 a large selection of antiques,</i>

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:31.797
<i> and once he freed himself
 from the aisle,</i>

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.633
<i> all Emily had to do was
 catalogue the broken items...</i>

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:37.536 align:start position:0%
- You're pretty clumsy,
huh?

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.271 align:end position:100%
- Is there any way I can
take this thing off?

00:05:39.304 --> 00:05:40.506
<i> - And ring up the sale.</i>

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.242 align:end position:100%
- It's about $280
worth of damage,

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.079 align:end position:100%
and that's probably
getting off easy

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:48.080 align:end position:100%
'cause I couldn't really assess
all of that broken--

00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:49.382 align:start position:0% line:92%
- Right.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:50.883
[laughs]
- Boo.

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:53.886
<i> - So with that, Emily
 got to make a sizable sale.</i>

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:54.887 align:start position:0%
Well, lesson learned,
huh?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.155
- Right.
- Sorry.

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:58.624
<i> - And JJ even got to take home
 some antiques.</i>

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:01.293
If you look at it this way,
it looks like it's brand-new.

00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:02.294 align:start size:25% position:75%
- Right.

00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:04.430 align:start position:0%
- So...

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:06.132 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a blessing
in disguise.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.366 align:start size:69% position:31%
- Right, right, right.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.268
<i> - I was so happy
 everything worked out,</i>

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:12.338
<i> and Emily seemed
 really won over by the idea,</i>

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:13.706
<i> but as we left
 the store,</i>

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:16.175
<i> I noticed that JJ
 was still pretty drunk,</i>

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:18.010
<i> and since he made
 such a big purchase,</i>

00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:20.246
<i> I felt the least I could do
 was be a gentleman</i>

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.648
<i> and give him
 a ride home.</i>

00:06:22.681 --> 00:06:24.049 align:start size:47% position:53%
Do you often do
stuff like that

00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:25.317 align:end position:100%

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:34.994 size:75% position:38%
- Tag team a girl, yeah.

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.095 align:start size:56% position:44%
- Tag team a girl?

00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:37.663
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what's that?

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:40.966 align:start position:0%
- It's when you have a threesome
with two guys and one girl.

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:42.168
- And you do that?
- Yeah.

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.335 align:start size:41% position:59%
- Yeah, yeah.

00:06:43.368 --> 00:06:44.670 align:start position:0%
- I do it with my brother
a lot, actually.

00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:46.305
- Oh, really?
- Me and my brother are dogs.

00:06:46.338 --> 00:06:48.274

 going into detail</i>

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:50.543

 he has with his brother,</i>

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.145

 dropped him off,</i>

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.549

 that I meet the guy,</i>

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.918

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.187

 his brother.</i>

You guys have sex

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.523
- Yeah.
[both laughing]

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:06.625 align:start position:0%

I told him about tag team.

00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:08.360
- Yeah.
- I told him.

00:07:08.393 --> 00:07:09.628 align:start position:0%

are brothers?

00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:10.596

- Yeah.

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:15.100 align:start position:0%

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:16.268
- Mm-hmm.

00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:17.736 align:end position:100%

Two...even, like.

00:07:23.742 --> 00:07:25.945 size:78% position:39%
- And then you're looking
at each other during it?

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:27.413
- No.
- It's dark in the room.

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:30.015
Lights are off all the way,
and you don't see shit.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:31.250 align:start size:38% position:63%
- It's fine.

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:32.551 align:start position:0%
- But if you're not looking
at each other,

00:07:32.584 --> 00:07:33.853 align:start position:0%
and you're having sex
with a girl,

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:35.287 align:start position:0%
why not just one of you
do it,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.490 align:start position:0%
and then the next one
does it later?

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:38.924 align:end position:100%
- 'Cause it's something we do,
it's [bleep]--

00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:40.793
- Right, it's just
something we've done.

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:44.263
I mean, all my homeboys
from back in Ohio, they do it.

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:46.465
Everybody does this shit,
Max, [bleep] George.

I do look at you guys,

that, you know,

00:07:57.676 --> 00:08:01.013
I don't have someone in my life
that is--I'm this close with.

00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:02.748 align:start size:63% position:38%

brotherly love

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:06.685 align:start position:0%
taken to that level,
in a way.

00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:07.920 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, I definitely see
where you're coming from.

00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:09.321
- It's just--
- And, like, you know--

00:08:09.354 --> 00:08:12.591
- To us, it's just, like--
it's nothing.

00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:15.761 align:end position:100%

[bleep] we're used to.

00:08:15.794 --> 00:08:18.364
We're used to all this shit.
