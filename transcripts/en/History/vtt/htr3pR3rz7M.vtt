00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.131
NARRATOR: Yekaterinburg,
Russia, July 17, 1918.

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:10.343
Members of the deposed Russian
royal family, Czar Nicholas

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:14.222
and Czarina Alexandra Romanov
and their five children,

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.890
are awakened in the
middle of the night

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.642
by Bolshevik soldiers.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:20.812
They are led to the basement
of their safe house.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.898
One after the other,
they are executed.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:28.027
Rumors spread that their death
was the result of a curse laid

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:31.030
upon them by the
powerful mystic, Grigori

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.160
Rasputin, a man who had
been murdered himself a year

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.536
and a half prior.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.539
Rasputin wrote an
open letter to Russia.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.083
And within this open
letter, he states,

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:44.461
if I am murdered
by the royal family

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.381
or by someone related to the
royal family, within two years,

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.467
every member of the royal
family will be dead.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:56.806
NARRATOR: Just who was
this mysterious figure

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.975
known as Rasputin?

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.227
And how did he come
to be so infamously

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.689
associated with dark powers
from beyond the grave?

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.484
[spooky music]

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.445
[wind blowing]

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.448
Pokrovskoye, Western Siberia.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:17.535
A comet streaks across the
Russian sky the evening

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:21.122
of January 23, 1871.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:24.751
This celestial event is
said to have set the stage

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.253
for the birth of Rasputin.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:31.549
From a very early age, Rasputin
displayed what some believe

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.594
to be supernatural
powers, including

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:38.973
psychic premonitions and
the ability to heal animals.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.267
And by the time he
reached adulthood,

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.269
he would experience
a vision that

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:47.148
would profoundly alter the
trajectory of his peasant life.

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:49.400
One day while
plowing his fields,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.237
Rasputin sees a strange
light in the sky.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.364
And out from the
middle of this light

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.492
emerges a vision
of the Virgin Mary.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.702
And she doesn't speak to him.

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:02.872
But he watches her
gesture to the horizon.

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:06.876
And Rasputin takes this to
mean that he is being told

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:10.839
by the mother of god that
he must go and find himself

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.590
on a spiritual pilgrimage.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.469
And this begins the huge
shift in Rasputin's life.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.137
NARRATOR: But was
it really the Virgin

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:21.641
Mary that appeared to Rasputin?

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.143
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.980
that what Rasputin encountered
was a very different

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.607
kind of otherworldly being.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:33.611
The vision set Rasputin
on his course of then trying

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:36.781
to become a religious
monk, which finally

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:40.326
led him to the czarist family.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.579
This has been a very
consistent thing throughout all

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.997
of human history.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.665
People are claiming that
they're being guided.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.084
Well, then you have to ask,
well, who's guiding them?

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:50.587
People have made contact.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:56.342
And it is clear that there is
a definitive extraterrestrial

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.719
involvement here.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.764
We have religiousized
this understanding.

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:06.978
We have developed a mythology,
a legend around something.

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:11.399
And we have not
understood it correctly.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:15.445
NARRATOR: In 1905, after years
of wandering and developing

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:19.490
a reputation as a healer,
Rasputin was introduced

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.534
to the Russian royal family.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.913
The reason why
the royal family

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:28.291
are interested in
Rasputin is the problem

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:33.087
they have with their only son,
Alexis, who is hemophiliac.

00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:37.967
It becomes very clear from the
earliest visits to the palace

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.679
that Rasputin's
prayers, his gaze,

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.432
that psychological
penetration, that he is

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.226
able to help stop the bleeding.

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:50.730
Rasputin certainly had a
powerful magnetic presence.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.274
He gained great favor
with the royal family,

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.984
the czar's family.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.236
Some felt he was one of the
most powerful people in Russia

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:58.780
at the time.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.074
But he also drew the
attention of powerful rivals.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.117
So he made some major enemies.

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:06.621
Rasputin's behavior certainly
became an area of concern

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:07.705
for the nobility.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:10.208
He was seen to be debaucherous.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.501
He was involved in orgies.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.253
He was a very,
very heavy drinker.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:17.715
He was often seen battling
with demons out loud as he

00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:18.466
walked through the streets.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.390
NARRATOR: Rasputin's
erratic behavior would earn

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.142
him the nickname the Mad Monk.

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:30.395
But might he really
have been functioning

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:35.191
as a vessel for otherworldly
forces, forces he had

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.568
little, if any control over?

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.907
Rasputin really almost
comes across as really being

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.951
a pawn in a much bigger game.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.621
And that's a bigger game that is
connected to extraterrestrials.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.622
And that's one of the
amazing things about it.
