00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.140
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, the podcast,

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.430
and today on the podcast,

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.660
sorta kind of following in the footsteps of our inheritance show [inaudible] we

4
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:13.020
have, uh, it's a feel good story that,

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.080
that you may not know how to feel about. It's like a bad feel.

6
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:21.410
Good story. It's, I don't know. Okay.

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.050
I'm willing to be confused in my feelings if that's what it's going to take.

8
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:27.440
Yes. Let me in. Let me get things rolling and introduce a reporter,

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.110
Andrea Seabrook. Hello. Hey. How's it going?

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.960
She'll be telling us this next story. Good. How are you?

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.200
I'm excited to hear what, what it is you've discovered on your adventures.

12
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.880
I have discovered many things. Young grasshopper. I'm ready. Okay.

13
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:41.714
So,

14
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.500
<v 1>so I went to this place, I'll entry road into Patuxent,</v>

15
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.600
which I sort of knew existed,

16
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:52.130
but I thought it was just like a little place north of Washington u s department

17
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:56.240
of Interior US Geological Survey, but Texas Wildlife Research Center.

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.960
There's a guard house and you drive into this place and it's like driving

19
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:03.610
seriously. It's like driving out of the beltway and into Jurassic

20
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.640
<v 2>[inaudible],</v>

21
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.870
<v 1>tall old growth trees.</v>

22
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.850
Suddenly sort of wash and meadows and verdant,

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.160
<v 2>a hidden magical forest.</v>

24
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.310
<v 1>It really gives you a sense of what this place must have been like before we</v>

25
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.850
came in and sort of asphalted everything

26
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.510
you just to set things up bit. Okay.

27
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.080
Scientists in this place are basically trying to go backwards.

28
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.420
They're trying to essentially re evolve a species of bird that has lost its

29
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:47.070
history. Which bird is that? Whooping cranes. Whooping Crane? Yes.

30
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.810
Whooping cranes. Oh yeah. I know about that.

31
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.680
This place has been minimized a lot. There have been movies made about it.

32
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.460
It's sort of the famous example of conservation, but

33
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.270
<v 0>when Andrea went to check it out,</v>

34
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.420
she discovered this mystery or this question that I'd never,

35
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.893
I never knew about.

36
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.520
<v 1>It's right at the center of what the scientists are doing, so, so I'm,</v>

37
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.730
so I met this guy. Hello Andrea? Yes. Hi.

38
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.260
Named John French to come on in. He's got kind of a Walrus,

39
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:19.570
like mustache and Straw hat.

40
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.250
I don't know if that tells you anything else about it, but just paint a picture.

41
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.790
We need to get you a little a badge here.

42
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.770
This guy has been working with these cranes for like three decades while we're

43
00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:34.660
here at the whooping crane observatory and the first thing he does is take me to

44
00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:37.210
a duck blind. What's a duck blind?

45
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.470
It's like a tiny little house up on stilts. It's,

46
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.140
it's raised off the ground that we're walking up steps, steep steps,

47
00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:45.450
almost like a ladder and you can,

48
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:49.420
you get inside this tiny little place with shutters that they can carefully and

49
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:54.421
quietly open and then look down on the grouping crane.

50
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.150
These birds. Oh mine.

51
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.470
<v 2>That's crazy. It's crazy. Regular quarter of the</v>

52
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.790
female females sitting on a Nashville,

53
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.780
unbelievably beautiful in tall.

54
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.570
These are huge. Three,

55
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:21.571
four feet tall with Luffy Downey white bodies perched on top of these two ball

56
00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:27.740
legs. Buddy stretcher when he's here for us,

57
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.730
they're willing. Spread is about Pete,

58
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.110
sometimes nine feet and then the from the, from the front of the body,

59
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.900
the this be almost swan,

60
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:40.690
like neck curves and rise.

61
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.090
Is that to a head that it's white all the way up.

62
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.290
Then it's got this right.

63
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.870
Please read across the top of the head the red cap that's actually bare skin.

64
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.020
That skin where they come into breeding condition,

65
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.440
that thing swells up and fills with blood gets brighter. I have

66
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.030
<v 1>never in my life seen anything like this and here's why.</v>

67
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.570
By the 1930s humans had destroyed enough of their territory and in fact just

68
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:15.490
like shot and eaten enough cranes that there were,

69
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.270
they believe 16 left in the wild.

70
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.150
One six one six. Wow.

71
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.500
And you know how many breeding females were in that population for?

72
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.270
So they were right on the brake.

73
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.000
They were right on the brink of the brain at that point.

74
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.490
Most biologists sort of say it's extinct. Well,

75
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.590
if you're that close to the end,

76
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.870
then how do you bring an animal back from something like that?

77
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.660
Here's what they do.

78
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.280
<v 0>Usually like two eggs on one building.</v>

79
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:46.600
They have two cranes to just lay a bunch of eggs. We can get, you know, three,

80
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:50.440
four or five, sometimes even six or seven eggs from a single pair.

81
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.560
And the scientists gather those eggs walking up the hatchery now and they put

82
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:58.130
them in these giant incubators and see them,

83
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.520
the trays of eggs and they tilt back and forth to allow their patrol rotate when

84
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:04.960
they are about to hatch.

85
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:09.020
And they can tell because they start hearing these little like, you know,

86
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.310
this sounds like not that

87
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.840
parents take it across the ramen at your painter walk in there and next they

88
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:18.220
take these eggs,

89
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.430
put them in a room and these eggs hatch and the baby comes out and it thinks

90
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.743
who's my mother?

91
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.720
And then one of the one walls of this room is plexiglass and on the other side

92
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:38.430
of the wall isn't that doll whooping crane? Like a mother whooping crane? Yeah.

93
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.280
Call this an imprint model.

94
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.490
Baby can see a mother on the other side of the plexiglass and in fact the

95
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:51.970
whooping crane and the other side of the plexiglass will make these sounds.

96
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:56.650
These sort of sounds that say,

97
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.100
come here baby,

98
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.170
<v 1>you know, cute baby. And so the baby,</v>

99
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.400
here's the sound and, and runs towards that sound. And you know,

100
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.320
onc runs into the plexiglass because of course that is there.

101
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.900
Oh see they're not letting the baby get to the mom. Nope. Why not?

102
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.930
Because they don't have enough captive cranes to raise the number of eggs that

103
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:21.580
they produce.

104
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.350
And if a baby crane were to imprint on a mother crane that,

105
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.520
that we're going to stay, then it wouldn't migrate. Ah,

106
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.570
they don't want the baby chick to inherit the traits that that mom has now that

107
00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:36.160
it's been raised by humans,

108
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.150
but they still somehow need the baby to see what a mom looks like. Yes.

109
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.960
<v 3>I want to make sure that those young chicks know what they're supposed to be</v>

110
00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:47.280
when they grow up. So that,

111
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.260
<v 1>so the check, here's that sand too.</v>

112
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.420
It looks around it's pen and in the corner is that a fake whooping crane that

113
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:57.760
the scientist to put there?

114
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.940
<v 3>We use a stuffed, um,</v>

115
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.720
[inaudible] from a new swans,

116
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.600
<v 1>but they put a whooping crane head on the top. That's kind of grim.</v>

117
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:08.260
It's totally weird.

118
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.550
And the way they've taxidermied these hooping grains is to have the wings kind

119
00:07:12.551 --> 00:07:12.890
of, yeah,

120
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.730
<v 3>he's out a little bit so the checks can snuggle up under there and kind of kept</v>

121
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.560
[inaudible]. Yeah, we have a heat lamp that is directed down, so it's warm,

122
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.780
right?

123
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.160
<v 1>So the chicken snuggles up next to his fake mom and the very next thing that</v>

124
00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:29.610
happens is the humans walk into this room.

125
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.020
<v 4>I'm Sharon Perrigo and I'm a technician here wearing these big giant crane</v>

126
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:40.160
suits, big white costume, and it made it have a sheet,

127
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.960
just white fabric.

128
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.990
We tried to use that to conceal the human form. And here's, here's a key part.

129
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.590
<v 1>They hold a cream puppet hand in one of their hands.</v>

130
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.860
<v 4>We use a puppet to point at things like the adults would point out food on the</v>

131
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:01.010
ground or guide them and walk with them. I mean,

132
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:02.570
they have to be taught everything,

133
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:07.060
<v 1>how to eat, how to swallow water. They have to be taught how to drink.</v>

134
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.550
She showed me how she takes the puppet head and dips it into water and then

135
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:10.650
[inaudible]

136
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.650
<v 4>tips the head back. The parents teach them how to do that.</v>

137
00:08:13.651 --> 00:08:16.260
So we have to use the puppets instead.

138
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.400
<v 1>And in these giant bird suits and with the puppet heads,</v>

139
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.870
they lead each little chick outside for the first time.

140
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.310
<v 4>They're very curious and they get very excited about going on walks and seeing</v>

141
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:36.191
butterflies and looking at bugs and see a pond for the first time and you know,

142
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.570
look at the frogs and try to catch the fish. And that's the fun part.

143
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.280
To see them act like cranes,

144
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.160
<v 1>then they have to teach them something else that's really important but</v>

145
00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:52.161
completely unnatural in the wild who'd been great in pair lays usually two eggs,

146
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.260
one or both will hatch and if to one of the babies will be stronger than the

147
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:02.160
other and the mother will start to ignore the weaker one and that one will die.

148
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.450
One of those chicks dies.

149
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.010
The family has never more than three in the wild really. But these scientists,

150
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.710
they raise a whole flock of them at once

151
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:15.510
<v 4>and often the first time we walk two chicks together, they fight.</v>

152
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.380
There's a little bit of aggression packing run and, oh, because I guess

153
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:20.971
<v 1>baby,</v>

154
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:25.080
you've evolved instincts to mistrust the other babies at least in the beginning

155
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:25.914
of your life.

156
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.840
And so the trainers have to teach these baby chicks to tolerate each other.

157
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.310
<v 2>We then gather them together in a, in a rather large group.</v>

158
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.280
<v 1>Then the scientists take them and put them on a track track. Exactly.</v>

159
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.510
Almost like a running track.

160
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.220
And they teach the baby checks to go around and around and around the track

161
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.750
chasing a little propeller plane. They chase a plane.

162
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.030
It's like a hang glider with a big fan on the back.

163
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.800
<v 2>Okay. And then they get imprinted on the aircraft and the costume andler that's</v>

164
00:09:56.801 --> 00:10:01.330
driving the aircraft. So they kind of think of this is mom or dad. Right.

165
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:05.330
And so when they learn to fly though, they fly behind the ultralight aircraft.

166
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:05.890
That's

167
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:10.080
<v 4>very exciting. We'll just, that's very, oh, you get all choked up.</v>

168
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.910
You know, it's just, it's we're doing,

169
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.490
we've done what we're supposed to do and they're doing what they're supposed to

170
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:21.420
do and it's very rewarding and you get all choked up about it and they're just

171
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:23.190
beautiful birds. They really are.

172
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.420
<v 2>So they practice flying during the summer up in Wisconsin.</v>

173
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.420
It gets strong [inaudible] they're good.

174
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.970
They're taking longer and longer flights.

175
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:34.770
And then when time for migration comes in late September or early October,

176
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.360
the ultra light takes off

177
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.500
heads down towards Florida in the birds follow them.

178
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.940
So we fly them down there to a couple of refugees in western Florida on the Gulf

179
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:47.160
coast and then we release them there.

180
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.960
<v 0>And once the cranes have taken that journey once,</v>

181
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.510
they never have to be shown it again.

182
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.760
So they like get it and they form breeding pairs. Wow.

183
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.140
Down in the wild. It just to break in thinking about how crazy this is,

184
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:05.420
these birds were hatched in an incubator,

185
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.800
cuddled by stuff's ones raised by humans and bird costumes then taught to eat

186
00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:10.940
and drink by puppets.

187
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.750
Now they're flying behind an ultralight plane on a migration route that never

188
00:11:14.751 --> 00:11:19.160
existed in nature. And it seems to be working.

189
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.980
<v 1>Can, there used to be 16 birds now? About</v>

190
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.020
<v 4>500 give or take depending on when we're counting. Yeah,</v>

191
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.120
<v 1>all that kind of stuff. Wow. It's a huge accomplishment.</v>

192
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.910
It's a huge accomplishment for this program,

193
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:37.390
for ecological biology and for humanity that we could even figure out how to do

194
00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:38.890
something like this. You know,

195
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.040
there've been all these documentaries that show this undies,

196
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:47.130
unbelievable inspiring pictures of this light plane followed by these baby

197
00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:51.540
cranes and it's so beautiful and it's like, oh, you know, humans are,

198
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.250
are doing what they should to their people who care

199
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.400
<v 0>so much that we're finally putting all of this into, you know,</v>

200
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.400
getting these cranes back and we're going to recover something.

201
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.240
But here's what, here's what happens next.

202
00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.980
French says that in most cases the breeding pairs that are formed in the wild

203
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.250
will lay eggs.

204
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.830
They will sit on the eggs and do all the things that wild cranes are supposed to

205
00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:24.450
do and then one day they,

206
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.450
they get up and walk away

207
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.310
without the baby, without the egg ever happen.

208
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.480
<v 2>These birds seem to abandon their eggs before and patching.</v>

209
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.760
For some reason it's puzzling. They just leave.

210
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:46.650
They just teach us walk away. They just get up and walk away. Yeah,

211
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.360
right, right. That's why.

212
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.270
<v 0>Well, well we have a couple theories.</v>

213
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:59.430
What we see in French says there are three big reasons it might be.

214
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.790
One is that uh, these birds are bothered by black flies.

215
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.320
Flies, black flies. Yeah. Black flies, black flies. These are not halfs fly.

216
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.260
They're not house flies. They're biting flies.

217
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.920
They burrow down under the feathers and bite and take a little blood meal.

218
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.380
These flies are infesting. The places where they nest,

219
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.300
we have pictures of just the head of a crane just completely covered with black

220
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:21.840
floods.

221
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.620
We have done some experimentation though to try and figure out if that is a

222
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:28.750
cause. And the data looks pretty good. Like, yeah. When,

223
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.170
when you're knocked down the black fly populations,

224
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.020
the nesting success seemed to go up a little bit,

225
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.520
but last year the data were quite a bit less clear cut, so,

226
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.720
so they're not sure if it's the flies. Exactly. That's one idea.

227
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.820
The second idea is that maybe they aren't getting enough to eat.

228
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.530
Do they have enough food and the right kinds of food to get them through the

229
00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:57.390
incubation period? There's some kind of suggestive evidence that uh,

230
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.830
that might be a problem for them.

231
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.560
So they might be leaving their nest because they're just starving.

232
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.730
Maybe because we've changed the landscape so much,

233
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:11.070
but John French thinks the third possibility is really the most likely one,

234
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.970
which is what the rather odd, uh,

235
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.990
upbringing that these birds have in captivity.

236
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:24.170
He thinks they have so much baggage from such a screwy childhood.

237
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.160
They're, they're raised by animal caretakers in these funky costumes.

238
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.260
They're in a very small pen that has a stuffed swan. This is not normal.

239
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.410
A normal childhood for a crane.

240
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.910
And so he thinks that something that they're doing or not doing exactly.

241
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.620
Exactly. In that upbringing,

242
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:53.650
do you suspect might be thing that is causing problems later when they're trying

243
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:59.480
to be, yeah. The real answer is I have no idea.

244
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.120
So you don't even know what you're, what, you're not teaching the chair.

245
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.320
Absolutely. Right. Right.

246
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.830
This is perhaps the most difficult problem.

247
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.470
There are so many variables.

248
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:18.850
It could be that the birds aren't being kept warm enough or they're being kept

249
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.570
too warm.

250
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.860
Maybe they didn't have a role model for how long they get parented and so they

251
00:15:23.861 --> 00:15:26.740
just walk away and know. So it could be a timing thing like, yeah,

252
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.280
a mother needs to say, you need to sit on your egg for six days. Not Fine,

253
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:35.200
just don't walk away. But they always walk away.

254
00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.010
Actually, no, there are two or three. After 11 years,

255
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:44.550
there are two to three adult birds in the migratory flock who are hatched in the

256
00:15:45.071 --> 00:15:47.980
wild who were hatched in the wild from captive bred birds.

257
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:51.970
The rest of them were born here that are in that flock. Now,

258
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.630
does that mean that the countless little babies have died because their mothers

259
00:15:55.631 --> 00:15:59.470
have abandoned them? Yes. Oh, that's tragic. And get this.

260
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.330
Every single one of those birds, once they release them and get them down there,

261
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.140
he's worth about a hundred thousand dollars. Really? Yeah.

262
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.400
In terms of the money that's been put in for training and all that. Yeah.

263
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.480
Oh my God. So not as a collectible, but in terms of investment,

264
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:23.020
you are a sickness. No, no. Because like, yes, if you're a really rare animal,

265
00:16:23.021 --> 00:16:24.530
like a crane. Yeah. Yeah.

266
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.150
Just being rare makes you valuable in some market around, in this case,

267
00:16:28.151 --> 00:16:31.390
it's sort of like your child is worth, you know, by the time they go to college,

268
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:35.680
you've spent $900,000 on them. Well, by the time these birds go to college,

269
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.130
they're human parents who spend $100,000 on them. Yeah.

270
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.690
But here's something you're not thinking of. And I haven't said, okay.

271
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.810
And then as these are very long life to birds,

272
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.320
they can live to be 40 and right now we're just seeing the first results of just

273
00:16:54.371 --> 00:16:57.160
the, you know, the success that they've had.

274
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.480
And so now they're just getting to this part really in the story. I see. So,

275
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.110
so the three birds, the three little babies who have hatched out there,

276
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.220
put against the 40 year lifespan means, well,

277
00:17:08.221 --> 00:17:09.820
maybe in a few years they'll get better.

278
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:13.480
How do we know we're having a real crisis as opposed to a learning curve crisis?

279
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.480
We don't, ah, that's interesting. He thinks,

280
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.180
and you can hear it in his voice.

281
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:23.470
He thinks they should have gotten better at it by now. Yeah.

282
00:17:23.471 --> 00:17:27.520
I mean there's something more that we need to do to,

283
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.210
to help that population become self sustaining.

284
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.930
There's something else wrong. It feels to me in a very gut sort of way,

285
00:17:34.931 --> 00:17:37.060
that they're not behaving quite right. Yeah.

286
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.440
Not because they haven't learned how,

287
00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:41.980
just a main never learned how may be something broken in them.

288
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.820
It really bothers him too. So given all of this,

289
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.593
<v 3>hmm.</v>

290
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:52.200
<v 0>It's just seem, it's just massively complicated. Why do you,</v>

291
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.580
why are you, why do we do it? Why, why do we humans do? Why are we doing this?

292
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.290
Well, it's the right thing to do.

293
00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.090
<v 2>And Mel, what else are you going to do? I mean, we're not going to give up.</v>

294
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.350
<v 3>No,</v>

295
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.120
<v 2>we're gonna find a way to,</v>

296
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.470
to make it work a little bit better and then go have a couple beers.

297
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:14.861
<v 0>I mean,</v>

298
00:18:14.861 --> 00:18:19.861
I went into this thinking this is like the coolest thing ever and how noble and

299
00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:23.020
I came out of it really ambivalent actually,

300
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.610
which is totally counter my type.

301
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.710
It is, it is an important undertaking for it itself,

302
00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:36.640
but reestablishing a fully independent flock.

303
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.710
I think maybe a goal that is, that is too,

304
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.820
too hard, but what about a flock that's not fully independent?

305
00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:50.560
I mean if you, if you abandoned the usual idea of conservation,

306
00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:53.920
which is a, you're trying to go back to the way things were before,

307
00:18:53.921 --> 00:18:58.780
we screwed everything up and you just say this is a new species and maybe they

308
00:18:58.781 --> 00:19:01.930
need humans as parents. That's just the way it's going to work. Yeah,

309
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.280
I find that sad.

310
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:08.490
It's funny because in a sense when they fail reproductively you fail.

311
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:16.180
<v 2>Well, I don't know about that reproductively yet. Possibly.</v>

312
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.060
I still have a couple of daughters and they're going to be there.

313
00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:21.970
Whether the crazy they're not, I have, but I gets with these cranes,

314
00:19:21.971 --> 00:19:24.320
whatever happens, we're not going to know for awhile. Yeah.

315
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.030
It's could take a heck of a long time. So, you know, dozens and dozens of years.

316
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.663
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

317
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.980
<v 2>okay, let's get in the car.</v>

318
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.793
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

319
00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.670
<v 5>[inaudible] a very sincere thanks to Andrea Seabrook for uh,</v>

Andrea spent more than a decade covering congress, ran PR,

322
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:58.500
and she just left to start a new podcast,

323
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.050
which she kickstarted and is now kicking ass.
