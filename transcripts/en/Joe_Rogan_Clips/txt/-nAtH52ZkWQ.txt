Speaker 1:          00:00          It's not simply a perspective enhancer, it changes how you, your body and your brain deal with, with opiates. I think a Tim Ferriss actually talked about that before as well. Um, but I mean, you know, I've seen it in my practice and there are medical studies, so I don't think that we should throw out the fact that, um, you know, cannabis can can help the opioid crisis. And then also too, you know, you want to look at it from a clinical perspective, right? So we know that opioids can kill people, right? Cause it acts on the brainstem, whereas whereas cannabis doesn't, so, you know, you might be saying, you know, you're just substituting one for the other. And you know, sometimes that is true, but if you're using a less harmful substance, you know, to me that's like a huge win. Right? So if someone you know, has to drink 12 beers a night versus smoking like one joint, man, that's, that's awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:54          I mean, you look at all, all these clinics, like you look at like Methadone clinics. I mean, what are they doing there? They're trying to get people off one substance to, you know, a substance that is a little bit less harmful. And I think that when you, when you use cannabis, you know, it can be effective, uh, for, for opioids. It can also be affected for, for benzodiazepines and for other medicines as well. So, you know, I would be awesome if everyone would just, you know, feel happy and great all the time by just exercise and nutrition and, you know, that's what I advocate and that's what I try to do personally. And that's what I try to, you know, say to my patients all the time. But I understand though that, you know, sometimes life is hard. Sometimes, you know, things hit you, you know, you have, you have crisis in your life, you have, you know, personal crisis that can throw off your mental health and then you have, you get into a car accident, you know, and you could be in really severe pain.

Speaker 1:          01:45          And in those times, you know, sometimes diet, exercise, meditation, doing all the right things just isn't quite enough. And, you know, I think that it's great that we have cannabis for those situations because it does seem to be very effective and has less side effects compared to some of the other metals as compared to some of the other medicines that we have traditionally used. Um, and you know, even though, you know, I'm talking about opiates and deaths, you know, we can also talk about insets, right? Like nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. So, you know, the, these drugs can also, you know, wreck havoc under GI system. Um, I saw one study, actually, I tweeted out, uh, uh, Rhonda Patrick tweeted out, said that if you use a and sets, it was really short. I gotta look it up again, but it was like two weeks. It can decrease your, uh, your gonadotropins, which can stimulate your, your testosterone level by like 25%.

Speaker 1:          02:39          And on that note too, we should talk about, I can't believe I forgot to talk with this, but opiates can drastically, um, inhibit your, uh, your, uh, testosterone production. Right? Which is a huge thing for depression because I've had guys come in to me before, um, that have been, uh, you know, really, really depressed. You just give them a small amount of testosterone, a man, their author, antidepressants, and they're off to the races. They're doing great. So, you know, are we creating a lot of people who are, who are depressed because they're using opiates and their testosterone levels are low. And you know, for men, I mean having low testosterone is horrible. You know, your libido goes, you know what, you're going to have low motivation. Um, you know, you're not gonna feel as well. You're not gonna want to do things. So, you know, um, if you're giving someone a medicine that, that, that nails there, their testosterone levels down, that's gonna really, you know, wreck wreck, wreck havoc on their mental health.

Speaker 1:          03:31          And I just want to make a note to cause Ben Greenfield who again, I really, really respect. I like that guy a lot. Um, you know, it was talking a little bit with you about testosterone and um, and uh, and cannabis and how it can drop it. So, I think there was three studies I saw done on humans. Um, and two of them, uh, noted no statistical difference and drop into testosterone levels and one study, the other study noted a small statistical difference. Um, so, you know, I think that it may drop your testosterone levels a little bit, but it's not gonna you know, substantially, um, drop them. So just so people, people know that because I know that comes up all the time, you know?

Speaker 2:          04:14          Oh yes. As the, as the, as the dumb anti drug advocates like to say doobies cause boobies.

Speaker 3:          04:21          Oh yeah, that is, that is, that is not right. There was no [inaudible] no,

Speaker 2:          04:30          I'm joking. Um, risperdol causes, that's a different issue. Um, respire Dawson anti psychotic, the spirit of, yeah, so, so look, I think, I think the issue of whether cannabis is a gateway drug, it's 100% clear that cannabis is a gateway drug. The argument is when you say it's 100% clear, the argument is why. Okay. So, so it's quite clear that cannabis use oftentimes proceeds other drug use, whether it's opioids, cocaine, other drugs. Now, one argument, and this is actually a pro legalization argument, is one reason it's a gateway is that if it's illegal, you got to buy it from your friendly neighborhood dealer. He might have access to heroin or cocaine, other drugs, and so eventually maybe you decide to try one of those other drugs. So actually that's really why the Dutch legalized. They wanted to create an avenue for people to use cannabis that wasn't connected to other drugs.

Speaker 2:          05:27          Okay. Another possibility is that using an addictive intoxicating substance, you might like it and you might want to try other addictive, intoxicating substances and it might prime your brain. And then the third possibility really is that they're just, some people are risk takers out there, right? They use, they're going to use cannabis, they're going to gamble, they're going to end. Cannabis is a little bit easier to access than other drugs. So they're probably going to try cannabis first. So it's not really that that cannabis drives the use, it's just the cannabis is first. They're just curious people. But your thoughts on what I would say, I mean I'm just going to go back to the NAM report. Right? And I mean, I mean you quote these people in your book, um, you know, so this committee couldn't find sufficient data demonstrating an association between cannabis use initially opioid use.

Speaker 2:          06:12          They found no compelling evidence to support the gateway drug theory. So, so again, but that's most of the people that you quoted in your book. So there's been more research done since then, but things have radically changed. I would say things have changed some, here's, here's, here's what I would probably say. I think that probably it's a combination of these things, right? It's, there's certainly an environmental factor where again, if you're buying from somebody who's got an access to other illegal drugs, maybe you try those drugs at the same time getting high, it feels good and maybe you want to try other drugs and at the same time you're just a risk taker. Okay. What is, what nobody seriously ever said until about the last five years is that cannabis could be an off ramp for opioids. Okay. And there's a lot of reasons to believe that's a really bad idea.

Speaker 2:          06:57          First of all, cannabis, if you actually need opioids for pain relief, cannabis is not a good enough pain reliever. It's like alcohol. It's a mild pain reliever. It's not strong enough. You're dying from cancer. Cannabis probably is not the pain reliever that you need. You need opioids. Okay. And again, the state level data is not as good. If you want to really figure out what's happening to an individual, the best way to do that is to follow that individual. And there's a really good paper that came out in 2017 after the NAM reports, so they didn't have it. That shows that people who use cannabis in 2001 is based on a large national study in the U S we're three times as likely to be using opioids three years later. Okay. And that just intuitively makes sense to me. And the other thing that people on the legalization, I don't ever talk about is who are the two countries that have the most cannabis use in the west, the US and Canada.

Speaker 2:          07:50          We're the two who are the two countries that have by far the worst opiod epidemic, the U S and Canada. Okay. But there's a real issue with that because the United States is also the only country other than New Zealand that allows pharmaceutical companies advertise. I mean there's a, there's Canada doesn't, the amount of opiates that are prescribed the United States is fucking preposterous. I agree. Particularly the, if the, I don't know if you ever saw the documentary, the Oxycontin Express, but the way Florida used to be structured where they didn't have a database, you could just literally go from pharmacy to pharmacy. Yet we have a problem with the way we prescribe drugs in this country. Opioids add drugs, Benzos, ssrs, all are connected to Canada. So it makes sense that it would filter over there. Yes. But what I would say is the people who think that cannabis is not part of that overprescribing problem are deluding themselves. And what do you think did that, so he, can you repeat the question again? So, so, so I, I agree with Joe the way that the access to opioids in the US. I mean, certainly it's come down a little bit in the last couple of years, but you know, Purdue Pharma, there's a special place in hell for those guys. But not just, it's not just opiates, prescribe too many benzos.

Speaker 1:          08:56          We prescribe too many add drugs. We probably prescribed too many SSR. I's we prescribed too much in this country. I think we all agree on that. I agree with that. I think that cannabis is another example of us looking for a drug to solve our problem. But what, what um, okay. Again, just from a clinical perspective, um, you know, I can't just rely on, on Diet and exercise for all my patients. I have to use other tools. And again, like everyone here in this room, like we're all pretty healthy. I don't have a bad back or you know, I don't have a mental health diagnosis or anything going on. So, you know, I have to look at patients that are coming to me. Right. So the way I see it is that, you know, we just mentioned a bunch of other drugs, you know, anti depressants and fetid means all these types of things.

Speaker 1:          09:42          You know, cannabis, and again, you know, I'm going to separate the chief. So you and the CBD, it's an incredible medicine and it doesn't kill people. Right? So as a clinician, you know that, that's so comforting for me to know that every single night I go to bed, I killed zero people. I know that. Right? So that's really, really comforting for me to know. Also, I feel, you know, we just talking about amphetamines, we were just talking about, you know, ssrs, I feel that cannabis, you know, particularly the CBD component can actually be more effective. You know, that's what I've seen a lot in my practice and other people have seen that as well. So, you know, I think that we need to need to take that into consideration when we're using all these drugs. And Alex, you know, some of the things that you're saying, you know, they're quite, you know, um, admirable and in a lot of things like researchers say, you know, are, are quite admirable as well.

Speaker 1:          10:33          And, you know, they, they feel that they can, you know, tell clinicians, um, you know, give them really good advice, but they're not the ones in the trenches. They're not the ones in front of the people. They're not the ones that, that have to have to chat with patients. You know, I have an obligation to do something for my patients to make them better. I really feel, you know, we just listed a bunch of drugs that cannabis is a really, really effective tool and, and it doesn't kill anybody. So, you know, because of that, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep using it. But like I said, I'm always looking for other drugs. I'm always looking for other alternatives that to also, um, help my patients. But I think that, you know, using cannabis is a really effective tool for a lot of clinicians and it's helped a lot of patients.

Speaker 1:          11:20          But what do you think about his argument about it being a gateway drug other than what these people said in the study? That there's no evidence that supports it, it's a gateway drug. What are your personal feelings about that argument? So I don't feel that, uh, that cannabis is a gateway drug. I do feel that, you know, one of the, uh, the things that you mentioned earlier is that, you know, some people kind of had this personality where they're like an experiment, right? And they, they just, they just want to want to try something. So, you know, the fact is, is that alcohol and cannabis just get introduced first most of the time, most people, you know, don't do, you know, coke or, or LSD and then, hey, say, hey man, let us try some, some cannabis. Right? So it's just that, that's the very first one there.

Speaker 1:          12:01          So if we, so you could say anything that, that, that was easier access. If there were some new drug that you know, did something similar to alcohol or similar to cannabis and that was introduced in, in our society, you'd be calling that the gateway drug. Um, and I do feel, and I, I do believe that nearly been demonstrated as being the gateway drug to almost all heart drugs because of the loosening of inhibitions. Whereas the opposite could be said about cannabis that it makes you paranoid. You might actually be less likely to try cocaine afterwards. And, and I know that the name, uh, you know, they don't, they don't feel that the cannabis is a gateway drug either. I mean again, they said, you know, they found no compelling evidence to support the gateway theory. And again, I mean these are the people that you are quoted in your book out. Let me just go a little bit further. They said in a retrospective cohort study, um, may it from e t a l and the 2016 exam and the transition from cannabis use to the use of other elicit drugs. They found that the probability of initially other elicit drugs after canvas did not differ significantly from the probability of, of starting with other elicit drugs. So it's just that cannabis is there first. It's definitely not a gateway drug in any stretch of the imagination. I just, I totally disagree. And there again, 50

Speaker 2:          13:15          years of data on this. I know the studies that he's quoting, but there are, there are many others. And I think the argument is as to why. And again, I think the argument that that to some extent having access to this drug via, you know, illegally tends to open you up to other illegal stuff, which to me is an argument for legalization. So, but I, I do want to throw one thing out there. You know, I don't know how many of your viewers have teenage kids or you know, it's probably, they're probably more likely to be teenage kids and to have teenage kids. But you know, the book has, the one thing that really worries me in the, if we're talking about gateway drugs is that jewel and vaping are really a gateway to THC. Vaping. So you can, you know, you can refer to that because, well first of all it gets people, it gets kids, teenagers used to inhaling, you know, this elicit substance and you can actually retrofit a jewel pod with THC.

Speaker 2:          14:14          They don't sell them, but you can, you know, you can easily go online and look up how to do it. And I think it really worries me, and I've heard from a lot of parents in the last month that there is an epidemic of Nicotine, vaping and TAC vaping going on right now and that I think, and, and we're talking about 15 1617 year olds inhaling pure THC, the most dangerous form of this drug. And I think unfortunately, it's not going to take long before the mental health consequences of that become apparent. And I really do hope that the book gives parents some tools to talk to their kids about that. If nothing else.
