00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.460
SPEAKER 1: And we are
lucky, once in a while,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.560
to welcome people like
Amy and Chef Donald

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.790
from Guittard Chocolates.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.880
Amy is a fifth generation
chocolate manufacturer.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.314
She is the great-great-great--

00:00:21.314 --> 00:00:22.480
AMY GUITTARD: --great-great.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.143
SPEAKER 1: --great-great
granddaughter

00:00:25.143 --> 00:00:29.880
of Etienne Guittard, who came
from France during the Gold

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.660
Rush days, like many
of our forebears.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.840
But when he saw how the
gold miners had the money

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.930
to buy good chocolate,
he went back to France

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.650
and learned about chocolate
and brought it back here.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.150
And I would say for good
chocolate, like this,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.700
I would pay almost
the price of gold.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.920
So this is what you're
going to learn today.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.280
And this is Guittard
Chocolate, not

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.695
the other chocolate
that begins with a G

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:02.580
that tourists flock
to, that has a kind

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.370
of Italian sounding name.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.710
This is French.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.180
And this is the chocolate
I love to cook with,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.490
and it's so good to know that
it's American made and American

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.750
based.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.350
So Chef, he's the
chef of Guittard.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.730
He's based in Los Angeles and
teaches professionals, as well

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.360
as nonprofessionals, about
the ins and out of chocolate.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.550
Amy has a book, where she
really writes about this.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.080
She came back from
working with Cliff bars

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.650
to what she knew and
loved, which is chocolates.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.470
And so I'm going to
hand it over to her.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.270
Chocolate is an incredibly
deep and interesting subject.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.450
I don't know if some of you
know that in the raw food

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.060
movement chocolate is
considered a super food.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.800
It's got these incredible
antioxidants and list

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.880
of nutrients.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.740
So that's your excuse, guys.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.060
But keep it easy on the sugar.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.630
And I also know that when I was
studying pastries and desserts

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.000
in France, that when
it came to chocolate,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.310
we were handed a sheaf
of papers this thick.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.930
You probably did,
I know you did.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.290
And you're tested specifically
on your knowledge of chocolate

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.510
and temperatures
and how to handle it

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.040
and how finicky it can be.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.390
So without much
ado, I'm very much

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.937
happy to have you
here and welcome,

00:02:33.937 --> 00:02:35.020
and I'll hand this to you.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.594
AMY GUITTARD: Thanks.

00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:37.760
Thanks for the introduction.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.969
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.010
Thank you all for coming.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.810
I know you guys are
all super, super busy.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.080
But we're stoked to
be here and to share

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.460
a little bit about
Guittard and also to dive

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.760
into the nuances of chocolate.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.710
As alluded to earlier,
chocolate is super complex,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.750
and there's a lot of
different ways and things

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.166
that you can dive
into when you're

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.550
starting to learn about it,
when you're baking with it.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.860
And so what we did is we picked
two recipes from the book.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.800
Donald has a chapter
in the back of it

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.970
that have a little bit
more sophisticated recipes.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.810
So he's going to be
testing two of those today.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.820
And we selected those
recipes primarily

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.530
because they showcase a
variety of different chocolates

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.910
that go into different
flavor nuances and also

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.890
different applications.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.200
We've pulled a
selection of items.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.862
We make probably, what, like
250 items maybe, more or less.

00:03:25.862 --> 00:03:27.320
We have a collection,
Etienne line,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.740
which is geared primarily to
professional pastry chefs.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.250
A lot of those items are
also available for consumers,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.270
but we pulled a
selection of those here,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.662
which you guys can taste
after we do the demo.

00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:40.120
And it's basically
just to showcase

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.495
the different
types of chocolate,

00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:44.700
whether it's a chip,
a wafer, or a bar.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.090
There's some fun stuff over
here between like a 70 and a 72,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.199
which are seemingly
very close together

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.740
because the percentages
are the same,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.450
but they couldn't
taste more different.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.450
So I'm kind of
jumping ahead here,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.000
but I wanted you guys to sort
of have that as a foundation

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.620
to help you navigate as we
talk through the recipes,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.280
to know that there is this
sort of diversity of products

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.330
over here that you'll be able
to explore once we finish.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.840
And as mentioned, I am
the fifth generation

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.540
of my family business,
which was started

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.560
in 1868 in San Francisco.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.269
We were making chocolate in
the Bay Area that whole time.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.209
When we first opened, we were
doing coffees, teas, and spices

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.887
in addition to chocolate,
because chocolate,

00:04:23.887 --> 00:04:25.470
we often talk about
in the industry is

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.000
that it's a grinding business.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.520
You start off with a bean.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.730
You grind it down, and
you make a cocoa powder.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.930
You can make ground
liquor, which

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.650
is sweetened chocolate,
which is then oftentimes

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.512
a base for a lot of recipes.

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:39.720
But it's a grinding business.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.514
It wasn't until after the '06
earthquake in San Francisco,

00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:44.180
which everyone's
probably familiar with,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.570
where we consolidated down
just to making chocolate.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.220
So we've been doing that
for a whole bunch of years.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.310
And most of what we do at
Guittard is we make chocolate,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.540
but we do it in a way
that sort of marries

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.260
a tradition of our business
and the tradition and heritage

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.230
of chocolate in general, because
it has such a rich history,

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.570
with innovation.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.670
The industry, as everyone
probably here knows

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.510
is so highly
saturated right now.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.890
There are all these
bean-to-bar guys.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.920
And everyone has their own
way of making chocolate.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.160
And so what we do is always
looking for different ways

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.170
that consumers are
engaging with chocolate,

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.310
new recipes that chefs are
coming out with-- that's

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.893
a really important
part of what Donald

00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:28.530
does-- different ways
that we can make chocolate

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.560
in our factory.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.360
And most importantly, we're
always looking for new beans,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.989
and that's a really big part.

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:35.530
You can't talk about
making chocolate

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.110
without talking about
the raw ingredient.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.880
It's not a great
photo, but I brought

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.250
some pamphlets that are over
here, you guys can look at.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.410
But cocoa is a bean.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.030
It's a fruit.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.760
I always tell people that
I start eating chocolate

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.820
at like 9:00 AM
anyway, but you're

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.540
getting your fruits and
vegetables by eating a fruit.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.210
But it starts off as a fruit.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.450
It's a bean.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.890
It's a seed, actually.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.590
This is a dried cocoa pod, and
I'll leave this out for you

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.340
guys to look at.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.700
It grows on a tree.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.470
It grows 15 to 20 degrees
either side of the equator,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.540
what we call the cocoa belt.
And we source beans from all

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.240
over the world.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.520
We do single origins.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.900
We do blends.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.120
Each region has their own
sort of flavor profile, which

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.120
is also really important
to how you make chocolate

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.820
and what goes into
either creating a recipe

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.880
and selecting the chocolate.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.650
What happens on the farm
level, the fermentation

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.550
and drying process, again
is really, really crucial

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.300
component to getting
the right flavor.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.840
So it's not only the terroir.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.420
It's not only the genetics
of the bean, like a Braeburn

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.520
versus a Pink lady versus
a Granny Smith apple.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.240
You've got similar
types of things

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.920
with regards to a cocoa pod.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.462
You have Trinitario,
Forastero, Criollo,

00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:48.670
all sorts of different types.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.340
So it's that.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.000
But it's also what the farmer
does with the bean at origin

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.380
before it even comes to us.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.240
And then we like to
say we try and listen

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.510
to how the being
wants to be roasted

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.270
and treated once we start
making chocolate from it.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.030
And then it works its
way through our factory

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.600
and then gets in the hands
of chefs like Donald,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.390
who then taste the
chocolate, figure out

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.390
sort of the nuanced flavors,
and then has an ability

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.670
to then craft a recipe
that can kind of celebrate

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.830
those flavors that really
starts on the farm,

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.955
goes through our factory,
and ends up in a kitchen.

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:21.080
So I'm going to hand
it over to Donald.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.390
There will be time afterwards,
I believe, for questions.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.400
And, yeah, so he's going to
do two recipes, as I said,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.190
that showcase different
types of chocolates.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.000
And I'll probably jump
in and ad lib as we go.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.050
DONALD WRESSELL: Great.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.260
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.930
So we're going to start off with
making a chocolate pound cake.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.155
It's a five-meal-a-day
kind of a recipe.

00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:44.310
You can have it for breakfast,
lunch, tea, dinner, midnight

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:44.810
snack.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.110
So I'm going to start
off with some butter.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.637
What's critical about
all pound cakes, not just

00:07:52.637 --> 00:07:54.720
chocolate pound cakes, is
that all the ingredients

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.830
are at room temperature
for the physics of mixing.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.800
So I'm going to go ahead and add
sugar, a little bit of honey,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.484
and butter to this.

00:08:02.484 --> 00:08:04.400
It's going to get a
little noisy for a minute.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.140
And I'm going to aerate this.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.080
This is the creaming method
we talk about in baking.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.720
So I'm going to
cream the butter.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.110
I'm going to introduce
a lot of air cells

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.120
that are going to
improve the texture

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.570
or actually create the
texture for the cake.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.950
We're also going to add
some egg and whip that in.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.617
That's also going to
add some air to it.

00:08:21.617 --> 00:08:23.491
And we're also going to
use just a little bit

00:08:23.491 --> 00:08:25.830
of leavening, a little
tiny bit of baking powder.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.530
So three ways I'm trying
to get cell structure

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.830
and lift for this pound cake
so it's not dense and heavy.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.669
We are going to try
this today, by the way.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.390
So while that's whipping,
going to give it about maybe 90

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.419
seconds to two minutes, I
have my dry ingredients here.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.040
I need to sift those
together-- cocoa powder.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.080
I'm using our Coco Rouge, which
is this is red can over here.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.980
You have a look at it.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.280
It's a 22%, 24%
fat cocoa powder,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.230
which is kind of standard
for baking recipes.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:07.060
So to incorporate, I'm just
sifting these ingredients--

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.210
salt. So sifting is to aerate.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.465
It's also to incorporate
things, so I do it on paper.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.411
A little finally mixing,
so that's ready to go.

00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:24.642
I'm going to go ahead
and add in our eggs.

00:09:24.642 --> 00:09:26.100
So these eggs are
room temperature.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.300
SPEAKER 1: Chef, why is it
important to have ingredients

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.750
at room temperature?

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.750
DONALD WRESSELL:
Well, so first of all,

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.690
the butter will whip
up nice and light.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.870
If I dump a cold egg onto that,
all of that air I put into it

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.840
is going to actually cause
the butter to chill down.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.060
All my air is going to go away.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.230
So right now I've got a light--
can you all see in there?

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.920
Is there a way to see in there?

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.600
Sort of?

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.290
How about if I do-- no.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.890
No.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:10.389
All right.

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:11.480
We'll leave it like that.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.150
I'm going to stop
the bowl for a second

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.775
because it's almost
ready to go anyway.

00:10:16.797 --> 00:10:18.380
That way you can
kind of see-- so it's

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.210
light and lemon-yellowish,
very important.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.540
So, yeah, it's very light.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.900
So I'm just going to give it
a little bit of a scrape here.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.450
Fortunately, this
paddle attachment

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.380
we have in this mixer does a
really nice job of scraping,

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.921
so I don't even have
to do that much.

00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:36.330
But you do want to scrape often.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.287
But the machine has
really been helpful.

00:10:38.287 --> 00:10:39.495
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] butter?

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.748
DONALD WRESSELL: What's that?

00:10:40.748 --> 00:10:43.150
This is sugar and butter and
a little bit of honey, yeah.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.739
And so over here we've
got the all-purpose flour,

00:10:45.739 --> 00:10:47.280
cocoa powder, a
little pinch of salt,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.190
and tiny bit of baking powder.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.870
And now we're going to add our
dry and our liquids together.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.180
So I've got a little bit of
coffee and vanilla extract.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.480
I've got some buttermilk.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.364
And we're going to incorporate
the dry and the wets together.

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:05.780
You've probably
read recipes where

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.830
it says alternate dry and wet.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.960
What's that all about?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.950
So if I were to dump
all the liquids in,

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.880
the butter fat would
separate, wouldn't

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.130
be able to absorb this liquid.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.540
If I put all the flour
in and kept mixing,

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.242
it would toughen
up our structure.

00:11:19.242 --> 00:11:20.700
We wouldn't have
a nice light cake.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.580
So that's why you
want to alternate.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.090
So I'm going to start off
with a little bit of flour.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.530
So I like to use this method
of getting stuff into the bowl.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.460
It's a lot cleaner than
trying to use a spoon

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.100
or dump it out of a
scoop or something.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.530
So a little bit of our dry,
a little splash of our wet.

00:11:44.352 --> 00:11:46.310
AMY GUITTARD: Just a note
on that cocoa powder.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.510
It's a Dutched cocoa powder.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.840
You guys probably see on
shelves that they're sometimes

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.770
natural cocoa powders,
Dutched cocoa powder.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.822
Dutched cocoa powder
is oftentimes something

00:11:54.822 --> 00:11:56.280
that I describe as
like it has like

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.260
a Moorish, which is a funny--
it's like you want more of it.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.590
It's like that
Oreo cookie flavor.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.630
And it's processed
with-- it's like alkalis.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.470
So it's sodium bicarbonate.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.620
And so it gives it a very
different flavor note

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.720
than like a natural
cocoa powder,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.520
and you've got to adjust your
recipe if you're using natural

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.840
in lieu of a Dutch, just because
it's got additives in there.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.440
Right, Donald?

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.260
DONALD WRESSELL:
Yes, that's right.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.697
And how you adjust that is
by adding some baking soda,

00:12:22.697 --> 00:12:23.530
bicarbonate of soda.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:28.040
So you change the pH
of the cocoa powder.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.371
So a little bit more mixing.

00:12:31.371 --> 00:12:33.037
I'm going to use my
final amount of dry.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.120
So now our cake is
essentially mixed.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.536
Off the machine.

00:12:45.536 --> 00:12:49.920
And I'll do a little final
folding together here.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.020
So now this is kind of
the-- when I set out

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.530
to make this recipe, I wanted to
create a cake that wasn't just

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.772
all cocoa powder
based, and I wanted

00:12:58.772 --> 00:12:59.980
to add more chocolate flavor.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.040
So what I did is
I grated our 91%,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.260
which you can taste over
here, on a box grater--

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.822
just a simple box
grater like this.

00:13:07.822 --> 00:13:09.280
And then I'm going
to fold this in.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.738
So it'll be just another little
shot of chocolate in there.

00:13:11.738 --> 00:13:14.560
So just, again, trying
to push the chocolate

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.060
flavor forward in the cake.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.170
Sometimes you see pound cakes
that are really shiny and dark.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.210
Those are always made with
oil and just cocoa powder.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.430
But I wanted a true
chocolate flavor in here,

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:30.200
so we'll taste it later and you
can see what I'm talking about.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.575
AMY GUITTARD: So
something that's

00:13:31.575 --> 00:13:33.450
really important about
working with chocolate

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.070
is understanding
what percentage is.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.820
And so like the
cocoa nib, which we

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.650
don't have any
here unfortunately,

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.130
do you have any in your recipes?

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:41.490
I can't remember.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.380
DONALD WRESSELL: I do not today.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:42.810
AMY GUITTARD: You don't.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.340
So a cocoa nib is basically
the roasted cocoa bean

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.650
before it's ground down.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.830
The cocoa nib is more or
less 50% fat, 50% solid.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.270
And so when you're looking at
a percentage, percent cacao,

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.050
you can sort of
try and figure out

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.280
that the percentage is
representative of the cocoa

00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.920
mass.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.870
The remaining percentage
is typically sugar.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.070
If it's a milk chocolate, it's
sugar and milk added to it.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.550
You can kind of sort
of figure out from that

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.534
the difference between
the fats and the solids.

00:14:10.534 --> 00:14:11.950
Sometimes you add
cocoa butter in,

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.240
which is the sign
of a couveture.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.800
The 91 has added
cocoa butter in it.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.280
If you don't add
cocoa butter, it's

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.370
going to be a different
sort of rheology.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.560
So this 72% does not have
added cocoa butter in it.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.680
So the fat content is more
or less-- what would that be?

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.900
30-- no, come on, Amy.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.900
DONALD WRESSELL: It's
about 30-- about 35, yeah.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.670
AMY GUITTARD: OK, thanks.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.680
And then the 70 has
added cocoa butter in it.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.480
So it's just something
to keep in mind as you're

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.470
working with chocolate.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.260
And then I'll add onto that once
Donald goes through his next--

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:43.990
DONALD WRESSELL:
All right, so that's

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.662
what our batter looks like.

00:14:45.662 --> 00:14:46.870
I got these cute little pans.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.160
They're half pound loaf pans.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.310
You can bake it in a bigger pan.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.890
That's OK.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.970
But these are so adorable,
I thought I would use those.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.051
So getting this into the
pan without getting it

00:14:56.051 --> 00:14:57.550
all of the table--
a couple of ways.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.465
A scraper works.

00:14:58.465 --> 00:14:59.960
I like an ice cream scoop.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.810
That is really helpful.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.068
You kind of drop it in.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.812
We'll fill the pans of
about 2/3 of the way.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.450
So I sprayed a little
bit of pan spray here,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.630
or you can use butter.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.900
SPEAKER 1: Well, what
was the question?

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.060
DONALD WRESSELL: Oh,
the question was, she's

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.694
asking, what's the difference
between spraying and using

00:15:22.694 --> 00:15:23.360
parchment paper?

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.860
I use both.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.710
So I want it coming out.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.160
I don't want any chance
for it not to come out.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.760
So I put a little
spray in there,

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.300
which attaches the paper
to the pan, actually,

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.590
and then push the paper in.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.430
Now it stays.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.380
And then we put a little spray
on top, so it just helps.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.880
It could be butter also or oil.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.000
So a couple methods of
getting it into the pan.

00:16:02.356 --> 00:16:03.980
I'll just use this
little guy here just

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.670
to kind of smooth
them out a bit.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.700
Give it a tap.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.283
That will knock any
air cells that are

00:16:18.283 --> 00:16:19.645
stuck in there, little pockets.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.150
So those are ready to go.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.660
I'm just going to lose
these over this way, please.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.000
Thank you.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.040
We're going to make a
little topping for it.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.422
So it's done real quickly
in a food processor.

00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:42.790
Move this out of the way.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.540
Thank you.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:57.380
So food processor-- so I've
got demerara sugar, which

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.200
is an unrefined brown sugar.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.670
It's got a little more molasses
in it, cocoa powder again,

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:09.170
our Coco Rouge, some roasted
hazelnuts, all-purpose flour,

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.792
a little pinch of salt.

00:17:13.792 --> 00:17:15.250
So what I'm going
to do is go ahead

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:21.332
and drop the sugar in here
first, cocoa powder, flour.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.882
Whoops, made a
little mess there.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.240
If I had used my
paper method, it

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.690
wouldn't be all
over the table now.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:37.250
So I'm just going to combine
these ingredients together.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.600
Now I'm going to go ahead
and pulse in these hazelnuts.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.590
And roasting hazelnuts
twice is a practice

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.150
that I've always had.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.320
Hazelnuts gain more flavor
by roasting them two times.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.576
In a crumble like this situation
that's surrounded by fat,

00:17:59.576 --> 00:18:02.200
all the moisture coming off the
cake, the hazelnuts won't cook,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.408
so they'll be kind of rawish.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.371
Break those guys up.

00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:20.180
I think we'll start our
second recipe, which

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.686
is going to be a cookie.

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.583
It's the triple
chocolate cookie recipe.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.530
Forgot that.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:34.346
That's salt.

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:37.869
Triple chocolate cookies--
so I've melted chocolate.

00:18:37.869 --> 00:18:39.160
There's two kinds of chocolate.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.540
There's a 100% and
a 64% in butter.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.550
So I'm melting chocolate.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.960
I use a water bath occasionally.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.310
I can also use a microwave.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.560
You can melt the butter
separately from the chocolate,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.226
combine the two.

00:18:51.226 --> 00:18:52.860
You can melt them both together.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.710
The point is getting them
melted and then homogeneous.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.110
So we're just going to
stir these two together--

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.693
or these three things
together rather.

00:18:58.693 --> 00:19:01.990
So there's 100%, 64, and
someone unsalted butter here.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.700
I've got some eggs, sugar.

00:19:13.795 --> 00:19:15.420
We're going to give
a little bit of air

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.330
to this, about one minute
of whipping at high speed.

00:19:21.325 --> 00:19:22.700
AMY GUITTARD:
Donald, do you want

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.910
to talk a little
bit about how you

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:29.024
work with like new chocolates
and develop recipes

00:19:29.024 --> 00:19:29.940
around new chocolates?

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.280
DONALD WRESSELL: Vanilla.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.040
Yes, so when I get a new
chocolate from Guittard,

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.180
I'll taste it first
against a bunch of things

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.030
that I might have
in the kitchen.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.071
I'll taste it with fruit.

00:19:39.071 --> 00:19:40.700
I'll taste it with coffee.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.770
I might just eat it
with some sour cream.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:47.167
I just have a little panel of
different kinds of ingredients

00:19:47.167 --> 00:19:49.750
in the kitchen and sort of see
what jumps out when I'm tasting

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.070
it-- passion fruit perhaps.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.800
What else?

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.100
Nut products-- and
sort of see if there's

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.140
any inherent traits
in the chocolate

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.430
that kind of correspond nicely
with this particular chocolate.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.780
So I'm always looking
for pairings that way.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.744
And then I'll mess around
with the rheology of it.

00:20:07.744 --> 00:20:08.660
I'll see how it melts.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.540
I'll see how it
handles on the table.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.190
Then I'll see how it
folds into ingredients,

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.680
just sort of check
it out that way.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.424
And that's how I come
up with new things.

00:20:18.424 --> 00:20:20.090
AMY GUITTARD: I think
when we sit around

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.330
the table at the office
and try and develop

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.780
new flavor profiles, it
usually starts with the beans

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.767
that we get.

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.850
We've got really strong
relationships with farmers

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.030
all over the world, and it's a
very word-of-mouth community.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.519
So we'll get an email or a
phone call from a farmer.

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:36.060
They'll come up to
us at a trade show

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.722
and hand us a bag
of samples and say,

00:20:37.722 --> 00:20:39.180
can you make
chocolate out of this?

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.850
And tell me what you think,
which is what we love to do.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.620
And it's that dialogue and that
relationship with these farmers

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.260
that sort of leads
us to developing

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.880
a lot of these chocolates
that Donald is saying kind of

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.580
inspires him to develop
these new recipes.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.680
And I think one of
the things when you're

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.490
baking with chocolate is getting
familiar with the different

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.780
flavor profiles and allowing
yourself sort of the freedom.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.700
A lot of the recipes
in our cookbook

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.480
are basic enough that
you can be like, OK,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.560
so now I know how to make a
regular old chocolate chip

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.060
cookie.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.670
Let me switch it up
a little bit maybe

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.110
use a single origin,
Madagascar, because I

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.860
know it's got some
cranberry notes in it,

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.550
and I want to toss in some
dried cranberries in that

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.060
and spruce it up a little.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.271
So having that sort of language
and being comfortable enough

00:21:20.271 --> 00:21:21.770
to be able to do
that in the kitchen

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.960
comes with sort of
understanding a flavor.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.020
DONALD WRESSELL: Exactly.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.580
So I'm going to just sift this
flour and a little bit of salt

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.802
together again for this recipe.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.880
Also make it easy
to get in there.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.220
So we'll put this on
hold for just a minute.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.330
So our three components
for the cookie

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.500
is the melted chocolate/butter
mixture, our aerated eggs

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.230
and sugar, and then our flour.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.050
OK

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.704
Now I'm going to cut this
butter up into little cubes.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.940
SPEAKER 1: Chef, do you
prefer a special butter?

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.830
DONALD WRESSELL: I like
and unsalted butter

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:05.820
in all my recipes.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.239
Usually, it's like 82%.

00:22:10.239 --> 00:22:11.280
It can be a little lower.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.565
So I'm just going to
pulse these guys together.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.910
SPEAKER 1: 82% fat?

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.130
DONALD WRESSELL: 82% fat, yeah.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.770
That's kind of European style.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.112
DONALD WRESSELL:
Cold butter, yeah.

00:22:32.112 --> 00:22:33.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.880
DONALD WRESSELL: Yes,
if I used soft butter,

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.130
it would kind of be a
greasy sort of consistency.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.105
And we definitely don't
want that for streusel.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.880
SPEAKER 1: So you're looking
for a course, crumbly mixture?

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.240
DONALD WRESSELL:
Course, crumbly-- I

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.400
should be able to
grab it with my hand,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.750
and it'll clump together.

00:22:59.522 --> 00:23:01.605
AMY GUITTARD: It's like,
what are you doing to me?

00:23:01.605 --> 00:23:02.650
DONALD WRESSELL: What
am I doing to it?

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.470
There's a piece of butter trying
to get down in the bottom.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.080
We'll get it down in there.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.100
We're going to push
it down actually.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.070
There we go.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.660
All right.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.200
Perfect.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.960
We're going to massage
it into his bag here.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.760
I do this in a piece of paper.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.999
So, as you can see, it
kind of sticks together.

00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:52.790
So I'll just mix a
little bit by hand here.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.690
We'll put some into this bag.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.440
Now you can use it
this way straight away,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.906
but I'm just going to show
you a quick technique.

00:24:02.906 --> 00:24:04.280
Well, let's just
do one this way.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:09.300
So here's our crumble
topping-- easy way.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.758
I'll show you a different way,
an alternative way to do it.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.410
I press it into
a sheet, like so.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:32.110
Then I refrigerate it,
keep it ready to go.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.352
Get that out of the way.

00:24:34.352 --> 00:24:35.560
And then it is kind of ready.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.300
I keep a lot of doughs
this way-- prepared.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.950
They're sealed.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.662
AUDIENCE: Do you freeze it?

00:24:45.662 --> 00:24:47.120
DONALD WRESSELL:
I freeze it, yeah.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.119
I can freeze it
or refrigerate it.

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:50.660
And then what I'm
going to do is just

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.760
going to press it
through a screen,

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.670
and I can create a
little crumb this way.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.046
Get rid of that.

00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:05.546
Thank you.

00:25:11.397 --> 00:25:12.980
And then you can
just kind of press it

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.465
through, either with a rolling
pin or even with your hand.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.701
And it wasn't cold enough--
our little make-shift fridge.

00:25:27.701 --> 00:25:29.200
But anyway, you can
present through,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.680
and you end up with
these nice little uniform

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.675
crumbs like that.

00:25:37.732 --> 00:25:39.940
SPEAKER 1: Chef, this is
assuming you have leftovers,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.700
right?

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.320
DONALD WRESSELL: Assuming you
have leftovers-- assuming.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:42.580
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.730
Not in my kitchen.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:44.980
No, there wouldn't be.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.480
DONALD WRESSELL:
All right, so we're

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.490
going to use a few of these
just for a cake, our other cake.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.550
But they're kind of a
uniform little crumbs.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.452
SPEAKER 1: That's beautiful.

00:25:53.452 --> 00:25:54.910
DONALD WRESSELL:
So those are going

00:25:54.910 --> 00:26:02.250
to go in the oven right down
here, 350 about 30 minutes.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.500
I say about it
because all ovens tend

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.124
to be a little bit different.

00:26:07.124 --> 00:26:08.540
So we'll watch 30
minutes on that.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.890
You timing that?

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.290
All right, so back
to the cookie.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:17.520
So again, review, so our
butter and chocolate mixture

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.640
is going to go right into
this egg-sugar emulsion.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.159
There we go.

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:32.950
Fold that together.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.791
Followed by our dry mix.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.580
And I'm going to fold in some
milk chocolate wafers, hence

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.150
the triple chocolate.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.650
AMY GUITTARD: Is that the 38%?

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:58.983
DONALD WRESSELL: That's the 38%.

00:26:58.983 --> 00:27:03.740
So in here it's the 100%,
the 64, and this 38% milk.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.120
And then I'm going to pour
it onto this sheet pan

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.010
and chill it.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:31.290
And then if you take a piece
of paper and just fold this up,

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:35.660
spread it out a little bit, and
now you've got a top for it.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.190
So now it's
completely sealed, so

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.350
in the refrigerator that
goes till it's cold,

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.522
maybe half hour, maybe longer.

00:27:43.522 --> 00:27:44.522
Or it could be tomorrow.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:28:00.740
Then what that looks like
when it's all done is this.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.680
So it's chilled dough now.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.380
And what I'm going
for is to end up

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.608
with something that looks
like this in the end.

00:28:13.266 --> 00:28:14.640
So these are kind
of ready to go.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.890
So it's a stick of cookie
dough, and now there's

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.821
the paper that we're going to
bake it on, so it's not wasted.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.244
Thank you.

00:28:37.614 --> 00:28:38.780
A little flour on the board.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.270
So this is how I'm going to
up with this particular piece.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.466
The paper goes away.

00:28:49.369 --> 00:28:50.285
A little bit of flour.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.290
I'll just cut them into bars.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.620
Add this one in, just if
you have any empty spaces.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.440
So I give it a little squeeze.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.377
Get the shape started.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.520
And that's how that works.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.840
So on the paper it goes.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.380
We wrap it up and roll it.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.130
So now you've got the
cookie, which you can freeze,

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:41.150
you can refrigerate--
refrigerate a couple of weeks,

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.960
freeze couple of months.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.107
Nice to have them on hand.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.960
Any questions
about that process?

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.840
It's kind of simple.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.220
SPEAKER 1: Chef, thank you.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.580
I always forget how much
work it is to make pastries.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.041
This is why I'm no
longer in pastries.

00:30:01.041 --> 00:30:02.040
Are there any questions?

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.390
DONALD WRESSELL:
Oh, no, it's easy.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:04.545
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much.

00:30:04.545 --> 00:30:05.230
DONALD WRESSELL: Sure.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.050
SPEAKER 1: Are we going to
get a taste of everything now?

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:08.160
DONALD WRESSELL: We are.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.102
There are pound
cakes over there.

00:30:10.102 --> 00:30:11.060
Everyone's got a plate.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.560
Is that what it is?

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.280
Should we taste it
now, do you think?

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.780
SPEAKER 1: Any questions?

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.556
AUDIENCE: What is the
advantage of like using 100

00:30:19.556 --> 00:30:22.600
and then 64 as supposed to
something in the middle?

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.640
DONALD WRESSELL: So this
is a really intensive

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.850
flavored cookie.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.120
So I'm using the 100%.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.890
I'm controlling
the amount of sugar

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.110
that goes along with that.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:35.720
Because like in the 64%, 36%
of that's going to be sugar.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.909
So I've added a blend
of these chocolates

00:30:38.909 --> 00:30:41.200
together just to kind of
create this nice strong flavor

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.825
that you're going to
taste in a minute.

00:30:42.825 --> 00:30:45.110
If I had used chocolate that
had sugar already in it,

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.280
it would be really sweet
and kind of cloying

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.647
and not dark and rich,
like this cookie is.

00:30:49.647 --> 00:30:52.105
SPEAKER 1: So you're really
controlling the taste of effect

00:30:52.105 --> 00:30:53.080
that you want.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.371
DONALD WRESSELL: Yes, I'm
controlling the taste effect.

00:30:55.371 --> 00:30:57.020
I'm controlling the flavors.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.700
I'm blending two
kinds of chocolate

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.860
together and then
adding an inclusion,

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.860
which is milk chocolate.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.944
So coming back to the
inclusion, so let's say

00:31:03.944 --> 00:31:05.610
you don't want to put
milk chocolate in,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.430
that inclusion part that
I folded in at the end,

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.390
it could be anything.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.070
It could be white chocolate.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.020
It could be dark chocolate.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.145
It could be milk chocolate.

00:31:13.145 --> 00:31:15.010
It could be nuts,
if you wanted to.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:18.110
The base cookie recipe that
you'll find in the book

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:22.580
is what you need to create this.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.619
Anyway, the inclusions
can be up to you.

00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:25.910
You can be creative about that.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.440
SPEAKER 1: This is amazing.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.870
It's in the book, right?

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:33.530
DONALD WRESSELL:
It is in the book.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.988
SPEAKER 1: Recipes
are in the book.

00:31:34.988 --> 00:31:38.160
How's the chocolate tasting?

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:44.930
So we can ask more technical
questions about how to make.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.300
But I wanted to ask Amy,
you're the generation

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.120
who's brought sustainability
back into your business.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.579
And you were talking so lovingly
and knowingly about the farmers

00:31:56.579 --> 00:31:57.370
that you deal with.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:58.995
Do you want to tell
us what you've done

00:31:58.995 --> 00:32:03.700
and why the cacao growing
and sustainability

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.370
is making such a difference?

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.770
AMY GUITTARD: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.480
I wouldn't go as far as to say
that I brought sustainability

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.090
to Guittard.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.548
Because one of the things that
was so humbling about coming

00:32:13.548 --> 00:32:17.010
to the family business after
not working there for a while

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.700
was sort of realizing
that all the stuff

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.350
we've done without
really talking about it.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.190
My grandfather used
to go to origin,

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.200
and relationships is such a
crucial part of what we do,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.060
and really realizing that
that was just inherently

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.620
how we do business,
which was pretty awesome

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.470
and humbling, again.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:38.320
So what we have been doing is
working to try and articulate

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.430
what those relationships
mean and what they look like.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:42.394
We go to origin.

00:32:42.394 --> 00:32:45.060
I go to origin all the time with
our director of sustainability,

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.810
as does my dad.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.230
And one of the sort of pivotal
points of what we do at origin

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.510
is talking to
farmers about flavor.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.410
You'll oftentimes hear
how important yields

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.360
are, how you've got
farmers need more cocoa.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.450
Because with more cocoa,
they can get more money.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.665
But what you don't
realize is that you also

00:33:01.665 --> 00:33:03.540
have to take into account
what the flavor is.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.350
Because with just a
constant onslaught

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.256
of high-yielding
plants, it's oftentimes

00:33:10.256 --> 00:33:11.380
at the detriment of flavor.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.140
And you don't have this
beautiful, nuanced, balanced

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.850
flavor that's so important to
making good chocolate, which

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.690
is also important to creating
a sustainable supply chain.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.120
I think we so oftentimes
think about sustainability

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.190
in terms of programs on the
ground or things like that.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.140
But it's also about putting
in place systems that

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:33.610
create for long-term success
and longevity for a product.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:34.610
So we talk about flavor.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.670
We talk about relationships.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:37.628
We do a lot of programs
on the ground-- women's

00:33:37.628 --> 00:33:41.426
empowerment stuff, helping
towards child protection

00:33:41.426 --> 00:33:42.800
initiatives in
West Africa, which

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.510
is a really big, very
challenging cultural thing that

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:52.340
happens over there.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.460
SPEAKER 1: Do you
want to give us

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:58.195
a quick guide to how to taste
the chocolate you've put out,

00:33:58.195 --> 00:33:59.652
what the origins are?

00:33:59.652 --> 00:34:01.110
AMY GUITTARD: Sure,
yeah, we didn't

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.419
bring our single origins,
which in hindsight would have

00:34:03.419 --> 00:34:04.710
been fun for you guys to taste.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.700
But maybe I'll send
them down, and you guys

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.670
can do a sampling
at another time.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.510
But we selected the
products that Donald

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.610
is using in his recipes
because it's fun,

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.620
and I totally nerd
out about this stuff.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.790
But it's fun to taste the
chocolate as itself and sort

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.040
of close your eyes and
envision, sort of as Donald

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.900
was talking about,
what he does when he

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.814
is trying to develop a recipe.

00:34:24.814 --> 00:34:26.980
Taste the chocolate, and
then if you haven't already

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.710
finished your plates, which it
looks like most of you have,

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:33.400
try and taste the chocolate
against the finished dessert.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.513
But I pulled the 70 in
the 72, neither of which

00:34:36.513 --> 00:34:37.679
are included in the recipes.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.290
But again, it's just a
fun point of comparison.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.889
The 72 isn't an origin.

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:42.710
It's a blend.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.639
Both of those are blends.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.440
The 70 is a little bit more of
a French style, a little bit

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.219
more peaky, fruity.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:52.210
The 72 is what, again,
we call Moorish.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:54.150
You kind of want more of it.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.544
There's like sipping
chocolates, which are oftentimes

00:34:56.544 --> 00:34:58.460
more of the single
origins, where you can only

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.100
take a little bit,
and it's to savor it.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:06.250
And then the Moorish sometimes,
it's more of a Dutched note.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.420
But the 72 doesn't have
any Dutching in it.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.770
But it's made primarily from
beans out of West Africa, which

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.130
has a very coconutty flavor.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.630
So when you taste
them side by side,

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.520
you'll be able to
pick up on that.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.430
I also pulled the 38 and
the 45, both of which

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:26.184
are milk chocolates, but again,
total different opposites

00:35:26.184 --> 00:35:26.850
of the spectrum.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:31.360
The 38 is more of a fresh dairy
note, more of an American style

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.280
milk chocolate.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.110
The 45 has more of like
a sour dairy note to it,

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.790
so it's a little bit more
of like a French style.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:41.200
And then we have 63% chip.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.090
And we didn't quite
get to this, but when

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.590
you guys are baking, if you're
looking through the cookbook,

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.298
you'll see that there's
some recipes that

00:35:47.298 --> 00:35:49.890
call for wafers, some that
call for baking chips.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.670
The easiest way that I can sort
of describe the difference--

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.440
you can make a chocolate chip
cookie with both-- is a baking

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.960
chip oftentimes serves as like
an architectural structure.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.600
It's got less
cocoa butter in it,

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.340
so it's going to
hold up your cookie.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.680
Whereas if you bake a
cookie with baking wafers,

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.250
there's more cocoa butter in it.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:07.250
That's why it's flatter.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.666
So when you bake
a cookie with it,

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:11.020
it's going to be like a little
bit of a flatter cookie.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.380
It's going to be a
little bit oozier.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.060
So I put that out
there just for fun,

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.310
not that you don't know what
a baking chip looks like.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:18.270
But it's there.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.490
And then 100%, if you're
daring, go for it.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.510
It's super palatable for 100%.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.510
It doesn't have any sugar
in it-- the original energy

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.970
bar, as I like to say.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.490
The 91 and then the 64, and then
we have the Cocoa Rouge out,

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:36.210
just so you can see that really
beautiful red color, which

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.510
comes from the beans.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.085
And that's a Dutched
powder as well.

00:36:40.085 --> 00:36:42.780
SPEAKER 1: Donald, do you have
a favorite-- a cook's point

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.529
of view about what
they're going to taste?

00:36:46.125 --> 00:36:48.000
DONALD WRESSELL: Gosh,
that's a hard question

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.350
because I use so many of them
for so many different reasons.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.855
Again, I like to blend them.

00:36:52.855 --> 00:36:53.980
I like to blend chocolates.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.880
SPEAKER 1: So you used
the 100% and the 60--

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.435
DONALD WRESSELL: 64 and
the 38 in that cookie.

00:36:58.435 --> 00:37:01.050
I used Coco Rouge and the
91% in the pound cake.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.300
SPEAKER 1: Really interesting.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.550
DONALD WRESSELL: Yeah,
I like to combine them.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.372
SPEAKER 1: OK, great.

00:37:06.372 --> 00:37:08.450
AUDIENCE: Hi, a
question about fondue.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:10.830
Of all the ones that you just
described, which ones would

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.630
you recommend the
most if somebody wants

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:13.575
to make a chocolate fondue?

00:37:13.575 --> 00:37:14.800
DONALD WRESSELL: A
chocolate fondue?

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.716
AUDIENCE: With fruits
like strawberries in it.

00:37:16.716 --> 00:37:18.681
DONALD WRESSELL: Well,
chocolate fondue,

00:37:18.681 --> 00:37:20.430
are you talking about
mixing it with cream

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.990
or just straight chocolate?

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.870
Just straight chocolate?

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.820
I think I would use
the 70% over there.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.589
Yeah, I would.

00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:29.130
SPEAKER 1: I would
mix it with cream.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.005
DONALD WRESSELL: She
would mix it with cream.

00:37:31.005 --> 00:37:34.320
But also, yeah-- also good.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.720
AUDIENCE: I was just
curious, in your pamphlet

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.830
it says that you work
with governments to help

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:42.000
with the right of
the chocolate makers.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.087
How does that
relationship look like?

00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:46.670
DONALD WRESSELL: So governments,
in terms of local governments

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.889
at origin-- so cocoa is
one of the biggest sort

00:37:49.889 --> 00:37:51.680
of commodities for a
lot of these countries

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.850
that are growing it.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:57.790
And the government oftentimes
regulates the price

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:00.130
and regulate sort of the
inputs that they get,

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.380
whether it's fertilizers,
planning materials, things

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:02.880
like that.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.590
It's heavily, heavily
regulated, which

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.910
is a good thing because
a lot of these farmers

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.650
are living out in
the boonies, and they

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.604
don't have access to things.

00:38:10.604 --> 00:38:12.020
A lot of the roads
are really bad.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.770
So when the government's
involved, it's good,

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.350
but it's oftentimes
when you work

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:20.070
in collaboration with them, it
sort of affords an opportunity

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.100
for different sorts of
perspectives to be shared

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.140
and understood.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.720
For instance,
flavor is something

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.860
that they don't
necessarily realize.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.410
There's a disconnect between
the importance of flavor

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.400
and how that impacts
price on the cocoas traded

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.490
on the futures market.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:37.170
So it impacts price.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:43.170
It impacts sort of the long term
perspective of the cocoa plant

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:43.920
itself.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.880
And so that's just
one example of how

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.610
working in collaboration
with government

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.690
sort of brings additional
perspective about how they can

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.470
aid farmers and
sort of-- for us,

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.050
it's more about
capacity building.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:58.410
So with knowledge and
with that sort of dialogue

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.904
can create sort of long
term success that's

00:39:00.904 --> 00:39:02.320
owned by the
countries themselves,

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.930
rather than just coming in and
saying like, oh, plant this.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:09.180
One of the things that we do in
Ghana is we have flavor labs.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.120
That's in conjunction with
the Cocoa Research Institute

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.270
of Ghana, CRIG, which they
have huge resources available.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.890
And so we instituted
a flavor lab there

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:22.117
to give them the tools so
they know how to taste.

00:39:22.117 --> 00:39:24.200
So the planning materials
that they're getting in,

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.741
they can figure out whether it's
something that they actually

00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:29.190
want to plant and hand
out to farmers, rather

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.546
than just knowing that
it's a high-yielding plant.

00:39:31.546 --> 00:39:33.545
They came to our office,
a bunch of scientists--

00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:36.190
Ghanaian scientists came to our
office and spent like a week

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.859
with us in our lab,
learning how to taste,

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:41.400
which is continued from all the
work that they've been doing.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.610
And that's a USAID
program that we do.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.780
We're doing a similar
thing in Indonesia

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.090
because they have a really
beautiful cocoa bean that

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:54.520
is, not to belabor it,
but in Indonesia they

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.080
harvest during the rainy season.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.100
So when they're
drying in the sun,

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:02.080
the beans oftentimes
get too much moisture.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.090
And so they'll dry
them near a fire,

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.600
which gives a smoky flavor,
which is not good for cocoa.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.570
So if you guys see
a bar that says

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.390
like the inherent smoky
notes of a cocoa bean,

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:18.660
that's them trying to hide the
fact that they're getting beans

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.209
that are tainted with smoke.

00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:22.000
Because you don't want
smoke in your beans.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.291
But anyway, so we're working
with Indonesian government

00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:27.760
to sort of implement a
similar program in Ghana--

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.240
to what we did in Ghana.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.740
AUDIENCE: So Chef [INAUDIBLE]
mentioned that chocolate

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.300
seen as like a super food.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.650
Have you seen any
changes in recent years

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:38.810
with market interests
or customer demand

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:42.360
for like products as the
whole raw food revolution

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.210
everything has been occurring?

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:47.010
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I mean,
I think the trends in food

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.560
is that there's
always this sort of

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:52.240
like how can we eat delicacies
and like indulgent foods

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.640
and feel OK about it.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.750
And I think the truth around
the antioxidants things

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:00.320
is that, yes, chocolate has
like inherent properties that

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.960
are good for you.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.140
In terms of like new
trends and things

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.432
like that, not so much
by way of antioxidants.

00:41:06.432 --> 00:41:08.640
I mean, I think you can look
at it at the marketplace

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.720
and you'll see that
there's an increased

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.890
interest in like raw foods.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.070
I get really nervous
about raw cacao.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.270
I mean I'll eat nibs, and
I eat stuff on the farm.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.730
But I think that might just
because my stomach's somewhat

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.100
tough, knock on wood.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.700
But the raw chocolate
movement, ugh, it's

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.090
like a little concerning
to me because there's so

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:35.700
many just icky things in
the bean that comes out

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.540
when you're roasting it.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.800
But I think the
biggest trend that I

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.339
see right now is organic, at
least in the chocolate space.

00:41:43.339 --> 00:41:44.880
I don't know how
you feel about that,

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.890
since you see it from a
different side of things.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:47.400
DONALD WRESSELL:
Yeah, if I can just

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.820
circle back on the raw
chocolate thing just real quick.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.778
AMY GUITTARD: Oh, yeah.

00:41:50.778 --> 00:41:52.610
DONALD WRESSELL:
So cacao is heaped

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.760
in one-meter square
boxes, generally speaking,

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.610
and fermented.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:59.780
So it's in the jungle area.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.390
Then it's dried on a
concrete patio in the sun,

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.660
and then it's put
into a burlap bag.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.570
And then it gets to
the factory, where

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:11.740
it could have foreign object,
like rocks and things in it,

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.240
whatever.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.489
So we spend a lot of time
cleaning it before we put it

00:42:14.489 --> 00:42:15.740
through the machinery.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.632
So if you can imagine it
being heaped and fermented

00:42:18.632 --> 00:42:20.090
and then dried on
a concrete patio,

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:25.130
the pathogen level can
be quite substantial.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.970
So when you just pop cocoa
beans in your mouth raw,

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.390
I don't know, maybe--
I don't do it.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.410
I won't do it.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.160
You're tough.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.140
I would never do that.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:38.000
AMY GUITTARD: Well, no, I've
had my fair share of challenges.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.375
DONALD WRESSELL:
So I just wanted

00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:42.900
to explain how that
happens and how that looks.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.604
And as Amy said, a lot of what
we get in the bean quality

00:42:46.604 --> 00:42:48.270
has to do with what
happens at the farm.

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:51.209
And the fermentation and
drying process are critical.

00:42:51.209 --> 00:42:52.000
AMY GUITTARD: Huge.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.010
DONALD WRESSELL: Without
that being done correctly,

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.360
the beans don't have a chance.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.310
AMY GUITTARD: I mean, that's
another thing we do at origin

00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:59.360
is work with farmers.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.970
We'll have them send us beans.

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.604
I mean, I just came
back from-- anyway,

00:43:05.604 --> 00:43:07.270
I go to a bunch of
trade shows, and I'll

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:08.480
like bring beans back for me.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.090
I'm like this came
from Cameroon,

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.922
and we'll do a test
run of the beans.

00:43:12.922 --> 00:43:14.380
And if we can taste
it that they've

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.390
been improperly fermented, which
isn't necessarily a government

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.480
thing, but if they've
been improperly fermented

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.830
or not dried
properly, we'll give

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.970
that feedback to the farmers
and allow them to have,

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:28.630
again, a dialogue and kind of
get them on the right path,

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:31.560
because it's such a
crucial component.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.710
A lot of these farmers
are super impoverished.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:37.410
So this is their life savings.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:40.570
And it's pretty cool.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.130
SPEAKER 1: Will you talk
us through the anatomy

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:44.642
of the bean?

00:43:44.642 --> 00:43:46.600
AMY GUITTARD: The anatomy
of the bean, the pod?

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.840
SPEAKER 1: So what is
actually crushed and made

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.300
into cacao paste?

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.100
AMY GUITTARD: So these
little white seeds,

00:43:55.100 --> 00:44:00.430
which I'll leave this out here,
these are cocoa beans-- seeds.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:04.950
They become-- everyone kind of
gets tripped up on the lexicon.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:09.530
But these are seeds,
otherwise known as cacao.

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.880
We call it cocoa beans
once they come to us,

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.500
once they are just about
to go through the process.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.110
But this white pulp is
what they ferment in,

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.680
and this is really crucial.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.900
Different beans have
different fat content.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.550
So like Ecuador tends
to have a little bit

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:28.450
of a lower fat content
than, say, like Madagascar

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:29.110
or something.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:30.730
And that's just the
varietal of that's

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:33.220
grown in these different
countries of origin.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.070
And that doesn't necessarily
impact the fermentation,

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:39.230
but it impacts the end product
when we're making chocolate,

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.120
because you're grinding it, as
I said when we first started.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.740
So this white pulp is
what it kind of sits in,

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:45.800
as Donald said.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.210
Different countries
ferment in different ways.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:50.720
West Africa typically
does heap fermentation.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:56.060
So they'll chop the
pod off the tree trunk.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.300
Then they'll slice it open.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.310
They'll pull the seeds out.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:01.350
There's a really
quick period of time

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:06.260
before it starts to oxidize, so
you throw it into a, as I said,

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.970
in West Africa they
do heap fermentation.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.820
So it's a science that
they've mastered, typically

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.276
passed down for generations.

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:14.360
They'll put the beans in a heap.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.040
And then over the course
of two to three days,

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.210
they'll turn them
in on themselves.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.600
It's actually like five to
seven days, more or less,

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.660
when they're fermenting.

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.000
And then in South
America they do

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.330
what we call box fermentation.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:30.972
So it's cascading boxes.

00:45:30.972 --> 00:45:32.180
They'll start off at the top.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.890
Then-- super ingenious-- they
open the front of the box.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:39.211
The fermented beans kind
of turn in on themselves,

00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:39.960
and then they sit.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.220
They put banana leaves on top.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.650
Then they sit in that box.

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:45.050
Then a day later they open
it, and then they turn it.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.550
And you'll sometimes see on a
farm like a little chalkboard,

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.570
where they'll start checking
off how many days, what it is.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.420
These guys you know
their beans so well,

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.820
they can put their hand
in and feel the heat.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.780
I'm still learning.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.460
You can also tell whether
it's been properly dried

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.020
by the crunch of the
shell on the seed.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.690
So that white pulp is
what it ferments in.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.610
But then there's also,
like most seeds-- like

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:09.094
if you guys an apple,
you know the brown husk

00:46:09.094 --> 00:46:10.510
sort of like comes
off, and you've

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:13.310
got that slippery
white seed inside?

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:15.640
That's kind of what I
could say is like the shell

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.130
of like a cocoa seed.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.010
And then after it's fermented,
then you lay it out to dry,

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.300
typically at a solar dryer.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.390
And so that's sort of
how that process works.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.170
And then we get it at factory.

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.494
SPEAKER 1: And you are
roasting it in south city?

00:46:31.494 --> 00:46:33.160
AMY GUITTARD: We're
based in Burlingame.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.705
So we had to move down
there in like 1950

00:46:35.705 --> 00:46:38.080
is when they decided to build
a freeway over our factory.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.460
But we roast and make--
most of our chocolate

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.946
is sold on the wholesale side.

00:46:43.946 --> 00:46:45.820
So you don't really
realize you're eating it.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.700
But you're probably
eating more Guittard

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.870
than you might realize.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.020
But it's sold in
as an ingredient,

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.640
and then we also have consumer
line, which is out here.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.630
And then a lot of pastry
chefs use us as well.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:01.867
AUDIENCE: I've read
projections that growing demand

00:47:01.867 --> 00:47:03.700
for chocolate is starting
to outstrip supply

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.360
at a rather rapid rate
on international markets.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.574
Is there any comment
that you have on that?

00:47:08.574 --> 00:47:10.990
AMY GUITTARD: Yeah, I mean,
it's principles of economics--

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:12.490
supply and demand.

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:15.160
You know, I think you have
to remember that cocoa

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:20.421
is a commodity, and it's an
agricultural product at the-- I

00:47:20.421 --> 00:47:21.420
don't want to say mercy.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.940
But it fluctuates,
production fluctuates,

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.470
based on mother nature.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.300
We just had an El
Nino season, which

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.080
typically means that
Africa's really, really dry.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.460
South America is
really, really wet.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.690
And those extremes-- cocoa's
a really delicate tree,

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:39.660
which is why there's so much
conversation around yields

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.060
and planting material,
and how can you

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.740
start planting more
robust trees that can last

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:49.060
longer in this extreme weather.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.300
We always believe the
principles of economics

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.780
will sort of iron things out.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.010
It's always been the case.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:57.051
You look at the cocoa
market, and it's constantly

00:47:57.051 --> 00:47:57.620
fluctuating.

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:02.690
So I think we'll have plenty of
chocolate to go around for all.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:07.300
SPEAKER 1: What is the addictive
ingredient in chocolate?

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.321
What would you say it is?

00:48:09.321 --> 00:48:11.195
AMY GUITTARD: Could you
answer that question?

00:48:11.195 --> 00:48:12.111
Is it the theobromine?

00:48:12.111 --> 00:48:15.590
DONALD WRESSELL: Well,
theobromine, apparently-- it's

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:18.060
a trace, trace, trace
amount of caffeine in there.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.637
But that's not really
why people-- there's

00:48:20.637 --> 00:48:22.720
something about chocolate
that creates a sensation

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.553
that you're in love.

00:48:23.553 --> 00:48:25.189
Like it releases sort of--

00:48:25.189 --> 00:48:26.230
SPEAKER 1: Phenylalanine?

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.370
DONALD WRESSELL: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:29.342
What you said, yeah.

00:48:29.342 --> 00:48:31.800
AMY GUITTARD: And we also talk
about like taste has memory.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.760
That's one of the things.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.250
We also have this concept of
incremental degradation, which

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.000
is my dad should trademark
because he talks about it all

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:38.610
the time.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.850
But it's the idea where the
things that you love, slowly

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:44.140
over time, start to
change flavor if you

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.760
don't keep track of what it is.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.790
And we're talking about the
importance of keeping flavor

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:50.790
in mind when you're looking
at planning material

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.080
that's going in on the farms.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.330
The same thing happens when
you're crafting chocolate.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.880
You could be like,
uh, I'm not going

00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.640
to add this bean today because
how we have to do this.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.550
Over time, if you
continue to do that, it'll

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:05.320
incremental degradation,
the base of the chocolate's

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.730
going to change.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:08.970
And that idea of
taste having memory--

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:13.490
that chocolate that you had when
you were a kid, if you taste

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:15.760
that 10 years later,
15 years later,

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.760
it's going to bring you
back to that moment when

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.210
you had that first chocolate.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.640
And a lot of the
stuff that we do,

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.820
we've had in our
repertoire for 150 years,

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.240
and other stuff is really new.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.814
And there's products
that I smell or taste,

00:49:28.814 --> 00:49:30.730
and I'm just brought
right back to that moment

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:31.605
right then and there.

00:49:31.605 --> 00:49:37.290
So, yeah, whether theobromine
or your soul I think that it's--

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:40.870
SPEAKER 1: Where do we go
to get a retail Guittard?

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:43.490
AMY GUITTARD: Yeah, so
you can buy our stuff.

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:45.940
Most premium supermarkets
light Draegers,

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:49.220
Mollie Stone's, Whole
Foods carries it.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:50.940
Some of these items
are pretty new.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.980
So I always say
ask your retailers,

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.130
because they may
not be aware of it

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:58.405
or it might just be on its way.

00:49:58.405 --> 00:49:59.940
SPEAKER 1: Can you
can order online?

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.440
AMY GUITTARD: You can, limited
amount, and the shipping cost

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.280
is obscene because it's
a delicate product.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:08.210
TBD.

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:10.440
SPEAKER 1: Can we please
have the cake come out?

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.400
DONALD WRESSELL: It's
just almost there.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.680
So the thing about
cakes-- let me just

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.804
talk about cake real quick.

00:50:14.804 --> 00:50:19.660
So if you slam the
door on a cake--

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.280
when the cake first
starts to bake,

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.910
it's just basically air cells
holding up the structure

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:28.430
until the proteins and
the starches coagulate,

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:30.610
if you will, or set.

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:33.964
So if you open the door and
shut it, the cake will collapse.

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:35.880
Have any of you ever
seen that before in cake?

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.460
Has it ever happened to anybody?

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.690
Raise a hand?

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.160
Yeah, so it's because
it's not set yet.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.500
So this is where we are here.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.417
It's just about there.

00:50:43.417 --> 00:50:44.791
If I take it out
now, we're going

00:50:44.791 --> 00:50:46.430
to have a little
cave-in in middle.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:48.000
So how do I tell it's done?

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.320
The spring back actually.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.730
It's just like pushing
on your forearm.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.388
It springs back.

00:50:53.388 --> 00:50:55.073
AUDIENCE: I usually
use a toothpick.

00:50:55.073 --> 00:50:56.406
DONALD WRESSELL: Toothpick's OK.

00:50:56.406 --> 00:50:58.645
That'll check moisture content.

00:50:58.645 --> 00:51:00.570
If it's real wet
inside, it's not

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:02.950
going to be-- I'm so familiar
with doing that, I just

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:06.480
touch it with my hand
and I kind of know.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.260
In time, it comes.

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.189
You bake enough
cakes, it'll happen.

00:51:09.189 --> 00:51:10.980
Checking the temperature
with a thermometer

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.920
to see if it's done, is
that what you're asking?

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.260
You can.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.250
I never do that.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.560
I do that with other
things, but not with cake.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.450
Really, it's just about the
feel of it, how it feels.

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:27.266
And actually, if you
want to, you come by

00:51:27.266 --> 00:51:29.140
and just touch it when
I put it on the table.

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:33.146
And you can see kind of how
it feels, if that helps.

00:51:33.146 --> 00:51:34.520
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you both so much

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.470
for just a delicious afternoon.

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:38.890
AMY GUITTARD: Thanks
for having us.
