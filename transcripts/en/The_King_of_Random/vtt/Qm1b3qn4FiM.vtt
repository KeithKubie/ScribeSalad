00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.080
Hey guys we're back.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.560
It's the next day and our silicone has

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.360
fully cured from our last experiment

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.560
where we took a vacuum chamber

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.000
and sucked all the air bubbles out of the silicone first

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.380
The idea being, that now our pokeball molds should be completely bubble free.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.060
So now we get to see if that is really the case.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.600
Now you've already seen me rip these off and cut them open in a previous video

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.100
So I'm not gonna spend a lot of time doing that here

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.080
Lets just dive right in and get it done.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.120
Cool guys. so we got our silicone molds out of the casings

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.620
 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.180
And if you look down here, where the clay was, you can see it makes a really cool cavity.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.320
And so now, when we pour molten Aluminum, Wax or even gummy Syrup

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.940
It's gonna have a reservoir to draw from as it cools and shrinks

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.560
I did notice on this one however, the clay was pushed up a little bit too high into the ball and that creates a bit of a problem

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.720
because now the ball is exposed

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.960
that means the inside of this ball mold isn't fully complete

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.140
The cool thing about silicone is: even though it's cured we can add more and it will fuse in and make one solid chunk of silicone.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.720
So even though we messed up here and didn't completely cover the ball

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.700
We can just mix up a little bit more, pour that in

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.500
and when it sets, it should be perfect

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.020
The only problem is, we only need one tablespoon of silicone

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.980
and i've got 5 gallons of the stuff

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.480
This looks like white frosting, it's really cool

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.660
Now we're not gonna need a lot of silicone, so i just mixed up about 100 grams worth here

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.680
and honestly we're probably gonna waste more than we actually use

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.720
But when you're dealing with quantities this small there's not much else we can do

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.000
Now I am gonna stick this in the vacuum chamber as well

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.840
and one interesting thing about this vacuum chamber is that if you look at this gauge

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.360
it's still suctioned up

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.280
I set this last night and sucked it down to about 25 inches of mercury

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.720
and interestingly enough

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.460
over the entire night, it's only slipped down to about 23

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.900
and the vacuum pump is not running, it's just maintaining vaccum pressure with these valves here

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.200
so i thought that was pretty cool and it means our proto-putty seal is working as intended

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.720
Sweet! Thats the stuff right there. Just made it to the lip of that cup

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.840
and now the bubbles are being extracted. So we just need that to settle down and then it should be good to pour.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.160
See, that suctions on pretty good

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.280
And our glass jar is not exploding, that's always a plus. :)

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.760
And now if we just drizzle this straight over this pokeball until the bottom is covered

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.640
we should be in business.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.400
alright, let's call that good!

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.440
(tries to pull it up) It's stuck. (laughs)

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.760
This bottom is actually so smooth

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.000
that if I slam it down on a hard surface

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It creates a suction cup that's actually

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Very difficult to get back off

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.682
(arrrrrrrrr) WOW!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Impressive  hehehehe

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Maybe we could use silicone to make our own suction cups

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.760
Now before we cut this thing open

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.000
you guys tell me in the comments... "Do you think

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.680
we made a mold that came out bubble free?"

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680
I'm a little bit nervous and a little bit excited to find out

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.680
because i have no idea

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.780
There we go... another successful extraction

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.500
so, cool!

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.640
now another little tweak I made to these pokeballs before I stuck them in the silicone

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.260
I took a bead of hot glue and wrapped it around the inside

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.480
to prevent the silicone from seeping in

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.980
It looked like it actually work out pretty well that time

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.500
we don't have these things loaded up with silicone

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.960
so yay!

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.760
alright so the moment of truth how does it look

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.960
on the inside? Lets take a peak

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.460
ohh yeah

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.460
that is actually looking really good

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.720
I see nothing but smooth silicone

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.080
no bubbles this time

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.620
that's a dramatic difference from our last mold

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.740
do you remember our last one was  pocked with bubbles everywhere

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.740
and this one completly smooth

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.960
that is very encouraging I like that

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.360
yeah that looks.. just about perfect

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.640
all we have to do now is trim up some of the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.160
flaps here, you can see where it leaked into the balls a little bit

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
but if we can trim those up

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.760
i think were going to have ourselves a pretty dang nice pokeball mold

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.880
(sings) Like a surgeon

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.380
so cool guys so our mold is looking awesome

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.260
im really excited to see how our wax castings

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.160
is going to turn out

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.780
but before we cast the wax

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.780
there are a few suggestions from my friend Nate

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.780
about how to make this work little bit better. First of all,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.780
maybe we should put it in the microwave for

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.600
about 3 minutes to warm the silicone up

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.780
Second of all when we pour the wax in here let's start off with a little bit and rotate the mold around

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.780
so it coats the inner walls of the mould first

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.780
and after we fill this thing up with wax

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.780
let's throw it in a vacuum chamber for a couple of minutes so see

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.780
if there's any air in molten wax

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.780
If we follow all those suggestions

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.780
perfectly I'm fairly confident

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.780
we're going to end up with a perfect wax Pokeball.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.993
So our mold just came out of the microwave

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:25.755
It's nice and toasty warm right now

00:04:25.862 --> 00:04:27.773
and our wax is completely molten

00:04:27.773 --> 00:04:29.235
So, let's pour the WAX!

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:33.513
Beauuutiful.... alright, gonna stop there for just a second.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.000
So what I'm doing now is I'm just rotating this gently

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.400
to put a nice wax coating on the inner walls of the mold.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.400
The idea being that that will fill in any gaps and prevent any air bubbles.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.520
Let's pour the rest.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.240
Ok now at this point I'm just going to stop for a second

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.400
and put this thing in the vacuum chamber to see if there are any air bubbles in there that we can suck out first.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Oh I see some bubbles rising there!

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.280
Interesting!

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.600
Wow that's incredible!

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.280
So I'm not really sure where those bubbles are coming from whether they're

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.600
leaking through the cracks in the side of the silicon mold

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.360
or these are actually bubble that were in the wax itself

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.360
but in either case I'm feeling  a lot more confident now that we have run them through a cycle in the vacuum chamber

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.360
alright let's release the pressure

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.360
[ Air hissing back into vacuum chamber ]

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.360
super cool

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.000
beauteous

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
there's our wax... hopefully bubble free

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.440
it's interesting it also looks like the wax has shrunk down a little bit

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.440
I wonder if that's because it's cooled in the vacuum?

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.640
but in either case we're going to top this thing off so it has a nice reservoir to draw from

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.240
there we go right to the very top and we'll see how much that actually shrinks down.
