00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.340
- [Voiceover] "Many species
have circadian rhythms

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.390
"that exhibit an
approximately 24-hour cycle.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.460
"Circadian rhythms are
controlled by both genetics

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.175
"and environmental
conditions, including light.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.610
"Researchers investigated
the effect of light

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.520
"on mouse behavior by
using a running wheel

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.080
"with a motion sensor to record activity

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.070
"on actograms, as shown in figure one."

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.850
All right, so let's think
about what figure one

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.300
is showing us.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.170
We have a picture of a mouse here

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.530
that seems to be inactive,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.900
definitely not on the running wheel,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.000
even eyes closed, maybe it's sleeping.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.680
And then here, a picture of a mouse

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.600
that is on the running
wheel, maybe running,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.186
with its eyes open.

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:40.280
And then we see our actogram
here and it describes,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.760
"Strategy for recording
mouse activity data.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.600
"When a mouse is active
on the running wheel,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.340
"the activity is recorded
as a dark horizontal line

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.460
"on an actogram.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.080
"When the mouse is inactive,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.680
"no dark line is recorded."

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.440
So we can see here, it gives
us the activity for each day.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.133
So for day one, day
one is right over here.

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.480
Let me do that in a lighter color

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.730
so that I don't overwrite
what you need to see.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.590
So day one is right over there,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.820
and you can see from hour zero to hour 12,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.920
since we have no black
line, the mouse is inactive.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.440
We're not detecting activity
on the running wheel.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.940
And then when we have the
black line from hour 12

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.200
to hour 24, that means
we are detecting activity

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.040
on the running wheel and so we can assume

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.240
that the mouse is active.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760
And then we have it again for day two,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.120
and the way this is set up, it looks like

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.920
that pattern holds for every day.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.340
Let's keep going.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.870
"For the investigation,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.020
"adult male mice were
individually housed in cages

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.640
"in a soundproof room
at 25 degrees Celsius."

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.640
So they wanted to make
sure that these mice

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.880
didn't bother each other,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.050
that this was definitely
controlled conditions.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.340
Soundproof, that they're not
impacted by outside noises,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.860
other mice, a variation in temperature,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.146
so they tried to for all of these things.

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:01.520
"Each mouse was provided
with adequate food,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.740
"water, bedding material,
and a running wheel.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.040
"The mice were exposed to daily periods

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.580
"of 12 hours of light,"

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.530
with the capital L,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.720
"and 12 hours of dark,"

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.450
capital D.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.540
L12, D12.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.340
So that's 12 hours of
light, 12 hours of darkness,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.490
"for 14 days, and their activity

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.366
"was continuously monitored.

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:22.660
"The activity data are
shown in figure two."

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.120
All right, so this is an
actogram of mouse activity

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.070
under L12, D12 conditions.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.290
Each row represents a 24-hour period

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.500
and the dark horizontal
lines represent activity

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.431
on the running wheel,
just like we saw before.

00:02:33.431 --> 00:02:36.240
But this is actual data
that we are recording.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.040
So in the first 12 hours,
the mouse are in conditions

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.530
where there's light, and you
can see for the most part,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.420
on day one, we detect no activity.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.640
On day two, we also detective no activity.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.820
On day three, we detect
a little bit of activity,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.070
but for the most part, when it's light,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.900
we detect very little to no activity.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.810
And when it's dark, it's the opposite.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.770
We detect a lot of activity
on that running wheel.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.620
There's a few gaps right over here,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.914
but for the most part, the
mouse is active when it's dark.

00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:11.390
So the mouse is active when it's dark

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.912
and inactive

00:03:14.912 --> 00:03:17.020
when it is light, which is the opposite

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.760
of most human beings, or frankly,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.120
well, definitely human beings,
where we tend to be active

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.240
in the light and inactive in the dark.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.787
Interesting.

00:03:25.787 --> 00:03:29.690
After 14 days, so that was
just with 12 hours of light,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.106
12 hours of darkness.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:33.320
"After 14 days of L12, D12,"

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.400
so it's 12 hours of
light, 12 hours darkness,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.400
"the mice were placed
in continuous darkness."

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.660
Capital D, capital D.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.140
DD, that sounds unpleasant.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.720
Continuous darkness.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.480
And their activity on the running wheel

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.215
was reported as before.

00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:50.220
"The activity data under
DD," continuous darkness,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.503
"conditions are shown in figure three."

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:55.230
All right, so this is interesting here.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.140
So it looks like on day one,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.970
the mice were inactive, not 12 hours,

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.800
like we saw when we had 12 hours of light,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.270
but it looks like about 10 hours.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.660
And then from hour, I don't
know, this is maybe hour nine

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.870
or 10, to about hour,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.990
it looks like maybe hour 21,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.940
they were active.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.560
Maybe 12 hours, maybe a
little less than 12 hours.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.040
And then inactive,
active, inactive, active,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.990
but it seems to be less than for 12 hours.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.280
And then they're active
for less than 12 hours.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.080
So you see everything shifting
up every 24-hour period

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.440
because they tend to be
inactive for less than 12 hours.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.680
It looks like it's 10
or 11 hours each day.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.140
And then active for a little
bit less than 12 hours.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.390
So that's why you see
this shifting pattern

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.442
where every day the activity starts

00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:45.340
at roughly an earlier period.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.940
It's not a perfect trend,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.450
but you see the trend over multiple days.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.090
I can draw, I can show a line

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.340
that goes something like this.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.150
You can see every day
we are starting activity

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.046
at an earlier hour.

00:04:58.046 --> 00:05:00.780
And every day we're
also ending our activity

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.400
at an earlier hour.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.410
And there's a lot more,
I guess you could say,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.360
sporadic activity going on.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.120
And remember, this under
continuous darkness.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.260
All right, let's see if we
can answer the questions.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.800
"The nervous system plays
a role in coordinating

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.900
"the observed activity pattern of mice

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.320
"in response to light-dark stimuli."

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.140
Yes, that makes sense, of course.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.740
"Describe one role of each

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.560
"of the following anatomical structures

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.210
"in responding to light-dark stimuli."

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.144
A photoreceptor in the retina of an eye.

00:05:32.144 --> 00:05:34.000
Well, this detects light.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.200
Detects light

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.830
and sends signal.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.240
Or maybe I'll say transmit signal.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.715
Transmits signal

00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:52.704
that eventually gets to brain.

00:05:52.704 --> 00:05:55.580
That eventually

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.470
gets to brain.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.766
Gets to the brain.

00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:03.660
All right?

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.720
The brain.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.860
Well, it receives signals.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.510
It receives.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.700
I before E, except after C.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.682
It re-see (laughs), it receives,

00:06:15.682 --> 00:06:18.120
it receives signals.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.580
It receives signals and
then coordinates activity

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.680
based on that.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.060
Coordinates activity

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.340
response based on that.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.030
Based on signals.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.520
Based on the signals.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.140
So this is really just, you know,

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.760
do we know what a photoreceptor,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.100
a brain, and a motor neuron,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.954
I guess as related to this test.

00:06:49.954 --> 00:06:51.460
And then a motor neuron,

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.860
well, these are neurons
that would stimulate.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.634
You tend to think of things
that would be, you know,

00:06:56.634 --> 00:06:59.120
like motor movement, like muscles,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.060
but they also control things like glands.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.620
So they stimulate

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.588
muscles, glands.

00:07:10.588 --> 00:07:12.930
And glands could be
especially relevant here

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.440
because glands might be the things

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.140
that release or don't release hormones

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.999
that might put the mice
to sleep or wake them up.

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:21.440
Glands

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.270
that might release
hormones related to sleep.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.860
Might release hormones

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.670
related to sleep, wake.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.030
Related

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.366
to sleep

00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:42.400
and activity.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.280
All right, so I think that's,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.140
we've taken a decent job
of describing the role

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.170
of each of those.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.830
All right, let's go to part B now.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.910
"Based on an analysis of
the data in figure two,

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.670
"describe the activity pattern of mice

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.860
"during the light and dark periods

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.974
"of the L12, D12 cycle."

00:08:04.974 --> 00:08:06.760
Well, this was pretty straightforward.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.604
When there was light,

00:08:08.604 --> 00:08:11.542
so they were inactive during light.

00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:13.000
Inactive

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.460
during light.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.540
Active during dark.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.680
Active

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.260
during dark.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.090
I could've written the answer down below,

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.580
but I think I could've
squeezed this one in.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.960
That's the basic idea.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.760
L12, D12 cycle, we saw right over here.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.750
Inactive during light,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.838
and then active during the dark.

00:08:41.838 --> 00:08:43.526
All right.

00:08:43.526 --> 00:08:45.915
Active during the dark.

00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:47.390
Okay.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.610
"The researchers claim that
the genetically controlled

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.260
"circadian rhythm in
the mice does not follow

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.774
"a 24-hour cycle.

00:08:56.774 --> 00:08:59.700
"Describe one difference
between the daily pattern

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.488
"of activity under L12, D12 conditions,

00:09:02.488 --> 00:09:03.940
"figure two, and under,"

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.800
continuous darkness, the DD
conditions in figure three.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.730
And "use data to support
the researchers' claim."

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.940
All right, well, we
talked about this already.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.580
So under DD,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.510
mice active

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.870
and inactive

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.686
for less

00:09:33.686 --> 00:09:36.700
than 24,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.815
or less than 12 hours each.

00:09:38.815 --> 00:09:42.900
12 hours each.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.720
And then we could say versus 12 hours

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.560
inactivity

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.255
under light,

00:09:55.255 --> 00:09:57.762
under, I could say, L12.

00:09:57.762 --> 00:10:02.480
And 12 hours activity

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.662
under D,

00:10:07.662 --> 00:10:09.320
under D12.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.850
So under continuous darkness,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.590
mice active and inactive
for less than 12 hours each

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.400
versus 12 hours inactivity under L12

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.700
and to 12 hours activity under D12

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.590
when it was dark for 12 hours.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.416
So less than

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:25.750
24-hour cycle.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.350
So less than

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.660
24-hour cycle.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.240
Activity also more sporadic.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.500
Activity

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.183
also more

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.600
sporadic.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.627
Sporadic, or we could say less continuous.

00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:51.280
Less continuous, there's
definitely more times

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.200
where the activity periods is broken up

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.640
by inactivity or the inactive periods

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.810
is broken up by activity.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.310
Less continuous.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.900
All right, I feel pretty good about that.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.870
Now, let's see.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.720
Actually, since I'm already
at 11 minutes in this video,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.100
I'll continue the next two
parts in the next video.
