00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello, and welcome to
Collab Week, 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.320
the week where I fulfill my
obligation as a YouTuber 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.210
to perform some "collaboration"
videos for your enjoyment. 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.300
In this installment, I am joined by heartthrob
disc jockeys Danisnotonfire and AmazingPhil, 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.090
and we will be collaborating
through the medium of sculpture. 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.570
We're going to
make some art now. 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.210
PHIL: Can I just throw a unicorn
into the mix? CHARLIE: You can. 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.900
DAN: You're going equestrian.
Something with four legs. 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.290
That's already very
advanced, Phil. 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.730
CHARLIE: I like unicorn.
Is there anything we can add to that? 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.720
DAN: I could take the black
and make it slightly robot unicorn.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.080
CHARLIE: And...uhh...
rainbow colored. 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.480
PHIL: Rainbow colored.
That works.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.290
DAN: Wow. Okay. 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.850
CHARLIE: How about a different
color for each body part. 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.630
Give it a proper squeeze
and a good roll. 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.690
PHIL: I'm making a hoof. 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.570
DAN: This is the first time
I've engaged my muscles. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.730
PHIL: Charlie, our legs are
looking mildly different right now.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.910
CHARLIE: That's not quite correct.
PHIL: Okay. 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.740
DAN: That's like a duck's foot, Charlie.
That's not much of a hoof. 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.170
Why are they so flat
at the bottom? 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.520
PHIL: That's what hooves look like.
Clop, clop, clop, clop. Clop, clop, clop. 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.030
DAN: Look, even if we don't say it, everyone
watching this is thinking the same thing. 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.310
PHIL: It's looking...
CHARLIE: They are colorful, phallically-shaped

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.630
DAN: Base complete.
CHARLIE: Okay. 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.870
DAN: Half pink,
half yellow body. 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.840
PHIL: Shall I start building
some kind of neck. DAN: Uhh...

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.340
PHIL: I feel like that's too much pressure.
I'm going to make the tail.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920
Is that what a
horse's tail is like? 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.840
DAN: They're more like down,
aren't they? 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.760
PHIL: Well they've got like a flare
at the end like a Charmander. 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.520
CHARLIE: I'm most impressed
by this tail so far. 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.100
PHIL: I'm proud
of the tail. 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.190
CHARLIE: It just happens to also be
the only think you can't see. 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.250
DAN: It's got the
shape of a horse. 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.550
CHARLIE: It has the shape
of a four legged animal. 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.780
Are we going to go
for red for head? 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.040
DAN: Red head,
yeah I'm feeling that. 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.400
CHARLIE: Does someone want to
bring up a photo of a horse?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.080
DAN: Um...
No that's cheating. 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.340
PHIL: Imagine the horse emoji.
Like a simplistic horse.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.790
DAN: Are you a fan of emoji,
Charlie, in your texts?

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.310
CHARLIE: I am. One of my
favorite emojis is the dancing lady. 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.140
DAN: WIth her little--
CHARLIE: Salsa lady. 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.650
DAN: Kicking out a
sassy heal. 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.300
CHARLIE: I feel like she encompasses
a lot of just general joy. 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.140
She's just having the best time,
and so if you're having the best time 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.030
you can communicate
that to people. 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.130
PHIL: Charlie, that
looks terrifying. 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.560
DAN: That looks like a horse
from Silent Hill. What have you done? 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.740
CHARLIE: I don't think horses have
quite as big necks as this. 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.700
DAN: That's a think neck.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.560
CHARLIE: I'm pretty
sure we've made-- 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.380
DAN: This horse is
on steroids. 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.150
CHARLIE: It's not unicorn yet.
PHIL: Oh no!

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.420
CHARLIE: We need the unicorn spike
on the front. PHIL: Uh let's-- 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.110
CHARLIE: I think white's good for that.
DAN: Obviously.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.120
PHIL: Oh that's good
twisting action. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.770
DAN: Charlie's going in
with the twists. 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.750
PHIL: That's amazing. DAN: Man, that could
easily impale someone. 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.250
PHIL: I would buy that.
CHARLIE: Just the horn? PHIL: Yeah 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.660
LAUGHTER

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.620
DAN: What?
PHIL: I don't know. 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.040
DAN: What are you
on about? 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.670
PHIL: I love that this is
our collective skill, as well. 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.020
DAN: One object.
Are you kidding me? 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.440
CHARLIE: We now need to work
on the robotic paneling. 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.620
Do we have
any blue left? 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.090
Let's take a bit out it's butt
and put it in it's face. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.220
Aww, look at that pretty
blue unicorn eye. 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.620
PHIL: It's horn
is drooping. 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.300
DAN: It's having
performance issues.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.780
CHARLIE: So there we go.
There is our collaborative project. 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.760
PHIL: Yeah!

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.160
CHARLIE: Together, we created a
Frankenstein, rainbow, robotic unicorn. 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.810
DAN: Yes! PHIL: I love it.
Can we give it a name?

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.190
CHARLIE: Is it male or female?
I'm feeling female. 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.210
My instinct says Gertrude. 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.700
PHIL: Gertrude?

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.320
PHIL: Well, it's
also a robot-- 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.140
DAN: That's the most inappropriate name
for a unicorn I have ever heard. 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.750
PHIL: What about Gertrude 3?
CHARLIE: Gertrude 3? That's good.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.640
PHIL: 'Cause it's a robot. 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.860
CHARLIE: Yeah. How do you
feel about that, Dan? 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.270
DAN: We don't speak about
the first two Gertrude.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.350
PHIL: Can you
now animate it? 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.790
CHARLIE: Neigh! 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.530
LAUGHTER

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.950
DAN: That's what it does before it charges
into battle and destroys worlds. 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.110
CHARLIE: Rawr!!

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.310
PHIL: Thanks for
having us, Charlie. 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.700
CHARLIE: You're welcome. Thanks for being in my collaboration video

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.830
for Collaboration Week, Dan and Phil. 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.090
PHIL: I had the best time.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.870
CHARLIE: I'm glad you did. I'm glad
you had fun. I had fun. Goodbye now.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.480
DAN: Bye, Internet. 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.320
CRASHING 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.120
DAN: Ow.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.590
CHARLIE: Okay. 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.800
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.620
which makes you, like, cool.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.230
CHARLIE VOICE: Thank you very much,
and if you'd like to watch 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.620
the other collaboration videos
from this week, 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.070
you probably don't need me
to tell you which boxes to click on. 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.780
I'm sure you can figure
it out for yourself.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.113
Goodbye!
