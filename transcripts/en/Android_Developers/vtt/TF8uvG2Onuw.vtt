ROMAN NURIK: Hello and
welcome again to

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.990
Android Design in Action.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.500
My name is Roman Nurik.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.560
ADAM KOCH: Hey, guys.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.172
Adam Koch.

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:09.590
NICK: Hi.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.970
Nick [? Coche. ?]

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.270
ROMAN NURIK: And today we have
way too much content.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.650
So we're just going
to get started.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.650
Today's episode is on the
device automation apps.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.630
The app that we'll be looking
at today is called Tasker.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.470
And then we'll also go into a
deep dive on touch feedback.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.160
And then we have a good
amount of design

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.920
use to cover as well.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.370
So let's just get started.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.720
So if we can look at
the slides, Jeff.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.435
I can't really see if
we're looking there.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.510
But I guess we are.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.170
OK.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.542
So this is, on the left
side, the Tasker app.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.980
Now Tasker is basically a
device automation app.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.820
In the app clinic, they kind
of use the term profile,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.440
device profile apps.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.240
This is kind of I guess
a subset of that.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.200
Basically it lets you create
a system of constraints or

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.880
contexts and create a set
of actions or tasks.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.730
I guess tasks are collections
of actions in this app that

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.710
get run when the device
enters that kind of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.130
profile, that context.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.080
So, for example, if the week day
is Monday through Friday

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.410
and the time of day is between
9:00 AM and 5:00 PM, you can

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.290
be thought as in the
work profile or in

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.190
the work set of contexts.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.130
And then so once you enter that
context, rather enter

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.930
that profile-- there's a lot
of terminology in this app.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.020
It's somewhat confusing.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.320
But it's very well
thought out.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.420
When you enter the context,
certain things can happen.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.930
When you leave that context
or profile,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.850
other things can happen.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.380
So there's an Enter
and Exit action.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.410
So that's at a very high level
what the app does.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.440
It lets you had to do a number
of different things from

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.320
setting system settings
automatically, to speaking out

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.310
text, to doing all sorts
of interesting things.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.160
And then of course, the number
of different profiles or

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.770
different constraints that they
have is also very large.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.030
So you can really, really
customize the set of

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.330
behaviors you want.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.665
So this is the app.

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:12.270
As you can see here, there's
kind of these three tabs--

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.660
profiles, tasks, and scenes.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.350
I'm not really going to talk
about scenes that much.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.740
Because I honestly didn't
really get a feel

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.290
for what they were.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.500
But profiles and tasks
are two of the most

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.580
important things here.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.630
So here we have a
single profile,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.990
which is my work profile.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.380
And on the left, you see the
different contexts that need

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.960
to be satisfied to be
in this profile.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.880
And then on the right hand side,
you see basically the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.740
actions that occur when
you enter or exit.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.950
In this case, there's only
an enter action.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.770
So when you exit this profile,
when you leave work basically,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.790
nothing will happen.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.990
There won't be an unmute
or anything.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.671
NICK: And it's set to unleash
a panda as soon

00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:57.420
as you get to work.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.630
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.860
I couldn't really find a
better icon for muting.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.970
Unfortunately, the built an
icons didn't really have a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.440
really obvious mute icon.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.560
So I just chose a panda.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.840
Because they're cute
and cuddly.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.320
NICK: OK.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.850
ROMAN NURIK: And basically
here there's

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.860
some standard stuff.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.370
There's these actions in the
bottom that let you add

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.960
things, add a profile in this
case, accept and cancel

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.370
changes, turn Tasker on
and off as a whole.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.120
And then to edit things on the
screen, there is a lot of long

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.040
pressing going on, which
if you look through our

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.680
guidelines on gestures you
should really reserve long

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.550
press for other things.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.010
But there's a lot of complex
interactions and a lot of

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.040
stuff going on on this screen.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.395
So that's why we chose to
think of a kind of a

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:46.030
re-imagining of what
it could look like.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.500
Before I jump into
the redesign,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.440
Nick, Adam, any thoughts?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.300
NICK: Yeah.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.390
This app's been on my radar
for quite some time.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.200
I think they won one of the
early Android developer

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.780
challenges.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.150
And I think the features you
described are super powerful.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.580
But I've always been put off.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.020
Whenever I get to the place,
to a listing, and you see

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.190
their screenshots, it's very
intimidating looking.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.790
Like I have no idea what all the
different controls refer

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.210
to and the plethora of options
it seems to offer up.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.780
So I was pretty excited that we
got to take a look at this

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.539
application and try and make
all that power perhaps a

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.546
little easier to tap into.

00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:21.410
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.700
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.750
We'll just move on.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.170
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.850
So let's look at the redesign.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.410
So this is the re-imagining
of the Tasker home screen.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.050
So on the right hand side--

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.020
I'm just going to zoom in
here so you can see.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.200
On the right hand side
here, we have Tasker.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.340
And obviously we've
refitted it with--

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.600
wow.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.780
Saying refitted sounds
like exhibits--

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.080
what's that kind of car
refitting show that he had?

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.830
NICK: "Pimp My Ride."

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.200
ROMAN NURIK: "Pimp My Ride." It
sounds like pimping rides

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.365
or anything.

00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:52.970
But whatever.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.970
So we've refitted it with--

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.470
NICK: Is like a plasma
screen TV is going to

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.970
[? fall down the side. ?]

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.015
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:04:57.015 --> 00:04:57.490
We've done a plasma screen TV.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.575
OK.

00:04:57.575 --> 00:04:58.890
We should really fly
through this.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.490
Because we have way
too much content.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.000
Anyway so we've fitted
it with the standard

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.580
action bar and tab bar.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.900
We've basically taken their core
tab bar that they've had

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.330
in the previous screen here.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.640
And we've made it look more
hollow obviously.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.290
We feel these tabs are
probably fine.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.870
Separating out the app into
these three core sections is

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.480
probably OK.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.360
It's really up to the app to
decide what their information

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.120
architecture is.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.540
But we left it as it.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.980
And we've moved the on, off
switch for the entire app to

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.300
the top right as a key action.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.810
In this case, some could argue
that you shouldn't have

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.890
actions in both the top right
and in the split action bar.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.560
But in this case, it's really
kind of like a global--

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.320
it's not really an action.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.480
It's really like a toggle, like
a high level toggle for

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.310
the entire app.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.010
So we felt that it was
appropriate there.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.640
And then in the content of the
screen, you see your profiles.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.300
But here you can't really
edit the profiles.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.010
And this is one of the things
that I found that was a little

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.450
confusing with the current app
is that viewing the list of

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.500
profiles and editing an
individual profile is all in

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.420
one screen.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.670
It'd almost be like seeing a
list of contacts and editing

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.050
each contact all in one.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.260
It's almost like
a spreadsheet.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And it just felt overbearing.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.080
So we decided to split this
screen up into two screens,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.750
where on one screen you see
the list of profiles.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.570
And you can obviously turn them
on or off, which is a

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.250
simple action that
you can take.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.160
But then to edit the profile,
you touch once to

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.220
get into the details.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.050
And we'll show you that.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.190
So here you see the
list of contexts.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.160
This is called my mute
at work profile.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.980
And there's the list of contexts
or constraints that

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.640
need to be fulfilled.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.140
And then when you
enter, it mutes.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.800
And when you leave,
it unmutes.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.460
And then here is an example of
a profile that's turned off.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.150
For example, send, I'm coming
home, as a text message.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.340
And we've decided to
turn that off.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.290
And there's no exit action.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.498
There's only a single
enter action there.

00:07:00.498 --> 00:07:04.230
And then you could add a profile
using the standard

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.580
action bar action there.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.740
And then there's another feature
inside of the menu,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.260
deep in there somewhere, which
was Search Tasker, which--

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.330
I don't exactly know
what it did.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.560
But it was just kind of like a
global search through the app.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.710
We decided to expose that as an
action in the bottom left.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.570
Before we move on,
any comments?

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.190
Should we fly through,
keep going?

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.420
OK.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.760
Let's keep going.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:33.040
So in the same exact screen that
you saw in the beginning,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.583
you see this kind of both
viewing a list of profiles and

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:37.760
editing the profile screen.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.820
This is the editing portion
that we broke up into a

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.990
separate screen, where here you
see the profile itself,

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.300
the enter and exit actions
that you can

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.280
select using a spinner.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.260
And then there's a little
shortcut here to edit each of

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.150
these tasks.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.510
And again, a task is a
collection of actions which

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.110
we'll see a bit.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.370
And then to add a context or add
a constraint, you simply

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.490
would press this in
line Add button.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.700
And of course, you could
put this in the

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.590
action bar if you want.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.125
But this is just an assortment
of different types of ways you

00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:10.440
can expose this.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.840
And then to remove something,
you just swipe to dismiss it.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.310
And there are probably other
actions you can take on each

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.620
individual context.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.960
For example, editing should
just be a one touch thing.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.610
But if you want to duplicate it
or clone it or something,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.640
maybe that can be exposed
through an overflow

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.380
affordance.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.659
And obviously if you want to
delete multiple things, you

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.599
should allow for multiple
selection using contextual

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.419
action bar.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:40.530
OK.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.539
The next screen--

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.920
this is an example of
selecting a task.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.930
So when you exit this mute at
work profile, here are the

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.750
list of things you could do.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.430
You can say oh, there's
no exit task.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.590
Or you can browse all tasks and
manage tasks where you can

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.790
select one of the existing
ones that you have there.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.350
Pretty straightforward,
nothing fancy there.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.480
On the next screen, this is
basically where you are

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.530
editing a task.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:11.700
And you can see here, there are
a lot of objects that you

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.080
deal with in this app.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.840
And so one of the core points
overall with this redesign is

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.630
to simplify things, to make it
very obvious what you're

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.670
working with.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.640
And so here you're working
with a list of

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.130
actions for a task.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.360
And previously you were
working with a list of

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.550
contexts for a profile.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.120
So you want to make it very,
very clear throughout every

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.970
step in the process what the
types of data you are working

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.830
with is and where in the
structure it is.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.350
So here is another example of
how you can kind of use swipe

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:47.200
to dismiss and a simple Add
Action here at the top to

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.500
replace a bunch of buttons
that are on screen for

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.470
deleting and adding and
things like that.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.070
And actually here you'll notice
that there's no real

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.340
way to delete something.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.345
You have to long press
to delete.

00:10:01.345 --> 00:10:04.070
It seems kind of like extra
work to have to do that.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.560
I think there's probably
one or two more.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.610
This is the place where you
can kind of rename a task.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.460
So if you jump into the task
details, you should be able to

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.420
edit everything.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.250
And one of the ways you could
do that is to have an inline

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.840
text field with the name.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.170
So you just start changing the
name right there and then.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.490
Or if you don't think that
that's going to be a very

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.190
common thing, you could move it
into the action overflow as

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.285
kind of a rename additional
action bar.

00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:34.760
And I think the last screenshot
I want to show here

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.870
is adding an action.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.630
This is one of the more
important parts.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.790
So actually this is adding
an action, not a context.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:48.760
So when you add an action, like
when I am at work for

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.790
example mute the phone or speak
some text or whatever,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.140
airplane mode or whatever.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.250
To do that in the current app if
you have to kind of go into

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.890
a browse mode where you see this
overwhelmingly large set

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.000
of things you can do.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.460
And it's kind of hard to really
find the thing you're

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.360
looking for.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.780
And I think in this case,
you're generally more in

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.400
search mode rather
than browse mode.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.560
So I think that it would be a
better case here to basically

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.640
have an auto complete.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.540
So if I'm in the list of actions
to take, I just start

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.980
typing volume or mute
or something.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.790
And it gives me a pre-populated
auto completed

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.430
list of things that I can do.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.800
And as soon as I touch,
it just adds it.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.712
And if there's configuration
stuff, then it just shows the

00:11:31.712 --> 00:11:34.260
configuration stuff.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.240
So I think that was it.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.710
I know that was super fast.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.160
We went through that
in 12 minutes.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.730
Anything else you guys want to
say before we move on from the

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.930
screen redesigns?

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.280
NICK: I really like the way it
feels a lot cleaner now.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.940
I think generally dialogues
just aren't the answer.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.660
The previous app popped up a lot
of dialogues, which kept a

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.980
lot of contexts and a lot of
load of the user to kind of

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:56.856
remember where they are.

00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:59.470
And I feel like the new setup
with the before and after-- it

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.830
just feels a lot easier
to use for me.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.120
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.300
And this app in general is
just really complicated.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.500
It does a lot of things.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.600
And so I think breaking the
different functions into

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.970
different screens really, really
helps the user navigate

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.620
through these different
sections.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:14.880
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.030
And really in this case
it's simplifying.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.120
And actually there's a lot of
cases in the past where we've

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.500
combined the multiple
screens into one.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.390
And I think that this app can do
well by splitting things up

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.190
more since it's so complex.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.695
Before we jump to the touch
feedback session, I just want

00:12:29.695 --> 00:12:33.130
to briefly talk about some
iconography, well actually I

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.190
guess branding.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.000
And actually it's really
just branding,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.630
this umbrella of branding.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.510
This is the current
icon on the left.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.130
And here's kind of what it could
look like matching the

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.230
redesigned theme.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.650
So the redesigned theme is
kind of a blue and orange

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.390
color scheme.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.920
And so here's what it
could look like

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.990
with that color scheme.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.160
And this better fits some of the
other app icons that are

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.570
out there just purely in terms
of styling, not so much in

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.660
iconography which is kind of the
most important thing to be

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.820
memorable is, what
is in the icon?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.880
But to make it feel a little
more modern and up to par with

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.120
some of the other apps
that are out there.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.800
And then the last thing I want
to mention is the lack of a

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.370
feature graphic.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.340
You cannot be featured,
absolutely cannot be featured.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.760
The editorial team for Google
Play will do nothing with your

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.280
app in terms of promotion
unless you

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.570
have a feature graphic.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.010
So make sure that you add one.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.950
And this is just one example
of what a feature graphic

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.520
could look like for Tasker.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.980
It could be as simple as just
having your name and the icon

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.720
there, maybe a tag line
or something.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.410
But make sure that it's also
legible and clearly delivers

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.380
the message at small sizes.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.850
Because this feature graphic can
appear in very, very small

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:48.060
sizes on phones and
other devices.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:48.480
NICK: Yeah.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.510
Just to expand on that
just a little bit.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.780
Yeah.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.150
Like Roman says, this one,
same, large asset--

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.650
it's like 1024 pixels wide
when you supply it.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.720
And so people get tempted
to cram all kinds of

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.910
information in there.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.060
But really, really
resist that.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.052
Because it can be shown
very, very small.

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:07.120
If you think about a small
handset, kind of three inches

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.460
diagonally handset, it's going
to be shrunken down greatly.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.140
So my advice to people
is always to get

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:13.800
your feature graphic.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.980
And resize it down to about
100 pixels wide.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.660
And check that everything's
kind of legible and still

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.540
looks good at that
kind of size.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.435
And the other tip is that if
you are lucky enough to get

00:14:22.435 --> 00:14:26.210
featured, the graphic can be
shown in the Play store on the

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.080
front page without
much context.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.660
So I always find it's helpful
to have your feature graphic

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.340
convey some of the meaning
of what the

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.500
application actually does.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.640
Because they're going to see
it on its own without the

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.770
benefit of the title and the
description text and the

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:40.250
screenshots.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.465
So really have it kind
of stand alone.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:42.920
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.950
And it could appear without
the icon and

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.880
appear without the title.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.580
So absolutely.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.790
That it can appear standalone
is a very, very important

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.300
point for future graphics.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.110
NICK: And resist putting
screenshots in there.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.140
Because they don't
size very well.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.080
And also [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:56.860
[? put a device ?]
frame in it.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.340
It just has the ability to
look dated very quickly.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.306
So try and resist that.

00:15:01.306 --> 00:15:02.282
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:15:02.282 --> 00:15:02.770
All right.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.765
Shall we move on to
touch feedback?

00:15:04.765 --> 00:15:05.230
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.810
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.080
Adam, you want to drive?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.700
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, sure.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.550
So we wanted to discuss
a little

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.220
bit about touch feedback.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.180
We actually look at
a lot of different

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.280
applications in our role.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.600
And surprisingly, one of the
things we see broken in a lot

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.080
of them is touch feedback,
which is strange.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.880
Because it really does give
the user a sense of

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.860
responsiveness and indicate
that something's happening

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.220
within the application.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.200
And the amount of effort
required to actually add good

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.520
touch feedback in your
application is

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.480
actually not that much.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.840
So it's definitely something
with lower amounts of effort

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.950
that has great pay off.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.040
And of course the canonical
source for information on

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.380
touch feedback is
the design site.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.430
So if you just go on to style,
there's a section

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.680
called touch feedback.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.610
We'll cover this on
the next page.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.510
There's a bunch of states here
and some more information on

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.900
some recommendations of how you
should actually style the

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.270
different states for
touch feedback.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.700
But we have some tips I think
on the next screen.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:03.960
Yeah.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.350
So the first thing to remember
is all interactive elements

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.110
should provide feedback.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.350
Not some of them-- every single
one should provide some

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.540
sort of feedback.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.180
ROMAN NURIK: They say if it does
something, it should look

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.510
like it does something
when you press it.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.000
ADAM KOCH: Exactly.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.610
And another point to make is
you should be consistent.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.170
So we often see people
customizing touch feedback for

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.170
parts of the application.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.380
But then they don't go and
customize, say, the action bar

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.560
touch feedback.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.780
So you have sort of the holo
blue in the action bar.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.640
But you have a completely
different color scheme for the

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.890
rest of your application.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.630
ROMAN NURIK: And one that one
thing that can help with that

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:45.280
is the Android holo colors
website, which basically

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.420
generates all that for
developers, as well as the

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.360
action bar style generator,
which again does all that for

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.880
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.070
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.330
Combining that will really
help you get sort of 99%

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:56.500
through your application,
being consistent there.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.820
We'll touch on this
again in a second.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.380
But you should really ensure
that the full touchable target

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.715
area has feedback, so not
just the portion of it.

00:17:02.715 --> 00:17:05.050
If it's touchable elsewhere, it
should really have feedback

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.700
across the entire item.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.650
As we mentioned, customized ad
feedback for custom components

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.540
and whatnot.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.800
And also, don't forget about
the multi select mode and

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.410
contextual action bar.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.160
Those are really important
modes.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.210
And you should really make
sure that there's touch

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.270
indicators when you're in
the multi select mode.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.945
So we've got some examples.

00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:25.819
And we can discuss some
of these points on

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:27.160
the next slide here.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.440
ROMAN NURIK: It'll load.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:31.870
And there it is.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:32.430
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.410
So this is just some of the
system apps to start with.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.040
We've got Google+ on the left,
YouTube in the middle, and the

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.100
system gallery on the right.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.490
So one area I see a lot of
people leaving out touch

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.080
feedback is when they're fully
customizing a list view.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.860
So you've got this long
scrolling list of items.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.280
And they've really
customized it.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.676
So in the case of Google+,
they've got these

00:17:52.676 --> 00:17:54.350
sort of nice cards.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.760
YouTube-- it's almost like
a card-like interface.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.950
But it's sort of rich items
showing the YouTube thumbnail.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.870
And very frequently, we'll see
people forget to add the

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.850
different states to these
kinds of list views.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.230
So there's two, sort of,
different types here that

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.950
these apps have taken.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.200
In the Google+ app, for example,
they've sort of

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.160
covered the entire item in a
sort of blue highlight, a holo

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.480
blue highlight.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.665
I quite like that.

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:20.010
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.230
That's kind of like
an overlay.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.460
And in development terms, it's
basically the draw selector on

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.900
top attribute on list views
and grid views.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.540
ADAM KOCH: Correct.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.730
And in the YouTube app, they've
gone and sort of shown

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.790
the overlay, a sort of
[INAUDIBLE] overlay.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.870
They've gone and showed
it underneath the

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:35.750
main thumbnail there.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.110
So it's another approach
you can take.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.600
It's really up to you
which one to choose.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.340
Personally, I like the Google+
method a little bit more.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.900
But when you've got rich
graphics in your list view, it

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.980
really comes down to how you
want to display it here.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.080
And then the third screen
shot shows the gallery.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.950
And it's got the contextual
action bar activated.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.460
And you can see, again, it's got
the touch feedback there.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.620
So that when you select each of
these, it shows a nice sort

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.180
of blue holo overlay.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.910
ROMAN NURIK: And actually you
get a lot of this for free

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.590
using on Android 4.0, well, on
ICS and above, you get this

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.380
for free with, I think,
the selectable

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.240
item background attribute.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.420
So if you use that throughout,
you don't even have to custom

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.300
create all these assets,
these blue assets.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.060
It just comes with the system,
with the framework.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.130
So it's really, really useful
to just use that, to

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.400
just drop it in.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.970
Android, colon, background
equals this.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.380
Or Android, colon, foreground
equals the selectable item

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.240
background thing.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.785
And you get a lot
of it for free.

00:19:35.785 --> 00:19:36.150
ADAM KOCH: Correct.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.860
NICK: It's also included in the
support library, right?

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.450
ROMAN NURIK: Is it?

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.930
That's awesome.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.710
That's great.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:43.220
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.080
I guess it's with [INAUDIBLE]
as well.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.400
Like a standard list view-- if
you use the standard list

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.060
items, it will have touch
feedback for you.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.710
But it's only when you really
customize these

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.730
things that it may not.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.390
Because you're building the
layouts from scratch.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.340
NICK: Yeah.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.450
So I think the key thing is here
is if you're customizing

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.875
you're providing your own button
drawables and stuff

00:19:59.875 --> 00:20:01.220
like that, make sure
you include all the

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.970
custom states as well.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:03.240
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.400
And it's a selector drawable
or a stateless drawable.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:05.890
ADAM KOCH: It is.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.650
ROMAN NURIK: So here you have
XML along with your PNG's that

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.490
indicate which PNG file, which
nine patch, or whatever should

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.840
be used with each state.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.980
NICK: And while you're in there
creating your kind of

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.160
press states, remember
to also include the

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.700
focus states as well.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.400
Because devices with trap falls
and Google TV's and so

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.370
on will really, really benefit
from those states.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.010
So while you're at it,
do the right thing.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.360
ADAM KOCH: Yes, correct.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.730
And as I mentioned, on the
design side it has some

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.610
examples of how you should
color and style those

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.860
particular different states.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.236
NICK: Well just use
[? Andrew Holoco's ?].

00:20:42.236 --> 00:20:43.630
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.940
So here's an example of a
third party app, the Ted

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.530
application, which we
like to use as an

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.890
example here on the show.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.340
There's three different
screens here now.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.430
It's kind of hard to see
in the first screen.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.330
But there's a grey highlight
actually on the top left part

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.000
of the action bar as well
as on the tabs.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.910
I kind of double tapped here
just so we could fit it into

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:04.540
one screenshot.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.110
ROMAN NURIK: You just contorted
your hand in there.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.500
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.350
It was kind of hard to take a
screenshot at the same time.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.740
But they've got a sort of light
grey highlight here when

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.660
the user touches down.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.680
And then if you look at these
other screenshots next to it,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.660
you'll see for other items,
including the action items in

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.570
the action bar--

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:22.920
yeah.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.310
ROMAN NURIK: So we should
move it into view.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.790
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, sure.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.980
Let's move it here.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:27.870
They've got a red highlight.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.480
So they've got two different
highlights.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.440
And they kind of use them for
different items across the

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.680
application.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.310
So places, I guess, where they
are already using the sort of

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.980
trademark Ted red
color, they'll

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.030
use the grey highlight.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.190
And other places, they'll
use the red highlight.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:47.030
So for example, in this button
here, which says, listen to

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:50.300
this talk, they've got the
red highlight again.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.960
And this comes back to that
point we were talking about

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.130
where you should really
highlight the

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.550
entire touchable area.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.550
So you'll see here that the
whole red highlight is

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.430
covering the entire line.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.110
Because you can touch anywhere
across that entire line.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.430
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.500
So the first time you touch
it, you'll probably touch

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.290
around the icon or the text.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:09.220
But then when you see that the
rest of that row responds in

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:14.720
red, your brain will internalize
the fact that this

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.530
whole thing is a single object
that you can interact with.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.490
So it really helps make
that association.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:21.190
ADAM KOCH: Yep.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.700
And I think we should move on.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.040
Because we're low on time.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.140
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.950
ADAM KOCH: And then finally
two other types of touch

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.720
feedback worth mentioning--
there's boundaries and

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.950
communication.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.380
So if you look here at the left
screenshot, it's kind of

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.450
hard to see.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.165
If you get the slides after the
show, you'll be able to

00:22:39.165 --> 00:22:40.620
see it a bit easier.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.380
But this is showing the edge
resistance, when you swipe

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.890
down and there's nothing more
above the current list.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.930
So you've got this sort of blue
glow showing here at the

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.715
top left in Google Play.

00:22:52.715 --> 00:22:54.700
NICK: It's like a force field
you just run up against.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.190
It starts glowing.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.040
ROMAN NURIK: It's dissipating
energy as its kinetic energy

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.980
is turning into light
basically.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.930
For developers out there,
this is the edge effect.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:06.060
And edge effect compat classes
that let you do

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.910
this on custom views.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.070
ADAM KOCH: And of course, using
standard views, you get

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.280
all of this for free.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.600
It is worth remembering how it
looks and how it behaves.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.060
Because you don't want to have,
say, blue colors at the

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.840
top there that might be
clashing with it.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.605
NICK: But it's quite interesting
that if you use an

00:23:22.605 --> 00:23:24.390
app when you can see that
they've implemented their own

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.900
kind of horizontal paging
[? we're often ?] using, so

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:27.790
another view page component.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.060
And it doesn't give you
that feedback when

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:30.760
you've reached the edge.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.613
It just kind of feels
off, right?

00:23:32.613 --> 00:23:33.560
ADAM KOCH: Mmm hm.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:33.870
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.060
ADAM KOCH: Definitely.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.270
ROMAN NURIK: For sure.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.020
ADAM KOCH: And then in the
second screenshot, it's the

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.150
Gallery application.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.220
And when you swipe to the edge
here, it kind of has a 3D

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.260
effect where all of the
different thumbnails kind of

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.940
tilt to the side, again
showing resistance.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.980
So this is more of a custom
implementation, I guess.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.470
So you can definitely implement
something custom.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.490
It's really up to you.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.990
Personally, I like the
blue glow, as we've

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.840
been talking about.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.005
But depending on the feel of
your application, the gallery

00:23:59.005 --> 00:24:02.230
is very much of a 3D sort of
feel of an application.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.540
So that's what's it's sort
of appropriate here.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.860
And Launcher has something
kind of similar as well.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.690
But the whole thing tilts.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.760
And then finally,
I just wanted to

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.420
quickly mention this.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.680
And this is fairly advanced.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.630
I can't imagine that many app
developers doing this.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.530
But there's this concept
of communication,

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.060
so for touch gestures.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:26.280
So in this example, Gmail--
you've got the sort of swipe

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.060
to delete or swipe to archive.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.770
As you swipe, you'll notice the
actual item starts to fade

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.600
out slowly as you move
across more.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.870
And if you slide back again
without actually completing

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.560
the swipe, it'll fade
back in again.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.310
So this is just sort of hinting
to the user that this

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.840
item's going to go away as you
swipe it off the screen.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.250
So, again, this is
pretty custom and

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.300
probably more advanced.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.230
But definitely something to
think about if you have these

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.510
advanced gestures.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.840
All right.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.825
We'd better keep moving.

00:24:54.825 --> 00:24:56.130
We've got five minutes left.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:56.560
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.130
So let's fly through Android
design news.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:24:59.370
ADAM KOCH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.530
ROMAN NURIK: We have like
six or seven items.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:05.660
But let's start with the
redesigns of the Outlook.com

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.160
map by Taylor Ling and Sam
Nolte from holo there.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.250
Really awesome work.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.310
Sam even basically did
a multi pane UI.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.060
He did a whole bunch of
different screens.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.400
And Taylor also kind of had
his own take on this app.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.890
And you'll notice that actually
there are some

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:21.610
similarities.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:26.950
There are some very obvious ways
to map an older app to

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.380
the newer holo style.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.260
And this is just one example of
minor variations of that.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.610
And I think that they're both
really good jobs there.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.350
Let's fly through to
actually Uhani, in

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.330
response to their redesigns.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.480
He also did a post on the
[? alog.com ?] map.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.030
And basically he gave some
anecdotal feedback, actually

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.410
some real feedback, I guess,
with some real data on how

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.670
when you release an app that
is using older, kind of

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.950
gingerbread, even eclair,
donut styling, for newer

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.020
devices, meaning now if you
released that sort of app now,

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.490
users are going to respond very
negatively towards that.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.660
So be careful while doing
that if you're

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.110
thinking about doing that.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.470
NICK: Just don't do that.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.900
ROMAN NURIK: Just don't.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.870
ADAM KOCH: It's a easier
way, yeah.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:16.680
ROMAN NURIK: And then one of
the folks that submitted an

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.870
entry for the stencil giveaway
a few weeks ago, Gen Gal--

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.725
he did a couple UI mock-ups
for the Dribble app or for

00:26:26.725 --> 00:26:29.290
what Dribble could look
like on Android.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.920
It's pretty cool.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.140
Nick, you want to add
anything about this?

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.570
NICK: Just that I want this.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.890
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.920
I saw your comment, just want,
exclamation point.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.140
Yeah.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.416
I feel the same way.

00:26:40.416 --> 00:26:42.130
NICK: Says it all, right?

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.240
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.620
Next up we just released
yesterday the new version of

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.160
the Maps API for Android.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.540
This is V2 of the API.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.050
It requires Google
Play services.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.060
And that's all you
need really.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.570
There's no separate bundle
or anything.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.730
It's really just part of
Google Play services.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:03.410
And this is basically if you
want to get vector tiles and

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:09.760
3D building facades and all of
this cool new 3D maps stuff in

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.830
your app, you should definitely
switch over to this

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.670
from the original map view.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:18.020
And this also works with
fragments and support library

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:18.640
fragments as well.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.260
So you get a lot of
the benefits.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.900
Basically everybody's
asking for this.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.320
And finally we're able to--

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.260
ADAM KOCH: The big
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.185
NICK: So for designers, I guess
the key takeaway is you

00:27:27.185 --> 00:27:29.520
can now have maps kind of
throughout the application.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.330
Developers have complained
and said, oh, that's

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:31.940
really hard to do.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.260
That's no longer the case, as
well as having some pretty

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.330
advanced features as well, so
having custom overlays and

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.160
different shapes and boundary
boxes and so on and so forth.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.050
This really, really allows lots
of really, really cool

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.366
interactions with maps.

00:27:44.366 --> 00:27:44.740
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.240
I'm really excited about the
different angles and panning

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.170
and tilting that you can do.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.160
I think that's going to work
really nicely with some of the

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.900
apps that are out there.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.720
ROMAN NURIK: And remember,
you can design

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.520
custom marker icons.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.550
So the marker icons don't have
to look like the teardrop

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.310
shape or a little
circle shape.

00:28:03.225 --> 00:28:05.050
It could use your branding
if you want.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.935
It could be custom
shape or whatnot.

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:10.800
So lots of options there.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.040
And there's this new website,
Androidviews.net, which

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.680
basically has a list, a
collection, of different

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:23.030
custom views and different
UI widgets and things.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.740
And this is kind of similar to
the ultimate Android library,

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.910
which is more broadly scoped.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:31.240
It covers libraries that are
for image caching and all

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.440
sorts of stuff.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.410
But this is very specific
to UI widgets.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.670
And it's a very nice
presentation of the different

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.510
UI elements you can
use in your app.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.220
NICK: It's very pretty.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.978
But I'm not sure about
that icon.

00:28:40.978 --> 00:28:42.660
It's like a steaming Android.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.880
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.830
That's exactly what it looks
like, a steaming Android.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:46.425
He's very angry.

00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:47.832
He's very angry.

00:28:47.832 --> 00:28:49.070
NICK: OK.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.810
Next.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:51.470
ROMAN NURIK: And, Nick,
you want to talk

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.280
about Marie's post?

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.590
NICK: Yeah.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:58.030
So basically Marie is a regular
viewer and active

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.560
designer in the community is
trying to get the community of

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.470
Android designers to kind of
coalescence and speak to each

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.280
other a bit more.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.770
I certainly resonate with
this kind of idea.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.070
I think when we were doing the
design competition, there was

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.350
a ton of activity going on on
Google+ especially where

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.080
people posting on
the hash Android

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.680
design and the hashtag.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.760
And that was really cool.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.030
I'd really like to see
that continue.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.230
So Marie is trying to get
everyone together.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:24.720
So if you find this QR code
and comment on her thread,

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.290
she's trying to put together a
circle of developer designer

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:29.220
working with Android.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.030
So comment on the post.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.050
And we'll try and share that
around, so everyone can kind

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.440
of connect to each other
and start talking

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.900
about Android design.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.250
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.340
So we're at 11 o'clock.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.860
Let's fly through the last
couple of things.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.210
I recently did a blog post
on designing for tablets.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.900
So if you're designing for
tablets, which means hopefully

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.080
everybody that's watching,
check out this blog post.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.200
It will link you to things that
you may not have seen

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.170
before, definitely kind of a
good resource for designing

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.810
for tablets and even developing
for tablets.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:30:01.230
And lastly, we recently put
out a developer survey.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.610
So if you're an Android
developer and you haven't

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.420
filled out the survey and you
are thinking, I really wish

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.550
