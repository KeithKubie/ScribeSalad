00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.569
Well, you guys seemd to enjoy our recent superhero
facts video, so here we are with a second

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.389
installment in quick succession!

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.960
These days, the popularity of superheroes
is such that a lot of people think they know

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.920
everything there is to know about their favourite
bad guy-battling champions - but they couldn't

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.010
be more wrong.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.679
The history of comic books is so long and
rich that there are bound to be facts that

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.449
have passed them by, slipped their mind, or
some that they have misconceived, so this

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.070
video aims to educate the masses regarding
some of those facts.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.439
We hope you enjoy it!

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:46.390
Here are ten superhero facts that never crossed
your mind: Part 2.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.320
Star-Lord Has Amassed More Than 350,000 Murders
Most casual comic book movie fans hadn't even

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.740
heard of Peter Quill AKA Star-Lord before
2014's Guardians of the Galaxy movie was released.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.680
He was a C-list superhero from an obscure
comic book title.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.989
Now, thanks to Chris Pratt's epic portrayal
of him in said movie in the Marvel Cinematic

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.570
Universe, he's hugely popular and a hero to
millions.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.670
Granted, he's a mischievous outlaw in the
movies, but he's generally a nice guy whose

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.820
goodness totally shone through in the end.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.829
However, in the comic books, he's actually
a mass murderer.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.190
In fact, Star-Lord is known to have amassed
more than 350,000 murders in the comics - that

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.319
is according to the Nova Corps' records - which
makes him one of the most prolific killers

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.929
in all of Marvel!

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.299
Daredevil Influenced The Creation Of The Ninja
Turtles

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.979
Daredevil is currently one of Marvel's most
popular heroes, thanks to his fantastic Netflix

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.770
series, in which Charlie Cox brilliantly portrays
the Hell's Kitchen vigilante.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.829
That series has to be one of the high points
of the character's history - but it pales

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.229
into insignificance when you realise that
Daredevil was the main inspiration behind

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.999
the creation of none other than the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles!

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.560
When Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird created
the reptilian quartet, they took inspiration

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.399
the style of Frank Miller's iconic Daredevil
run.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.340
They also made the Turtles' origin story mirror
that of the Man Without Fear's, which depicted

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.359
a young boy saving an old man and being blinded
by radioactive chemicals.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.690
Their sensei Splinter was named after Daredevil's
mentor Stick, and the Turtles' main foes - The

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.720
Foot Clan - were inspired by Daredevil enemies
The Hand.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.470
A team-up between the two entities would be
awesome, therefore but, sadly, inter-company

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.730
politics have made that impossible up to now.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.260
Supergirl's First Boyfriend Was Her Pet Horse
We mentioned in our previous superhero facts

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.390
video that Aquaman's first love was a dolphin,
but we think we can beat that with this weird

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.330
fact - Supergirl's first boyfriend was her
pet horse!

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.320
The 1960s seemed to take a She-Ra-esque camp
approach to Supergirl's storytelling - and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.310
that was never more evident than when her
superpowered horse, Comet, appeared.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.480
Comet ended up receiving a human form - "Bronco"
Bill Starr - and Supergirl actually embarked

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.360
on a romantic relationship with him.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.400
The weird thing was that he was only able
to assume this form when a certain comet passed

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.270
the Earth - meaning that, for the majority
of the time, he was indeed still a horse.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.320
Thankfully, as the 60s came to a close, this
kind of sugar-coated weirdness petered out

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.290
with it.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.100
The Silver Surfer Has Citizenship In 190+
Countries

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.150
The Silver Surfer is an extraterrestrial superhero
hailing from the planet Zenn-La.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.800
Although Earth is very familiar to him - and
indeed the people of Earth in the Marvel universe

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.220
are very familiar with him - he certainly
isn't a native of the planet.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.910
It should come as a surprise to you, therefore,
to learn that he actually has citizenship

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.470
in more than 190 of Earth's countries.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.450
The Surfer did, of course, earn his citizenships
by saving the planet on more than one occasion.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.050
The one time he saved the Earth from having
all of its culture removed and replaced by

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.980
his native race is the one that stood out
to several UN representatives.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.900
They decided to give him citizenship to their
countries - which included China, France and

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.900
Russia to name a few.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.540
He was subsequently given citizenship to the
rest of the planet's countries - which is

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.360
more than any actual Earthling can say.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.590
Green Lantern's Powers Were Inspired By Aladdin
When you think of all the characters that

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.120
came before him in fiction - Superman, Buck
Rogers, Captain Nemo and many others - one

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.200
of the last you would ever think of as having
influenced the creation of Green Lantern is

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.200
Aladdin.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.390
However, it was indeed the main character
of the Middle Eastern folk tale - on of the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.620
"Arabian Nights" stories - that inspired the
creation of Alan Scott, DC's first Green Lantern.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.790
When you think about it, it's not actually
that strange either.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.130
Aladdin got anything he wanted from the genie
of the lamp - very much like the constructs

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.049
Green Lantern Corps members can will into
existence.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.440
Moreover, Scott was very nearly named "Alan
Ladd" as a homage to Aladdin.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.780
However, it was decided that "Ladd" would
be his middle name - which was probably for

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:37.250
the best, in retrospect!

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.900
Hawkeye Was Originally A Villain
Hawkeye is, in every sense of the word, a

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.900
hero.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.840
Although he wasn't a founding member of the
Avengers, he was the second character - after

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.340
Captain America - to join the original team,
and he has been a mainstay in the lineup for

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.160
most of the subsequent 60+ years since then.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.960
He's brave, incredibly skilled, and fights
against superpowered foes in spite of the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.820
fact that he has no superhuman abilities of
his own.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.570
However, when he first appeared on-panel in
a 1964 issue of Tales of Suspense, Clint Barton

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.840
was presented as an enemy of Iron Man's.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.560
Although he was more confused than malicious,
he was still a villain, and it took him around

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.010
nine months to pledge his alliance to the
side of good.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.231
So, next time you watch 2012's The Avengers
and see Hawkeye as a mind-controlled bad guy

00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:20.810
for the bulk of it, don't forget that that's
exactly how the character was originally intended

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.810
to be.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.820
Doctor Strange Was Based On A Character From
A Radio Show

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.220
The Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange, was,
of course, created by the iconic pairing of

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.360
artist and writer Steve Ditko and Marvel legend
Stan Lee.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.260
Lee has actually admitted that Strange was
initially Ditko's idea, but says that he had

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.420
a lot of creative input and responsibility
with regards to the character's overall conception.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.210
It has since been revealed by Lee that their
character was heavily based on a little known

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.090
character called Chandu the Magician - the
star of a humble radio program that aired

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.610
on the Mutual Broadcasting System in the 1930s.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.060
The program also went on to become a film
in 1932 - just like Doctor Strange did in

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.310
2016 - and was about a man who was both a
magician and a secret agent.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.730
You Can Study Batman At College
There was a time when the entire concept of

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.340
superheroes was largely seen as a guilty pleasure
by those who enjoyed it.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.560
People who liked superheroes and the comic
books they appeared in were often mocked.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.300
Comics weren't taken seriously as a medium
and superheroes as a genre were seen as silly.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.510
But it's not like that these days - in fact,
you can actually study Batman at college!

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.230
No, really, there's a genuine college course
called "The Science of Batman" at the University

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.550
of Victoria in Canada.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.290
When you think about it, there are actually
many aspects of the Dark Knight that could

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.430
be studied - mainly of the psychological variety
- but this course actually focuses on the

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.080
physical side of the character.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.590
The course description reads "The extreme
range of adaptability of the human body explored

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:46.150
through the life of the Caped Crusader."

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.740
Deadpool's Healing Factor Is His Only Superhuman
Ability

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.110
Deadpool is so enormously popular these days
- thanks in no small part to Ryan Reynolds'

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.820
brilliant portrayal of the character in his
2016 titular movie - that his fans are often

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.580
in denial about the level he's at on the power
ladder.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.010
Claims that he could beat the likes of Superman
and the Hulk in a straight-up fight are often

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.669
made - but they're ridiculous.

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:06.669
Why?

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.270
Because Deadpool's only power is his superhuman
regenerative healing factor.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.020
Deadpool isn't super-strong, he's not super-fast,
he can still feel pain like the rest of us

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.180
and, aside from occasionally having a teleporter
in his possession, his weapons and gardgets

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.620
are largely underwhelming.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.020
He's basically a peak human who recovers from
injury insanely quick.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.020
That's it.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.020
So, still think he has a chance against a
lightspeed Kryptonian who can bench press

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.020
planets, fly, fire heat rays as hot as the
sun, AND heal faster than the average human

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.020
like Deadpool himself can?

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.020
Think again.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.020
Oh and that horrible character in 2009's X-Men
Origins: Wolverine - that just wasn't Deadpool.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.750
Captain America Live In An Alternate Dimension
For More Than A Decade

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.990
Captain America has been a staple part of
the 616 Marvel universe's Earth since he first

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.070
appeared on-panel in 1941.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.190
It's hard to imagine that timeline without
him in it, but the truth is he has actually

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.320
spent a whopping twelve years away from it
- by virtue of the fact that that's how long

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.870
he was trapped in another dimension on one
occasion.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.700
Arnim Zola abducted him and trapped him in
the post-apocalyptic hellscape dimension known

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.700
as Dimension Z.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.580
Cap was stuck there for ten issues which,
as previously mentioned, spanned twelve years.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.550
However, to his allies back in his world,
it had only been a few minutes - and they

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.990
barely realised he'd gone missing.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.750
That's got to be tough to take!

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.449
In that time, Cap had been through all manner
of experiences - including raising a young

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:13.240
boy - until he was brought home by writer
Rick Remender in 2013's Captain America #10.
