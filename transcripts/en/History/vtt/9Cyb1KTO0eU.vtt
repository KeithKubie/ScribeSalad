00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.869
BOBBY: This is a '67 XKE.

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.104
Oh.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.239
I haven't seen that
car with the cover off--

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:07.941
I can't even tell you how long.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.142
That was my dad's baby.

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:09.843
There you go.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.112
Yeah.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.314
So did he find this locally?

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.483
BOBBY: I have no idea
where this came from.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:20.086
MIKE: [whistles] The Godfather
of European auto design, Enzo

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:23.957
Ferrari, proclaimed
the Jaguar XKE the most

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.059
beautiful car he had ever seen.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.562
They were a huge influence
in the sports car world--

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.698
design, performance.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.534
I mean, when you see one
coming down the road,

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.735
you stand at attention.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:37.670
There's a guy I
know in Tennessee--

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.738
he does Jags.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.240
He works on them, he
buys and sells them.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.476
I'd love to send him some
pictures of this, just so you

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.945
can have a jumping off point
and so can we in regards

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.514
to the value of it, you know?

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:51.451
I know enough about Jaguars to
know that it's a numbers game.

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.454
And what I mean by that is
it's a serial numbers game.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:55.855
There it is.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.892
I'm going to call my buddy Mike
Mefford in Columbia, Tennessee.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.960
He knows these cars
inside and out.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.496
And I'm going to find out
where those numbers are.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.731
Mike.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.032
MIKE MEFFORD (ON PHONE):
Hey, what's going on, Mike?

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:11.337
I'm looking at a 1967
XKE convertible Jaguar.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.217
I know that the serial
numbers make a big difference.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.752
So where can I see
those at on it?

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.694
Yeah.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:36.062
Well, it's going to
be a really hard part

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.364
to get into on this side,
because the car is cranked

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.633
up against a bunch of stuff.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.836
Why don't I just send you
some general photographs

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.405
of the car so you can
get an idea of just

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.173
the overall broad stroke of it?

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.875
BOBBY: I remember
playing in that Jaguar

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.511
when I was a little kid, hopping
up and down in the front seat,

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.947
pretending I was
driving and shifting,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.883
while my dad was working on the
bikes right next to that car.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.351
This was my dad's baby.

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:00.453
And he used to make
jokes with his friends

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:01.754
and say I was waiting
for him to die

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.290
to get the car,
which was totally

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.992
farthest from the truth.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:07.327
Yeah.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.762
And then right before
he died, he pulled

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.097
it out and had it running.

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.199
I was walking around
the passenger side,

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.767
and he said to me,
what are you doing?

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.102
Where are you going?

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.604
And I remember,
my heart stopped.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.072
And I was like, what?

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.040
And he's like, you're driving.
Get in.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.311
And it's just like he wanted
me to drive the car with him

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.579
still alive.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.848
So I guess that was a big
moment for the two of us.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:30.416
I finally got to drive it.
- Sure.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:33.052
The connection
between father and son

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.588
can happen a lot
of different ways.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:39.292
Bobby and his father
had a moment in this car

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:42.262
that Bobby will remember
the rest of his life.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:43.530
MIKE MEFFORD (ON PHONE): Hello?

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.304
MIKE: Hey, Mike, it looks
like it starts with 7R280.

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:51.871
OK.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:58.511
What year is that?

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.351
OK.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.054
What kind of value would you put
on the car in this condition?

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.934
$45,000 to $55,000.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.102
That's a little better number
than the last you heard.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.270
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.405
MIKE: OK.

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.441
Jaguar enthusiasts are
all about originality.

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:31.578
It's got to be the original
tranny, the original motor,

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.212
the original everything.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.715
Once it's been altered,
that takes it down.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.450
So this is just
going to be a driver.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.886
What would the car be
worth in this condition

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.187
if it did have matching numbers?

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:48.227
OK.

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.362
What if it was done?

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.997
What if the car was done
rolling down the road

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:51.831
and it had matching numbers?

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:56.569
All right.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.171
Well, hey, I very
much appreciate

00:03:58.171 --> 00:03:59.205
all of your knowledge.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:00.940
And as always,
thank you so much.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.175
MIKE MEFFORD (ON PHONE): Bye.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:05.678
I was thinking of a $30,000
price range on that car.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.748
To find out that it's worth
more than that, it's nice.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:09.849
MIKE: Well, I'm
glad that we were

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.451
able to get a hold of Mike.
- Yeah.

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:12.385
Thanks for helping me get--

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.553
He's got a lot
of knowledge, man.

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:14.821
The guy's been in
it a long time.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:18.024
Bobby is smart enough
and passionate enough

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:21.160
to understand that he
can't do this car justice.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.398
This car needs so much
work, expensive work.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.166
And it needs to be
back out on the road.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.267
Actually, you know what?

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.603
I'll give you Mike's
number before I leave.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.771
He could sell it for you.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.373
Let him try to get
your top dollar.

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:37.410
- Cool.
- At $45,000, I'm not a player.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.580
And I want to see him get as
much as he can for the car,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.850
because he deserves it,
his father deserves it.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.851
And what a hell of
a ride they had.
