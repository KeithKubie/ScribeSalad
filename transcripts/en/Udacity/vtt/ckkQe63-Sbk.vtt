00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Professor Mitchell, what do you think? &gt;&gt;You throw away the extremes, the mean is 20.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay, so you throw away the extremes, you arranged all points as before

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
minus 99, 13, 17, 33, 1489, we find that these are the lower quartile and upper quartile,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
this happens to be the median--these are the numbers that are average--13, 17 and 33.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You have one more chance Tom to revise your estimate.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay. I'll go with 21. &gt;&gt;21! You did it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Professor Mitchell from Carnegie Mellon University with us today

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
computed the quartile of this data sequence.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Thanks so much! &gt;&gt;Thank you. Thank you.
