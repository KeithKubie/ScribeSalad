[Theremin sounds]

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.380
My name is Dorit Chrysler.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm a musicologist and composer. I also play the theremin.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.580
I helped co-found the New York Theremin Society

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.780
and also started a program, Kidcoolthereminschool

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.320
to teach Theremin internationally

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.260
and I'm delighted to

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.580
talk about the Theremin here today at

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.280
Harvard. Lots of different possibilities

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.460
How does the Theremin work?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.920
It is completely different than all the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.220
traditional music interfaces we are

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.220
familiar with and they also developed

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.980
over thousands of years, where the Theremin

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.200
in comparison is a very young instrument.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.570
It basically creates two electromagnetic

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.840
fields one horizontal and one vertical

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.460
This is the pitch antenna, so...

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.340
...the closer I go to the pitch antenna, the higher the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.080
pitch and this is the volume. Here it is...

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
...the further away my hand is, the louder it gets.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.200
So I'm sculpting each bland sinus note

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000
with the volume

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.080
[Music]

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.380
while trying to find the pitch, which is

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.460
constant intonation. It's kind of like a

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.620
bumblebee buzzing around the flower

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.040
which is a pitch and you're trying to

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.860
land on it.
