00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.138
Narrator: THIS IS

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:09.776
THE EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION
FOR NUCLEAR RESEARCH --

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.178
CERN.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:18.184
CERN IS HOME TO HALF OF
THE WORLD'S PARTICLE PHYSICISTS

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.653
AND THE BIGGEST
PARTICLE-HUNTING MACHINE

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:24.824
THAT HAS EVER BEEN BUILT,

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:30.429
THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER,
OR LHC.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.366
INSIDE THIS PIPE,
TWO BEAMS OF PROTONS

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.103
ARE SENT HURTLING
AROUND A NEARLY 17-MILE LOOP

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:41.741
BEFORE BEING SMASHED TOGETHER
TO CREATE SUBATOMIC PARTICLES.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.347
IT RE-CREATES
THE CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:51.684
JUST AFTER THE BIG BANG.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.953 line:0%
THE BIG BANG WAS AN EXPLOSION

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.790 line:0%
THAT HAPPENED AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE UNIVERSE

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.692
WHEN ALL MATTER WAS CREATED.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:03.162
SO THIS IS THE YEAR ZERO,
AND IF WE DRAW A LINE HERE...

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.398
Narrator: FROM THIS POINT,
THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED,

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.367
GETTING COOLER
WITH ITS ENERGY DISPERSING.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.903
...TO WHERE WE ARE
IN THE UNIVERSE NOW

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:14.407
WHERE HUMANS EXIST,
THAT'S 14 BILLION YEARS.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:20.146
Narrator: OUR SUN WAS FORMED
9 BILLION YEARS AGO,

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:24.184
WHILE THE FIRST STARS FORMED
OVER 8 BILLION YEARS EARLIER.

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:30.523
BUT THE LHC IS ABLE TO LOOK
EVEN FURTHER BACK IN TIME

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:34.060
TO WHEN ALL THAT EXISTED WERE
THE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.529
OF THE UNIVERSE,

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.331
PARTICLES.

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.433
Dr. Martin: SO IN A WAY,
THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER IS

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.203
LIKE A TIME MACHINE
TRYING TO CREATE

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.704
THE CONDITIONS THAT HAPPENED

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:47.373
JUST IN THE FEW MILLIONTHS
OF A SECOND

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.775
AFTER THE BIG BANG
TO SEE WHAT PARTICLES EXISTED

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:53.245
WHEN THE ENERGY DENSITY
OF THE UNIVERSE

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.248
WAS REALLY, REALLY HIGH.

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.552
Narrator:
AT THE MOMENT OF COLLISION,

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:02.421
THE ENERGY IS CONVERTED
INTO MASS

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:04.958
IN THE FORM
OF THOUSANDS OF PARTICLES.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.329
ALTHOUGH MOST WILL BE ONES
WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT,

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.998
THE HOPE IS
THAT UNDISCOVERED PARTICLES

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:15.935
MIGHT ALSO BE CREATED
THAT COULD HELP EXPLAIN

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:19.472
SOME OF THE MYSTERIES
OF HOW THE UNIVERSE WAS FORMED.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.577
