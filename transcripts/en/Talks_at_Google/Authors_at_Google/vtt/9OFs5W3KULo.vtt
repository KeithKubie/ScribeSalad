00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:04.122
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:06.387
HELEN SCALES: Thank
you very much.

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:07.720
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.890
So thank you for giving
up your lunch hour to come

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.300
and hear me talk about my book.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.750
My name is Helen Scales.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.760
I'm a marine biologist.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.136
And just in case any
of you are wondering,

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:20.000
that is my real name.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.270
Scales, fish,
marine biology, yes.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.220
And this is my book, "Spirals
in Time, The Secret Life

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.450
and Curious Afterlife
of Sea Shells."

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.290
I want to tell you a little
bit about why I wrote the book

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.760
and tell you a few of the
stories that go into it.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.130
Starting off, already the
title-- "Spirals in Time,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.460
The Secret Life and Curious
Afterlife of Sea Shells"--

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.110
in the review I got
in "The Guardian"

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.928
newspaper a few months ago,
I made the mistake of reading

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:54.303
below the line on the website
version and looking at some

00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:55.761
of the comments
people had written.

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.936
And one person felt necessary
to comment on the subtitle,

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:00.560
"The Secret Life and
Curious Afterlife"

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.380
was clearly a
clever, clever title

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.250
provided by the
publisher enforced

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.420
on this kind of
popular science books.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.610
It's the sort of title
you have to have.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.250
Luckily, somebody
else commented also.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.250
It just kind of tells you
what the book's about.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.330
That's fine.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.590
But actually, it wasn't
my publisher's, it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.630
was my mom who came up with
the title-- the subtitle.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.940
And I'm really pleased she
did because it means she kind

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.930
of got what the book was about.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.970
From me talking about it
for ages, and also making

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.880
her read bits of it
as it was going along.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.397
She clearly kind of got what
it was I was trying to do,

00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:42.270
even perhaps before
I really realized.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.142
So yes, there's really two
things I'm doing in the book.

00:01:45.142 --> 00:01:48.780
One is telling the story of
the lives of the shell makers.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780
The animals that
make sea shells.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.920
We all know those beautiful
objects you find on a beach.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.140
You might have picked
them up, taken them home.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.370
But where do they come from?

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.340
How are they made?

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.150
What happens in the lives
of the creatures that

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.010
left these shells behind?

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.770
So I wanted to tell
partly the story

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.960
about the wonderful
creatures, the mollusks, that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.789
makes these shells.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.450
Mollusks are really one of the
most strange, smallest, tough,

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.830
ancient, and successful groups
of animals on the planet.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.790
We're talking about
familiar creatures.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.210
Mollusks range from slugs and
snails and squid and octopus.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.640
And two slightly stranger
things you might not have heard

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.540
are things like argonauts and
sea butterflies and chitons,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.400
and weird little things called
[INAUDIBLE] gastros that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.920
live in bottom of the sea, and
frankly just look like worms,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.510
but they are still mollusks.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.730
And they are one of
the most diverse groups

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.230
of animals on the planet.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.865
Really, they're only
beaten by the arthropods.

00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:51.820
Another phylum.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.540
These are phyla that
were talking about.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.650
Kind of grouping them
in the animal kingdom.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.850
And the arthropods
include all the insects.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.320
So they definitely win in
terms of the largest number

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.490
of species within a phyla.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.280
There's over a million
species of insects.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.460
Alone, most of them are beetles
but mollusks come in, I think,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.160
good second place, frankly.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.550
And they are an
incredibly strange bunch

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.060
of animals that live all
sorts of different lives.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.250
It's thought there could be
about 50 to 100,000 species

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.099
of mollusk alive today that
we've described already.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.890
And we don't know for
sure, because there's

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.740
no-- up until now, there
hasn't been a central catalog

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.885
to list all the names of
all the mollusks that have

00:03:32.885 --> 00:03:33.990
been described scientifically.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.920
We're now doing that.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.903
So hopefully we'll get
a bit more of a grasp

00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:41.460
on just how diverse
these animals are.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.480
But it's thought by some of the
leading thinkers and scientists

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.540
who work on mollusks
that actually there

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.470
could be more like
200,000 species, including

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.020
ones we haven't discovered yet.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.020
Including creatures
like these guys.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.430
So these are more micromollusks.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.010
They were found in Papua
New Guinea just last summer.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.790
They are all under 5
millimeters in size.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.670
About the size of your
little fingernail.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.560
And none of these have been
described scientifically yet.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.010
They've just been found.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.200
They were found during
an expedition lead

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.960
by a guy called Philip Bouchet
from the Natural History

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.097
in Paris.

00:04:16.097 --> 00:04:18.430
And he basically spends his
life going around the world,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.690
leading expeditions, trying
to find as many mollusks

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.472
as possible.

00:04:21.472 --> 00:04:22.680
People do this kind of thing.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.310
Scientists focus on a
group and really try

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.210
and figure out what's going on.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.685
These were all found
around coral reefs.

00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:32.190
And they're just, just
incredible creatures.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.225
These are types of
mollusk, snails,

00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:36.610
and clams that no
one's ever seen before.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.290
A clam with pink tentacles
for goodness sake.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.490
And transparent shells so you
can see the skin underneath

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.380
is brightly colored.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.580
But these particular
animals, and plenty more

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.590
that they find on
these expeditions,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.620
remain on a museum
shelf undescribed.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.210
They're called orphan
species because we

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.330
lack the expertise to
actually have people sit down

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.590
and name individual species.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.360
We just don't know about
this kind of diversity.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.810
So there's all this hidden
side to the lives of mollusks.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.945
That was partly what
I wanted to talk about

00:05:10.945 --> 00:05:13.500
in the book was all the
things that we don't yet

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.710
know about this incredible
group of animals,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.950
including the species
that we haven't yet found.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.120
And Philip, I spoke to him.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.480
And he's one of the people
who really thinks there could

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.170
be 200,000 species of mollusks.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.077
And he should know.

00:05:26.077 --> 00:05:26.910
He looking for them.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.576
He's finding more and
more all the time.

00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:30.750
Even if all he's really
doing is doing a head count.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.680
This is something different.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.889
We don't know what it is yet.

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.263
We don't know what
might contain.

00:05:34.263 --> 00:05:35.490
We don't know how it lives.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.706
What interesting things that
these animals might be doing.

00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:41.480
And one of the things
I really amazed me when

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.800
I was writing the book--
right up until the point where

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.390
my published were like, no.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.390
You have to stop now.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.340
You cannot put any more
science into this book.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.990
There's so many new discoveries
are coming out the mollusk

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.715
world, that pretty
much every week I'd

00:05:54.715 --> 00:05:56.423
be like, oh, there's
another cool story I

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:57.423
want to put in the book.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:06:01.140
Like the fact that limpets
have the toughest teeth

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.490
made out of the toughest
known biological material.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.320
They've knocked spiders
silk off the perch.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.460
And they figured that
actually because these

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.862
are the snails that clamp
themselves to rock and spend

00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:11.820
their lives scraping the
rock with their teeth,

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.880
they've evolved this incredibly
strong material in their teeth.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.810
So it was like, that
has to go in the book.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.720
Somewhere, we have to get it in.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.710
And then I think actually
just the last thing

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.126
I did manage to
get into the book,

00:06:22.126 --> 00:06:26.700
the last story was about
how cone snails-- these

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.200
are poisonous sea snails
that live in the tropics.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.010
They are notorious for having
incredibly diverse and complex

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.300
toxins that they use to hunt
all sorts of animals, including

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.960
fish.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.325
And there are a few species
that if they sting a human,

00:06:40.325 --> 00:06:42.560
they will actually kill them.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.690
Bit of an overkill,
but there's reasons

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.620
why we think they're
such powerful hunters.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.078
So that they can actually-- a
tiny snail that slowly slides

00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:51.140
along the sea bed,
has the ability

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.670
to eat fast moving fish,
which is kind of incredible.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.510
And a new discovery just
came out a few months

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.920
before the book came
out that they in fact,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.480
use insulin as part
of their weaponry.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.700
So that the only animal we
know that's kind of evolved

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.720
this hormone so that it
essentially knocks out

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.230
its prey by giving
it a dose of insulin

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.710
so that their blood sugar
levels drop, and they faint.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.260
And they can then
eat these fish.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.957
That's just really cool.

00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:19.890
So there were lots of
incredible, cool, amazing, mind

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.260
blowing discoveries coming
out of the mollusk world.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.032
And that was a really
big part of what

00:07:25.032 --> 00:07:27.440
I wanted to do in the book
was to capture this excitement

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.850
of what we're discovering.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.850
And the applications of a
lot of this, this science,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.391
is exciting too.

00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:34.890
The cone snail
venoms that have been

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.810
used to develop
medicines, that have been

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.800
used in biomedical research.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.606
The fact that razor
clams- I don't

00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:44.775
know if you've ever seen the
long, thin shell shells you

00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:45.650
might see on a beach.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.549
They burrow themselves
in the sand,

00:07:47.549 --> 00:07:49.340
but they're much more
efficient to doing it

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.670
than just their muscles
and their shape,

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.880
and the strength of their
shell would suggest.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.970
And researchers have figured
out that they actually

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.750
have this clever
technique of creating

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.540
little pools of quicksand
around them as they dig down.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.000
And it's incredibly
efficiently way of burrowing.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.680
And this could lead to the next
generation of underwater robots

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.550
that can fix things
to the sea bed.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.760
Even undersea cables
for the internet.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.400
They could be fixed down
by these robots inspired

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.922
by razor clams.

00:08:20.922 --> 00:08:22.630
There's tons of cool
stuff about mollusks

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.064
that I was trying to
talk about in the book.

00:08:25.064 --> 00:08:29.890
And what I wanted to capture too
was some of the big discoveries

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.850
and some of the big
questions that scientists

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.180
have thought about when it
comes to shells and mollusks

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.870
over the years.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.260
And one of the big ones is
the shape of their shells.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.624
How is it that shells are made?

00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:45.915
They've got these-- many of
them are beautiful spirals.

00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:47.410
I call my book
"Spirals in Time."

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.290
I guess because I wanted
to allure to the idea

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.890
that these things have been
around for a long time.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.770
And spiraling around.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.750
These calcium carbonate spirals
have been around for probably

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.040
for half a billion years.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.160
We think mollusks first
evolved in the oceans

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.000
about 500 million years ago.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.960
But how do they
make their shells?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.760
And why are there so
many different shapes?

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.740
And in lots of great
thinkers have put their mind

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.250
to try and work out what's
the mathematics that lie

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.720
behind shells and shell making?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.180
One of the simplest
parts of a shell,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.080
of a mollusk's spiraling shell,
is the logarithmic spiral.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.510
A spiral that expands
at a constant rate.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.080
[INAUDIBLE] came up with
this idea of a log spiral.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.330
And if you cut through a
chambered nautilus, which

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.340
is this shell here, you get
a pretty good approximation

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.130
to that logarithmic
spiral in two dimensions.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.360
And if you look at lots
of different mollusks,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.160
many of the gastropods with the
spiraling shells, the snails,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.820
as well as these
the natutilises,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.730
and various other,
the bivalves too,

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.000
clams and so on, they do still
have spirals in their shells.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.790
We'll come to that.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.780
What about into
three dimensions?

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.240
That was the next big
question that scientists

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.280
were thinking about.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.863
Mathematicians and
philosophers wanted

00:09:59.863 --> 00:10:03.477
to figure out how could you
make a three dimensional shell?

00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:04.643
It's all very well the same.

00:10:04.643 --> 00:10:06.080
You've got these two dimensions.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.913
The log spiral is really
important actually,

00:10:07.913 --> 00:10:10.580
because no matter how
big or small it is,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.510
it's the same shape.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.930
And that is a key
rule to making shells

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:18.131
is that if they're tiny
of if they're huge,

00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:19.380
they will stay the same shape.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.960
So mollusks keep their
shelves their whole life,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.960
unlike crustaceans,
the crabs and lobsters

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.240
will shed their shells
and grow new ones.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.220
Mollusks keep the same ones,
just growing bigger and bigger.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.620
But they stay the shape,
even if they're tiny or huge.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.260
But how about three dimensions?

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.110
So it was the turn
of the 20th century,

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.540
there was a guy called
Darcy Wentworth Thompson,

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.940
who wrote a book called
"On Growth and Form."

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.550
And he was really thinking
about shapes in nature.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.540
And how can mathematics
describe the shapes

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.880
of a splash, or a deer's
antler, or indeed,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.814
the shape of a three
dimensional spiraling shell?

00:10:56.814 --> 00:10:59.700
And he came up with the
idea that perhaps you

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.420
create these 3D shells by
spinning a two dimensional

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.686
shape in three dimensions.

00:11:05.686 --> 00:11:07.310
And so essentially
what he's looking at

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:13.130
is having a central axis around
which maybe a circle, a flat

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.990
circle spins around.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.210
And it can either do
so in the same plane,

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.780
or it can drop down that axis.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.910
The walls of the shell can
overlap each other or not.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.905
And perhaps it would
only take three--

00:11:27.905 --> 00:11:29.681
this is running away from me.

00:11:29.681 --> 00:11:34.217
Stop it, stop it-- three
or four simple rules

00:11:34.217 --> 00:11:35.925
to actually make all
the different shells

00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:36.890
that you see in nature.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.990
So he came up with this idea,
just a theoretical idea,

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.900
he couldn't test it.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.690
All he had was paper and pencil.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.990
Could you make all of
the sells we see nature

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.110
with three simple rules of this
single, circle spinning three

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.370
dimensions, how tall it
gets along that axis,

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.010
and how much those worlds
overlap each other?

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.290
These ideas were picked up 40
years later by a paleontologist

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.120
called David Raup
who did something

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.820
unusual for a paleontologist
certainly at the time.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.430
He used a computer.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.340
As he took these
equations from Thompson,

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.527
and he plugged them into a
mainframe IBM 1790 computer.

00:12:12.527 --> 00:12:14.402
The sort of thing that
was at the time-- this

00:12:14.402 --> 00:12:15.690
was in the '60s.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.090
The '50s and '60s
was intended to be

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.750
used for designing aircraft
and nuclear reactors,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.480
but I think he managed
to get some down time.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.320
He was at Johns Hopkins
University in Maryland,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.380
and he used this
computer to build shells.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:35.280
And to see if these simple rules
that Thompson had come up with,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.810
whether you really
could make all

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.290
the different shells that
you see in three dimensions.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.280
And he did.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.520
And the output he had
from his computer work

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.160
was all 2D plots,
which were then

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.460
realized by an artist
in three dimensions.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.010
But we can now have
a look at a mock

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.713
up of what the output of his
model would have looked like.

00:12:53.713 --> 00:12:55.046
And we're going to let that run.

00:12:55.046 --> 00:12:57.100
I think it's incredibly
beautiful and mesmerizing.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.558
So what we're doing here is
just changing these parameters,

00:12:59.558 --> 00:13:05.220
the height, the expansion, the
rate at which the shell flares

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.270
ope as well.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.270
And just by changing
these three parameters,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.510
you do actually get incredible
diversity of shells emerging

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.737
from those simple rules.

00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:17.320
The rest of your shells can be
explained through fairly simple

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.430
mathematics.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.200
You get the clam form
a spiraling shell.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.890
You wouldn't expect
that, but it pops up.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.370
And what Raup did
was he created what's

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.810
come to be known as The
Museum of All Possible Shells.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:38.240
And populated by these shells
created from these equations.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.560
And what seemed to be all
these different, endless forms

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.646
that you see in nature.

00:13:43.646 --> 00:13:46.380
But the really
surprising thing he found

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.850
was that the Museum
of All Possible Shells

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.249
actually isn't full
of real shells.

00:13:51.249 --> 00:13:53.040
If you look at the
shell that have actually

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.090
evolved in the past
through fossils,

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.020
and through what's
alive today, there

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.730
are lots of parts of this space.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.313
If you think about it as being
this actual space where there's

00:14:03.313 --> 00:14:05.845
three parameters on the
next y and zed axis,

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.576
there are large parts of this
space that aren't occupied.

00:14:08.576 --> 00:14:11.400
And those shells
haven't evolved.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:18.120
And it's raised this
question about this

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.460
is a theory called
theoretical morphospace.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.295
The possibilities of
what organisms could be.

00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:27.256
What shapes they could be
and what they actually are.

00:14:27.256 --> 00:14:29.130
And why there's a
difference between the two.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.200
So evolution hasn't
taken mollusks and shells

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.730
to all the possibilities
that these simple rules could

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.230
lead to.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.220
Some of these shells
just haven't existed.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.830
Raup pointed out
that some of the ones

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.030
he made in his computer
wouldn't have worked.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.750
There were clams
that wouldn't open.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.500
There were some that
would just be flimsy,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.550
and they wouldn't be competitive
out there in the wild ocean

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.150
and in places where
mollusks live.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.086
But there were
plenty of shells that

00:14:55.086 --> 00:14:56.252
seemed to be perfectly good.

00:14:56.252 --> 00:14:59.490
And there seems no reason
why they haven't evolved.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.260
And people expanded
this idea out now.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.090
And we've built museums of
all possible fish and plants

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.120
and all different
types of organisms

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.100
that you can look
at their morphology

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.160
and see what potential
shapes they could be.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.327
And then compare that
to what we actually see.

00:15:16.327 --> 00:15:17.910
And again and again
you see this limit

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.340
of what evolution's created.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.230
Of what evolution's thrown
up, and what potentially

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.420
could occur.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.350
And discussions are going on.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.550
There is this division
between some people who

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.555
think that ultimately yes, all
these shells could and would

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:34.775
evolve if the situation
arose that that shell would

00:15:34.775 --> 00:15:37.397
be well adapted to a
particular condition.

00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:39.730
And there are others who think
that actually, maybe, no.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.090
Then that's the
evolution-- genetically

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.220
there isn't the material that
would ever evolve these shells.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.800
It just would never happen.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.730
And the discussions go on.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.485
That's one of the
big questions I

00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:53.790
look into on a bit more
detail in the book of how

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.500
shells evolve.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.708
Why they're different shapes.

00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:58.550
And why we don't actually
see all the potential shells

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.540
that mathematics suggest
could exist in the world.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.520
So that's the life
part of the subtitle.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.470
There's also the after life.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.600
And this isn't the
bit of the book

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.640
where I talk about snail
ghosts or any kind of belief

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.390
in the after life.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:19.760
It's really just my
desire to talk about how

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.570
humans have used shells.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.380
So after the animals
inside that make

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.490
them have died and
long gone, and they've

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:29.206
left behind these
empty shells, we

00:16:29.206 --> 00:16:30.581
do all sorts of
things with them.

00:16:30.581 --> 00:16:31.960
And there's incredible,
long, history.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.418
Pretty much to the
dawn of humanity

00:16:33.418 --> 00:16:35.510
that people have seen
shells, they've found them,

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.200
and put them to
all sorts of uses.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.930
Both practical and
incredibly deep

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.720
symbolism and
meaning in seashells.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.080
I was really amazed researching
the book at just how broad

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.134
and how universal these
beliefs in shells are.

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:50.550
There are symbols
of sex and death

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.802
and birth and power
and money, and cultures

00:16:54.802 --> 00:16:58.385
all over the world, and
even far, far from the ocean

00:16:58.385 --> 00:17:00.410
have these incredibly
strong beliefs in shells.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.720
So I wanted to tell
some of those stories.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.402
I partly wanted to try and
reinstate some of the grandeur

00:17:06.402 --> 00:17:10.619
and some of the wonder
and magnificence of shells

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.030
in human lives.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:18.849
Because today, I think shells
have got more of a reputation

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.869
for being fairly-- they're
cheap, throw-away trinkets.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:27.489
They're emblems of ocean that
we can buy from a seaside store,

00:17:27.489 --> 00:17:28.850
or perhaps we find ourselves.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.110
We don't really pay them
that much attention.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.315
And people make
things like-- this

00:17:35.315 --> 00:17:39.510
is the kind of thing people
use shells for these days--

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.600
Make things like
this, and also this.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.790
I found this on sale on eBay.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.141
She's got lovely,
lovely headdress on.

00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:51.410
Oh dear, now it's
running away again.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.130
What I wanted to
do was tell stories

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.526
of how people have used
shells in the past in ways

00:17:56.526 --> 00:17:58.600
that are far more magnificent.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.242
So this guy here is
about 7,000 years old.

00:18:02.242 --> 00:18:03.990
I don't know why
this is running away.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.460
Hang on a second.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.910
I'm going to just do this a
different way so it stops--

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.380
stops going too quickly.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.620
I wanted to tell stories of
how people have used shells,

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.715
not to make comedy frogs.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:25.335
So this is a great
found in Bulgaria.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.490
And about 7,000 years old.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.560
They're called
the old Europeans.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.960
Don't you want to know
why it's doing that?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.100
AUDIENCE: I think you've
got auto advance on.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.766
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:19:02.462 --> 00:19:03.462
HELEN SCALES: Excellent.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.291
Stories of shells being
used in human lives.

00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:11.790
There's this
incredibly rich history

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.280
of the beliefs and
symbolism of shells.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.500
This chap is the leader
of the Varna community.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.220
These guys lived in Europe
about 7,000 years ago.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.280
Up until this point,
when this was discovered

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.000
in the 1970s, this grave in the
city of the dead in Bulgaria,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.760
it was thought that
the old Europeans were

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.270
quite an egalitarian group,
and that they were mostly just

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.256
nomadic farmers.

00:19:37.256 --> 00:19:39.930
There was no sign up until
that point of any elites

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.160
who were coming in
charge, and that society

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.730
was fairly even and equal.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.890
And they found a
grave where a guy

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.490
covered in gold and with
all sorts of jewelry,

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.390
including some very
beautiful shell jewelry.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.890
And that's why I wanted to talk
about this particular case.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.950
Around this guy's
upper arm, you can

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.391
see on one side he's got
bangles, including a white one.

00:20:02.391 --> 00:20:04.390
And that's made from a
shell called spondylitis.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.172
It comes from a long
way from this part.

00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:07.630
It doesn't come
from the Black Sea,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.120
but from the Mediterranean.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.830
And there was this
long distance trade

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.460
in these shells
called spondylitis

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.610
that were carved into
beautiful objects, all the way

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.230
across Europe up to Paris.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.400
And often what
was done with them

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.359
is they were carved into
bangles that people wore.

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:24.900
And I think there's
even been studies

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.712
to show that some
of these bangles

00:20:26.712 --> 00:20:28.920
were put on to people's arms
when they were children,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.382
and then they grow into them,
and couldn't take them off

00:20:31.382 --> 00:20:32.084
again.

00:20:32.084 --> 00:20:34.500
This particular one though,
it was just really intriguing.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.032
So it was carved
from this big shell.

00:20:38.032 --> 00:20:39.240
They're called spiny oysters.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.810
That's another name
for these shells.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.421
In life, they're
covered in spines.

00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:43.920
But cut them through
and they've got

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.940
this beautiful,
bright white shell.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.340
And carved into a bangle,
broke it, and then

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.552
fixed with gold plates.

00:20:52.552 --> 00:20:54.010
And that's what
this guy's wearing.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.644
We don't know why they did that.

00:20:55.644 --> 00:20:57.060
There's various
other remains that

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.330
seem to be deliberately broken
of these shells left in graves.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.500
There's some significance
behind this particular shell.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.090
It was always the same
species that was being used.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.430
And then it just disappeared,
and they stopped being used.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.410
It was about 6,000 years
ago, and that's it.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.921
No more spondylitis.

00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:17.490
There was a parallel trade
in spondylitis shells

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.954
in the Americas, with the
Aztecs and the Mayans.

00:21:19.954 --> 00:21:21.370
They were using
spondylitis shells

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.830
for decorations and money.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.280
They were carving
statuettes of humans,

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.795
giving them to
children, taking them

00:21:27.795 --> 00:21:29.295
to the tops of the
highest mountains

00:21:29.295 --> 00:21:32.000
and leaving them there,
as human sacrifices.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.500
So there were all these
incredible, significant stories

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.596
about shells.

00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:38.279
And so I tell some of
those stories in the book.

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:43.580
And hopefully try to reinstate
some of the sense of mystery

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.480
and wonder about
what shells are.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.080
And I think one of
the reasons people

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.496
value them so much
is because they

00:21:48.496 --> 00:21:52.550
come from this dark, deep
ocean where they're full

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.400
of sea monsters and
things we can't see.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.379
But these beautiful
objects wash up on beaches.

00:21:56.379 --> 00:21:58.545
And people have always
wondered where they come from

00:21:58.545 --> 00:22:02.830
and how they're made, and
hold them in great meaning.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.460
Oh.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.887
Now I've broken it entirely.

00:22:06.887 --> 00:22:07.387
Sorry.

00:22:07.387 --> 00:22:08.137
AUDIENCE: Hang on.

00:22:11.251 --> 00:22:13.375
HELEN SCALES: See if we
can get some pictures back.

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:16.310
That's fine.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.350
The beliefs and the symbolism
and mysteries of shells

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.260
haven't all just
died out in the past.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.360
There's plenty of modern--

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.100
There are still
some modern stories

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.140
and modern of shells
filling that role

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.760
of some mysterious
objects surround

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.872
by some significant
beliefs and ideas.

00:22:38.872 --> 00:22:41.413
And I thought of the story of
one of them in the modern world

00:22:41.413 --> 00:22:45.300
today of this stuff
called sea silk.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.950
Silk from the sea.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.900
And lost of ancient stories
have been told about stuff

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.280
called sea silk, which
comes from a shell called

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.150
the noble pen shell, which
grows in the Mediterranean.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:59.980
They can grow to
up to a meter tall.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.980
They look like giant
muscles, just like a muscle

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.690
that you'd eat.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:03.880
They stand really tall.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.690
And this stuff called sea
silk comes from the threads

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.970
that they make to anchor
themselves to the sea bed.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.990
If you've ever eaten muscles
or cooked them, blue muscles,

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.510
you would probably had to
debeard them and yank out

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.760
the fibers that they have.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.820
Same stuff.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.930
Only these shells have really
big ones because they're bigger

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.815
and they have to use
their byssus threads,

00:23:24.815 --> 00:23:28.065
which I'll come back to--
to anchor themselves solidly

00:23:28.065 --> 00:23:30.030
and so they don't
get sucked away.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.570
Anyway, so there's lots of
stories told about sea silk,

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.270
also known as byssus.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.870
There are stories told
of the ancient Egyptians

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.760
buried their
pharaohs and wrapped

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.777
in cloth made of sea silk.

00:23:42.777 --> 00:23:44.985
Henry the Eighth had a picnic
with the King of France

00:23:44.985 --> 00:23:48.500
with his men all dressed
in golden sea silk.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.760
And the stories go on and on.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.510
There's stories in
the Bible of sea silk.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.780
And a lot of people
do still believe

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.792
that this has a very ancient
origin maybe thousands of years

00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:00.050
ago.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.560
And I went to Sardinia
to find and to meet

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.652
the lady who calls herself
the last maestro of sea silk.

00:24:07.652 --> 00:24:09.110
She says she's the
only person left

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.570
in the world who knows
how to weave fabric

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:14.020
and threads from this fiber.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.530
A lady called Chiara Vigo.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.830
There was a story in the BBC a
couple of days ago about her.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.700
You might have seen
it on the BBC website.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.860
Check it out.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.400
That gives one
side of the story,

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.740
which is interesting
about what she goes up to.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.790
And she has a museum of
byssus, a byssus museum

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.020
in a tiny island of Sardinia
called Sant' Antioco.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.050
What she does, she
practices weaving.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.740
She shows people
how this is done.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.800
And retells all these stories
about byssus and sea silk

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.350
going back into the Bible and
beyond a thousand years ago.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.460
But as I was researching
and working on the book,

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.630
I met and spent a lot of
time with a few people who

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:56.760
actually study sea silk and look
at it the academic side of it.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:01.070
And scholars have traced
records of sea silk

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.710
back in the literature
and back into the past,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.900
and discover that there's a
big problem with this story

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.010
that sea silk is such
an ancient stuff.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:14.200
And it really it comes
down to a spelling mistake

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.310
in the 15th century.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.835
And a lot of talk
about seal silk

00:25:17.835 --> 00:25:21.125
goes back to Aristotle's book
on the history of animals.

00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:24.310
And he talks about pen shells.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:29.772
And how they have these
fibers coming out of them

00:25:29.772 --> 00:25:31.050
called byssus.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.120
And therefore, sea silk
comes from pen shells,

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.214
and it's connected
to this word byssus.

00:25:38.214 --> 00:25:39.755
But actually what
the truth of it is,

00:25:39.755 --> 00:25:41.980
is that word byssus was
never connected to pen shells

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.813
when Aristotle originally
wrote those books.

00:25:43.813 --> 00:25:46.200
It was a translation
much later that

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.490
mistranslated a word that
means deep and depth, the word

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:55.476
that leads is to things
like abyss and bathysphere.

00:25:55.476 --> 00:25:56.850
And what he was
originally saying

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.060
was that these shells
grow in the deep water.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.830
And that was that.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.440
That's why he used
the word byssus.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.810
And the translation came
along in Latin, later

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.580
on in the 15th century,
shifted an accent

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.280
from one word-- I
think it was actually

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.050
from the Greek from
one letter to another--

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:16.920
and changed it from meaning
deep to meaning fine cloth.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.380
And from then on, byssus was
associated with fine cloth.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.110
And there is a word
byssus that means

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.470
linens and cottons and
all sorts of fine fabrics,

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:26.970
but not specifically.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.485
But once that
translation kicked in,

00:26:28.485 --> 00:26:30.651
and it was a really popular
translation of that book

00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:32.990
by Aristotle, everyone
thought that byssus whenever

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.820
it was mentioned, back
in all of the old texts,

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.056
refers to sea silk.

00:26:38.056 --> 00:26:38.810
And it doesn't.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.860
It just means fine cloth.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.099
So unfortunately all
this talk about sea silk

00:26:43.099 --> 00:26:44.890
being this ancient
stuff, it doesn't really

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:45.910
have any foundation.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.797
But no one really is listening
to these scholars who

00:26:48.797 --> 00:26:51.356
are saying have you actually
looked and seen that there

00:26:51.356 --> 00:26:54.582
is this mistake and we we're
actually telling stories that

00:26:54.582 --> 00:26:55.745
aren't true.

00:26:55.745 --> 00:26:59.362
But that doesn't stop a
certain lady continuing to show

00:26:59.362 --> 00:27:00.570
people this, and that's fine.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.180
I went to see her.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.513
And she was very pleasant,and
she showed me what she was

00:27:03.513 --> 00:27:04.030
doing.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.810
But when I was in
Sant' Antioco, I also

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.666
met-- OK, that's a
lump of raw byssus

00:27:08.666 --> 00:27:09.790
before it's been processed.

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.224
As it's been pulled
off the shells

00:27:11.224 --> 00:27:12.932
there are little bits
of sea shell in it.

00:27:12.932 --> 00:27:15.455
And that previous
shot is a piece

00:27:15.455 --> 00:27:18.530
of processed byssus and sea
silk before she weaves it.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:21.940
I met these ladies who
also weave sea silk.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.210
So Chiara is not the only one.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.500
she tends to be the maestro.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.500
But there are some other
people who still do it.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.700
So these lovely ladies
showed me the same process.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.630
How they carved the fibers,
how they spin them and then

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:37.740
use them to weave
embroideries like this.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.570
One of the problems is that
pen shells are now protected.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.250
They're a protected species
because, for various reasons,

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.450
they're not doing very well.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.880
They live in sea
grass beds which

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.800
is suffering from things
like climate change,

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.335
and habitat destruction.

00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:50.505
So they've been protected.

00:27:50.505 --> 00:27:52.380
And you're not allowed
to actually take them.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.160
It's illegal to
take these shells

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.020
or to harm them in any way.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:01.346
Chiara claims that she has found
a way of sustainably harvesting

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:04.860
sea silk from shells by
taking them up and snipping

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.530
their threads, and
then putting them back.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.475
The problem is that
she's so surrounded

00:28:09.475 --> 00:28:12.320
in secrecy in what she
does, that no one is

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.550
allowed to go with her
while she's doing this.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.860
And so I can't comment as to
whether she's actually doing it

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.940
sustainably or if
she's up to something

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.380
else, because she absolutely
refused for me to go with her

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.130
and see what she was up to.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.795
The other ladies--
this is the picture

00:28:27.795 --> 00:28:30.066
of these two these guys.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.947
Jessapina and Acentina Pez
were very open and said to me

00:28:36.947 --> 00:28:38.530
we can't get a hold
of anymore fibers.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.194
We can't do this new anymore.

00:28:40.194 --> 00:28:41.610
They had a little
collection of it

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.050
that their grandmother
had given them,

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.800
and they use it to
show people like me who

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.600
want to see how it's done.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.670
Mostly they just use
other fibers these days

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:51.250
and carry on with their
traditional weavings,

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.320
but not with sea silk.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.445
And occasionally a fisherman
will find a dead shell

00:28:54.445 --> 00:28:56.653
and give it to them, and
they have a bit more to use.

00:28:56.653 --> 00:28:58.530
But they're like, it's
a thing of the past.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.380
We want to remember
how it's done,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.965
but we can't pretend
that we can still

00:29:01.965 --> 00:29:04.006
do it because these shells
just aren't available.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.790
I felt like when I was
reporting on this story,

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.640
this is not what I
was expecting at all.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.530
I was just expected to
tell this simple story

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.950
of this strange old fiber that's
been here since the Bible.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.560
And found I was getting sucked
into this stranger story than I

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.345
unexpected of things not being
quite as the should seem.

00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:25.900
So, it was really fun.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:33.200
So a question I often get
asked by people, mostly kids,

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.240
but then they always
ask the best questions

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.155
when I'm talking about
shells and mollusks

00:29:37.155 --> 00:29:40.180
and my book is what's
my favorite shell

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.639
and what's my favorite mollusk?

00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:44.430
So I tell them that's
really hard question.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.620
You do that there might
be 200,000 species.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.030
But OK, if you make
me, I will tell you

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.135
that my favorite
is the argonaut.

00:29:52.135 --> 00:29:54.075
I even have it on my tee shirt.

00:29:54.075 --> 00:29:56.160
That's how cool it is.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.360
And there's a couple
of reasons why

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.550
I do genuinely think that
argonauts are brilliant,

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.200
brilliant mollusks.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.050
Firstly, while they are the
only octopus that have shells.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.440
So octopus of a mollusk
that generally have

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.690
evolved life without a shell.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.830
They have a soft life.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.540
They have evolved
other mechanisms

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.090
to survive and to
incredibly well

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.190
without having an
external shell.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.130
But argonauts still have shells.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.985
You can just about make out.

00:30:23.985 --> 00:30:25.526
They're also called
paper nautiluses.

00:30:25.526 --> 00:30:27.572
They're not related to
the chambered nautilus,

00:30:27.572 --> 00:30:29.071
but they look a
little bit like him.

00:30:29.071 --> 00:30:32.070
And they have this papery
shell, and a little octopus

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.140
lives inside.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.810
And they're very
beautiful creatures.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.650
I've never seen one myself.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.310
They live in the open ocean and
they're really hard to find.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.500
You often really just
find the shells washed up,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.650
but no living creature inside.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.210
And for a long time
the big question

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.380
was there were these sort
of gentlemanly arguments

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.810
and debates among scientists
in the, technically

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:58.040
Victorian times, about
the truth behind argonauts

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.345
and whether or not they
make their own shells

00:31:01.345 --> 00:31:04.070
or whether they steal them
from some other animal

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.040
that we haven't yet discovered.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.290
This was the likes of Richard
Owen, the guy who set up

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.220
the Natural History Museum.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.050
He was really keen to
figure out whether argonauts

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:17.020
were shell makers or basically
pirates that stole shells

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:17.920
from other creatures.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.720
And there were just
brilliant stories

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.580
told in all sorts of-- I
think Aristotle told stories

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.782
about this, about argonauts.

00:31:25.782 --> 00:31:27.365
I think he started
it all off actually

00:31:27.365 --> 00:31:30.680
by claiming to have
seen argonauts using

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.125
their shells as little boats.

00:31:32.125 --> 00:31:33.500
So I haven't got
one to show you,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.001
but they are quite
hollow and light.

00:31:35.001 --> 00:31:36.958
And you can imagine that
they would float along

00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:38.056
the surface of the sea.

00:31:38.056 --> 00:31:41.160
And he told stories of seeing
these little octopus sitting

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.270
inside in their
shells and sticking

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.920
two of their tentacles, which
one of them you can see here.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.840
They do spread out
into this wide membrane

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.020
which we'll come back to.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.360
But he [INAUDIBLE] put
them in the air as sails,

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.740
and they caught the breeze.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:59.100
They drifted around
in their little boats.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.360
Or other scientist claim
to have seen argonauts

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.767
using their arms to row
themselves along, again,

00:32:04.767 --> 00:32:05.850
on the surface of the sea.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.360
With their little boats.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.080
And the story get told and told.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.600
If you read "20,000 Under
the Sea," by Jules Verne,

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.845
he tells the story about how
Professor Arronax at one point

00:32:15.845 --> 00:32:17.000
pops up on to the nautilus.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.500
Ha, ha.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.375
There's the nautilus.

00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:19.336
There's the name again.

00:32:19.336 --> 00:32:20.460
Actually, it's quite sweet.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.810
They see a raft of
argonauts drifting past.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.904
It seems to go for
about five minutes.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.900
Yeah, with their little
ears which are their sails,

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.820
supposedly drifting along.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.720
It's his butler at one
point, he points out--

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.907
I don't know if you know
the story of "20,000

00:32:42.907 --> 00:32:45.230
Leagues Under the Sea,"
how it's Captain Nemo who's

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.010
this crazy mariner who
kidnaps the scientist

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.820
and takes him around the
world in the nautilus,

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.680
which is his submarine.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.990
This is some scientific truth.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.615
A lot of the stuff
that he writes about

00:32:57.615 --> 00:33:01.520
is what was the science at the
time we knew about that Jules

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.500
Verne-- it was really
a marine biology book.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.785
But with a story,
which was quite nice.

00:33:05.785 --> 00:33:08.870
And Professor Arronax, the
marine biologist's assistant,

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:12.410
actually says, well,
why didn't Captain Nemo

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.050
call his ship The Argonaut?

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.960
Because argonauts, the octopus
can actually come all the way

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.630
out of the shell,
unlike a nautilus,

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:21.546
which is like a snail.

00:33:21.546 --> 00:33:22.390
You can take it out.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:25.540
It would immediately not
be very well if you tried

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.070
to pull a snail out of a shell.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.180
But the octopus can
leave their shells,

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.330
but they just choose not to.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.250
And Captain Nemo was the same.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:37.645
He could leave his is submarine,
but he chooses not to.

00:33:37.645 --> 00:33:39.610
He lives forever
beneath the waves.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.136
Kind of an exile from humanity.

00:33:41.136 --> 00:33:42.510
So I thought that
was quite nice.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.527
There was a point
in the book where

00:33:43.527 --> 00:33:45.027
I was like you
should have called it

00:33:45.027 --> 00:33:47.520
the Argonaut, not the Nautilus.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.340
So this debate went on about
do argonauts make their shells,

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.170
or do they steal them?

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.100
And the other
reason why I really

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.010
wanted to tell the
story of argonauts

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.030
and why they're brilliant
is because of this lady

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.920
who you finally cracked
this question of the truth

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.915
about how argonauts.

00:34:05.915 --> 00:34:09.270
Her name was Jeanne
Villepreux-Power.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:15.330
And she was French and
married a Sicilian.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:18.090
She went and lived in
Sicily as a lady of leisure.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.326
She started off life as a poor--
in a little village in France,

00:34:22.326 --> 00:34:24.409
but ended up meeting this
guy and getting married.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:28.471
And spent the rest of
her life as a scientist.

00:34:28.471 --> 00:34:29.929
Basically as a lady
of leisure, she

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.739
decided that she wanted to go
out and just explore the world.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:33.739
She explores Sicily.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:36.150
She did lot of studies of
the animals of the island.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.918
She sounds a bit like a
latter day Gerald Durrell.

00:34:38.918 --> 00:34:40.959
She brought things to live
in the house with her.

00:34:40.959 --> 00:34:43.250
There were pine
martens running around.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.300
But one of the things
she did, and she actually

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.100
isn't very well
remembered for, and why

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.690
I wanted to write
about her story,

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.980
is that she pioneered some
incredible marine biological

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.255
studies.

00:34:53.255 --> 00:34:56.550
And invented an aquarium
tank for research.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:00.520
And she built this thing,
which was just made of wood.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.680
It was an open box
with wooden slats

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.612
let sea water come through.

00:35:04.612 --> 00:35:06.570
And she would anchor it
at the edge of the sea.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.120
And she would take
argonauts that fisherman

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.590
would catch for her, and
she would occasionally

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.350
catch herself, and
she'd place them

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:14.110
in these observation chambers.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:18.030
And she conducted some really
quite elaborate experiments

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.980
to figure out do
they make shells,

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.280
or do they borrow them
from something else?

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.930
Or do they parasitize
another animal?

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.180
And I give the details of
the experiments in the book.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.680
And it's a pretty
brilliant ideas.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.980
Some of them are a bit cruel.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.740
You have to do things
like break argonaut shells

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.010
and see if they can fix them.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.990
Take their shells away.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:36.860
And she slowly built
up this picture

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.140
that really did convincingly
show that argonauts,

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.250
yes, they do make
their own shells.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.440
And in fact, it's
the females that do.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.610
The males were just
nowhere to be seen.

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:48.375
But it was always
the females she found

00:35:48.375 --> 00:35:49.930
were making the these shells.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.230
And in fact, the
membrane that you

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.885
see on the outside of the shell,
that's what makes the shell.

00:35:54.885 --> 00:35:57.010
It's really different from
to other mollusks, which

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.340
have this thing called a mantle,
which covers all of their body.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.910
And that's what makes the shell.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.600
Whereas they have a modify
at the end of two tentacles.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.600
And it looks silvery
when you see them alive.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.730
And they can fix up patches
in their shell if it's broken.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.750
And they also make
the shell initially.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.540
They only ever make one shell,
like the rest of the mollusks.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.140
So if they're parted from their
shell, they don't survive.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.200
Which I guess is why they
always hang on to them.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.420
So she started having
ideas, Villepreux-Power

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.936
did have ideas about
where were the males,

00:36:28.936 --> 00:36:30.810
but she didn't quite
get to the bottom of it.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:32.510
The females make these shells.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.090
They lay their eggs
inside the shells

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.385
and use them as a brood chamber.

00:36:36.385 --> 00:36:37.690
But where are the males?

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:39.606
And it wasn't too much
later it was discovered

00:36:39.606 --> 00:36:43.670
that the males are tiny,
tiny small and basically kind

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.690
of parasitize the female.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.925
Then they have one tentacle
with a packet of sperm

00:36:47.925 --> 00:36:49.690
on the end, which
they lob at her.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.025
And it sticks to her body.

00:36:51.025 --> 00:36:52.460
And she can collect
a few of them

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.585
and put them inside her
shell and carry them around

00:36:54.585 --> 00:36:57.200
until she's ready to
fertilize her eggs.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.683
So the males have a
rather different problem

00:36:59.683 --> 00:37:02.336
in life than the female.

00:37:02.336 --> 00:37:04.160
And still things
we're finding out.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.810
New things about argonauts,
recently, one guy in Australia

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:12.390
found some live ones and
discovered that they actually

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:14.730
use their chamber, their
shells as a buoyancy aid,

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.370
but like chambered
nautilus they have

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.350
air inside their shells, which
they use to keep them floating

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:19.850
under water.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.070
So it's a bit easier
for them to swim.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:26.815
And argonauts do
a similar thing.

00:37:26.815 --> 00:37:29.050
If he emptied all the
air out of their shells,

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:31.160
they all would swim straight
back to the surface,

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.335
gulping some air
into their shell,

00:37:32.335 --> 00:37:33.730
and then swim back
down until they

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:36.125
were neutrally buoyant at that
the depth they wanted to live.

00:37:36.125 --> 00:37:38.150
So it reduces their cost
of swimming by having

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.140
a bubble of air inside them.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.490
It's like an underwater
blimp, which is very cool.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:46.450
And leads me to my final thing
I wanted to tell you about,

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.440
which takes me back to
the title of the book.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.630
And also I wanted to tell you
a little bit about the art

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.500
work, which I absolutely love.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.256
And really just so pleased with
the way the book has come out

00:37:58.256 --> 00:37:59.350
and how it looks.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.960
And it will comes down to
this picture of an argonaut.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:08.137
It was around the time I was
writing the argonaut chapter

00:38:08.137 --> 00:38:10.220
that my publisher at
Bloomsbury said that I really

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.845
had to decide what I what I
was going to call the book,

00:38:12.845 --> 00:38:15.095
because we had come up with
another title, which early

00:38:15.095 --> 00:38:16.520
on we decided we didn't like.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.330
I was going to call it, "Snails,
Tears, and Thunderstones."

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.830
And then everyone said, I don't
know what thunderstones are,

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.685
and what's this thing
about snail's tears?

00:38:25.685 --> 00:38:27.060
I can explain
nature if you want.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.360
But anyway, we decided
that was no good.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.405
But I'm so obsessed
with argonauts when

00:38:31.405 --> 00:38:32.530
I was writing this chapter.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.520
And with all of the great
stuff that she discovered,

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.269
and all the silly stories.

00:38:38.269 --> 00:38:39.560
All I could see were argonauts.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.230
That was my view in life.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.467
So I wanted to call the book
"Flight of the Argonauts."

00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:46.550
Especially with this
discovery of how they use air

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.372
to help them swim under water.

00:38:49.372 --> 00:38:51.830
So I'm now hunting around online
for pictures of argonauts,

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.760
and I found this one.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.420
And it's by an illustrator
called Aaron Jean Gregory.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.625
And have a look at his websites.

00:39:00.625 --> 00:39:02.750
Not only did he sell tee
shirts with these on them,

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:04.730
which was really
cool, it turns out

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.950
that he's in a band
called Giant Squid.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.909
He lives in San Francisco,
and we got in touch.

00:39:09.909 --> 00:39:11.408
And he'd just been
on holiday to one

00:39:11.408 --> 00:39:12.820
of the islands
off of California,

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.580
and he found an argonaut
shell on the beach.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.020
We have to have this guy.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.900
He's a marine
biologist by training,

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.990
was retrained, has just
retraining as a fine artist.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:26.176
So he is as geeky as I am
about all the marine creatures.

00:39:26.176 --> 00:39:28.800
I was like, we have to have him
to do the front cover art work.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.454
Because we were
also looking for who

00:39:30.454 --> 00:39:32.620
we wanted to work with on
that, as well as the title

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.283
of the book at this time.

00:39:34.283 --> 00:39:36.338
So we got in touch
with him, and I'm

00:39:36.338 --> 00:39:38.230
really pleased that
he agreed immediately

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.232
to work with us,
which is fantastic.

00:39:40.232 --> 00:39:42.815
And I don't think he quite knew
what he was letting himself in

00:39:42.815 --> 00:39:45.330
for, because we were still
undecided about the title.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.200
And I was still pushing for
"Flight of the Argonauts."

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.350
So we were like, go and
do us some argonauts.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:51.800
So he does some sketches.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.010
I'm going to show you some of
the sketches that he sent us.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.640
As unseen before.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.510
Anyway, apart from
being my publisher.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.587
So first of all, he gave us
some tentacly argonauty ones.

00:40:04.587 --> 00:40:05.670
And I think they're great.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.423
And I was really just so keen to
have "Flight of the Argonauts,"

00:40:08.423 --> 00:40:10.760
and argonauts on
the front cover.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.260
But no.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.220
We decided that no one
would think that-- it

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.470
wasn't a book about argonauts.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.640
Just a bit of it.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.800
So we had to [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.620
Think of a different title.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.249
And it was literally coming
down to the last minute of like,

00:40:22.249 --> 00:40:23.790
can I just have
another day to decide

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:24.860
what the title is going to be?

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.270
And I kept on coming up with
ideas that weren't working.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.359
And then went to a
holiday to Devon.

00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:31.525
And spent a few days mucking
around on the seashore.

00:40:31.525 --> 00:40:33.790
And finding shells and
having a nice time.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.819
And then "Spirals in
Time" just popped up,

00:40:35.819 --> 00:40:36.860
and I thought that'll do.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.360
And everyone else
seemed to like it.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.740
So we stuck with
"Spirals in Time."

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.730
And that actually
meant for the cover

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.200
that we then had a whole free
reign of what we could put

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.550
on the front cover of the book.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.715
I should say that I
really appreciated

00:40:49.715 --> 00:40:52.844
having a chance to be involved
in designing the front cover.

00:40:52.844 --> 00:40:54.635
Authors don't always
have that opportunity.

00:40:54.635 --> 00:40:57.410
For my first book, I was
just told, here's your cover.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:00.580
Whereas Bloomsbury were
keen to have me involved.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:05.530
It's been really fun to be
a part of the way it looks,

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.020
as well as the words inside.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.502
So I told Aaron--
so the two things

00:41:09.502 --> 00:41:10.960
I wanted to have
on the front cover

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.270
were lots of different
species of mollusks.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.580
I wanted to try and capture
this idea of them being

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.130
this incredibly diverse group.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.170
And I also want
them to be alive.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.930
One thing again, that I really
want to do with the book

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.825
is to show people
that shells aren't

00:41:23.825 --> 00:41:27.684
just these boring dead things
that sit around doing nothing.

00:41:27.684 --> 00:41:29.684
They come from these
incredible living creatures

00:41:29.684 --> 00:41:31.620
that live extraordinary lives.

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:35.500
So I wanted living, diverse
mollusks all over the cover.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.460
So the first sketch he
came up with was this.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.196
[INAUDIBLE] just make that out.

00:41:41.196 --> 00:41:43.470
There were loads and
loads of mollusks.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.770
But Jim Martin [INAUDIBLE]
was like, nope.

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.200
Too many mollusks.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.530
Cut it down.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.640
Too confusing.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.210
How about a spiral of mollusks?

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.662
The title is "Spiral in Time,"
so we could have a spiral.

00:41:53.662 --> 00:41:54.546
Brilliant idea!

00:41:54.546 --> 00:41:57.260
So we said go do us a spiral.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.547
So Aaron did us a couple
of spiral sketches.

00:41:59.547 --> 00:42:02.130
Do you want it down page, or do
you want it coming out at you?

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.802
Of course, I wanted
it coming out at me.

00:42:04.802 --> 00:42:06.765
He then said that's really pale.

00:42:06.765 --> 00:42:08.840
But we basically said,
yeah, a big spiral,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.710
going across both covers.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.889
He pencil sketched.

00:42:12.889 --> 00:42:14.430
This, for me, was
really interesting,

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.290
because I don't know how art is
done these days, but apparently

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:21.130
what he did was he painted these
in with ink and paint brush,

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:22.170
by hand.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.560
And then he colored
it in on a computer.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.020
So he used a tablet to do all
the coloring in, afterwards.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.420
After scanning in the inks.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.280
And then he came up
with some color options.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.480
And we decided
which one we wanted.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.370
And ultimately, that was what
we went for, and I just love it.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.630
I think it's brilliant.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.900
Some of the other
things he did--

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.370
he did this illustration at
the beginning of each chapter.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:47.130
So I just wanted
to show you those.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.910
I would say, OK, the
chapter about cone snails,

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.700
we want a nice, active
cone snail catching a fish.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.936
And then he inked
those in as well.

00:42:55.936 --> 00:42:57.990
The chapter about
sea butterflies,

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.850
these beautiful sea snails,
that microscopic animals

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.870
that fly through the open ocean.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:04.050
A whole chapter about those.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:08.392
So he did us a beautiful
image of sea butterflies.

00:43:08.392 --> 00:43:09.970
And then ammonites.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:11.970
Actually, that's the
chapter with the argonauts.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:14.810
And I talk also about the
ancient extinct mollusks.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.513
And this is parpuzosia,
the biggest ammonite that

00:43:17.513 --> 00:43:18.870
grew to three meters across.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:22.010
And the little shark there
is to give you scale.

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.300
So just some beautiful images.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.060
And then finally, I'm really
pleased that the book-- if you

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:30.950
get the hard back, and if you
do grab a copy, the end plates.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.080
I wanted this for my first
book, but they said no.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.450
But I really want to
have beautiful sails

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:36.840
on the beginning and the end.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.470
So I said, we wanted
wentletrap snails

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:40.780
because they've got these
incredible complex shells.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.650
So Aaron did this little sketch.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.540
And then that's
what it looks like.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:48.540
So if you do have a-- grab
a copy of the hard back,

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.990
you have snails, about life
size, falling over the front

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:55.380
and back cover.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.580
So there you go.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.380
Thank you very much.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.730
[APPLAUSE]
