00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.350
As we take our grand tour of the solar system
here on Crash Course Astronomy, we’re going

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.540
to skip over the asteroids for now—we’ll
get to ‘em, I promise—and instead pay

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.929
a visit to the King of the Planets, the big
guy, the top dog, the big cheese, the head

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.129
honcho, the one and only: Jupiter.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.080
Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar
system. It’s not even close: All the other

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.089
planets could fit inside it with room to spare.
It’s a gas giant, which means it’s gassy,

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.860
and... giant.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.700
And I do mean giant. It’s 11 times wider
than Earth—more than a thousand Earths could

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.350
fit inside it, and it has a mass over 300
times that of our planet. Despite its bulk,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.949
it rotates extremely rapidly: One day on Jupiter
is a mere 10 hours long! That’s the fastest

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.350
spin of any of the planets in the solar system.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.920
Not surprisingly, a planet that big can reflect
a lot of sunlight, and even though it orbits

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.909
the Sun on average at a distance of about
800 million kilometers, it’s one of the

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.640
brightest objects in the night sky.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.620
With binoculars or a small telescope, Jupiter
is a wonder. You can easily see it as a disk,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.650
and its four biggest moons are readily visible—if
they weren’t hidden by the planet’s glare,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.530
they’d be naked eye objects. Galileo himself
discovered those moons.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.300
They’re worlds in their own
right, and so we’ll dive into

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.610
them—literally—in the next episode.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.650
When we look at Jupiter we’re not seeing
its surface. We’re seeing the tops of its

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.200
clouds, and they’re a strange mix of permanence
and change. The atmosphere of Jupiter is banded,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.770
with multiple stripes running parallel to
its equator. The lighter-colored stripes are

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.440
called zones, and the darker ones belts. They’re
fairly stable, though their shape and coloring

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.680
change over time.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.200
Belts and zones circulate around the planet
in opposite directions. They form due to convection

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.940
in Jupiter’s atmosphere. Upwelling air cools
and forms white ammonia clouds; that creates

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.460
the light colored zones. That air flows to
the sides and sinks, and sunlight changes

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.300
the chemistry in the clouds forming molecules
that color the air yellow, red, and brown.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.360
This is what causes the darker belts.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.410
In May of 2010, one of Jupiter’s biggest
belts sank so deeply it disappeared from view

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.890
completely, covered by other clouds! Then,
a few months later, it popped back up and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.840
reappeared, none the worse for wear. This
has happened several times in the past, too.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.890
I saw one of these events once through a telescope,
and Jupiter looked really weird. Lopsided.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.530
Turbulence in the regions between zones and
belts can create storms, gigantic vortices

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.340
raging in the clouds. Dozens of them dot the
face of Jupiter all the time, but there is

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.599
one to rule them all: the Great Red Spot,
a fittingly huge storm for a giant planet.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.599
It’s actually a colossal hurricane, several
times larger than our entire planet Earth,

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.939
with sustained wind speeds of 500 kph. And
it’s old; it was first seen in the late

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.950
17th century—imagine a storm on Earth lasting
for more than three centuries! And it may

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.709
be far older; the 1600s is just when we first…
spotted it.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.209
So, why is it so stable? It turns out that
a vortex, a local spinning region in a fluid,

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.319
can persist if the fluid in which it’s embedded
is itself rotating. Jupiter’s rapid spin

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.290
is what keeps the Red Spot circulating! And
the redness is probably due to cyanide-like

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.859
molecules that absorb blue light, letting
redder light pass through.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.969
Weirdly, the Red Spot appears to be shrinking!
It was substantially bigger and more elongated

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.999
just a few decades ago. It changes color over
time, too, having gone from deep red to salmon

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:28.450
and then back again. No one knows why its
shape, size, and color change, but given how

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.370
long the Spot’s been around, I doubt it’s
going to evaporate any time soon.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.610
Remember, we’re only seeing the tops of
the clouds on Jupiter. Its atmosphere is thick,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.680
several hundred kilometers deep! Like the
composition of the Sun, the air on Jupiter

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.680
is mostly hydrogen and helium, but it’s
also laced with ammonia, methane, and other

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.719
poisonous gases.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.669
As you dive into Jupiter’s atmosphere, the
pressure increases with depth. But you’ll

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.959
never reach the surface; the planet doesn’t
really have a proper surface. The gas gets

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.579
thicker and hotter, and eventually just sort
of smoothly changes into a liquid over a several

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.479
hundred km range below the clouds.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.240
Below that is where things get really weird.
Instead of a mantle, like terrestrial planets,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.360
Jupiter has a huge region made up of liquid
metallic hydrogen. We think of hydrogen as

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.849
being a gas, or, if it gets really cold, a
liquid. But under the ridiculous pressures

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.799
generated deep inside Jupiter, hydrogen undergoes
this strange transformation. Individual atoms

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.389
don’t hold on to their electrons, but instead
share them. This means the hydrogen can conduct

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.960
electricity, and has other properties more
like a metal. This substance is hot, too:

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.120
about 10,000° C, hotter than the surface
of the Sun! If we could see it, it would glow

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.560
tremendously bright.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.160
Finally, at its center is most likely a dense
core of material, probably composed of rock

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.879
and metal. We really don’t know, because
it’s incredibly difficult to understand

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.910
the physics and chemistry of material locked
in at those pressures and temperatures. What’s

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.199
weirder is that we’re not even sure if Jupiter
has a core! If it did, it’s possible it

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.820
was eroded away by currents of hot metallic
hydrogen early on in Jupiter’s formation process.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.940
It’s also possible it never had a core in
the first place.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.310
The solar system formed from a flat disk of
gas and dust. The center of this disk is where

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.819
the Sun was born, and it’s thought that
the planets formed as smaller particles of

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.990
material stuck together during random collisions
farther out in the disk. As they got bigger—much

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.990
bigger—these protoplanets eventually started
to grow even faster by drawing in material

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.780
around them due to their gravity.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.800
Jupiter formed where the disk was thick, rich
with material. It’s possible that several

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.860
large protoplanets were forming, collided,
and stuck together to really kickstart Jupiter’s

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.979
growth. If that were the case, it started
out with a rocky metallic core, and once it

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.559
got big enough it drew in that gas that made
it the giant we see today.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.200
Another idea is that Jupiter didn’t grow
from the bottom up, but from the top down:

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.750
The disk itself collapsed in several places
to form huge, distended clumps. These then

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.729
would have collided, stuck, and created the
planet. If that’s the case, then Jupiter

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.310
might not have a core at all.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.370
These two different mechanisms make different
predictions about Jupiter’s structure, and

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.710
that means that, hopefully, we can eventually
figure out which is correct by studying Jupiter

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.270
more carefully. But at the moment we still
don’t know.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.240
Either way, Jupiter grew immense, and it’s
mostly liquid under all that atmosphere. Couple

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.620
that with its rapid rotation, and you can
see it’s noticeably flattened! It’s wider

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.460
at the equator than through the poles by about
6% due to centrifugal force.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.659
So, Jupiter is a big bruiser of a planet.
But how close was it to becoming a star?

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.729
Sometimes, people ask me if Jupiter is a “failed
star”; in other words, as it formed it almost

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.949
got massive enough that nuclear fusion could
start in its center, turning it into a star.

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.879
I see this a lot on TV shows and in articles,
and it really burns me up.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.590
When a star forms, hydrogen fusion starts
when the star gathers so much mass that its

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.830
gravity can compress atoms together in its
core hard enough to get them to fuse. This

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.240
happens when a star has roughly 1/12th of
the Sun’s mass. In fact, the smallest stars

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.389
we see do have about that mass.

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.069
What about Jupiter? The mass of Jupiter is
about 1/1000th the mass of the Sun, far too

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:01.300
little to undergo fusion in its core. If you
want to turn Jupiter into a star, you’d

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.569
have a lot of work ahead of you: You’d have
to take Jupiter… and then add about 80 more

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:06.789
Jupiters to it!

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:11.650
Saying Jupiter is a failed star is really
unfair. It’s not a failed star. It’s a

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.189
really successful planet.

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:17.659
Even though Jupiter isn’t a star, it does
have another funny property: It emits more

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:19.620
heat than it receives from the Sun.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.870
The Earth and other terrestrial, rocky planets
are in a heat balance with the Sun; we emit

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.770
pretty much the same amount of heat that we
receive. But Jupiter is different. After it

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.819
formed, it started to cool by radiating away
heat from its upper atmosphere. A large fraction

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:37.550
of the planet is gas, remember, and when you
cool a gas in contracts. So the atmosphere

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.389
cools and contracts, but this increases the
pressure inside the planet, so it heats up!

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:48.080
That heat works its way out of Jupiter, and
gets radiated away as infrared light. In the

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.229
end, the amount of heat Jupiter gives off
is more than it receives from the Sun. It’s

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:56.879
still actively cooling, 4.5 billion years
after it formed! Oh and hey, remember the

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:01.310
belts and zones, the stripes we see in Jupiter’s
atmosphere, and all the storms that pop up?

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.360
Those are driven in large part by Jupiter’s
internal heat. On Earth our weather is powered

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.440
by heat from the Sun, but on Jupiter they
get their energy from the planet itself!

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.820
Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field,
no doubt due to all of that metallic hydrogen

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.370
inside it coupled with its rapid rotation.
Like Earth it has aurorae at its poles as

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.999
the solar wind is funneled down to the cloud
tops. As we’ll see next week, Jupiter’s

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:25.180
moons affect the magnetic field and aurorae
on Jupiter as well.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.699
Jupiter also has a ring, though it’s not
nearly as grand as Saturn’s. It wasn’t

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:32.729
even discovered until we sent space probes
to the planet. The ring is made of dust, probably

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:36.849
thrown into orbit around the planet due to
meteorite impacts on its smaller moons.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:41.039
Speaking of impacts, we know that Earth gets
hit by interplanetary debris all the time:

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.600
Go outside for an hour and you’re bound
to see a few meteors. Jupiter, being larger

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:51.600
and with more gravity, gets hit a lot more.
A lot. A lot more. And sometimes it gets hellaciously

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:57.930
whacked. In 1994, the comet Shoemaker-Levy
9 impacted Jupiter. Multiple times: Jupiter’s

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.630
fierce gravitational tides had ripped the
comet into dozens of pieces, and each slammed

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.649
into the planet one after the other with the
force of millions of nuclear weapons. The

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:12.809
scars left in the upper atmosphere from the plumes
of material that exploded outward lasted for months.

00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:16.120
Several smaller impacts have been seen in
Jupiter’s atmosphere since then, and it

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.779
may suffer an impact large enough to see from
Earth every year or so.

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:25.139
And while that sounds scary, it might actually
be our savior. There’s an idea that Jupiter’s

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.519
gravity tends to take comets that fall toward
the inner solar system and fling them away

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:33.910
into interstellar space. Over the eons, this
has cleaned out a lot of otherwise dangerous

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.260
objects that could have eventually hit Earth.
On the other hand, Jupiter has a tendency

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.800
to warp the orbits of some other comets so
that they do swing by the Earth. It’s hard

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.790
to say if Jupiter’s influence is a net benefit
or not.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:50.589
But either way, it’s clearly the 2 septillion
ton gorilla in the solar system.

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:54.600
Today you learned that Jupiter is really,
really big. It’s the biggest planet in our

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.910
solar system, a gas giant. It has a dynamic
atmosphere, including belts and zones, and

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.949
a gigantic red spot that’s actually a persistent
hurricane. Jupiter is still warm from its

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:09.079
formation, and has an interior that’s mostly
metallic hydrogen, and it may not even have

00:10:09.079 --> 00:10:14.079
a core. It has the fastest spin of any planet,
and it’s not a failed star.
