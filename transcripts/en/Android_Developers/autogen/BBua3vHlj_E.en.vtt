00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229
controller within our game so let's run
 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.670
controller within our game so let's run
this and see what happens alright so I'm

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680
this and see what happens alright so I'm
 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.710
this and see what happens alright so I'm
signed in I've got this achievements

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720
signed in I've got this achievements
 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.580
signed in I've got this achievements
button I'm going to click it and I get

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590
button I'm going to click it and I get
 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.290
button I'm going to click it and I get
this lovely achievements view controller

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300
this lovely achievements view controller
 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.379
this lovely achievements view controller
which is empty and that's because we

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389
which is empty and that's because we
 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.909
which is empty and that's because we
haven't defined any achievements for our

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919
haven't defined any achievements for our
 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.060
haven't defined any achievements for our
game so I suppose this is correct I

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070
game so I suppose this is correct I
 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.730
game so I suppose this is correct I
click the done button it calls my

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740
click the done button it calls my
 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.320
click the done button it calls my
delegate method which dismisses that

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330
delegate method which dismisses that
 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.680
delegate method which dismisses that
view controller and there you go we can

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690
view controller and there you go we can
 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.000
view controller and there you go we can
now view our achievements within the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010
now view our achievements within the
 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.279
now view our achievements within the
game so maybe the next step would

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289
game so maybe the next step would
 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.990
game so maybe the next step would
actually be to create some achievements

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000
actually be to create some achievements
 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.330
actually be to create some achievements
and we can do that developer console and

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340
and we can do that developer console and
 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:29.690
and we can do that developer console and
so we'll tackle that in the next lesson

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700
 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.920
the fire

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930
the fire
 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.990
the fire
Oh
