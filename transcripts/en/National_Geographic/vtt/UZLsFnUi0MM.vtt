00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.233
NARRATOR: Finally,
the [inaudible] leader

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:04.100
agrees to talk.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.767
[non-english speech].

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.266
He is speaking on
behalf of everyone.

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.333
He says, yeah, I'm a pastor.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.834
I'm a leader.
I'm a Christian.

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:14.967
I'm a father.

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:16.467
But this belief is
part of my life.

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.700
And I can't just take it out.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.400
It's part of me.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.433
How can I extract it?

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.834
[non-english speech].

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.800
INTERPRETER: People
admit themselves and say,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.700
we have [non-english].

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.367
But it does have to do--

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:31.667
But people confess.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:32.834
INTERPRETER: Yeah, they
admit to having it.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:33.567
Huh.

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:38.934
It escapes me why
they would do that.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.800
So people do confess.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.567
And sometimes they'll
say, it wasn't me.

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:44.867
It was the one from over there
or the one from over there.

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.700
And they'll tell us, and we have
no idea, so we just believe it.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.133
It's a good [non-english]
and bad [non-english].

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.834
[non-english speech].

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:56.834
One is good thinking.

00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:57.967
[non-english speech].

00:00:57.967 --> 00:00:59.333
And the other
one is dangerous.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.667
Oh, [non-english].

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.734
This is [inaudible],
one of our accused.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:04.166
Hello.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.567
INTERPRETER: Her
mother was murdered.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:06.200
She's accused.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.467
Her son is accused.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.800
So they're all within
the same family.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.266
So he believes that she
has this [non-english]

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.734
spirit inside her.

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.700
[non-english speech].

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.800
So he said, how would we
know if she has [non-english]?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.700
It's a spirit.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.000
You can't see a spirit.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.300
We've been told by
people who would

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.767
know because they're
also [non-english].

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:23.967
[inaudible] has it.

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:24.867
So we believe it.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:26.066
[non-english speech].

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.300
INTERPRETER: I was
going to kill her,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.633
but then she said
she didn't have it.

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:29.600
It wasn't her.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.834
But then the others
turned around

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:34.100
and said, no, it was her, so.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.367
[non-english speech].

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:37.967
So I asked him,
in your own life,

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:41.400
your wife was accused of being
a [non-english] and murdered.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.066
Now, do you think--
- She was murdered.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.633
His wife was murdered.

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:47.934
INTERPRETER: So do you think
that she was correctly accused?

00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:50.767
[non-english speech].

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:53.066
There's is no way that
my wife was [non-english].

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:54.467
I don't accept that.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.834
Her family, my family,
and I myself and I believe

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:59.166
she was not [non-english].

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:02.867
And it was completely
falsified accusation.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.500
[non-english speech].

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.033
INTERPRETER: But they
killed her anyway.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:10.166
But when there's
a bad [non-english],

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.867
do people believe it is
OK to then kill them?

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:14.834
You have to kill them?

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.166
It's OK to kill them?

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.800
Is it the right thing to do?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.834
We must kill them then.

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:21.333
We must kill them then.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.100
NARRATOR: This man, this
priest, whose own wife

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.333
was falsely accused,
still believes

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.400
that witches must be punished.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.600
In so many ways
this tells me how

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.100
deep and intractable the belief
in [non-english] is here.
