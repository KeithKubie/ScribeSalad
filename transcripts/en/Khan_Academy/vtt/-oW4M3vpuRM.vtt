00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.470
In the last set of videos, we've
hopefully familiarized

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.250
ourselves with the different
ways that a

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.630
company can raise capital.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.140
It can do it through
debt or equity.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.030
And we learned that debt
securities are

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.200
often called bonds.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.470
And equity securities you're
probably familiar with.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.610
Those are stocks.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.620
And then I left you with
a cliffhanger.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.470
Let draw it so I don't
get ahead of myself.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.570
So these are the assets of a
company and it was able to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.430
generate these assets.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.020
So there's a couple of ways
you can generate assets.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.270
You can get investors through
equity, and we've done several

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.040
videos on that.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.810
You start with the angel
investors, or maybe your rich

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.750
uncle, and then eventually get
venture capitalists, and you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.320
do an initial public offering.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.760
And then you can do follow-on
offerings.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.380
And so on and so forth.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.380
Now we see governments will buy
equity in you if you are a

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.880
bank that's too big to fail.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.420
But we'll do a whole
playlist on that.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.350
So equity.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.270
That's one way that you can
get cash or get capital so

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.560
that you can buy assets
to run your business.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.030
The other way is you can borrow
money from people.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.820
So the equity holders
are actually the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.790
owners of the company.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.230
So you might have been part of
the equity holder, and you

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.260
have to sell some of the equity,
or sell some shares in

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.090
your company for someone
else to give money.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.820
Then they become kind of
like your partner.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.910
And the other way is you
could borrow money.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.290
Let me draw that.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.070
That we'll just put generally
as liability.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.990
Debt isn't the only kind of
liability, but that's a pretty

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.430
reasonable simplification
for now.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.220
There's other things.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.930
In general, liability means you
owe something to somebody

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.180
in the future.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.760
So these are liabilities.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.970
And we'll assume right
now that your debt

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.070
is your main liability.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.550
You might have other
liabilities.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.760
You might have some type of
legal liability, where someone

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.190
is suing you or you had sprayed
asbestos on a bunch of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.920
playgrounds, thinking that it
was actually good for the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.770
playground equipment and now
there's all of this liability

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.670
because, well, you
get the idea.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.610
But from now on we'll have the
simplification that debt is

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.270
your liability.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.150
And we said there's different
kinds of debt.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.410
If you securitize it,
it's often a bond.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.690
Right?

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.860
That would be a certificate
that's an IOU from a company.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.940
It'll pay you coupons or
interest and so forth.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.789
Or you can also just get regular
bank debt, where you

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.320
owe the bank money.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.510
And I left you with a question
the last time around.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.460
I said, let's say this company
goes into bankruptcy.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.440
And let's say that these assets
aren't worth what we

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.170
think they are, right?

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.250
In this world, if we just
have to sell off

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.730
these assets, fine.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.440
The debt guys would
get paid off.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.400
And the equity guys would get
left over with whatever else.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.410
So let's say if this
was on our books.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.140
Whenever you hear things like
book value, and I've done a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.670
couple of videos on book value
versus market value, but the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.930
book value is essentially
what you have on

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.680
your accounting books.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.570
You say that this is
worth $10 million.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.800
Right?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.010
Let's say we've bought land
and factories and whatever

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.160
else worth $10 million.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160
Let's say your debt
is $6 million.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.360
Then your equity would
be worth $4 million.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.780
And let's say, for whatever
reason, the economy turns

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.580
south or maybe this was some
type of business that's now

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.410
not viable.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.040
So it's going to go
into bankruptcy.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.770
And I'll get a little bit more
specific on the different

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.650
types of bankruptcy.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.220
But we're assuming
liquidation.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.760
Actually I'll just get
specific right now.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.080
So when we say bankruptcy,
bankruptcy is

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.130
a very common word.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.050
I think most people have a
general sense what it means.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.970
They know it's bad and it means
to some degree that a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.510
company can't operate
as it was before.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.420
But there's a lot of confusion
over what it means.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.940
There's actually two types
of bankruptcy.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.190
There's liquidation.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.780
And that's essentially saying
that, you know what, this

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.580
business doesn't
make any sense.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.290
It doesn't make sense
to have the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.350
employees and run the factories.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.840
You're never going to make any
money, so you might as well

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.550
just sell everything you have.
You liquidate it all.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.310
That's one type.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.810
And that falls under the
category of Chapter 7.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.620
And we're just talking
about corporate

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.730
bankruptcy right now.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.250
There's also personal
bankruptcy.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.825
And maybe we'll do a couple
of videos on that.

00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:04.200
It might be especially relevant
in this economy.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.090
Well, the other type is
reorganization or

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.340
restructuring.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.990
And restructuring says,
you know what?

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.459
This factory here,
it's actually

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.610
making something useful.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.430
It's actually generating
money.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.430
And actually we can get more
value for what we have here if

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.600
we keep it running.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.890
And we will just keep it
running, and we'll restructure

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.610
the company.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.190
And usually that means changing
this side of it.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.130
So maybe we'll cancel some
debt and all of that.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.080
And I'll show you how that's
done in a reasonably fair way.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.400
But just to understand kind of
a simplified scenario, let's

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.120
take liquidation into
consideration.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.480
So let's say that this was my
website selling shoes online,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.710
and that all of a sudden
people have

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.880
stopped wearing shoes.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.060
It's just gone out of fashion,
so it makes no sense anymore

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.110
to sell shoes online.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.320
So I'm just going to liquidate
my assets, my real estate that

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.270
I might have, my warehouses,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.160
My question that I left you with
in the last video was,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.570
who gets it?

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.470
So let's say when we liquidate
it-- so we go into bankruptcy

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.690
and essentially all of the
assets are taken into

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.260
possession by the bankruptcy
court-- they're going to sell

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.820
these assets.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.460
And let's say when they sell
them, they don't get $10

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.790
million for these assets.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.590
They only get $5 million
for them.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.250
Right?

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.390
I paid for them thinking that
they were useful in some way,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.540
but they end up not to
be, so my assets--

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.430
You know what, I just realized
when I talked earlier about

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.170
there's two ways to raise
capital, there's a third way

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.700
to raise capial.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.930
Right?

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.580
You can sell shares.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.350
You can issue debt.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.380
You can borrow money.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.480
Obviously the third way is
actually just make money.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.900
Right?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.810
Once you start a company,
hopefully you generate

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.590
earnings, and that'll also
generate cash or capital that

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.790
you can reinvest in
the business.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.640
And we'll talk about that.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.640
But I just wanted to make it
clear that that's obviously

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.250
the best way to generate capital
for your business is

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.520
when the business itself
generates capital.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.180
So let's say that these assets,
when you actually sell

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.760
them off, aren't worth
$10 million anymore.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.340
Let me make the pointer
smaller.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.730
They're worth $5 million.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.320
So my question in the
last video is, who

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.750
gets this $5 million?

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.670
Do you somehow split it evenly
between all of these people?

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.000
Or does one of them get more
of it, or one of them gets

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
less of it?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.890
And I think you'll get a sense
based on where I took the $5

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.680
million out of, who
gets the money.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.630
It's the debt holders.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.100
And the way I drew it right
here, you can kind of view it

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.760
as you go up in this
direction, you're

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.010
getting more senior.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.850
Or if you're going down
in this way, you're

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.110
getting more junior.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.750
And seniority, when you talk
about a company's capital

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.760
structure, is just, you know
what, if there's anything

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.860
left, who gets their
money first?

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.160
And even within the
debt, you'll have

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.280
different layers of debt.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.520
There might be different debt
holders who have different

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.030
levels of seniority.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.950
So this one might be called
senior secured debt.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.370
Senior means they're high
up on the stack.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.080
They are one of the first people
to get their money.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.590
And secured means there's
actually some collateral on

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.170
the asset side that they get
if the company can't pay.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.060
So maybe this is like
a piece of land.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.490
Right?

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.240
So just in kind of our everyday
personal finance

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.150
world, your mortgage is
actually secured debt.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.990
It's secured by the collateral
of your home.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.830
If you can't pay the debt,
the bank comes

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.470
and takes your home.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.040
It forecloses on the property.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.320
So that's what secured means.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.540
It means that there's some
collateral, and in the event

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.750
of a bankruptcy this guy can
immediately go and get the

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.620
collateral that his debt
is secured by.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.310
So this is considered a very,
very senior form of debt.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.620
Senior secured.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.960
Then you might have here, you
might have senior unsecured.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.070
And there's a lot of words
around, senior, junior,

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.110
subordinate, and all of that.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.470
But just to get a sense that
there's just a hierarchy here.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.620
Some people are the first people
to get the money, and

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.440
then whatever money is left goes
to this person, then if

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.460
there's any money left, it goes
to this person, and then

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.630
if there's anything left
it goes to this person.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.460
And once you're in bankruptcy
court it does tend to be a

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.163
negotiation between the
different, you can almost view

00:08:15.163 --> 00:08:16.120
it as buckets, of debt.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.010
And we'll do a more complicated
example in the

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.590
future on that.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.760
We'll actually delve into the
details of bankruptcy.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.170
But this is the general
notion.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.760
That the senior guys get made
whole first, then the more

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.420
junior guys get whatever's left,
and so on and so forth.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.990
And if there's no money for the
equity, there's no money

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.679
for the equity.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.610
And that makes sense, right?

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.400
Because the debt holders, all
they were getting-- their

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.070
upside was just interest,
right?

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.640
So they also should get limited
downside in the event

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.980
things should turn bad.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.500
Equity holders, they kind
of took a gamble.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.000
If things were great, they would
get all of the upside.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.770
And now that things turn
bad, they take

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.500
a lot of the downside.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.350
And they're actually lucky that
they don't owe money.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.730
That's actually the-- I guess
you could call it-- the beauty

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.060
of a corporate structure, that
you have limited liability.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.640
In some times in history, these
people would actually

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.770
owe the difference.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.730
They would actually owe
this extra $1 million.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.150
They would all go to debtor's
prison and all that.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.670
But we'll talk more about
it in the future.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.190
So anyway, just going back on
the different tranches of

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.730
debt, or buckets of debt.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.840
So we could call this
senior unsecured.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.380
And that means that they're
still senior.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.780
They're still fairly high
up the seniority ladder.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.440
But they're unsecured.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.680
There's no particular assets
that they can go run.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.190
But as long as there's enough
for them, they'll get it.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.190
So let me put some
numbers here.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.390
So let's say there was, I don't
know, $1 million of

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.750
senior secured.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.570
Let's say there's $2 million
of senior unsecured.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:40.930
And let's say that this is $2
million of subordinated--

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:41.870
subordinated just means they're

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.330
not senior-- unsecured.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.780
So in this reality, what would
happen is the bankruptcy court

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.780
would liquidate all this stuff
and then they'll hand it out

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.620
in order of seniority.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.620
These guys get their
$1 million back.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.980
So they're made whole.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.000
And they probably charged a
lower interest rate, because

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.680
they didn't perceive their risk
that high to begin with.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.290
These guys, right here, the
senior unsecured, they'll get

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.300
the next $2 million.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.980
And then there's $1
million left.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.490
Right?

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.700
And that $1 million will go
to the subordinated debt.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.870
So they'll get 50% of
their money back.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.120
So they took a little bit of a
hit, but that's OK because

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.300
when things were good, they
probably got higher interest

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.650
to compensate them
for their risk.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.810
Usually as you get more and more
junior and you take on

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.630
more risk, you get more upside,
or more interest. And

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.930
in this case the equity
holders get nothing.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.790
They get wiped out.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:33.860
So it just goes to 0.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.190
So that's the answer
to the question.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.360
I said, who gets the money?

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.430
Well, it's the debt holders
get first dibs.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:45.720
And if there was actually $7
million here instead of $5

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.820
million, then you would have
paid the six off completely,

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.810
and then the equity holders
would've gotten $1 million.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.580
And so they would have gotten
something if there was enough

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.840
money to hand it to them.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.950
Anyway, in the next video I'll
cover-- this was liquidation,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.420
where we just say this
isn't worth running.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.440
Let's just give it all away, or
let's sell it, and give it

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.675
back to our creditors.

00:11:09.675 --> 00:11:12.430
In the next video I'll talk
about reorganization, where we

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.190
say, hey, you know what?

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.480
This business is a
good business.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.110
It just has too many
liabilities.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.870
See you in the next video.
