[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.670
EMMET O'NEILL: StoryToys
is a creator and publisher

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.160
of children's app content.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.610
We make everything from original
IP to classic fairy tale books,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.651
right all the way through
to licensed content.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.150
GAVIN BARRETT: What we do is
we combine a reading experience

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.070
with interactive scenes.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.270
It's a nice combination
of an educational reading

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.720
experience with a
slightly gamified

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.100
interactive experience.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.350
So they don't so much interrupt
the reading experience

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.397
as draw the child in, make them
feel part of the narrative.

00:00:34.397 --> 00:00:36.230
EMMET O'NEILL: One of
the biggest challenges

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.180
of working in the
children's app space

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.950
is that you have two audiences.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.864
First you have the children, but
you also have to sell the app.

00:00:44.864 --> 00:00:46.780
We have to try and create
an experience that's

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.515
both appealing, but also to the
parent represents good value,

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:53.229
has sound educational
values, effectively something

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.520
that the parent can feel good
about letting their child

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.165
interact with.

00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:59.790
GAVIN BARRETT: Since the launch
of the Family section on Google

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.320
Play, our experience
with Android

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.030
has been completely transformed.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.450
We saw a huge uplift in
revenues and our downloads, too.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.460
Google Play was now
our number one channel.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.390
It's been nothing but
positive for StoryToys,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.190
and we're delighted
to be involved.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.356
EMMET O'NEILL: The Family
section on the Google Play

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:18.260
Store has really provided a
safe, trusted creative space

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.730
for families to
find new content.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.960
Android is fantastic for rapid
iteration and prototyping,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.560
absolutely hands-down the best.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.540
You can beta test on the store.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.510
I think we've got
fantastic opportunities

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.360
to do that with a much
wider audience, too.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.800
GAVIN BARRETT: The Play
Store delivers global reach.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.740
As a distribution
channel, it's unrivalled.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.760
Google Play allows you to
customize pricing per market.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.830
That's an extremely
powerful tool.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.840
You can then use the
translation services

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.390
on Google Play, an
extremely efficient way

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.460
to get all the content in
your app translated quickly.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.140
EMMET O'NEILL: Google Play
has allowed My Very Hungry

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.450
Caterpillar to reach some
pretty staggering numbers.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.610
We found that kids playing
with the app, in general,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.510
have engaged with it
between 80 and 120 minutes.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.740
We've found that kids
cumulatively have made more

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.320
than a million butterflies.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.780
And they've fed the
Very Hungry Caterpillar

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.770
more than a quarter of a billion
pieces of fruit within the app.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.228
GAVIN BARRETT:
We're really excited

00:02:16.228 --> 00:02:18.280
about the next few
years for StoryToys,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.985
and particularly focusing on
education and the opportunities

00:02:20.985 --> 00:02:23.110
that lie there.
