I was working in New York City
as a photo editor

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:07.540 line:0%
sitting at my computer all day
looking at stories coming in.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:11.511 line:0%
And I always dreamed of becoming
a foreign correspondent.

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:15.882
And I got the courage
to quit my job

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.017
and move to the Czech Republic,

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:22.755
where I got a job working
for a small business paper.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:25.958
<i> And in that time,
 in that next year</i>

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:29.829
<i>the war in Kosovo was starting,
 it was in my backyard.</i>

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.066
<i>And suddenly went from being a
relatively amateur photographer</i>

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.336
<i> working at a business
 newspaper to</i>

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:40.073
<i> overnight becoming a
 war photographer.</i>

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.777
And as I dove into my career,
I did the classic thing,

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.611
I think a lot of
photographers do.

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:47.247
We want to make a difference,

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.982
we want to tell
powerful stories.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.551
So, you know,
what do you do?

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:55.789
<i> You go the most
 dangerous, difficult,</i>

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.224
<i>toughest places on the planet,
 and I did that.</i>

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.628
<i>And I was 26 when I started,
 and I went to</i>

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:04.129
<i> conflict zones all
 over the world,</i>

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.431
<i> because I wanted to
 make a difference.</i>

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.202
<i>And I think we're automatically
 taught to believe that</i>

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:13.072
those powerful stories are
the ones that are driven

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.875
in angst and death
and suffering.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.045
And I don't ever want to

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:21.714
minimize the importance
of telling those stories.

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.684
<i>But I had set down this path</i>

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:27.587
<i>to become a war photographer
 without meaning to.</i>

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.856
<i> I was sent to Gaza.</i>

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.425
<i>And this was when the second
 Intifada was unfolding.</i>

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.428
And it began as
kids throwing rocks

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.497
and quickly escalated
into people dying.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.667
And there were plenty
of stories all around us,

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.604
but we were asked to
focus on the violence.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.273
<i> Obviously, that's what
 sells in newspapers.</i>

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.776
<i> And this is a scene,
 and literally there are</i>

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.211
<i> at least half a dozen
photographers next to me,</i>

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.847
<i>we were all photographing
 exactly the same thing.</i>

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.550
And this was a profound
moment in my life,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.086
when I started asking
myself all these questions,

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:03.456
because one day I was
walking back to my hotel

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.425
and I heard this
music on the street.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:09.228
So, I wandered in and
I found this hotel

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:10.996
and this couple getting married.

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:14.100
<i>And this beautiful scene,
 scene of love,</i>

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.368
<i> you know, in the middle
 of all of this chaos</i>

00:02:16.368 --> 00:02:18.605
<i> just captivated me,
 and I thought,</i>

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.541
<i>"Wow! Why aren't we telling
 these stories as well?"</i>

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.976
Because they're
just as important,

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:26.379
they help us relate
to one another

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.215
and help me understand these
people as human beings

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.616
<i> just like you and me.</i>

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:32.084
<i>And so, I think that, you know,</i>

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.187
<i> we've become attuned
 to thinking that,</i>

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.889
you know, the positive,
the good,

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.526
the beautiful stories are
just banal, they're boring.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:43.562
You know, they don't really
deserve to be published.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.632
What would happen if
we chose to illuminate

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.168
the things that unite
us as human beings,

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:51.771
rather than just the
things that divide us.
