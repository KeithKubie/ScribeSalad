00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
Vsauce!

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.190
Kevin here.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.140
Let's get inspired by Dairy, Eye, Hair, Sideburns.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.509
There's evidence of humans making cheese dating
back 7,500 years.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.930
Dairy herding goes back 9,000 and it's believed
our ancestors were lactose intolerant so they

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.730
ate fermented foods like yogurt and cheese
which turn lactose into lactic acid.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.820
And it was also easier to transport the protein-rich
cheese curd than milk.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.200
The idea that eating carrots improves eyesight
is a myth originating from World War II.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.679
The British developed a new radar system to
shoot down German planes at night but they

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.079
wanted to keep it a secret so they created
propaganda citing an excess of eating carrots

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.850
by their pilots as their reason for success.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.190
Carrots do have beta carotene which converts
to Vitamin A - a lack of which could lead

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.059
to health problems but any well-rounded diet
will supply enough Vitamin A.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.929
People started wearing powdered wigs because
of syphilis.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.720
There was an epidemic in Europe and patchy
hair loss was one of the symptoms so the wigs

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.970
were needed to cover up the rampant baldness.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.120
The powder was scented with orange and lavender
to cover the odor of the accompanying sores

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.540
and rashes.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.350
Soon after, King Louis XIV and King Charles
II wore them to cover their thinning hair

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.300
and they started a trend that spread throughout
the aristocracy with the term "bigwig" coming

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.690
from those who could afford the biggest most
elaborate wigs.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.470
Having facial hair on the side of the face
has been around since at least 100 BC and

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.430
we know this thanks to a mosaic featuring
Alexander The Great sporting the style but

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.820
the name sideburns comes from a U.S. Civil
War General - Ambrose Burnside.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.700
He had facial hair across his cheeks that
connected to his mustache and it became known

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.030
as burnsides.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.570
Sideburns came into style a few years later
by shaving the mustache leaving you with just

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.700
the burns on the side.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:14.860
Now if we take out the air like this, the
ey, s and burns what we're left with is Dye

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.190
and Hide.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.630
An Easter Egg tradition.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.550
Humans have been decorating eggs for millennia
with engraved ostrich eggs discovered in Africa

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.640
going back 60,000 years.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.420
Christians of Mesopotamia stained eggs red
in tribute to the blood of Christ and the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.400
egg itself represents the resurrection of
the Lord.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.920
But modern adults rank red as the least popular
color with their favorite being blue.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.650
And as always - thanks for watching.
