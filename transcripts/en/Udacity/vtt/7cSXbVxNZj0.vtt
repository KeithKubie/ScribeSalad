00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's take a look and see if we understand revenue streams.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
On the top we have some examples of revenue stream possibilities.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We could have direct, ancillary, asset, usage, or subscription.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Why don't we match the best examples that go in each box.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Why don't you put the number that corresponds to what you think the best examples are

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.931
in the boxes underneath the revenue stream examples on the top.
