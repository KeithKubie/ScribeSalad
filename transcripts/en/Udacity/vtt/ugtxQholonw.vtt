00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer that all four of these representations would be fine.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We can generate successors by appending or adding elements

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to set lists, tuples, or frozen sets.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
None of those is too hard to do. It's a little bit easier with sets than with the other ones.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In terms of hashing, the immutable data types--frozen sets and tuple--

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
are hashable, and the mutable types--list and set--are not hashable.
