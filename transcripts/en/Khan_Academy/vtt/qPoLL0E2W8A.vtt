00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.450
The Eastern and Western
fronts, even though they

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.539
were fronts of the same
war, were very different

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:05.080
in character.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.538
And a lot of it came out of
the fact of who was fighting it

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:10.500
and especially how big
the actual fronts were.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.010
So the Western Front,
which was generally

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.750
this region right over here,
was a much smaller front

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.860
than the Eastern Front.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.330
The Eastern Front
was essentially

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.500
this entire region
right over there.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.270
And because of
that, trench warfare

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.090
did not become as major of a
factor on the Eastern Front.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.479
In fact, was fairly useless
on the Eastern Front.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.982
If you imagine trying to
dig a bunch of trenches.

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:36.940
So if you're trying to
dig a bunch of trenches,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.650
trenches are huge advantage
for the defending army

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.812
as long as you can block off
the entire region with trenches.

00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:45.770
So over here, you can't
go around the trenches,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.811
you essentially, if you
want to make some ground,

00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:50.310
an attacking army has
to cross the trenches.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.550
And because you have
now machine guns

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.250
and the defending
soldiers could essentially

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.330
sit behind the trenches,
they could essentially

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.220
mow down the attacking
army very easily.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.075
And that's what caused the
Western Front, especially

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.450
after the Schlieffen
Plan was not

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.640
able to be executed on
as quickly as possible,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.590
it turned into just a stalemate.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.430
So you just had a stalemate,
a hugely defensive stalemate.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.430
Because both parties had
their trenches, it was very,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.710
it was hugely advantageous
for the defending side.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.410
On the Eastern Front,
you had this huge front.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.740
It was very hard.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.490
You couldn't have.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.890
They didn't have enough
people to dig trenches

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.670
across this entire front.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.680
And so you could imagine if
you tried to dig a trench,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.864
but you weren't able to
cover the entire front,

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.280
then the attacking army doesn't
have to storm your trench.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.738
They don't have to
do that anymore.

00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:43.520
They could just go
around your trench.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.825
And because trench warfare
was not as significant

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:49.880
of a factor on the, or wasn't
as anywhere near as much

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.450
of a factor on
the Eastern Front,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.390
it was a much more fluid front.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.990
You had offensives
and counter-offensives

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.850
between the Germans,
Austrians on one side

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.900
and the Russians on the other.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.940
Now the other factor-- and
this was mainly with Russia

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.479
as a variable-- the
other factor was just

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.490
what was going on in Russia.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.920
So Russia had several
things going for it.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.040
The main thing is,
it had a huge army.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.190
It had a huge standing
army, even before the war.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.170
And it was able to
amass even more.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.230
So it had a huge army.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.420
But what was going
against it-- and this

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.980
is why it eventually had to get
into a very unfavorable treaty

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.190
with the Central Powers
near the end of the war--

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.187
is it had huge
internal problems.

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:37.020
And I'm not just talking
about the military.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.920
I was talking about, I'm
talking about the entire empire.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.830
And it arguably was due to
the war, due to the economic

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.060
and the human cost of the war.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.670
But as we enter
into 1917, you first

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.800
have the February Revolution.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.480
Tsar Nicholas II has to
abdicate the throne because

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.670
of the riots that
are going on, because

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.960
of the unhappiness,
the unease with people

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.050
literally going hungry.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.734
People, obviously, the morale
of the troops going down.

00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:09.650
And then on top of that,
the Russian military,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.240
even though it had a huge army
in the beginning of the war,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.370
the Russian industry wasn't
ready to fully supply

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.030
that army in as good of a way
as, say, the German army was.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.590
And on top of that, it had
communication problems.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.910
And even in the beginning
phases of the Eastern Front,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.047
it even had issues in terms of
coordinating its actual armies.

00:03:28.047 --> 00:03:29.630
And so what we'll
see, and we'll cover

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.310
this in much more depth
in a future video,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.470
but what we'll see
is, Western Front.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.260
Schlieffen Plan not executed
as fast as possible.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.360
Ends up in a stalemate.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.760
This did allow the Germans
to bring some of their troops

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.910
back to the Eastern Front
to fight the Russians.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.110
This goes back and
forth as we'll see.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.490
But once you enter
into 1917, you

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.194
have a revolution in Russia.

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:52.860
First, you have the
February Revolution.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.990
Tsar Nicholas II
has to abdicate.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.130
And then later that year,
you have the Bolsheviks

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.110
overthrow the
interim government.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.080
And you now have
Communist Russia.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.340
The Bolsheviks were
in no mood to continue

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.900
to fight the Germans.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.580
The military was in
no mood to continue

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.380
to fight the Germans and
the and Austria-Hungary.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.750
And so they, essentially,
get into a treaty with them

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.821
and kind of take
themselves out of the war.

00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:19.779
So we'll cover that in
a little bit more detail

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.710
in a future video.
