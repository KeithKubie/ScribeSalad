Unit rates aren't always used to talk
about speeds, like miles per hour.

00:00:05.048 --> 00:00:06.060
They can even be used for

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.790
a ton of purposes like talking about the
price per ounce of a box of pretzels.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.565
So can you tell me what is
the the price in dollars

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:16.895
per ounce of Pretzelicious pretzels?

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:20.065
Enter your answer here, and all you have
to provide is the number of dollars.

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:22.575
I've included the dollars per one ounce.

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:24.185
And you should round
to the nearest cent.
