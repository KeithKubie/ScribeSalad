00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's an example of what Galileo's data may have looked like.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this version of the experiment, he ran through the experiment five times.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
On the first run through when he led the ball to roll 1 unit of time, he measured the distance of 1 unit.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
After 2 units of time, he got 4.03; 3 was 9.07; and 4 was 16.18.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now he was a good scientist so of course he repeated this process multiple times,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and this is data he got in each of those following repetitions.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now with all these wonderful data now he has to analyze it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But how does he take advantage of the fact that he has collected each piece of data multiple times?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Presumably, he wants to find patterns in this data but how does he use all of it?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He has collected it. He should use it all. Well, the answer is he takes the average.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And so a quick review on averages in case you've forgotten or if you don't know.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
To calculate an average--for example if I want to calculate the average distance ruled

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in each of these units of time, and I've indicated the average of distance by a D with a bar over it,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and in physics a bar over a letter generally means the average.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What I'm going to do is add up all my data and divide by the number of data points.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here I would add up 1.00 + 1.01 + 0.99 + 0.99 + 1.01.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Divide it by 5 because that's how many data points I have--1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And when I calculate that, well I get an average of 1.00.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Can you calculate the average for the other 3 time measurements?

00:01:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answers in these three boxes.
