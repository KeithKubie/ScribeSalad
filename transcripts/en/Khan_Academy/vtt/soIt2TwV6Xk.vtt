00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.670
Let's say that we're told
that some angle theta, which

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.300
is going to be
expressed in radians,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.580
is between negative 3 pi
over 2 and negative pi.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.235
It's greater than
negative 3 pi over 2

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.840
and it's less than negative pi.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.220
And we're also told that sine
of theta is equal to 1/2.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.080
Just from this
information can we

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.080
figure out what the tangent of
theta is going to be equal to?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.430
And I encourage you to pause the
video and try this on your own.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.590
In case you're stumped,
I will give you a hint.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.100
You should use the Pythagorean
identity, the fact that sine

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.450
squared theta, plus cosine
squared theta is equal to 1.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.940
So let's do it.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.430
So we know the Pythagorean
identity, sine squared theta,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.830
plus cosine squared
theta is equal to 1.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.230
We know what sine
squared theta is.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.570
Sine theta is 1/2.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.250
So this could be
rewritten as 1/2 squared,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.860
plus cosine squared
theta, is equal to 1.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.450
Or we could write this as
1/4 plus cosine squared

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.110
theta is equal to 1.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.890
Or we could subtract
1/4 from both sides,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.210
and we get cosine squared
theta is equal to-- let's see.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.990
You subtract 1/4 from
the left hand side,

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.010
then this 1/4 goes away.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.051
That was the whole point.

00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:30.510
1 minus 1/4 is 3/4.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.870
So what could
cosine of theta be?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.280
Well, when I square
it, I get positive 3/4.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.680
So it could be the positive or
negative square root of 3/4.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.200
So cosine of theta
could be equal

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.310
to the positive or negative
square root of 3 over 4,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.370
which is the same thing as
the positive or negative

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:08.500
square root of 3, over the
square root of 4, which is 2.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.830
So it's the positive or negative
square root of 3 over 2.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.440
But how do we know which
one of these it actually is?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.200
Well, that's where this
information becomes useful.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.630
Let's draw our unit circle.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.580
If you're saying,
well, why am I even

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.980
worried about cosine of theta?

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.680
Well, if you know sine of
theta you know cosine of theta.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.750
Tangent of theta is just sine
of theta over cosine theta.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.760
So then you will know
the tangent of theta.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.760
But let's look at
the unit circle

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.000
to figure out which value
of cosine we should use.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.890
So let me draw it,
the unit circle.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.930
That's my y-axis.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.040
That is my x-axis.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.280
And I will draw the
unit circle in pink.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.050
So that's my best attempt
at drawing a circle.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.440
Please forgive me for its
lack of perfect roundness.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.960
And it says theta is greater
than negative 3 pi over 2.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.869
So where is negative
3 pi over 2?

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:10.410
So let's see.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.986
This is negative pi over 2.

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:14.360
So this is one
side of the angle.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.690
Let me do this in a color.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.550
So this one side of
the angle is going

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.960
to be along the positive x-axis.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.090
And we want to figure out
where the other side is.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.020
So this right over here
that's negative pi over 2.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.150
This is negative pi.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.260
So it's between negative pi,
which is right over here.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.740
So let me make that clear.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.320
Negative pi is right over here.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.860
It's between negative pi
and negative 3 pi over 2.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.430
Negative 3 pi over 2
is right over here.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.790
So our angle theta is going
to put us someplace over here.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.070
And the whole reason I did
this-- so this whole arc

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.400
right here-- you
could think of this

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.174
as the measure of angle
theta right over there.

00:04:06.174 --> 00:04:07.590
And the whole
reason I did that is

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.340
to think about whether
the cosine of theta

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.230
is going to be
positive or negative.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.120
We clearly see it's in
the second quadrant.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.079
The cosine of theta
is the x-coordinate

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.160
of this point where our angle
intersects the unit circle.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.636
So this point right
over here-- actually

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:25.010
let me do it in
that orange color

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.290
again-- this right over here,
that is the cosine of theta.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.270
Now is that a positive
or negative value?

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.580
Well it's clearly
a negative value.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.010
So for the sake of this
example, our cosine theta

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.220
is not a positive 1.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.720
It is a negative 1
So we could write

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.240
the cosine theta is equal to
the negative square root of 3

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.530
over 2.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.410
So we figured out cosine
theta, but we still

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.910
have to figure out
tangent of theta.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.440
And we just have
to remind ourselves

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.050
that the tangent
of theta is going

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:00.745
to be equal to the sine of
theta over the cosine of theta.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.560
Well they told us the
sine of theta is 1/2.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.520
So it's going to be 1/2
over cosine of theta, which

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.260
is negative square
root of 3 over 2.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.250
And what does that equal?

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.920
Well that's the same thing
as 1/2 times the reciprocal

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.510
of this.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:27.810
So times negative 2 over
the square root of 3.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.960
These twos will cancel out and
we are left with negative 1

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.160
over the square root of 3.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.850
Now some people don't like a
radical in the denominator,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.350
like this.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.120
They don't like an
irrational denominator.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.060
So we could rationalize
the denominator here

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.500
by multiplying by square root
of 3 over square root of 3.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.980
And so this will be equal
to negative square root of 3

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:04.747
over 3 is the tangent of
this angle right over here.

00:06:04.747 --> 00:06:06.830
And that actually makes
sense, because the tangent

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.490
of the angle is the
slope of this line.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.199
And we see that it is
indeed a negative slope.
