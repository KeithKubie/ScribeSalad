00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.469 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You are literally
 my number one.

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:04.537 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I don't know if I
 should even say that.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.571 align:start size:63% position:38%
- Oh.
(laughs)

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:06.572
 - We're out of time.

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:07.407
- Lame.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.508 size:88% position:44%
 - It goes so quick.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:09.309
 - Oh my god.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - I guess I'll
  see you next time.

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:11.544 size:88% position:44%
 - When will that be anyway?

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:13.179 size:88% position:44%
 - Say what?
 (laughing)

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:15.515 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Say put your
 number in my phone.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:16.616 size:88% position:44%
 - Say what?

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.352
 (theme music)

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.690
 - Oh my god,

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.492
 your story was so dope
 yesterday on Snapchat.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:27.460
I was loving it.

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:28.661
 - Thank you.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:30.596 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And you and I, we
got that fire going on.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:31.664
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:33.399
- I love it, I love it.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.301 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You're the only
person I have that with.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.369 size:88% position:44%
  (chuckles)

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.570
 - That's cool.

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:39.705
 - I feel like maybe you're a
 little nervous or something.

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:41.541
(laughs)

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:42.442 size:88% position:44%
  - Nervous?

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.510
 No, I'm not nervous.

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:48.548 align:start size:88% position:13%
Trust me, I go on first
dates all the time.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.683
- So you guys ever have
any weird celeb run ins?

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.351 size:88% position:44%
  (chuckles)

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.654 align:start position:0%
 The time when Decker saw
 Clark Gregg in the hotel gym.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.155
 - Holy shit.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:57.457 size:88% position:44%
  (exhaling)

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.558 size:88% position:44%
 Hey, Clark.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.392 size:88% position:44%
  (exhaling)

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:00.393
 Clark.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.695
 Agent Clark.
 (screaming)

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.230
 - Wait, wait.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.532 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Kevin's story
 definitely beats mine.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:08.501 align:start position:0%
 - Anthony, thanks for
 sharing your workout with us.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:09.635
- Thanks a lot.

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.037 align:start position:0%
 - [Voiceover] Gonna wrap, cut.
 (beep)

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.637 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Can I talk to you
over here for a minute?

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.505 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, sure bud.

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:13.172 size:88% position:44%
  What's up?

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.407
 - Hey, listen.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.074 align:start size:88% position:13%
I didn't want to do this
in front of everyone.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:15.675
 You remember--

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.476
- Let's keep this cool.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.710 size:88% position:44%
  - Dude, come here.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:18.511 size:88% position:44%
  You remember poker
  the other night?

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:19.512
 You owe me my $12,000.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.114
 Now don't make me fuck you up.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.582 size:88% position:44%
  - Can we talk about this--

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.051
 - No, let's talk about it now.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:25.818
 - Get the...

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.087
(groans)

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.323
 Hey guys, let's wrap this up.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.691 size:88% position:44%
  - [Kevin] Complete
  misunderstanding.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.059 size:88% position:44%
 (chuckling)

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.293
- Hey Brittany, what about you?

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:36.262
 - I've literally never
 embarrassed myself.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:37.530
 Oh, hey Ash.

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:38.397 size:88% position:44%
 What are you doing?

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.066 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh, just reading
 a script for this--

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.468
- Oh my god, is it the
new Hunger Games script?

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.370 size:88% position:44%
  You can tell me, I
  won't tell anyone.

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:45.371 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I think you're
 thinking of Twilight.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:49.408
- No, Twilight where you
had the bow and arrows.

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.110
 - I was in Twilight.

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.512
 Kristin Stewart plays Bella.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.779 size:84% position:42%
  - [Brittany] Yes.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.214 size:88% position:44%
 - The vampire falls
 in love with her.

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:56.816 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - And they eat the
 poison berries, and--

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:57.650
 - No.

00:01:57.683 --> 00:01:58.718
 - Break the sequence.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.652 size:88% position:44%
 - No, okay.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.221
 - Ash can get weirdly pushy.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:03.356
(gasps)

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.557
 OMG, you guys.

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:07.193
- Oh no.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.061
- What?

00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:10.363 size:88% position:44%
 - Jesus, it's them.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.397
- What?

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.231 size:88% position:44%
 - It's all of them.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:13.332
 - Hey buddy.

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:16.169 size:88% position:44%
 - I had no idea that little
 mannequin could even eat.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.503
 I'm gonna go say hi.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:18.437
 - Hey.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.506
 - Hey.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.408
- There she is.

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Sometimes coincidences
are so awesome.

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:32.518
 - It's my best friend
 and my arch nemesis.

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:33.786
- You have so many arch nemeses.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.221
- It's better than none.

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:37.757
 - Do not tell me you
 two are on a date.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.591
- Well--

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:39.525
- No, actually.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:40.760 size:88% position:44%
 Nope, we're not, so just...

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.261
 - Well actually we
 were just on a date.

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:44.564 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Until you just decided
 to be a dickhole.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.065 size:84% position:42%
  - Oh, you tell him Bella.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:47.633 size:84% position:42%
  And frankly, I'm
  surprised he even

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.735
has it in him to ask a lady out.

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:52.138 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.174
Seriously, I'm not here.

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:56.776
Please continue.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.245
Or we just make this a
nice romantic three way.

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:00.613
- Never gets old, Kevin.

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:01.447
- [Kevin] That's right.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.482
 - Oh my god.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.350
 - Seriously?

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:06.285
- It's Brittany, bitch.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.119 size:88% position:44%
  (chuckles)

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:08.421 size:88% position:44%
 My favorite people.

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.389
 - Oh my god, this is gonna get

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:12.558 align:start size:88% position:13%
more violent than a
Fast and Furious sequel.

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:13.659
- This is not cool, man.

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:15.061
 We should just leave.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.362
 I do not want to watch this.

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:17.430
 - Just enjoy the ride.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.765
- Bella, it's so good to see you

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:22.101 size:88% position:44%
 with my friend Christopher.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:25.504 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Hi, how was the
 whole hospital thing?

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:26.638 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh, well.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:29.542 size:88% position:44%
 I'm proud to say I've fully
 recovered after my meltdown

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:32.345 align:start position:0%
  when you stole those three
  endorsements from me.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.479
 - Oh.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.147 size:88% position:44%
  - Whatever, was gonna put
  a down payment on a condo.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.449
Had to let that one go.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.517
 No big deal.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
  - Oh my god, you know
  what Bella's perfect for?

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:41.053
 - No.

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:42.622
- The Glanthor saga adaptation.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.056
 - Decker, no.

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.791
- Just picture her with
six wings and a horn.

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:47.660
 That is the ice queen Verasia.

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:49.362 size:88% position:44%
  - Why would I be
  threatened by you?

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.430
 You're an 18 year old with six
 million Instagram followers.

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:52.465
(coughs)

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.766
 - Ten.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.468 align:start position:0%
  26 cross platform if we're
  talking real numbers.

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.336 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Counting is tough
 for you anyway.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.571 size:84% position:42%
  But that's a lot.

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:00.373 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - [Bella] It's
  awkward, actually.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.507
 - Yeah, hate myself.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.441 size:84% position:42%
  - Come on, don't do this.

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:04.377 size:84% position:42%
  - It's already happening.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.245 size:84% position:42%
  - No, no.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.513
 - You know, this whole thing.

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:09.415
 You guys are really
 killing my vibe here.

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:10.650
 - [Christopher] They
 should leave, right?

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.318 size:88% position:44%
 - You guys should
 stay, I'm gonna go.

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:13.286
- Bella.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.120
(gasps)

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.388
It's me.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.023 size:88% position:44%
 - [Bella] It's you.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.325
Are you friends with these guys?

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:20.526
- [Decker] Best friends.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.261 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh, well.

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:23.496 size:88% position:44%
 - Hey, I was wondering if I
 could run an idea past you.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:24.430 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I'm not threatened
 by you at all.

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:27.000 size:88% position:44%
 (crosstalk)

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.706
(claps)

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:35.241 size:84% position:42%
  - I'm hip hopping
  out of this orgy.

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:37.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Cause you guys
  are fucking weird.

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:38.811
- [Kevin] No, we should
just make it a foursome.

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:40.146 size:88% position:44%
 You're a dick slit.

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.681 align:start size:88% position:13%
 You're a Zach
 Galifianakis wannabe.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.249 size:84% position:42%
  You're just an alcoholic.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.818 size:84% position:42%
  And who the fuck are you?

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.620
You're paying for this.

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:49.488
 Taking this with me.

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:50.355
 - But Bella.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.658 size:88% position:44%
  My laugh, remember
  you like my laugh?

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:53.526 size:88% position:44%
  I thought.

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.463 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You're not getting
 laid tonight.

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:58.496
