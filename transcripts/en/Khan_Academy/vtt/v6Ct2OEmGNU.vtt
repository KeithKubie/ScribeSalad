00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:02.720
- [Instructor] So we're asked
to graph f of x is equal to

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.422
two times the absolute value
of x plus three, plus two.

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:09.088
And what they've already graphed for us,

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:10.278
this right over here,

00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:14.445
this is the graph of y is equal
to the absolute value of x.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.672
So let's do this through a
series of transformations.

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:20.443
So the next thing I wanna graph,

00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:22.776
let's see if we can graph y.

00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:28.838
Y is equal is to the absolute
value of x plus three.

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:31.432
Now in previous videos
we have talked about it.

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:32.956
If you replace your x,

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.454
with an x plus three,

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:40.137
this is going to shift your
graph to the left by three.

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:41.786
You could view this as the same thing as

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:46.192
y is equal to the absolute
value of x minus negative three.

00:00:46.192 --> 00:00:48.608
And whatever you're
subtracting from this x,

00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:50.603
that is how much you are shifting it.

00:00:50.603 --> 00:00:53.430
So you're going to shift
it three to the left.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.177
And we're gonna do that right now

00:00:55.177 --> 00:00:57.997
and then we're gonna just gonna
confirm that it matches up.

00:00:57.997 --> 00:00:59.579
That it makes sense.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.897
So let's first graph that.

00:01:01.897 --> 00:01:03.163
Get my ruler tool here.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.864
So if we shift three to the left,

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.959
it's gonna look something like...

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:09.927
It's gonna look something like this.

00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:11.664
So on that...

00:01:11.664 --> 00:01:12.639
When whatever we have

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.827
inside the absolute
value sign is positive,

00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:20.005
we're going to get
essentially, this slope of one.

00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:21.890
And whenever we have

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.577
inside the absolute
value sign is negative,

00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:27.592
we're gonna have a slope of
essentially negative one.

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:29.546
So it's going to look...

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:32.216
It's going to look like that.

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:36.023
And let's confirm whether
this actually makes sense.

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:38.933
Below x equals negative three,

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.558
for x values less than negative three,

00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:43.385
what we're gonna have here,

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:46.477
is this inside of the absolute value sign,

00:01:46.477 --> 00:01:48.171
is going to be negative

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:50.185
and so then we're gonna
take it's opposite value

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:51.160
and so that makes sense.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.470
That's why you have this
downward line right over here.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.808
Now for x is greater than negative three,

00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:02.932
when you add three to it, you're
gonna get a positive value

00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:06.234
and so that's why you have
this upward sloping line

00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:07.388
right over here.

00:02:07.388 --> 00:02:09.436
And at x equals negative three,

00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:13.327
you have zero inside
the absolute value sign,

00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:15.375
just as if you didn't shift it,

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:17.939
you would have had zero
inside the absolute value sign

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.559
at x equals zero.

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.121
So hopefully that makes a
little bit more intuitive sense

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:24.795
of why if you replace x,

00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:27.867
if you replace x with x plus three,

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:29.679
and this isn't just true of
absolute value functions,

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:31.740
this is true of any function,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.138
if you replace x with x plus three,

00:02:34.138 --> 00:02:37.721
you are going to shift three to the left.

00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:39.789
All right, now let's keep building.

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:41.981
Now let's see if we can graph

00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:46.148
y is equal to two times the
absolute value of x plus three.

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:49.798
So what this is essentially going to do

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:53.298
is multiple the slopes by a factor of two.

00:02:55.332 --> 00:02:59.836
It's going to stretch it
vertically by a factor of two.

00:02:59.836 --> 00:03:04.329
So for x values greater
than negative three,

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.026
instead of having a slope of one,

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:07.815
you're gonna have a slope of two.

00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:09.685
So let me get my ruler out again

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:12.030
and see if I can draw that.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.113
So let me put that there.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.125
And then, so here instead
of a slope of one,

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:22.758
I'm gonna have a slope of two.

00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:24.175
Let me draw that.

00:03:25.054 --> 00:03:27.382
It's gonna look like
that, right over there.

00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:31.023
And then instead of having
a slope of negative one

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:34.182
for values less than x
equals negative three,

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:37.432
I'm gonna have a slope of negative two.

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.214
Let me draw that right over there.

00:03:41.214 --> 00:03:44.137
So that is the graph of y is equal to

00:03:44.137 --> 00:03:47.292
two times the absolute
value of x plus three.

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:50.329
And now to get to the f
of x that we care about,

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.810
we now need to add this two.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.839
So now I wanna graph, and
we're in the home stretch,

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.921
I wanna graph, y is equal to two times

00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:04.153
the absolute value of
x plus three, plus two.

00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:06.080
Well whatever y value I was getting

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.819
for this orange function,
I now wanna add two to it.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.104
So this is just gonna shift
it up vertically by two.

00:04:12.104 --> 00:04:13.437
So instead of...

00:04:14.662 --> 00:04:16.750
So this is gonna be shifted up by two.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.180
This is going to be shifted.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.042
Every point is going to shifted up by two

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:26.241
or you can think about shifting
up the entire graph by two.

00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:27.601
Here, in the orange function,

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.308
whatever y value I got
for the black function,

00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:32.591
I'm gonna have to get two more than that.

00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:34.924
And so it's going to look...

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.623
It's going to look like this.

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:41.845
So let me see, I'm shifting it up by two.

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:45.078
So for x less than negative
three, it'll look like that.

00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:48.798
And for x greater than negative three,

00:04:48.798 --> 00:04:51.048
it is going to look like...

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:55.589
It is going to look like that.

00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:58.212
And there you have it.

00:04:58.212 --> 00:05:02.358
This is the graph of y
or f of x is equal to

00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:05.098
two times the absolute value
of x plus three, plus two.

00:05:05.098 --> 00:05:06.669
And you could've done
it in different ways.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.442
You could have shifted up two first,

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:14.274
then you could have
multiplied by a factor of two,

00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:17.282
and then you could have shifted, and then,

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:18.929
so you could have moved up two first,

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:20.797
then you coulda multiplied
by a factor of two,

00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:22.933
then you could've shifted left by three.

00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:24.570
Or could have multiplied
by a factor of two first,

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.850
shifted up two and then shifted over.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.000
So there's multiple,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.770
there's three transformations
going up here.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.853
This is an...

00:05:31.812 --> 00:05:34.099
This is a, let me color them all.

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.530
So this right over here tells me...

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.026
This over here says hey, shift left.

00:05:41.026 --> 00:05:44.276
Shift left by three.

00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:49.684
This told us, stretch vertically by two.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.655
Or essentially multiply the slope by two.

00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:58.700
Stretch vert by two.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.440
And then that last piece,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.636
says shift up by two.

00:06:02.636 --> 00:06:05.303
Shift up by two,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.913
which gives us our
final result for f of x.
