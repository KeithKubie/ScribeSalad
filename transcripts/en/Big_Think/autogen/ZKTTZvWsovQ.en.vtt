having robust systems it will keep you
 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.179
having robust systems it will keep you
alive and then just you know water and

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189
alive and then just you know water and
 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.059
alive and then just you know water and
and in food you know I think I heard

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069
and in food you know I think I heard
 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.649
and in food you know I think I heard
it's gonna take 24,000 pounds of food

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659
it's gonna take 24,000 pounds of food
 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.830
it's gonna take 24,000 pounds of food
for I think a colony of four or five to

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840
for I think a colony of four or five to
 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.260
for I think a colony of four or five to
live up there so the pre position do you

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270
live up there so the pre position do you
 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.539
live up there so the pre position do you
fly those in pre position that there and

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549
fly those in pre position that there and
 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.429
fly those in pre position that there and
hope that a dust storm or something

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439
hope that a dust storm or something
 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.080
hope that a dust storm or something
doesn't wipe it out and know that it's

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090
doesn't wipe it out and know that it's
 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.239
doesn't wipe it out and know that it's
still there and then a shelf life of

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249
still there and then a shelf life of
 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.879
still there and then a shelf life of
five years whereas the shelf life for

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:03.889
five years whereas the shelf life for
 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.319
five years whereas the shelf life for
the food on the space station is 18

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329
the food on the space station is 18
 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.169
the food on the space station is 18
months so a five year shelf shelf life

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
months so a five year shelf shelf life
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.830
months so a five year shelf shelf life
and every time item of food you know

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840
and every time item of food you know
 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.990
and every time item of food you know
sits there for another month another

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000
sits there for another month another
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.540
sits there for another month another
month and

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550
month and
 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.760
month and
month it lives this nutritional value it

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770
month it lives this nutritional value it
 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.340
month it lives this nutritional value it
loses flavor it loses texture so making

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350
loses flavor it loses texture so making
 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.050
loses flavor it loses texture so making
sure that we have something that people

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060
sure that we have something that people
 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.570
sure that we have something that people
don't want to eat and will eat to stay

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
don't want to eat and will eat to stay
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.690
don't want to eat and will eat to stay
healthy on this in this environment we

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
healthy on this in this environment we
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.950

as a race the human race are

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960
as a race the human race are
 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.040
as a race the human race are
intrinsically curious and we are wired

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050
intrinsically curious and we are wired
 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.280
intrinsically curious and we are wired
in our DNA as it we're explorers we look

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
in our DNA as it we're explorers we look
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.960
in our DNA as it we're explorers we look
up at the night sky we wonder what's up

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
up at the night sky we wonder what's up
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.420
up at the night sky we wonder what's up
there especially as children and so this

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
there especially as children and so this
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.910
there especially as children and so this
this journey of exploring the things

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
this journey of exploring the things
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.860
this journey of exploring the things
around us whether their clothes are far

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
around us whether their clothes are far
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.290
around us whether their clothes are far
that's what we do that's what we do as

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300
that's what we do that's what we do as
 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.140
that's what we do that's what we do as
humans and I think you know all the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
humans and I think you know all the
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.480
humans and I think you know all the
things that we've done with exploration

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490
things that we've done with exploration
 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.070
things that we've done with exploration
whether it's walking on the moon or

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080
whether it's walking on the moon or
 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.780
whether it's walking on the moon or
building an International Space Station

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
building an International Space Station
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.630
building an International Space Station
all these things help advance life back

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640
all these things help advance life back
 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.320
all these things help advance life back
on earth and so exploration leads us to

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330
on earth and so exploration leads us to
 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.880
on earth and so exploration leads us to
a better life you know

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
a better life you know
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.490
a better life you know

gave me this perspective shift when I
look back at the planet you know like

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440
look back at the planet you know like
 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.140
look back at the planet you know like
Ron Garren's book orbital perspective

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150
Ron Garren's book orbital perspective
 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.800
Ron Garren's book orbital perspective
and so as we do this space station thing

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
and so as we do this space station thing
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.900
and so as we do this space station thing
as we maybe move go back to the moon and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910
as we maybe move go back to the moon and
 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.330
as we maybe move go back to the moon and
build a habitat but eventually we're

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340
build a habitat but eventually we're
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.650
build a habitat but eventually we're
going to be going to another planet and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660
going to be going to another planet and
 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.860
going to be going to another planet and
Mars is you know our closest neighbor

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870
Mars is you know our closest neighbor
 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.800
Mars is you know our closest neighbor
that we can get to there potential

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810
that we can get to there potential
 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.449
that we can get to there potential
resources there

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459
resources there
 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.190
resources there
you know there's water at the poles

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200
you know there's water at the poles
 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.100
you know there's water at the poles
there's you know these iron is in the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110
there's you know these iron is in the
 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.900
there's you know these iron is in the
soil that we can turn into other things

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910
soil that we can turn into other things
 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.860
soil that we can turn into other things
that perchlorates and so I think as a as

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870
that perchlorates and so I think as a as
 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.159
that perchlorates and so I think as a as
a race of people I think it's imperative

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169
a race of people I think it's imperative
 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.080
a race of people I think it's imperative
that we continue to explore but also

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090
that we continue to explore but also
 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.690
that we continue to explore but also
that we visit this neighbor that might

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700
that we visit this neighbor that might
 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.969
that we visit this neighbor that might
have been like our planet at one time

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979
have been like our planet at one time
 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.400
have been like our planet at one time
before so this can be a harbinger of

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410
before so this can be a harbinger of
 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.290
before so this can be a harbinger of
maybe things to come that we need to

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300
maybe things to come that we need to
 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.860
maybe things to come that we need to
understand

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870
understand
 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.020
understand
would what happened there and what's

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030
would what happened there and what's
 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.939
would what happened there and what's
going to potentially happen here on

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949
going to potentially happen here on
 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.860
going to potentially happen here on
earth you know no matter what that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870
earth you know no matter what that
 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.140
earth you know no matter what that
timeframe is understanding that is is

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150
timeframe is understanding that is is
 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.660
timeframe is understanding that is is
very important

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670
very important
 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.879
very important
