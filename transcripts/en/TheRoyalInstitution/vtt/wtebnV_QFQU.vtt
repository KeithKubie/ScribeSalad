00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.770
 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.860
Our genetic information, our
DNA, is conveniently packaged

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.310
into little bundles called
chromosomes.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.030
Humans have 23 pairs of
them, 46 altogether.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.120
They contain the instructions
that the body uses to build

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.830
itself, the recipe for
a human, if you will.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.690
Accidentally duplicating copies
of the DNA instructions

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.910
can cause problems later on.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.860
That's what happens in Down's
syndrome, a genetic condition

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.450
that causes developmental and
physical disabilities.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.570
It's a result of accidentally
inheriting additional copies

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.860
of some of the DNA
instructions.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520
Down's patients typically have
an extra chromosome 21.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.569
So instead of 46 chromosomes,
they have 47.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.630
Where does this extra chromosome
come from?

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.320
It happens during the formation
of sperm and eggs, a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.610
process called meiosis.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.140
During meiosis, your 46
chromosomes are shared out so

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.910
that only half of them, 23, go
into each sperm or egg cell.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.880
I'll show you using just one
of the sets of chromosomes,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.410
although actually it's
happening to all

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.320
23 at the same time.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.900
Now originally, one of
the pair will have

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.210
come from your father.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.570
Let's say it's this blue one.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510
And the other one will
have originally

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.855
come from your mother.

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:38.210
Let's say it's this red one.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.840
 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.240
First of all, each chromosome
makes a copy of itself.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.880
It duplicates, making four
altogether, two stuck together

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.080
from the father and two stuck
together from the mother.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.130
These then move to the middle of
the cell, where they match

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.225
up and almost wrap around
each other.

00:01:57.225 --> 00:01:59.920
It's then that something called
crossing over occurs,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.100
where genetic material is
exchanged between chromosomes.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.190
This mixing process
can generate new

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.570
combinations of genes.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.520
It's one of the most vital
features of sexual

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.500
reproduction.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.190
Now the chromosomes are pulled
in opposite directions by

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.630
fibres that come from the
sides of the cells.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.615
They're pulled apart once
and then once again.

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:24.020
And the four separate
chromosomes go into four

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.160
separate sex cells.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.030
Remember, this is actually
happening with 23

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.100
pairs, not just 1.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.690
And so each sex cell ends
up with 23 chromosomes.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.425
In males, those all go on
to become sperm cells.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.350
In females, it's slightly
different.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.920
Only one of them goes on
to become an egg cell.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.490
During fertilisation, you get 23
from the male sperm and 23

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.940
from the female egg, making 46
in total again, 23 pairs.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.180
Down's syndrome occurs when
during this pulling apart

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.950
process of meiosis something
goes wrong with

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.300
chromosome number 21.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.100
Instead of the four chromosomes
separating and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.290
being pulled apart, at some
point two of them go together.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.580
And both go into one sex cell.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.080
During fertilisation that sex
cell fuses with another one to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.070
form an embryo.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.030
It means that there are three
copies of chromosome 21,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.520
rather than the usual two.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.875
In total, the embryo
has 47 chromosomes.

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:27.160
Chromosome 21 being the shortest
human chromosome, the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.990
foetus can normally survive.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.610
If this sort of thing happens to
other chromosomes with more

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.883
genetic information, the outcome
is usually fatal.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:40.605
The intricate mechanics of how
our sex cells are created can

00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:43.520
make the difference between
life or death.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:04:02.113
