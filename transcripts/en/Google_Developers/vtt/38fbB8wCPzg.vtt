00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:06.020
ASTRID WEBER: Hello, everyone,
and welcome to our talk,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.650
Designing for the
Next Billion Users--

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.120
Accessibility UX Insights
from Emerging Markets.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.300
I am Astrid Weber,
and I lead UX research

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.452
for accessibility
engineering at Google.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.160
NITHYA SAMBASIVAN:
I'm Nithya Sambasivan,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.577
and I am a UX researcher for
emerging markets at Google.

00:00:24.577 --> 00:00:26.410
ASTRID WEBER: The first
half of today's talk

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.610
will include an overview about
accessibility, an introduction

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.430
to the people who live
in the next billion years

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.750
context of emerging markets,
and finally end with closing--

00:00:41.184 --> 00:00:43.600
and finally, we are going to
take a closer look at the NBU

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.320
markets and those
users that profit

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.500
the most from
excessive technology.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
In the second part
of the talk, we

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.620
are going to introduce you
to our NBU accessibility

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.770
framework that will help
you, as app developers,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.129
to make the most out of the
learnings of today's talk.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.160
Before we get started,
I want to ensure you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.770
that we do not have any
technical difficulties

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.020
with our presentation.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.360
We simply modified this
screen to give you a glimpse,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.320
or merely just an
impression, of what

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.480
this presentation would
look like for someone

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.250
with low vision.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.990
More than 250 million people in
today's world have low vision,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.960
and today is Global
Accessibility Awareness Day,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.450
so I'm more happy
than ever I could

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.920
be to have all of you here
attend this talk with us having

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.000
that day happening.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.270
So let me introduce you
to one of those users, who

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.920
has actual low vision.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.130
His name is Jonah, and he's
living in the South of Jakarta

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.100
together with his parents
and his three siblings.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.410
So Jonah is the
oldest one of those,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.170
and he's supporting
his family because they

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.810
have a neighborhood store.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.780
Jonah is helping out.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.040
When Jonah was three years
old, he had an eye infection.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.560
And even though the
doctors performed surgery,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.040
unfortunately Jonah
was left legally blind.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.100
What does that mean?

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.650
That means that
Jonah can only see

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.950
objects that are very closeby,
or that are extremely enlarged.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.170
20 years ago, Jonah would have
had very limited opportunity

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.570
to help his parents
run the store.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.020
But today, thanks to
assistive technology, Jonah

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.870
is able to go to
the market, as you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.180
see him do here in
the picture, and pick

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.270
objects for his parents' store.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.460
And his phone is
helping him to enlarge,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.950
to check what it is,
what the quality is.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.050
And Jonah is just one
example of us today

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.890
that we would like to
take as a starting point

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.460
to introduce you to how much
technology can help people

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.047
with disabilities in
order to live their lives

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:50.630
and do the things
that matter to them.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.230
Worldwide, there is more
than 1 billion people

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.610
who have a disability.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.250
For the US, that's one
out of five people.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.610
But actually, that is not
even the full picture yet

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.550
because many of us experience
so-called temporary

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.810
disabilities.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.560
For example, you may be pregnant
and have limited mobility,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.900
or you might have a broken
wrist and are suddenly

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.870
not able to operate
your phone anymore.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.970
Accessibility does
not stop there.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.630
With a society that is growing
older than ever before,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.810
many people are affected
by hard of hearing,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.800
hand tremors, and
limited walking ability.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.410
Even children have
accessibility needs.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.870
Our environment
often enough is not

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.320
created for people of
various body sizes.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.530
And if you can't read or
write, much information

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.190
remains inaccessible to you.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.070
Even those of you who might
think, I have no accessibility

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.660
needs whatsoever--

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.610
think further.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.090
Ever been to a bar where
there was loud music playing

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.060
and you were trying to have
a conversation with a friend?

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.890
That's basically the
experience of someone

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.480
who is hard of hearing.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.259
Or maybe you try to follow
the sports commentary

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.550
on the screen, but you couldn't
because the environment

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.560
was just too noisy.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.530
So, all of us encounter
situations every single day

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.890
in which we have
accessibility needs.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.040
To sum it up, while
developing applications

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.470
we should never assume
that users constantly

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.620
have their full vision,
their hands, their hearing,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.820
or the full cognitive
abilities available to them.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.000
Did you know that some of the
most innovative and most used

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.690
products were actually
designed because people

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.590
had accessibility inspirations?

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.660
The email-- the way we all
know it and use it every single

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.230
day--

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.920
was originally developed
in 1972 by Vint Cerf

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.010
when he started to program
the first email protocol.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.150
He firmly believed
that electronic letters

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.700
are going to change
our interactions

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.530
and our communications.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.450
And yes, he was right.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.140
But what very little people know
is Vint Cerf's wife was deaf.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.930
And for him, it was the only
way to communicate with her

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.010
while he was at work.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.000
Just in recent
years, Joshua Silver,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.820
a professor and physicist
from the United Kingdom,

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.740
created a new form
of liquid filled

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.550
corrective lens that can easily
be adjusted for the patient.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.440
This low cost approach works
for over 90% of the vision

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.630
corrections in the world.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.600
The glasses are particularly
useful in the context

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.320
of emerging markets
where, often enough, you

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.140
don't have access to
a trained optometrist.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.258
And with, that I hand
it over to Nithya.

00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:41.050
NITHYA SAMBASIVAN: Thank you.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.920
It's easy to see how much
technological innovation is

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.890
being inspired by accessibility
and the next billion users.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.550
Out of all the people in this
world that have disabilities,

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.290
80% of them live in the global
south in emerging markets.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.380
So designing for the
next billion users

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.430
and designing for
accessibility is a natural fit.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.190
If you want the next billion
users to use your product,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.130
it will be even more important
that your technology considers

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.785
their lives, their values, their
use cases, and their desires

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:12.285
and needs.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.100
In this millennium, the vast
majority of mobile phone growth

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.640
has happened south
of the equator.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.980
While industrialized
nations are plateauing

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.620
in their internet and
mobile phone growth,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.180
growth in emerging markets is 10
times that of Western nations.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.430
In the next few years,
a billion new people

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.150
are expected to come online for
the first time from emerging

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.570
markets.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.650
And here are some examples of
how developing products that

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.710
work for use cases
for emerging markets

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.110
can deliver a globally
superior experience.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.530
Absent content that render
directions when one does not

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.980
have connectivity are useful
in the everyday context

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.990
of a small town in Nairobi--

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.750
near Nairobi-- or when you're
out of reach of cell signal

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.090
on the way to Yosemite.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.730
Other innovations that
have originated or gained

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.440
traction in emerging
markets that have

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.980
traveled sideways or scaled
up in many different parts

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.510
of the world are mobile
money, QR code services,

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.000
peer to peer sharing, or cash
on delivery, just to name a few.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.250
So, what we argue for is
that designing for inclusion

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.800
is designing for everybody.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.890
When we think inclusively
beyond our immediate context

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.080
and the people that
we know, our products

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.120
become far more
meaningful and useful

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.710
to those who may
try to use them.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.810
So until now, we see
that accessibility

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.720
is a relevant topic
for us and especially

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.360
for those living in
emerging markets.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.640
Let's take a closer look
at who these next billion

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.770
users are, and learn more about
their behaviors and contexts.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.820
Mobiles are often the
first and only device

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.940
to which many people come
online in emerging markets.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.280
Unlike the desktop
trajectory of AOL

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.740
to search to email
to social media,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.350
many people in
emerging markets get

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.930
introduced to the internet
through social media,

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.050
and on a mobile phone, without
any preconceived notions

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.900
through mobile phone
based app registration.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.140
So the mobile, then, is not
just an on the go device

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.476
but is the primary device.

00:08:19.476 --> 00:08:21.100
Phones in emerging
markets tend to live

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.310
for much longer due to
circulation as gifts from urban

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.060
to rural, second hand devices,
and to avoid wastefulness

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.250
in general.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.930
Due to longer lifespans,
older operating systems

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.000
tend to persist.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.260
| of these phones have low
RAM, storage, battery life,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.210
small screens or
multiple SIM cards

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.710
in order to fit into
the $40 to $100 bracket.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.980
Many devices have broken
screens or damaged phone covers,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.821
not the pristine
conditions that we imagine

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.070
when we're designing for them.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.660
A primary driver for this
democratization of the internet

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.730
is prepaid access.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.590
96% of mobile users in India,
and 95% in South Africa,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.920
are on prepaid.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.030
So, prepaid requires
lower financial commitment

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.090
on the part of the user
compared to post-paid,

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.650
where one has to
pay a steep amount

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.270
at the end of each month.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.540
In pre-paid, a user can
decide when and how much

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.460
they want to top up
for and which network

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.140
they want to top up on.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.470
And users have to do a
complex recalculation of size,

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.560
validity, type of
network, and carrier,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.070
and they're usually assisted
by somebody at the mobile shop.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.090
It's easy to get
access to scratchcards

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.410
in emerging markets at grocery
stores or traffic lights,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.690
and nowadays even online.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.760
Sometimes, users run
out of data and wait

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.060
until there are better
finances, or buy small packs.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.920
So this is in
contrast to the model

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.640
around which most
apps are developed,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.861
which is 24/7 connectivity.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.770
50% of the world is
now online in 2017,

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.620
but the internet is slow,
expensive, and intermittent

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.980
in emerging markets, creating
a more constrained experience.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.860
The average speed in the
United States is 16 MBPS.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.590
In Egypt, it is around 3 MBPS.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.330
Internet can also
be intermittent.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.920
3G is limited.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.460
Cellular networks switch
between 3G to 4G to offline.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.340
Internet can be expensive too.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.950
To buy 1 GB of data
in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.730
it costs 18% of the average
person's monthly income.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.190
And the comparable figure
in the US is less than 1%.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.640
Even when Wi-Fi is available,
it is almost always capped.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.800
Truly uncapped Wi-Fi
is very expensive.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.400
So what this translates
to is that network

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.130
is top of mind for
many, rather than just

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.640
focusing on the app experience
that we're designing for.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.310
When one goes online, one of
the first few things they learn

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.360
is how to manage a network,
and strategies and workarounds

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.070
for data management.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.060
These are completely un-obvious
and learned from top-up shops

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.250
or friends and family.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.590
Mobile data gets turned
off from Android settings

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:03.715
in order to control costs.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.050
We have met users who have
broadband but regularly

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.450
unplug their routers at night.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.840
App updates are usually ignored
because they cost money.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.010
Peer to peer sharing of APK's,
not applications, and media

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.340
is used for rich content.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.990
Media are often
downloaded for consumption

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.487
when there is a lack
of connectivity.

00:11:25.487 --> 00:11:26.820
So the network is never a given.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.670
When it comes to using devices,
diverse literacies, languages,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.200
and technology
capabilities are at play.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.710
55% of the content
online is in English,

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.490
but less than one third of
Indians can speak English.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.110
Fluency in English
is proportionate

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.330
to socioeconomic status.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.780
And despite low fluency,
interestingly, many people

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.540
prefer to use English because
it is the aspirational language

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.550
of upward mobility.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.470
While there are many
phone UI options,

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.350
many users prefer the
fluidity across languages

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.510
and transliterate as needed.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.670
Multilingualism is common.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.810
Literacy levels vary with
about 781 million adults

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.460
being non-literate,
most of whom are women.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.220
New vibrant social setup
exists in emerging markets.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.930
Information is more
trustworthy when

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.770
it comes from people rather
than applications or software.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.840
New internet users
introduced to technology

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.000
through friends or
agents or family,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.740
resources-- including
technologies--

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.180
are often shared.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.900
And sharing overcomes a number
of literacy and usability

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.415
issues and builds upon trust.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.880
This is evidenced in borrowing
sugar from neighbors,

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.740
babysitting friends'
kids, or helping

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.740
a friend get a new
application and teaching them

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.530
how to use it.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.160
Apps are installed
through friends

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.010
because they recommend
them and transfer them,

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.080
and not through the play store.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.600
Onboarding through
screens does not work.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.490
It is often so people
that one learns

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.340
how to use an application.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.920
Women and minorities
are often marginalized

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.420
when it comes to access.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.190
Throughout the
emerging markets, women

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:08.850
are less likely to own a phone
or go online compared to men.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.020
In addition to gender, the
social order, religions,

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.040
identity norms, and politics
all enable or deter access

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.180
to technology.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.110
For example, one may put away
phones on Fridays or Saturdays,

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.310
depending on their religion.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.140
Taking phones out
in public places

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.560
may not be acceptable,
depending on the safety norms.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.420
Content may be
considered offensive

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.965
in a different cultural context.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.950
ASTRID WEBER: Thank you, Nithya.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.460
Let's take a moment to recap
what we learned so far.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.790
People who live in emerging
markets are mobile natives.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.880
They use low cost devices
and are more concerned

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.840
about data consumption and
the costs that come with it.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.020
And often, they have
different cultural norms.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.230
Recall that 80% of
people with disabilities

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.922
live in emerging markets.

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.380
That should be
reason enough for us

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.930
to take a closer look
at the intersection

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.370
of temporary, situational, and
permanent accessibility needs

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.280
among those next
1 billion users.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.020
The perceived value of
people with disabilities

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.800
in many societies in
emerging markets is low.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.070
In rural areas, people
with disabilities

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.370
face resentment,
as people believe

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.530
that they are kind of
second class citizens

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.480
that bring shame
to their families.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.900
Sadly, a consequence of that is
that children of those families

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.560
often don't go to school, and
some members of the village

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.090
even consider them to be cursed.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.740
While this image
is luckily updated

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:51.080
a lot in the urban areas,
people with disabilities

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.320
are still massively
underestimated by society.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.780
Due to that, the
people themselves also

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.550
don't believe that
they can contribute

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.299
in the same way towards
their social environment

00:15:02.299 --> 00:15:03.090
and their families.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.870
I'd like to illustrate
that with a quote

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.430
from one of our
blind participants.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.260
Mohammed said, "People think
disabilities are a curse...

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.570
like the parents at something
wrong so they give birth

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:16.740
to a child like that."

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.360
People with disabilities also
struggle with an inaccessible

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.290
environment around them.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.740
Most infrastructure
was not designed

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.500
for those who are blind,
rely on a wheelchair,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.700
or can't follow the general
speed of mobility around them.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.640
For example, even getting on
a crowded bus or a motorcycle

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.310
taxi can be really challenging.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.350
Generally, the
quality of education

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.720
in most emerging
markets is lower than

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.430
in the Western countries.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.730
People with disabilities are
less likely to attend school,

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.040
and also to finish it.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.010
If students have special
needs, oftentimes the parents

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.350
are expected to
attend the classes

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.110
and to help their
children, or to pay someone

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.850
to do that on their behalf--

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.890
which obviously,
not every family

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.315
is financially able to support.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.560
While support options
through the local health care

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.860
system, international NGO's,
and local community centers

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.160
sometimes exist,
people often don't

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.980
know about those,
and as a result,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.080
don't take full advantage.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.750
Also, asking for
help is unfortunately

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:22.950
often frowned upon.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.430
While laws on inclusiveness
and disability

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.190
exist in most of the
countries, too often

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.180
they are not being reinforced.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.430
Forina, who is a deaf
graphic designer that we met,

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.050
showed us how she had applied
for a total of 438 jobs,

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.210
but was not accepted
to one of them.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.080
And lastly, people
with disabilities

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.480
struggle on a very
personal level

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.370
with their own
limitations when it

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.560
comes to social
activities, which

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.340
obviously becomes more and more
important the more you grow up.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.800
For example, a
deaf student often

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.350
will find themselves locked
out from conversations

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.000
among their peers.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.700
Later on in life, when people
become married and start

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.980
families, those
with disabilities

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.770
are again at a disadvantage
because they're

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.920
considered less attractive
as romantic partners,

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.740
and people do not believe that
they can lead and to support

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.560
a family in the same way.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.599
By now, we've gained
a better understanding

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.210
about the disabilities
and the struggles that

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.920
come along for those
people who have them

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.690
in the emerging markets.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.910
In the offline
world, users who are

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.550
deaf, blind, mobility
or cognitively

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.220
impaired struggle
with gaining access

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.850
to education, employment,
and social integration.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.570
But luckily, many of them
have technology devices

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.240
that can make all the
difference for them.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.410
People with disabilities
are starting

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.710
to use mobile technologies to
grow personal independence.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.440
For example, you will see
usage of mobility apps

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.510
to organize their
own transportation

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.270
and to take advantage
of delivery options.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.450
Services that mean
convenience to some people

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.970
offer a new form of
freedom and independence

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.390
to those who were previously
depending on their family

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.530
and friends to do things
on behalf of them.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.920
With traditional transactions,
users who are blind

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.890
often have to trust that
they don't get cheated.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.460
Those who are deaf were not
able to negotiate a price.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.410
And those who can't
walk often enough

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.810
didn't even make it
to the physical store.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.390
With mobile payments
and online purchase,

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:34.180
people gain control and
receive more equal treatment.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.290
And for those with
reduced mobility,

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.890
it is essential to keep in
touch with friends and family.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.010
Social networks and
instant messaging services

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.560
enable them to participate,
contribute, and stay in touch.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.210
This is equally
true, by the way,

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.990
for education and work, which is
really the foundation for them.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.510
Thanks to assistive
technologies and their ability

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:59.320
to enlarge, announce, and
react to spoken commands,

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.530
impaired students are
getting to the point

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:06.100
to be socially, productively,
and collaboratively

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.220
just on the same
level as their peers.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.070
And while workplaces have
become more accessible

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:16.630
thanks to assistive
technologies,

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.390
also the amount of general
business opportunities

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:20.825
is increasing through software.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.550
The majority of people
in the emerging markets

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.240
work in the informal sector,
and they might operate

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.260
a little micro-business.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.260
People with disabilities can
now start their own business

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.410
at home, just like one
of our deaf users did.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.060
She plans to sell
her new clothing

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.215
line through the internet.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.000
We're really excited how
much technology has already

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.550
driven change to those
with accessibility needs

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.260
in the emerging markets.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.650
At the same time, the future
potential is even bigger.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.640
Let's do a quick recap.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.490
So far, we looked at the
themes of accessibility

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.060
and the next billion users.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.110
And within the field
of accessibility,

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.830
we touched on cognition,
mobility, vision, and hearing.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.200
Within the field of
the next billion users,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.110
we learned about infrastructure,
affordability, literacy,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.290
languages, and culture.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.210
And at the intersection
of those two,

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.620
we identified four
themes that unite them

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.210
and that we can address
through global accessibility

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.290
guidelines.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:28.095
Those four themes are awareness,
access, relevance, and design.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.300
So let's take a look
at these guidelines,

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.150
and how you as an app
developer or designer

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.951
can make your applications
accessible for the next billion

00:20:38.951 --> 00:20:39.450
users.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.840
The first category
of our guidelines

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.180
is dedicated to awareness.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.750
Being aware of your users'
needs and the potential impact

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.990
that you can have
on their lives is

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.970
the foundation for any
universally accessible

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.890
application.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.290
And so it comes as no
surprise that we recommend

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.030
that you get to
know all your users,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.480
especially those who are
very different from yourself.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.940
Now, how can you get to know
your users, you're asking.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.620
First of all, we
recommend that you

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.080
take advantage of the
wealth of information

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.570
that is provided
on the internet.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.970
Check out YouTube for some
very inspirational TED

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.890
Talks on the topic.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:23.120
Secondly, we recommend that
you make time to attend talks.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.880
You're here today at our talk,
and with that, you actually

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.560
already started.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.890
Conferences and local events
often host researchers

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.520
from emerging countries.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.020
Go.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.120
Learn from their expertise.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.350
And lastly, you can use research
tools like the Mobile Vaani

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.460
to gather feedback from the
users directly themselves.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.040
Tools like the
Mobile Vaani get you

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.830
to collect the app's
feedback from those users who

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.530
live in the most remote
places in the world.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:57.900
Secondly, we recommend that
you represent inclusively.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.080
How can you represent
inclusively?

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.630
I'll just show you some tips and
tricks with a concrete example

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.580
of the warm welcome.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.950
First of all, check how
diverse your burst your imagery

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:13.170
is, by race, clothing, physical
ability, and social class.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.960
And secondly, the
details matter.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.410
Take a look at
these pictures here.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.910
Are they inclusive?

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:22.790
Yes.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:25.870
The hands represent
different skin colors.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.070
But I would argue--

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.630
do you see left handers?

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.740
Fingers missing?

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.795
Painted nails?

00:22:30.795 --> 00:22:31.295
Bangles?

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.420
Diversity does not
mean putting the person

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.380
with a physical impairment into
a solo job or into a corner.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.340
And lastly, universal
design in your warm welcome

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.830
means that everyone,
independent of their abilities,

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.540
can access and complete it.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.650
On here, we see an example
of two warm welcomes

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.150
that I'd like to
point out to you.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.540
The first example is our
Android onboarding experience,

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.320
which contains vision settings
since the Android N release.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.810
That way, users can set
their preferences in regard

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.680
to large text, magnification
gestures, displaced size,

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.600
and talk back at
the very beginning.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.270
And so, also their
onboarding is accessible.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.310
In regard to your
own app, doublecheck.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.070
Does it actually respect
the accessibility settings

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.000
from the operating system?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.490
Secondly, Google
Wallet designers

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.690
were mindful when designing
that one welcome screen

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.960
by picking a person with color
within the illustrations.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.040
And with that, I hand
it over to Nithya,

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.580
who is going to tell you more
about the category of access.

00:23:36.811 --> 00:23:38.227
NITHYA SAMBASIVAN:
Thanks, Astrid.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.020
Can users install
your application?

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.680
Is it easy to use once
they get access to it?

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.410
Will your users be able
to use your software

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.900
without incurring a
major financial cost

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.815
or a social cost?

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.590
Can your design be responsive
and work seamlessly

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.380
over slow and
intermittent networks

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.830
and a lack of connectivity?

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.900
So, connectivity issues
without accessibility support

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.450
break the whole user experience.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.660
Just imagine waiting for a page
to load that doesn't tell you

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.470
what is happening, or
filling out a very long form

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.170
and then the system
loses the connection.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.800
Enabling state transitions
between slow, offline,

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.280
and intermittent connectivity
through progress indicators,

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.820
smart auto defaults, or
local caching of input

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.530
can be helpful.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.810
Render content progressively
instead of a batch

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.860
update so that your application
provides the perception

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.290
of being responsive.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.900
Pre-cache frequently used
content, especially when

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.820
there's a Wi-Fi connection.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.180
Design for offline as a steady
state and not as an edge case.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.970
Create a meaningful
offline state

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.000
with help resources
or onboarding screens,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.820
with cached contents or
placeholder UI's instead

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.280
of showing a blank screen.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.980
For example, YouTube's
adaptive bitrate streaming

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.220
allows video resolution
to automatically respond

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.080
to the bandwidth
conditions of the user.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.150
So, in order to ensure that your
app really works for everybody,

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.040
we highly recommend
you test your app

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.522
with accessibility services.

00:25:17.522 --> 00:25:18.880
So, how do we do that?

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.030
It's a straightforward process.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.740
Treat your
accessibility settings

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.920
as a critical user experience
and not a checklist.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.040
Simulate the most important
use cases and user journeys

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.800
with accessibility
settings enabled.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.640
And lastly, you should test your
application with real users.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.170
Only if you test
it with those who

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.990
know what it means to be
blind or deaf will you

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.730
get a complete picture
of accessibility

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.230
in your application.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:46.950
We recommend you try the Google
Accessibility Scanner, which

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:51.640
is available on the Play Store,
to debug your application.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.080
Next can you design render
and operate meaningfully

00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:00.030
on low specification devices
and older operating systems.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:03.930
Research shows that using
applications on low end devices

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.630
is much harder for
those with disabilities

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.720
in dealing with clogged up
memory, slow phones, and lack

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.940
of indicators of
resource depletion

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.310
like when battery runs out.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.780
Test your app layout on 480 by
800 pixels and less than 4 inch

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.720
screen sizes, which are
the most common screen

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.340
sizes in the world.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.850
Provide controls and visibility
into your application size

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.270
and application data as
well within settings,

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:34.140
and alert users when they
reach high levels of app data,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.020
and provide the ability to
move your app to SD cards.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.010
Minimize battery usage
for your application.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.050
Remember, electricity
is not uniformly

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.300
available throughout this world.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.430
Many people have to pay
to charge their phones,

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.680
and there may be load sharing
or complete blackouts.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.370
Build backwards compatibility
for all the operating systems,

00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.030
for example Google Translate
takes less than 10 MB

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.960
and allows offline
downloads of languages.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.600
Does your application
respect your users' budget

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.090
and financial conditions?

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:11.720
Reduce the size of your app.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.480
In our research,
we repeatedly hear

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.910
from users throughout
emerging markets

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.530
that they want to
install apps that

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.440
are more than 5 MB or 10 MB.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.640
Limit high bandwidth consumption
such as videos, rich images,

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.480
or feed models.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.490
Create transparency
into the data

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.530
heavy portions of
your application,

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.720
and request user
permission before engaging

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.710
in high bandwidth activities.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.870
For example, are you downloading
tiles for some offline usage?

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.310
Mention the size and
get user permission.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.360
Since application
updates get ignored

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.620
by users in emerging markets,
limit the size and frequency

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.540
of your app updates.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.110
Consider adding in-app
cards for new updates.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.820
Explain the value
of the update you're

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.340
providing and humanize it.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.520
For example, YouTube Go, which
was built from the ground

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:06.370
up for emerging markets, allows
users to choose video downloads

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.150
by stating the storage size
in addition to resolution.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.060
And for a user,
storage size is a proxy

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.066
for the data cost
that they will incur,

00:28:15.066 --> 00:28:16.940
which allows them to
make an informed choice.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.160
A third category
is about relevance.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.500
Your app needs to be
relevant and meaningful

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:29.080
in the context of users' daily
lives and specific needs.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.290
Does your application
feel local and speak

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.625
the language of your users?

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.630
Simple, clear, global English
makes it easy for anybody

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.100
to understand your product.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.230
Avoid slang terms
like dude and got it.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.200
Use a combination of
words and graphical cues

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.050
so that it can provide value
to both low-literate and

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.850
high-literate users.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.860
Minimize hierarchy
in your design,

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.620
like menus and tree
structures, and layout content

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.030
for browsing.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.880
This is much more accessible
for people with disabilities

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.875
and low-literate users.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.870
Reduce text input or
simplify text input

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.850
with tap versus type,
autocompleted text,

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.730
or curated content lists.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.690
For example, Google Search has
a clever language selector.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.300
Instead of hiding language
under the settings

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.240
at the bottom of
the page, Search

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.200
presents both English
and Hindi options.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.370
So, Hindi language users can
easily identify the Hindi text

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.120
and choose it.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.020
Does your application
respect social-cultural norms

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.380
in the content and
user interface?

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.470
Understand the local context
of use of your application.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.590
And this includes gender,
religion, politics,

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.770
social structures,
and public safety.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.330
People with
disabilities are very

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.460
likely to get regular
support from people

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.110
that they know or hire--

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.310
people to help them--

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.620
in going to the city
or daily activities

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.750
or navigating applications.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.850
Consider how you can leverage
this social infrastructure.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.890
In our research--
as an example--

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.310
on public Wi-Fi in India,
we heard some concerns

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.470
about entering phone
numbers in the login

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.800
screen due to harassment fears.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.120
Indian law requires
public Wi-Fi users

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.770
to enter their phone
numbers in order

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.680
to provide a code to
access public Wi-Fi.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.590
So as a design response, before
a person enters a number,

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.910
we explicitly state your
number is safe with us and link

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.370
to FAQ, which comes from the
questions that were raised

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:28.900
in user research sessions.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:31.290
Back to Astrid.

00:30:32.913 --> 00:30:34.246
ASTRID WEBER: Thank you, Nithya.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.240
The last category of
our design guidelines--

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.520
[INAUDIBLE] design.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.000
The design choices you make
while developing your app

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.570
will ultimately decide if
people will be able to use

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.640
your application or not.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.680
We have picked two
design guidelines

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.950
for today that are easy for
you to apply and make all

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.140
the difference for your users.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.150
You can find more
design recommendations

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.190
if you look into the
accessibility section

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.555
of Material Design Online.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.110
We recommend that you define
a color palette for your app

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.980
that takes contrast
as an important factor

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.090
in consideration.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.510
So, how do we get to
sufficient contrast.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.210
Life and work is often
happening outdoors.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:23.300
In rural areas, mostly
in direct sunlight.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.490
Sufficient contrast
can be the difference

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.090
between usable and unusable.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.370
For users who have low
vision, it is essential.

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.470
Remember Jonah
from the beginning?

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.899
He can only use
applications on his phone

00:31:35.899 --> 00:31:37.190
that have really good contrast.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:43.250
Sufficient contrast is defined
as a contrast ratio at 4.5 to 1

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.800
for normal text.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.680
If you have a large
text that ratio is 3:1.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.790
And large text is being
defined 18 points or larger.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.420
Also, just a tip
as a side, there

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.820
are various hacks color
testing tools online that

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.270
make it very easy
to find out what's

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.930
the contrast ratio between
the colors that you're using.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:04.420
All these tools are for free.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.890
Next, our last guideline
is actually around,

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:13.340
color alone is never enough.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.790
And what does that mean?

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.880
Colors mean very
different things

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.800
in different parts of the world.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.650
On low resolution
devices, it is much harder

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.260
to actually tell colors apart.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:29.030
In addition to that, people
will definitely perceive colors.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.760
We call that also
color blindness.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.160
Within the result of
two people looking

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.840
at two different
colors, you might

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.380
be surprised how different
they might perceive them.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.450
In order to be
accessible, we recommend

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:45.650
that you never rely on color
alone within your app design.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.390
What else can you
do, you ask me.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:50.870
Well, including design
elements in addition to color

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:54.440
to ensure that everyone
receives the same information.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.320
That can be in the
form of visual cues

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.530
that help you to communicate the
stage in which your design is

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:01.850
at the moment.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.180
Utilizing elements
such as strokes,

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.130
indicators, patterns,
textures, a text

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.310
to describe the actions
and the content,

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.020
help you use this a lot.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.470
And again, there's also free
colorblind simulation filters

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.170
on the internet that can
help you to actually check

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.870
what your application
looks like through the eyes

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.950
of various users.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.300
And with that, we've
reached the end of our talk.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.830
We will leave you
with an overview

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.980
of our global
accessibility framework.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.290
We hope that you will
continue to challenge

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:38.550
your own assumptions, and
also build up your awareness

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.470
after you leave this talk--

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.930
that you will build
options for all your users

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.850
and all their
devices, and that you

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.790
will succeed in offering
a relevant app that

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:51.480
will make design choices that
will make your app robust

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.870
and work for really everyone.

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.640
We mentioned these
throughout the talk.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.780
Here they are again.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.700
Those are our last resources.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.160
And with that, I say thank
you for your attention.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.070
And if you have
any questions, feel

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.110
free to come up to
the microphones.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:13.260
