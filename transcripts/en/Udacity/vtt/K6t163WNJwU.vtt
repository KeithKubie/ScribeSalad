00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.469
In this last lesson of the course, you're going to be introduced to some real

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.846
life examples. That can be described mathematically by exponential growth,

00:00:07.846 --> 00:00:12.294
exponential decay, and logarithmic growth. Now you've already seen the

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:15.366
equations that correspond to each of these types of functions before, so I'm

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:19.950
just going to refresh you on them. These forms I've written here may be

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.338
slightly different than what we've talked about. Note for example, that our

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:28.050
bases for our two exponential functions are e, and the base for our log

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.210
function is 10. So this is just one way of expressing these types of functions.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.960
The question is, do you remember what each of these two functions looks like?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.459
So to jog your memory on that, here are three graphs. I've labeled them A, B

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:46.869
and C and I'd like you to tell me which one corresponds to each of these types

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:48.810
of functions.
