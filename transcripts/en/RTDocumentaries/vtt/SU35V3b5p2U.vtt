00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.400
Matadi town in Congo.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.880
The Nzanza neighbourhood is a slum.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.440
Hundreds of teenage gangs operate here. 
They’re called the KULUNA.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.680
The gangs are spreading out to the big cities like a virus.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.440
It’s a social epidemic. Kulunas are mainly 
involved in theft and robbery.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.760
Supposedly employment opportunities 
are increasing in the country,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.560
but the reality is massive unemployment.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.080
The resource extraction sector is currently booming but it’s controlled by government officials.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.280
According to those who live in Nzanza, 
they only give jobs to their own people.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.720
And the rest have to survive however they can.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.400
Becoming a Kuluna is one of the popular options.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.000
This is Shina Ram. 
The leader of the Outlaws gang.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.560
Shina Ram is the short form of Shina Rambo, 
a character from a Nigerian action movie.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.920
What's the name of your town?

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080
It's Matadi

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.000
And your gang's name?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.600
Sans Loi, the Outlaws. This is the Devil's base

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.520
The Outlaws are a young gang.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.360
The kids’ are 15-17 years old.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.340
They share a street in the Nzanza neighbourhood 
with the Tricage gang.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.640
Together they form the Devil group.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.100
Are you afraid of anything?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.240
I only fear prison

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.480
What do you think about your life?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.000
It stinks!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.640
The Outlaws control the public restroom, while Tricage lords it over the Paris restaurant.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.940
This is the Devil’s turf 
and the police station is on the same street.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.640
It’s 300 metres from the Paris to the precinct.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.960
Line up! Attention

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.200
That could've been better!

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.140
Major Charles is the Chief at the police station

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.040
and it’s his job to deal with the Devil group 
 and the other street gangs.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.720
Many bad things happen here these days

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.480
It’s fashionable among
the youth to become kulunas

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.560
However, they're bandits

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.920
They walk the streets with machetes and
rob people, in broad daylight and at night

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.680
They steal, mug, and
injure people with their machetes

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.720
Today, here in Nzanza,
we've got a lot on our hands

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.440
Matadi was founded in a rocky place.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.080
That’s what ‘matadi’ actually means, ‘a rock’.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.980
And since its founding, the main jobs here 
are quarrying and stonecutting.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.020
But this kind of work is not to everyone’s liking.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.560
As a rule, the devils don’t do anything during the day. They just hang about.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.640
The guys smoke marijuana non-stop.
 It's the cheapest drug here.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.760
In Congo, as in many countries, drug use is illegal.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.801
But it doesn’t stop the gang members and

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:25.760
they seem unconcerned about 
the harm it does their health.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
By nightfall, many of them would be literally speechless.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.360
-What is your name?
-Manzak

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.120
What does it mean?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.000
It means 'claw'

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.720
So I'm a good pickpocket

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.080
I'm Rais

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.240
They call me Rais because I'm a cool devil!

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.800
I'm Lord Devil in this gang

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.200
Lord Devil! What do you mean?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.400
I mean, I'm devilishly good at getting scalps!

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.560
Nzanza streets are like a maze.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.000
If you go there, you won’t be able to get out on your own.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.600
Even if they’re just messing around,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.640
it still has violent overtones.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.280
That’s how life is here.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.200
The public restroom is a source of regular income for the Outlaws gang.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.720
There are plenty of houses here that have no plumbing, so the restroom is in high demand.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.649
‘To go number two’ will cost you 100 francs,

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:59.520
while taking a shower is also 100 francs.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.960
Our toilet's very clean

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.440
It's so clean that if you buy me a banana,
I can eat in the toilet

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.840
This guy keeps it clean

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.880
The entrance fee is 100 francs,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.680
although if you have no money,
we can let you in free

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.640
Hey, man, is it clean there?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.280
Come on

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.480
This is a friend of Shina Ram’s.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.040
He calls himself King Kalamba.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.840
He’s a good football player, 
but he can’t afford to keep on training.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.440
Now we're in the men's toilets

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.880
We conduct our business here

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.680
The Outlaws run a protection racket at the restroom

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.040
and every day they get money from the manager.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.640
He’s been in cahoots with the gang for a long time,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.040
but he appears to resist them in order to 
keep up appearances.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.160
While they were extorting money from the manager,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
one of the gang members got sick.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.640
This is our friend

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.160
We received a call
saying he'd been arrested

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.000
He's not feeling well

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.640
We don't know what happened to him

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.480
I know this guy

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.120
He plays for Damar FC

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.240
They're really bad boys

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.120
Their friend was arrested recently

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.880
He's currently in jail

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.400
Oh dear me!

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.560
That one's a very dangerous individual

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.320
If you meet him at night, that's it!

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.120
We're looking for him now

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.720
What was the last thing you stole?

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.200
I stole this phone

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.480
When was the first time you had sex?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.600
My first time? I was nine

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.920
Nine!

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.880
Who do you hate the most?

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.240
There's one man. He's a cop

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.760
Why do you hate him so much?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.160
He snoops on us all the time

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.080
What will happen if you two meet?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200
A big scrap!

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.440
Look at this!

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.560
If you hit me with it, it won't hurt me

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.280
But if we meet one-on-one and start fighting...

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.800
I'll smash your head in

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.000
So there! No hard feelings

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.960
But I'm just poor

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.760
and I really need money. I don't have any!

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.480
The Paris restaurant hasn’t been a restaurant
for quite some time now.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.680
It’s been a long time since the denizens of Nzanza

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.600
have had enough money to dine out.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.640
That’s where the Tricage gang, 
mentors of the Outlaws, hang out.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.520
Tricage’s main goal is to save up 
enough money to buy a boat

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.840
and go to sea via the Congo River.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.040
And after that, on to Europe or even America.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.160
Fiston, the gang leader, speaks
about the code of the ‘hood'.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.720
We steal and rob somewhere else

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.640
It's a bad idea to do it in your neighbourhood

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.320
You must go someplace else
because our mothers and sisters trade here

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.880
We need to maintain order here

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.480
Of course, the younger ones don’t listen to the elders.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.880
And now Shina Ram is plotting something at the neighbourhood’s southern outskirts.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.600
Do you think it's more difficult
to kill or give birth?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.880
I think killing is more
difficult than giving birth

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.040
So, if you have to kill someone...

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.200
you'll stop to think?

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.120
No, I won't think.
If I have to kill you, I will

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:24.200
Who would you like to be?

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.840
President Kabila

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.960
President Kabila doesn't seem
to be able to give everyone a good life

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.720
When I'm in his place, I'll do it differently

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.840
Everyone will have a good life

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.080
Even if Shina Ram ever runs for president, it’s going to be very hard for him to win.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.680
The ordinary people don’t like the Kulunas.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.560
When Kabila was in power,
the rules were stricter

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.320
If you got caught with a marijuana joint,
your fingers would get cut off right away

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.960
If you got caught stealing,
your hand was chopped off

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.000
Now it's anarchy!

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.520
They must catch those kulunas and chop
off their hands, straight away!

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:28.560
So when one goes down the street
people could see he's a thief

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.880
because his hands would look
like cut-off shorts

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.600
To be taken to the station is not the worst thing that could happen to a Kuluna.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.560
Lynch-mob mentality is typical in the Congo.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.760
They put a tire round a criminal, douse him in petrol, 
and set him on fire.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.840
This man was burnt

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.600
That's where his legs used to be

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.880
And here's his mouth

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.080
Nzanza consists of thousands of little houses that nestle cheek by jowl on a hill,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.440
which overlooks the city jail.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.040
What you see over there is Matadi's main prison

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.520
That's it there

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.040
King Kalamba is packing up a food parcel for one of the gang members who’s currently doing time.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.760
These are beans, here's fish, this is manioc

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.720
You don't get these in prison

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.640
If you're given anything,
it's some kind of rubbish

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.000
That's why you have to bring them food

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.120
Food must be passed to prisoners not via the main entrance,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.280
but through a hole in the fence.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.920
That's it...

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.160
You stay here, and I'll go inside

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.000
The prison security doesn't allow filming,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.840
so you stay, and I'll go to Marshal

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.400
The police consider Kalamba a good kid. He’s a footballer and can walk around freely.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.000
But Shina Ram has to hide out in the 
Paris’s shower room.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.720
He’s a wanted criminal, and tries to avoid
being seen on the main street.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.920
There’s a police officer on the beat there right now.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.240
The police are nearby,
so why can't they catch you?

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.800
Because we're very smart,
and they're dumb

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.840
But they're so close!

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.400
Yes, but they can't catch us,
because we're very careful

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.960
- How do you avoid being caught?
- When they show up, we promptly run away

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.440
That's why they can't do anything

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.040
What do you tell a girl who likes you?

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.120
- Simply 'I love you'
- And then what?

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.400
Well, then we'll talk about love...

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.760
What could make you hit a woman?

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.480
If I saw her with another man, I'd beat her up

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.080
and kill him

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.600
It seems something is going on.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.160
All the Devils are assembling in the Paris.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.480
You embarrass me

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.440
Oh come on, why?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.600
I feel awkward

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.120
Don't say that

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.960
I'm still a child

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.840
Come on!

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:59.920
You're an old lady, not a child!

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.760
Kiss me!

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.880
I'm too young

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.280
No one's innocent at your age

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.840
Are you drunk? You look wasted

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.360
No, come on!

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:21.040
Is it okay to fall in love at this age?

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.800
Of course, when else?

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.840
Fiston is unhappy with a recent robbery 
committed by Shina Ram,

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.120
so the older devils will fight the younger ones.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.520
Fighting in the ‘hood could be dangerous.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.680
So, they’ve agreed to go 
to the other side of the Congo river.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.440
But one car can’t take all those who want to fight.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.040
Muri! Where's your list?
We have to take people by the list!

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.440
Why are you all so stupid?

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.600
In the end, both gangs travel in the same car,
to save on gas.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.440
Usually, there’s a huge traffic jam before 
the bridge over the Congo river.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.560
The bridge was a gift to Matadi from Japan.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.120
And so here we are.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:39.520
The very next day, the Devils go swimming together in the Congo river.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.760
This is our river.
It's where the devils bathe

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.480
I'm the master,
and my apprentice is over there

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.840
It’s not just a group logo, it’s a magic charm.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.720
Other gangs might ask a sorcerer for help to take over the Devils’ turf or to kill someone.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.160
This sign breaks any spell.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.600
This is our Devil base's sign

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.000
If you come, you'll see it,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.000
be it in the light of day

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.000
or in the dark of night

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.400
A machete is 32 inches long.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.320
The outlaws say it’s the optimal length for a machete.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.360
Pardon me, ma'am,
do you have a cat?

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.960
No, I don't have a cat

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.640
Do you know anyone here who does?
OK, she says there's one over there

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.000
The Devils are going from door to door 
trying to buy a cat.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.600
In Nzanza, it’s not that easy.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:33.200
To the boys, a cat is a magical animal that gives people strength and ferocity.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.480
But it requires eating a feline.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.360
So the Kulunas eat cats 2 or 3 times a week.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.560
Besides, a cat is the cheapest meat you can get.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.360
The Devils are throwing a big party tonight.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.520
Friends and neighbours gather for the dinner 
made of cat meat.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.120
When we eat cats,
an evil spirit enters us

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.080
It makes us good warriors

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.840
We won't be scared during a brawl,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.320
we'll fight like real beasts

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.720
The main street is the only one in the neighbourhood.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.640
All the action happens in the small alleys 
between the houses.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.440
As soon as the crowd gathers for the party, 
a makeshift barbershop starts up.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.880
I'm the best

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.000
That's the magic of beauty

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.840
The white building up there is a church.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.400
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.920
I'm a Christian

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:06.400
- Why have you stopped going to church?
- Because they lie to you there

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.840
Girls come to services wearing short skirts

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.160
The pastor gets a crush on them

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.800
and they have sex

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.560
If you go up the path, you’ll end up at the restroom.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.320
If you go down, you’ll reach the prison.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.880
This is a very bad place to raise kids

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.840
It's just awful

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.840
Even when our older brothers
were growing up here,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.320
they ended up becoming bad guys

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:05.680
The kids that are born here today
will also grow up to be bad people,

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.000
just like their fathers

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.920
because this place is absolutely cursed

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.720
What's your favourite kind of car?

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.440
I like limos

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.360
- So, if you had the money, you'd buy one?
- Straight away

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.000
You'd drive around Matadi in a limo?

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.760
No, in a different place

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.200
Like where?

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.360
In the country where you live

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.440
- What will your house look like?
- My house?

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.880
It'll have everything:

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.560
carpeting, air conditioning, and a plasma TV

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.880
The lads haven’t partaken of cat yet, 
but they’re already angry.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.160
They can’t agree on how to share it fairly.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.840
- Let's start drinking already
- Wait, we can't start just like that!

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.040
They're going to smoke and drink what's theirs

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.280
and we'll have what's ours!

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.600
This is ours, this is ours!

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.160
We're senior here

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.120
We've counted it all

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.640
This is ours

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.720
That's the way it is...

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.920
Harmony!
When I'm here, all is good

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.400
This is me – Shakira

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.040
Everything's gonna be great!

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.960
No, they've never hurt me

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.600
If they did,
I'd never come back

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.800
But I am here,
so that means something

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.800
A week after filming, Shina Ram and Rais 
attacked an appliance store.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.600
A guard called the police, and when they arrived on the scene, they opened fire.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.880
A bystander was killed by a stray bullet.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.280
Shina Ram and Rais are currently being held in the Matadi city prison.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:35.520
What was the best moment of your life
that you can remember?

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.560
I haven't had one yet...
I will when I have money

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.400
Which parent do you love more?
Your mum or dad?

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.920
Mum

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.280
Why mum?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.800
Cause when I'm in jail, she'll bail me out
