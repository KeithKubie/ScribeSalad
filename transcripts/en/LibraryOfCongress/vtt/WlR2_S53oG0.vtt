00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.300
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: On the head
of the Libraries and Poetry

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.480
and Literature Center, let
me just say how thrilled

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.910
and bewildered I am to kick
off the last day of the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.250
"Inaugural Asian-American
Literary Festival".

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.020
What a wild three
days it has been!

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.240
Most of you have probably
gotten not so much sleep

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.640
and hopefully you'll recover
tonight after some more fun.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.930
I want to thank all the
organizations involved

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.930
for making this a reality,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.780
specially the Smithsonian
Asian-Pacific-American Center,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.200
and I want to give a shout out
to Lawrence [inaudible] Dewis

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.870
who has been -- Lawrence!

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.510
Come on! Come on!

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:11.080
[ Audience cheering
and clapping ]

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.430
I was going to say, officially
Lawrence has been my hero,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.340
for his efforts to
make this happen.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.880
We've had a lot of
meetings, done a lot of work,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.060
figuring all things out and you
know, I've worked with a lot

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.730
of people in my live
in Literature events,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.650
and no one has been as calm and
as magnanimous, and as capable,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.790
and as [inaudible]
to figure things

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.260
out as Laurence has, so, again.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.640
[ Audience cheering
and clapping ]

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.630
Let me tell you a little
bit about the Poetry

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.920
and Literature Center
here at the Library,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.050
we are home to the Poet Laureate
Consultant and Poetry and we put

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.750
on 20 to 30 programs annually.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.300
To find out more about our
programming here in D.C,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:04.110
especially for those of you who
are native to the capital area,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.180
please go to [inaudible] which
is outside in the [inaudible]

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.540
and visit our website
www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.490
And now, to explain a little bit
about this morning's program,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.090
I'd like to welcome Lisa
Sasaki, she is the Director

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.040
of the Smithsonian
Asian-Pacific-American Center.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.840
Thanks so much.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.050
[ Audience clapping ]

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.760
&gt;&gt; Lisa Sasaki: Good morning
everyone, I just wanted

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.520
to welcome all of you on behalf

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.340
of the Smithsonian
Asian-Pacific-American Center.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.340
We are all a migratory Museum.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.480
That means we don't have
a physical space, or,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.920
a location currently
what we do is,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.530
we travel around the country,
doing what our mission is,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.130
which is to amplify the voice
of Asian Pacific American,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.460
to be able, to make
ensure, that we are a part

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.860
of the American Story.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.540
And I think, there is no
better place that that happens,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.140
than in literature, and,
as represented by all

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.330
of the amazing writers,
and poets,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.050
and authors who we've seen
over the last two days,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.590
and today as well, we see how
they're able to give voice.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.110
Often times, for the first time,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.700
and in ways that the average
person isn't always able to do.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.880
About some of the things we
are facing, Asian-Americans,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.250
which is: What does it
mean to be American?

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.760
What does it mean to
be Asian-American?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.270
What does it mean when
you are "the other"?

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.430
What does it mean when you
don't look like everybody else?

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.210
What does it mean when
you're targeted simply

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.050
because of the way you look?

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.190
Or the religion that
you practice?

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.630
Or the gender that
you identify with?

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.280
These are some of the topics
that are super important,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.620
for us to be able to discuss
and I can thank the authors

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.640
who are here, who have
helped us explore this

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.450
through the last three days.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.370
I would be remised [phonetic] if
I didn't thank all of the people

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.160
who have helped us,
[inaudible], of course,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.860
Library of Congress thank you so
much; one of our major partners.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.400
But we've had other supporters
as well, which includes AARP

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.000
and the DC Commission
on Arts and Humanities,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.050
Phillips Collection,
Dupont Circle,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.060
they were our hosts
yesterday, as well as,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.490
other parts of the Smithsonian:

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.480
like the National
Portrait Gallery

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.440
and the Smithsonian
American Art Museum,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.760
who all have hosted us
throughout the duration

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.060
of the time.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.880
And of course, the
Poetry Foundation,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.230
for their support as well.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.540
But what I'm really
up here today to do,

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.020
is to introduce our speaker
for today, as well as sort

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.790
of the structure
for this morning.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.820
So, first we're going
to be having a lecture

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.260
by Karen Tei Yamashita,
which is entitled "Literature

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.070
as Community: The
Turtle, Imagination,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.910
and the Journey Home".

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.850
Followed by that we're
going to have Cathy Che

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.610
from Kundiman come up and
introduce "The Fiction Readers"

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.420
and is going to be featuring
by three Kundiman fellas so,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.710
we are excited about that.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.670
But first, let me tell you a
little bit more about Karen,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.090
I know most of you already
know who she is, and somebody

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.080
who rarely needs
introduction, but it's my honor

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.330
to do that this morning.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.530

in my hands this morning.

All published by
Coffee House Press.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.100

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:30.050
[ Applause ]

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.350
?? Karen Tei Yamashita:
So, is that going to start?

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.440
There we go.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.240
Thank you so much, thank you for
the introduction and thank you

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.290
to Lawrence [inaudible] Davis,

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.210
the Asian American
[inaudible] Review,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.660
Smithsonian Asian American
Center and the Library

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.950
of Congress and all of the
co-partners in this program

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.760
and conference, it's been a
wonderful conference these past

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.060
few days.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.430
And thank you to all
of you for coming

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.710
from so far away
to be here today.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.630
Thank you for your
invitation, I am very honored.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.260
A while back [inaudible]
professor

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.560
of literature interviewed
and asked me apologetically

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.510
if I considered myself to
be an Asian American writer,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.970
and I didn't understand the
apology, and he explained

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.340
that several of his interviewees
became somewhat in sensed

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.120
at the question, remarking
that they were American writers

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.600
who happened to be
Asian American.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.470
I asked myself, "Where
is Asian America?",

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:51.230
and what is Asian America if it
is not a political construct?

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.770
It is a naming of a category
to recognize the immigration

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.460
and participation of Asia
and Pacific Islander peoples

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.100
in American society
and political life

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.770
over the past 150 years.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.410
Initially the literature
assorted is grounding

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:14.290
with in the American Continental
history and geography,

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.310
but it has always been
called referenceable

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.170
to the necessary crossing
of the oceans, both, Pacific

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.550
and Atlantic, without which
it cannot be fully read

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.810
or understood.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.920
This navigation in
the relationship

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.840
to the Americas has not
been necessarily pacific,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.290
but often a relationship
and result

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.120
of colonialism, racism and war.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.770
As such, Asian American
literature is at heart,

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.230
a literature of politics
and resistance.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.030
So, I guess, what I am,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.510
on apologetically an
Asian American writer.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:00.140
[ Applause ]

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.260
So, with that question
out of the way [laughter],

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.890
I want to begin with
what's been asked of me

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.560
on intimate lecture
a way of thinking

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.190
about Asian American
journey, particular to me.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:21.180
Of the exact day and year,
I cannot say, but I'm sure

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.330
of that my aunt [inaudible] took
me on a drive form her then,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.350
home in Rosemont
[inaudible] California,

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.000
to visit my cousin Ted
[inaudible] at his gift shop

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.090
on Solano Avenue in Albany,
on the border with Berkeley.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.880
I'm pretty sure that my aunt
[inaudible] also came along,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.380
and perhaps we met [inaudible]
wife Barbara at the gift shop.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.610
The other purpose of that
trip was to climb the steps

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.360
to a small apartment on
the same street to meet

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.660
with the author [inaudible].

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.110
years later I would discover

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.340
in Kate [inaudible] letters her
war time correspondence with one

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.680
of her best friends Kate
Uchida, Yoshiko's sister.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.260
I took for granted
the connection

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.870
of the Yamashta family to
the Uchida's connections

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.620
through the church
and UC Berkley

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.550
and to their war-time
incarceration at Topaz in Utah.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.530
These connections were part
of a tightly net association

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.960
of Japanese immigrant
communities

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.140
in San Francisco
and the East Bay.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.900
Now, years later, we descendants
can find ourselves tracing the

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.940
weave of our relationships
and near encounters.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.220
Through the Nii Sei
[phonetic] conversation started,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.720
we often made fun of as kids.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.920
That conversation
started was always, "hey,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.440
what camp were you in?"

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.050
We thought camp could've
been a tribal event

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.730
of initiation or something.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:55.580
Why weren't we sent to camp?

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.340
I realize I can't see.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.000
I know that choosing K
had planned this meeting

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.080
with Yoshiko Uchida because
they were proud aunties

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.230
who thought I was a writer.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.280
All these years later this
memory is both comical and sweet

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.890
to me, and meanwhile
Yoshiko Uchida --

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.000
who met an Ernest Sansey
[phonetic] kids just

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.460
out of college had no idea.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.940
In those years, Uchida was the
most successfully published

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.110
Japanese American
writer of her generation.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.850
I might name other Nii
sei writers, Isa Yamamoto,

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.870
Toshio Mori, Wakako
Yamouchi [phonetic],

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.040
Nitsue [phonetic] Yamada but all
these writers only Uchida lived

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.340
by her craft.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.720
Not that she was
swimming in royalties,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.310
despite her many published books
she probably received a few

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.550
cents on every copy sold.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.350
She lived alone and
very modestly.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.340
She was, I thought,
a real writer.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.770
I remember asking her why her
stories were not anthologized

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.930
in recent collection's life
I.E. Perhaps there was a hint

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.670
of bitterness in her answer,

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.090
but her audience was
considered juvenile.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.960
Children's literature had
been a genre form she chosen

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.070
to enter the publishing world,
but it was still writing gifted

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:17.120
with sophistication; years later
she would publish her adult

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.760
memoir, "Desert Exile,
the Uprooting

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.500
of a Japanese American Family".

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.950
In the 1950s my parents
relocated

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.330
from Oakland to Los Angeles.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.050
My father, the pastor

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.060
to Japanese American church
Centenary Methodist on 35th

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.270
and Normandy Avenue, my folks

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.980
and other young Nii sei couples
had returned from the war

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.050
and camps to try to jumpstart
their lives in this old center

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.210
of the Japanese American
community in Los Angeles.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.570
We lived on 5th avenue near
Jefferson, a street line

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:56.960
with Japanese American
businesses, groceries,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.410
butcher shops, pharmacies,
dry cleaners,

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.810
candy shops and restaurants.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.920
Every day my sister and I
walked past these storefronts

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.600
on 6th Avenue elementary school.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.950
Our classmates and neighbors
were a mix of Japanese

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.250
and African Americans, but
for the most part we lived an

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.510
insular life within the church,

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.530
its Japanese American
congregation and our center.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.930
In 1949, Uchida published
her first book,

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.600
"The Dancing Tea Kettle" and
other Japanese folk tales.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.150
I assume that spoke to
have been the first book

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.760
of Japanese folk tales
written in English.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.470
So, we learned to read with
"Dick and Jane" and "Dr. Seuss",

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.970
we also grew up with
Uchida's stories.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.230
Of these tales the one story
that continues to puzzle

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:49.840
and resonate for me is
"Urashima Taro [phonetic]".

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.380
Uchida tells the story.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.940
"Long, long ago, in a
small village of Japan,

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.720
there lived a fine young
man named Urashi Mataro.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.610
He lived with his
mother and father

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.140
in a thatched grove house,
which over looked the sea.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.250
Every morning, he was up before
the sun and went out to sea

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.160
in his little fishing boat.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.990
On the days when
his luck was good,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.340
he would bring back large
baskets of fish which he sold

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.140
in the village market.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.290
One day as he was carrying
home his load of fish,

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.310
he saw a group of
shouting children.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.810
They were gathered around
something on the beach,

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.260
and were crying 'hit
him, poke him'.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.680
Turned around over to see
what was the matter and then

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.650
on the sand he saw a
big brown tortoise.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.600
The children were poking
it with a long stick

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.480
and throwing stones
at his hard shell."

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.870
This is how Yoshiko
Uchida's version

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.260
of the Japanese folk
tale begins.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.620
As the story goes,
Taro saves the tortoise

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.240
from the bullying children,
returning it to the sea.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.360
"One day while Taro is
fishing, the tortoise appears,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.030
and as a return gift
of thanks, invites Taro

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.070
to visit the princess
of the sea.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.790
Taro climbs onto the tortoise's
back and travels to the bottom

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.460
of the sea to see Princess
fed Taro with food and music

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.420
and dancing, in all the
seasons of the year.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.790
Taro lives in this luxury for
three years, which seems to him

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:27.800
like three days, but at last
Taro feels he must return home

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.580
to his parents and take
his lead, and as he leaves,

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.710
the princess gives
him a small jewel box,

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.160
stuttered with many precious
stones, and warns him

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.470
that if he returns to
the palace of the sea --

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.040
that if he wishes to return
to the palace of the sea,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.750
he must never open that box".

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.880
Well, perhaps anyway,
you know the story.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.990
Sometime after the Watts
riot and the assassination

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.880
of John F. Kennedy, and
after my father's stroke

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.600
and disability retirement,
my family moved to Gardena,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.770
an old on-clay but
Japanese American strawberry

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:13.430
and flower farmers, turning
their land into the suburbs.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.690
By then I was in high school
and cynical enough to agree

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:24.040
with my friends that Gardena
was the armpit of America.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.830
This brings me to speak of a few

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:31.240
of my Gardena high
school friends --

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:37.290
in particular, Kathy Yamamoto
and Garret Hunkle [phonetic].

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.790
Kathy was always writing,
she was the editor

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.990
of the school newspaper, but
before that she was the editor

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.590
of a fan letter for the Beatles.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:51.540
I figured Kathy was a writer
because it was in her genes.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.850
Her aunt was Hisaya
[phonetic] Yamamoto

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.730
and Hisaya's best friend
was Wakako Yamouchi,

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.180
who also lived in Gardena.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.420
Like the relationship of
my aunts to Yochiko Uchida,

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.430
I never paid much attention
to Kathy's relationship

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.630
with these two illustrious
Nii-sei writers.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.240
Some years after high school
I heard Garret complained

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.110
to Kathy, why hadn't she told
him about Hisaya and Wakako?

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:21.370
Introduced in sooner when
we were in high school.

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:24.710
Kathy replied with
amusement, "Garrett,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.620
I didn't know you wanted
to become a writer.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:38.920
Hey, I thought you wanted
to blow up the world."

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.100
He did. One Gardena
summer, Garrett lived

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.420
in an apartment block,
a block away

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.550
from Wakako Yamomuchi's
house, walking back and forth

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.190
and forming a mentoring
and writer relationship

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.220
that has lasted a lifetime.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:00.550
In 1982, Garrett published
this poem for Wakako Yamomuchi,

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.890
in his first book of poetry
Yabbo light [phonetic].

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.380
The title to the poem is
"And your soul shall dance",

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.740
honoring Wakako's short story,
a story she eventually crafted

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:19.000
into the dramatic
play by the same name.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.660
"Walking to school beside fields
of tomatoes and summer squash,

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.090
alone and humming a
Japanese love song,

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.890
you've concealed a
copy of photoplay

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.870
between your Algebra
and English texts.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.330
Your Niisak [phonetic] saddle
shoes, plaid dress and blouse,

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.770
long sleeved in white, with
ruffles down the front,

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.660
come from a Sears catalogue

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.480
and neatly complement
your new tony curls.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.790
All of this sets you
apart from the landscape,

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.870
flat valley grooved
with irrigation dishes

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.960
of tractor grinding
through alkaline earth.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.850
The short stands of
windbreak eucalyptus,

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.470
shuttering the dessert
wind from a small cluster

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:08.710
of wooden tracks, where
your mother hangs the wash".

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.870
"You want to go somewhere,
somewhere far away

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:17.030
from all the dust and swerving
machines and acres of lettuce,

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.480
somewhere where you might
be kissed by someone

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.560
with smooth, artistic hands.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.270
When you turn into the
schoolyard, the flag pole gleans

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.870
like a knife blade in the
sun, and classmates scatter

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:38.200
like chickens, shoed by the
storm brooding in your horizon".

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:44.070
I believe that what Garrett
captures here is the same desire

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.070
both he and I shared for
something beyond the confinement

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.910
of our provincial
roots and origins,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.970
even though we would
have to return again

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.280
and again in order to leave.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.020
Leading the old armpit
of my California home,

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.090
I went to school in
Minnesota, Carlton College,

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.940
and one day Alex Hayley, the
author of the autobiography

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.820
of Malcolm X, arrive to give
the convocation lecture.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.410
Though it seems an
impossible memory,

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.960
I believe we were riveted to our
seats for the next three ours,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.750
while Hayley spoke of his
relationship in writing

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.730
with Malcolm X. in
the first hour,

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.410
and then for the next two hours
he told decadent storytelling

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.380
of the transatlantic crossing

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.320
of his named ancestor
Kunta Kinte [phonetic].

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.500
I've never forgotten
that day sitting

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.690
up in the Skinner Memorial
Chapel filled to capacity.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:45.410
That we came and come from
somewhere had meaning.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:50.320
In the next few I will take
my transpacific crossing

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.170
to do what my family
called "Katie's root swing".

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.510
Figure out where we came
from and why but finding

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.640
out my roots turned
out to be a mixed bag

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.030
because I had thought it
would be the same thing

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.290
as finding belonging.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.570
If I had not entirely belonged

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:13.230
to my Japanese American
communities in LA and Gardena,

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.010
I was a really bad fit in Japan.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.580
In my continued years
at Carlton,

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.390
two professors there
were special mentors,

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.310
American literature
professor Bob Tisdale

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.150
and anthropologist Paul Riesman.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.940
Many years later I
realized that it was Tisdale

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:36.250
who quietly believed in me,
despite my huge anxieties.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.670
He was behind small invitations
to meet writers at his home

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.820
and supported my proposal
for the Watson fellowship,

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.000
that would send me to Brazil.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.270
And it was Paul Riesman who
made me understand my role

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.320
as a stranger, in the powers
of observation, empathy,

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.520
that role might support.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.750
The lessons my teachers provided
took many years to understand.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:09.500
I was sent away with two odd and
desperate but now obvious books.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.690
Claude Levi Strauss'
"Tristes Tropiques"

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:16.680
and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's
"100 years of solitude",

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.700
and I would have to
travel to the other side

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.830
of the hemisphere, a
time travel of sorts,

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.320
to meet another community
of Japanese immigrants

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.070
who had acculturated Brazilian.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.000
If these Japanese
immigrants were Brazilian,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.980
what did it mean to be American?

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.090
This is the question I pondered
while researching the Japanese

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.190
Brazilian community and writing

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.250
and rewriting the novel
Brazil Modu [phonetic].

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.990
I arrived in Brazil at the
end of the American 60s,

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:52.700
a period ripe with ideological,
racial and political turmoil,

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.170
the Vietnam War,
hippie communalism

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.520
and civil rights movements.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.460
I met a community of
Japanese Brazilians who lived

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.550
through similar experiments,
idealizing a new civilization

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.410
and practicing communalism
from the 1920s on.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:12.530
These people could've been my
grandparents -- my parents.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.160
What had happened
to their community

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.150
and how did they
survive the war years?

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:22.620
What I learned were dozens of
resilience, hubris and failure.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.700
Over the many years since
I've maintained interest

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.440
in scholarship and writing
about Asians in the Americas,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.570
I've only recently come across
maybe Asian American writing

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.740
that haunts the psyche
of Brazilian discovery.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.920
Encounters of the indigenous and
civilized science and belief,

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.110
sexuality and race
story and history,

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.670
and while her story
resides in the pacific,

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.390
in her novel "The
people in the trees",

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:53.300
Hanya Yanagihara [phonetic]
binned these narratives

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.940
in her writing with
complexity and danger.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.350
This segment from "The people
in the trees" reminds me

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.080
of the folk tale
of Hurashima Taro,

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.880
which kindly extends
darkly and magically

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.810
to explore ideas of immortality.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.130
"As my father stood
near the shore very sad,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.690
he suddenly saw something
sliding beneath the

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.340
water surface.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.680
To my father's great
astonishment, the thing rose,

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.740
and my father saw that it
was an enormous turtle --

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.590
the biggest he had ever seen.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.620
Both taller and wider
than he was,

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.440
its fetus large has law-wide
spurs, paddling the water

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.860
in brisk, forcible strokes,
and staring at my father

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.750
with its slow, yellow eyes.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.040
My father was so amazed he
found himself unable to move.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.400
But then the turtle waggled the
top half of its body to the lent

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.480
and my father understood
that he was

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.940
to straddle the turtle's back
and the turtle will take him

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.830
to Ibu-Ibu" [phonetic].

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.940
"My father had never
felt exhilaration

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.010
like the kind he experienced
riding on top of the turtle.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.630
The turtle swam gingerly
through the shallows,

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.720
careful not to scratch his feet
on the great oceans of coral.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.060
But once they were in open
water, his swimming became swift

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.710
and powerful, and they passed
coups of sharks, pots of whales

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.540
and once that magnificent flee
of other opaiba icas [phonetic].

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.310
Hundreds of them, he just
did, as the one he was riding,

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:32.290
who lifted their heads from
the water and stared at him,

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:37.830
as if in salute, with the
multiplicity of glowing eyes".

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.370
Hara captures here the idea
of the turtle as a magical

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:45.760
but also an inscrutable being
upon whose back we climb hoping

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.960
to find our destiny.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.270
Perhaps what lies ahead is
an adventure or an escape,

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.200
or the moment of our death.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.730
The turtle is the great
vehicle, on silence they ship.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.350
The responsibility

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:06.110
of our journey is only
our own, real or imagined.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.710
About the time that the
Brazilian government --

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.660
or military returned
the government

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.630
to a civilian democracy, I
left with my Brazilian family

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.500
to immigrate into Los Angeles.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.540
As predicted, LA had become a
diversely cosmopolitan city,

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.550
it's growing majority
complexion turned Latino.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:31.020
And by the time the 1992 riots
burned across our landscape,

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.770
we knew the media had completely
mischaracterized the conflicts

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.010
as black and white
or black and Korean.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.540
As Brazilians, we were part
of the Latin American shift,

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.370
and I saw to understand
that shift

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.660
in a novel called
"Tropic of Orange".

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.050
It was during this time
that I met and have ever

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.560
since been inspired by
the east LA poet Sesshu

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.690
[phonetic] Foster.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:58.020
Sesshu narrates as only Sesshu
can an alternative reality

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.230
in his non-novel
"Atomic Aztec" --

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.930
I'd better drink another glass.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:11.670
"Perhaps you are
familiar with this --

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.830
with some world stupider
realities among an alternative

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.200
universe is in which the Aztec
civilization was destroyed.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.400
That's the possibility --

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.540
I mean, that's what the
Europeans thought they planned,

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.620
genocide, wipe out our
civilization, build cathedrals

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.200
on top of our pyramids,
hump our women --

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.870
not just our women but
analyst people, designate them

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.220
with small postesels
[phonetic] and shit pits.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.740
Welfare lines, workaholism
[phonetic], imbecility

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.180
and slave them into silver
minds and Potosi, the gold minds

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.030
in El Dorado and Disneylandia
[phonetic], on golf courses

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.330
and country clubs --
chingados [phonetic].

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.550
All our brothers --
you get the picture".

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.250
"The European figure,
they wipe us out.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.490
Planee [phonetic]
and slave our people

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.070
down at Tacoma Liquor
Store, crush our resistance,

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.750
then claim it was
all an accident.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.450
Just their luck, they pretend
they just happen on their way

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.800
to India to buy some carom
and some nutmeg and spice;

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:13.790
like you just accidently happen
to designate whole civilizations

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.500
and worlds just to set a
nice breakfast table --

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.350
hot coffee, cinnamon
toast, Chinese silverware.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.560
Did we care if they
had a plan B?

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.650
Hell no, because in no way
does this fit our aesthetic

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.210
conception of how the
universe is supposed to run.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.670
It's just plain ugly.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.890
The Spanish believed they
had superior fire powder --

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.690
gun powder, crossbows, steel,
armor body, Arabian horses,

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:39.990
gallions built on convoys".

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.700
"All this was true, but we asked
to have our ways and means,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.220
we have access to the
meanest, nastiest,

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.540
psycho [inaudible] voodoo.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:55.470
Jump blues, human sacrifices,
proletarian fam guard parties.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.720
Angry coffee house, poetry,
fantasy life intensified

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.510
by the masturbation and comic
books on all our armies,

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.940
flower warriors,
jaguar legions, jujitsu

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.930
and of course, the
secret weapon.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:16.010
In a nutshell, the Spanish
didn't have a chance".

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.270
The imagination sometimes
revealed itself intensely

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:23.300
and vibrantly insane,
but it's only sane --

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.220
but it's the only sane
sight where we can do war.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.000
Bloody hand to hand combat,
express grief and anger

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.670
and find solace and
reconciliation.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:38.830
In the mid-90s I met Ryuta
Imafuku [phonetic] writers color

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.300
and cultural critic, who invited

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.890
and sponsored my family
a six-month stay in Japan

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.560
to research the return migration

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.500
of Japanese Brazilian
factory labors.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.710
During that period,
Ryuta invited me

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.580
to write online monthly
installments

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.970
about anatomy search
and travels,

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:02.060
and those essays found their
way into circle case cycles.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.770
It was Ryuta's insistent
but always gentile prodding

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.660
that encouraged me to see

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.810
and explore the growing
Brazilian Dekasegi [phonetic]

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.220
community and to see that
community in despotic movement,

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:18.910
in the context of both
historic and contemporary japan.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.260
If I had learned my lesson, as
a young stranger in years past,

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:28.990
I was given the confidence and
freedom of an old stranger.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.610
The twisting triangulations of
my world are constantly changing

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.040
and flexible, although it's
possible to name other writers

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.450
who live with such
mobility, I feel closest

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.700
to the shifting homes of
Arizamora Linmap[phonetic] mark,

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.050
moving about from Honolulu
to Manila to San Francisco,

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.530
to Miami, Madrid, Buenos Aires,

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.450
Tokyo and all these pursuing
the chaos of language

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.240
with clay and dark humor.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.780
"A recurrent immigrant story is

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.540
that laborists leave
their children behind

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.500
with grandparents or
relatives and then send

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.400
for their children years later,

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.980
when they are able
to afford to do so.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.580
This is the last scene
of Zack's novel "Leche".

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.000
The protagonist, Vince
returns from Kalili [phonetic],

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.420
Honolulu to his childhood home
in the Philippines, San Vicente,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.530
where his grandfather has
died to find the empty

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:30.620
of his family and
childhood passed.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:36.030
In the photograph, what happened
to the wall to wall photographs

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:40.190
that show generation after
generation of the Lewis clan?

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.430
Where are the hand
painted photographs of turn

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.570
of the century relatives,
one who came to the tropics

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.970
as a soldier to fight
the Philippinos

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.690
and another to teach them?

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:54.090
And the airport group shots
of himself, Alvin, Gene,

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.660
Yaya Leti [phonetic] and Don
Alfonso in front of the fountain

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:02.040
on the afternoon, they were
sent off to their parents.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.760
Whom do they belong to now?"

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:08.630
"He reassures himself
that they're upstairs

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.280
where the bedrooms are, the
runs up the wooden staircase,

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.580
head straight forward
to the room

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.620
as if he lived there all his
life -- it too was empty,

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.890
as empty as the succession
of closets

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:22.300
and cabinet drawers he pulls
open, hoping to get assaulted

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.940
by memorabilia, smelling
of moss balls, but nothing.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:31.450
No one dusty shelf of books
or issue of comics -- empty".

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.910
"Fighting off tears and with
a heart that doesn't know

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.840
when to give up hope, he
searches room after room,

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.370
wall after wall, for halls
punctured by nails upon

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.350
which used to hang the guilt

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:47.660
and picture frames he checks
the inside of doors for shadows

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.490
of the photographs that
had once been tacked there.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:56.540
He took everything with him, to
his grave -- he tells himself,

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.970
he didn't want me to return
and reclaim what was mine.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:05.320
My family history, objects from
my childhood, nothing salvage,

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:12.110
nothing, except this house,
smelling of mule waxed floors".

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:15.920
Zack mourns here the loss

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.490
of home while showing the
predicament of mobility

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:24.650
of the transnational, as a stage
of new, global citizenship,

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:29.070
often celebrated but also
for many, migrant labors,

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.420
a state in limbo, and
great precarity [phonetic].

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.750
So, it seems that here the
great turtle with its shell

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.620
as home has a different lesson.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.930
How we must also travel within
our bodies, even if marked

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:46.230
by ethnicity, gender and color.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.500
In the late 90s I began
teaching at UC Santa Cruz.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.250
And along with learning
how to teach I made forays,

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.320
into San Francisco to research
the Asian American movement

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:10.530
as it is was birth in Chinatown,
Manila Town, Japan Town

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.810
and then the universities,
the factories, culture

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.980
and political institutions
spawned in that period.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.280
And I would have found --

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.600
and I found the center
of that narrative

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.490
in the international
or the I-Hotel.

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:30.460
As with other projects, I sat
out to be a gathering machine,

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.710
recording Marriott stories of
anyone willing to talk to me.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:39.020
I never recorded anyone
on a recording machine.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.780
My method has been to record
with my body, and to remember,

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.970
well, everything, bodily
expression, insinuations,

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:50.990
syntax, cadence and story.

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:57.800
The most difficult recording was
the one I tried to accomplish

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.040
with the poet Al Robles.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.710
I met with him at Vesuvian
[phonetic] North Beach next

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:08.110
to city lights and sit
close with him for hours,

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.770
while I tried to pin down the
most preposterous stories.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:16.350
By the time they grew dark, he
stood up and said, "hey Karen,

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:20.250
let's get some dirty food",
which meant that we would go

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:25.680
to Chinatown and slip into a
greasy diner for chop suey.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.320
I think I dropped him off
at home around midnight

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.850
and headed back to Santa Cruz.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:36.100
I was exhausted, I've been
recording from maybe 12 hours,

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.020
maybe I didn't get Al's
stories right, but he was,

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.330
as his friend said, the
poet Monka [phonetic]

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:47.430
that tendered a loin
and I miss him dearly.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:49.320
Al with the help of
Roselian [phonetic]

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.010
at the UCLA Asian
American studies center,

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:56.220
published one book of poetry,
"Wraping with 10,000 caravans

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.680
in the dark" and this
is the first stanza

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.790
of that signature poem.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:05.690
"International hotel in the
Mongol heart in east the mind

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:09.430
of the Philippines where old
and young Philippinos live,

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:12.820
hang and roam around on
daylight cutouts in the mud.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.360
Eating, sleeping and working,
Philippinos scattered all over,

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.960
brown faces pile high,
moving like shadows on trees,

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.540
concrete doorways, poohas
[phonetic], barber shops.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.960
Guitar music echoes
through down deep

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.330
in your Mongol heart
and ease their mind.

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:34.280
Chinatown across the way, 60,000
or more live in rooms the size

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.170
of tea pots, searching,
stretching east,

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.070
west, north and south.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.560
Thousands are crammed in damp
basements, alleyways behind,

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.500
run down barrels of ancient
Chinese mountain wine,

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.850
thousands of Chinese children
run, soy sauce streets,

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:55.380
long black-haired
listening like a cool stream

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.060
of quiet moon watches".

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.630
"Short crop of hair,
morning spring faces,

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:04.600
underneath fresh soaked clouds;

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:11.580
all those tiny footsteps
keep the winter valley warm.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.310
Similar to the turtle algae,

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.580
the old Philippino
batches the Mongol are kind

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.190
of mythical stages as cut about.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:23.690
Watcher buffalo, roaming
so rarely in the halls

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:27.090
and teapot rooms of the
international hotel,

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.410
mud replaced by concrete
doorways,

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:33.210
barbershops poohas,
soy sauce streets".

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.290
In the past years I've
been forced to think

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:40.200
about the future, probably
because many of my students want

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.130
to write science
fiction and fantasy.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.820
What the academy has
rebranded as speculative.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:50.060
My colleague Nika
[phonetic] Perks pointed

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.810
out that I've been a
speculative writer for years,

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:55.240
I just didn't know
it, and with the help

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.960
of Steven Honsong [phonetic]
I published "Anime Wong",

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.250
fictions of performance.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.980
This work remembers
my collaborations

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.770
with director Sushiko
Hoshi, ideographer,

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:09.710
Karamaeda [phonetic]
and composers

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:13.290
that kept Beabe [phonetic]
and Glen Horiuchi [phonetic].

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.630
And the dozens of actors,
dancers, designers,

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.080
stage personnel and producers

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.120
who joined our performance
projects presented at venues

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.800
in Los Angeles for Asian
American audiences.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.550
Recently, more Asian American
writers have taken a turn

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.740
to the speculative,
and I have followed

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.450
with admiration the
work of Chang Ray Lee

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.930
since his book "Native Speaker".

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.870
Most recently his novel "On

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:44.540
such a fool sea" imagines
the present future of vacated

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.010
and bided cities and the
global exchange of labor

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:53.910
in a completely secular society,
governed by class and capital.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.580
What follows are
edited selections

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.420
that introduce the collective
narrator are the protagonists

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.950
of Chang Ray's novel.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:15.760
"It is known where we came from,
it is known where we come from,

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.810
but no one much cares
about these things,

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.770
but things like that anymore.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.870
We think 'why bother?'

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:27.790
Except for a lucky few,
everyone is from some place

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:31.610
but that some place
it turns out is gone.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:34.200
You can search it, you
can find pits or bits

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.600
that show what the
place last looked like.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.310
In our case they
gavel color shop town

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:44.890
of stoop shouldered buildings
on a river bank in china,

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.870
shore hills in the
distance, rooftops

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.590
and nests of wires and junk.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:54.120
The river tea still,
a swath of black,

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.630
and blunting it all is a
haze you can almost smell,

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:01.800
a smell you think you
don't want to breathe in".

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.270
"So, what does it matter if
the town was raised one day?

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.290
After our people were
truffed [phonetic] out,

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:08.870
what difference does it make

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.040
that there's almost
nothing there now?

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.370
It was on the other
side of the world,

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:16.720
which might as well be
a light year away --

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.400
though probably it was mourned
when they were thriving.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.280
People are funny that way,
even the most miserable kind

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:30.140
of circumstance can inspire
a genuine throb of nostalgia.

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.210
And then there is
the tale of Fan,

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.720
a young woman whose
cause has been taken

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.870
up by a startling number of us.

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:39.510
She's now gone from here,

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.350
and whether she's
enduring her suffering

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.870
or dead is a metaphor
her household,

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.300
whatever their disposition".

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.770
"They're gone too.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.490
We can talk about her openly

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.500
because hers is no grand
tragedy, no apocalypse

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.760
of the soul or of our times,
yet there are those who would

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.260
like to believe otherwise,
that each and every being

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.870
in the realm is a mock
of micocosum [phonetic]

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:06.230
of the realm, that we are
hardened and chastened

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.710
and elevated by a
singular reflection.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:13.740
This is a fetching idea,
metaphorically and otherwise,

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.850
most often would sit for
promoting the greater good.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.180
But more and more we can see

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.090
that the question is not
whether we are individuals.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:28.570
We can't help but be, this
has been proved case by case.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:31.530
We are not drones or
robots and never will be,

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.730
the question then is whether
being an individual makes a

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.070
difference anymore."

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.980
"That it can't matter at
all and if now whether

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.950
in fact we care -- to try
and care about such things.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:46.270
Let's suppose another
way of considering here,

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:51.500
which was that she had a special
conviction of imagination.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.060
Few of us do to be honest.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.490
We wish and wish and often
we furiate [phonetic]

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:01.580
but never very deeply, for if we
did we'd see how the world can

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:07.690
sometimes be split open
in just the way we hope.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:12.510
That it and we, in
fact, are unbounded --

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:18.870
free" Perhaps it's not obvious
but what I have attempted here

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.630
to do is to weave a personal
history with encounters

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:27.940
of community, remembered and
imagined as literary registry.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.240
Why I ended up writing?

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.360
I'm not sure.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.120
It wasn't genes or
a passionate choice,

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.480
it's probably the only thing
I'm really equipped to do.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.460
But in reflection of this
journey I have traveled within

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.850
and been a part of
many communities,

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.090
perhaps is the familiar
stranger,

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:49.260
providentially there
and not there.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:54.350
An empathetic observer, wanting
to learn, carry to record --

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:58.820
that has been my particular
role and contribution.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.440
There are many writers
whose names

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:04.170
and words I might have
also shared today.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.390
But given the time, those
mentioned here are a few

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:13.310
of those with whom I have
grown up and grown old.

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:18.150
Immigrants, refugees, exiles
by the fortunes of life,

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:22.030
have set forth on the
backs of immortal turtles

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:25.920
to distant places or
perhaps not so distant,

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.520
but alternates display bummed
out realities never again

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:35.480
to return, or discover that
return is never possible.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.760
Asian American might
be an imagined island

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.260
or an undersea palace.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.530
Perhaps it is Hania's
Ibu-bu, Sesshu's East LA

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:53.700
or Al's I-Hotel, or it is Zach's
limbo, Garrett's somewhere,

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:56.890
Chang Ray's unbounded world.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:03.180
As Yochiko Uchida has retold
the story of Urashima Taro,

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:07.660
Taro returns from the sea palace
on the back of the gray tortoise

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.640
to his village and finds
it completely changed.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.260
And where his batch for
home should've been,

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:18.310
there is an empty lot
full of tall weeds.

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:21.800
He quirs an old woman,
who he calls a story

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.620
about a young fisherman
named Urashima Taru,

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.800
who went out to fish
and never returned.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:33.620
This she uses must have
happened 300 years ago.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:38.950
Confused but thinking that
the jewel box gifted to him

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:45.420
by the princess must hold
an answer, he opens the box.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.300
Suddenly there rose from
a cloud of white smoke,

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.920
which wrapped itself around
Taro so he could see nothing,

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.390
and when it disappeared,
Urashima Taro appeared

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:03.250
into the empty box but he
could scarcely hear sea.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:06.190
He looked at his hands
and they were the hands

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:08.700
of an old, old man.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:15.210
His face was wrinkled; his
hair was white as snow.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:20.290
This year coffee house press
will publish letters to memory,

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:23.160
and while I'm unable to
characterize the book,

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.820
my editor Carolyn
Casey has said,

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:29.410
as I say "it is the
word based on an archive

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:32.560
of family correspondence
documents and photographs,

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.950
the center of which are letters
written between 1938 and 1948,

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.640
capturing the family's
war time dispersal

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.430
from Oakland California,

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:45.640
to Topaz concentration
camp in Delta, Utah.

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.470
And beyond the schools and work,
in the Midwest and east coast,

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.810
and for a portion of the family,

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.900
their eventual return
to California.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:57.560
The form my book has
taken is epistolary --

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.160
that is fictional letters and
what follows is the first part

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.560
of letter until after.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:17.710
"Dear Kohele [phonetic],
you're a preacher's kid.

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:20.340
When we met we recognized
each other immediately

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:24.810
that pique je ne se
qua, like we're supposed

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.660
to be doing something
significant eventually

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.930
or actually, like we were
raised with everyone looking

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:34.910
on politely resentful,
assuming we knew --

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:38.560
when we didn't and thus
perpetual strangers in a world

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.740
of blessed woe, primed
by difference to serve.

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.930
One day I heard your
lecture, and I turned to you

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:50.210
after in marvel --
'you gave us sermon'.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:53.100
You answered 'all my
lectures are sermons'.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.730
I thought 'mine too, maybe'.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:47:00.950
Frustrate picas, but you must
have really been frustrated

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:04.040
because finally you entered
the seminary and got a master

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.610
at definity [phonetic].

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:08.460
I could never do this,
well you believe,

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.080
which is kind of necessary.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.740
One day I came home from junior
high school and announced

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.630
at dinner that I discovered
a philosopher named John Paul

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:23.640
Sartre, and a great idea
caught existentialism.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.190
I can't remember what
my dad John said,

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:28.650
but that was the beginning.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.970
I had been that kind of pique.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:33.420
Heading out in another
direction where turns

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.350
out anyway to be the same.

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:36.880
I figured you understand

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.650
and that you'll know the
skinny and funny of it.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:45.250
Recently I saw yet another
staging of Shakespeare's

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:49.570
"King Lear" and I wondered about
those good and bad daughters,

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.610
silent tribute versus
false fanning

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:55.940
and this reading
of love and honor.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:00.130
Do daughters naturally
aspire to be Cordelia?

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:03.380
Or is this an impossible
and romantic notion

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.760
of set-by-character
and circumstance?

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:14.130
"No, no, no, no" cries Lear to
Cordelia, broken and unwilling

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:16.830
to further challenge his fate.

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:20.560
'Come here' encourages
her 'let's away to prison'

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.730
and then these last
words to his daughter,

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:31.600
'We too alone will sing
like birds of the cage.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.190
'When bow does sassy
blessing, I'll kneel down

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:37.070
and ask of thee forgiveness.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:41.260
So, we'll live and pray and sing
and tell old tales and laugh

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:45.440
at gilded butterflies and hear
poor rogues talk of court news

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.090
and we'll talk with
them too, who loses

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.750
and who wins, who's
in, who's out.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.650
And take upon us the
mystery of things,

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:57.390
as if we were God's
spies, and we'll wear

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:02.310
out in a wall prison packs
and sex on great one that eve

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.140
and flow by the moon'".

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:13.090
I am drawn to memories in
which we live and pray and sing

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:16.220
and tell old tales and laugh.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:21.760
But this was the laugh, oh but
to laugh at gilded butterflies,

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.630
this must be the satirical
laughter that I am prone to.

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:29.310
But John would say that
this is not truly laughter,

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:32.640
not the laughter that
preoccupied his thinking.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:36.420
It is not laughter at,
but laughter within,

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.570
I think, that concerned him.

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:43.500
I am growing old, searching
for this kind of laughter,

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:48.430
and where is he now that
this laughter is needed most?

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:53.430
Meanwhile I have found myself
beholden to the lost possibility

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.890
that we take upon us
the mystery of things

00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:00.540
as if we were God's spies.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.790
Perhaps this has been the
meaning of these letters,

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.490
though surely no
mystery is revealed here.

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:14.350
Simply we have been
together before time to try.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:17.910
Thank you.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:51:03.710
[ Applause ]

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.190
&gt;&gt; Lisa Sasaki: Thank you so
much Karen, that was just --

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:09.340
I was just sitting
there thinking and sort

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:14.070
of contemplating this idea of
the legacies that we all stand

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:18.690
on right now, the writers,
the family members,

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:22.900
the letter writers, the heroes
that have come before us,

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.040
who I think we're
constantly thinking of in --

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.460
even as we move forward
into the future.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.580
So, now I'd like to go
into the future right now

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.850
with our next part of our talk.

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:35.780
But before I do that I wanted

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.310
to just make a quick
invitation for this evening.

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:42.800
The Asian-Pacific American
center would like to invite all

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.570
of you -- anybody here, who has
participated in the festival

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:50.930
to join us this evening for
an informal closing gathering

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:54.150
at "Ten Tigers Parlor",
this evening from 05:00p.m

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.200
to 07:00p.m. We would
love to have you there,

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.610
we're going to be remediating
on the festival and coming

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.550
up with grand ideas
for the future.

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:02.870
So, please join us.

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.950
Kathy, if you could
join us up here

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:08.570
to introduce our next leaders.

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:11.250
&gt;&gt; Kathy Lin Che: Thank you
so much and thank you Karen

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.530
for that intimate lecture.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.560
I was so -- I feel like
all my neurons are on fire

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:22.030
and I feel just so honored to
have that sense of history.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:24.400
So much of what we
do so, hi, I'm Kathy,

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.620
I'm the executive director
at Kundiman [phonetic].

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.920
We are an organization

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.940
that serves Asian American
writers specifically.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:36.530
Our mission is to -- we're
dedicated to the creation,

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:38.620
cultivation, motion of
Asian American literature

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:44.970
but specifically I think what we
look to do is really to nurture

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:47.910
and mentor and teach
the next generation

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:50.880
of Asian American writers
and I think having a sense

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.890
of our history is so
important so, thank you.

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:58.030
Our next three -- so, we have
three readers from Kundiman

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:01.850
who will be presenting
their work.

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:04.740
Each person has such
a different story

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.600
to tell so, I'm very excited.

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.320
And I had hold up
their bios on one

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.010
of these devices
-- here they are.

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:19.070
OK so, I'm going to read all
of their bios in sixth session

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:24.500
and they'll come up in the eight
so, our first reader is VT Hung.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.440
VT was born in Dorchester,
Massachusetts.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.900
His parents are both people

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.660
who opened the first Vietnamese
grocery store in Boston.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.770
He received his education
from BC High --

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:37.590
Boston College and the
Lynch School of Education,

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:39.630
the Boston Public Library.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:43.750
And WGBH Channel 2.

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:47.290
He's Kundiman fiction
fellow and Margin's fellow

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:50.000
at the Asian American
writer's web shop in NYC

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.530
and currently he's
completing his MFA

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:56.790
in Creative Writing Syracuse
University in Fiction.

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:58.090
I decided not to give --

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:01.510
I changed my mind,
everybody welcome VT.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:10.500
[ Applause ]

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.280
&gt;&gt; VT Hung: Hi, everyone.

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:15.270
I am -- my background's
an education so,

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:16.570
I'm going to let you know

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:18.780
that I'll be reading two
short pieces of fiction.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.500
The first one is one page,

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:25.330
the second one is four pages
so, you know, get ready.

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:28.900
When I told some of my friends
in the program that I was going

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.570
to be reading today they said
"make sure you read something

00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:34.000
that has sex or violence,
because that sells.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.650
Like, that's going to
be really popular".

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:39.320
I can't promise you all
that but I can tell you

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.630
that there's going to be cats

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:44.940
and sadness so, like,
just as good.

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:47.210
Like, it'll be -- it's fine.

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:52.090
So, before I start, I want to
thank you Karen Tei Yamashita

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:57.110
for her beautiful, important
lecture, and I can't believe I'm

00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:58.820
on the stage that you
were just standing on.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:02.520
I want to thank you Lauren
Smith Davis, Nydia Cook and all

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.650
of the organizations
and staff involved

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:07.730
in making this successful
reality, the Smithsonian A-pack

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:10.480
and Lisa Sasaki, Kuni
[phonetic] Man, Kathy Linh Che,

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.060
Ryan Lee Wong, the Asian
American writers workshop,

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.390
Ken Cheng and Jyoti
Nadarajan [phonetic],

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:16.870
and for all of you coming

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:19.680
to support Asian American
artist and their work.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.360
And lastly shout out to
Balok and Tudiq [phonetic],

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.030
the provinces where my
Vietnamese refugee parents were

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:29.000
born and to Dorchester Mass,
where I was born and raised.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.600
I can't believe we're out here
in the library of Congress.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.640
What a Boston -- all right.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.740
So, how I generated this piece
-- this is the one-page piece.

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.850
Last year I moved from
New York City to Syracuse

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:46.410
to begin my MFA program and I
went through a very long breakup

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.270
and had a lot of
trouble finding sleep.

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:56.100
This piece is called
"2:16a.m.". "On my life,

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.690
I waited to be kept up at night.

00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:00.110
And it finally happened.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.680
At first, I told myself it'd
been a mistake, but after a week

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.180
of waking up in the
middle of the night,

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:08.850
I took the red line teleport
to the sleep exchange center

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.130
in the Floating Medical
District.

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.570
I drew a number from
the ticketing machine

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:16.430
and waited my turn to meet
with a dream official,

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.090
who checked my records.

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:21.220
Unfortunately, no one
had reported my presence

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.620
in their dream.

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:25.450
The official assured me that
records were up to date,

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:28.750
with data gathered each
morning from dream monitors.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.760
'It might have been that
you were just an extra

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.000
in the background
of someone's dream.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.900
That happens more than you'd
expect' the dream official said.

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:40.680
'OK' I thought, So, maybe
I wasn't the lead role

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:45.550
in someone's dream, fine but
my restlessness continued.

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:48.480
It lasted another
two weeks, then three

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:53.500
and after a month I resolved to
find out who was keeping me up.

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.390
But how'd I go about it?

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:59.340
If I asked them politely,
would they stop dreaming?

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.980
Whoever they were,
they've been consistent.

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.700
Maybe they were falling
in love with me,

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.750
if they weren't already.

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:07.770
In the end, I decided
it would be best

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:09.680
to wait another week or so.

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.920
For now, the routine
brought me some comfort.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.760
I fall asleep and
the night wakes me,

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.590
the moon keeps me company
and then I remember

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:20.190
that when you cannot sleep,

00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:24.790
it is because someone
is dreaming of you."

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:26.950
All right, oh.

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:30.790
All right so -- [applause].

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:36.820
The next story, which is four
pages long, double spaced,

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.050
is called "Tiger, Tiger".

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:47.200
"The portal dropped the child
an unfamiliar ground" --

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.760
that's right, there's a portal.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:52.800
"Against all decrees of
high science and witchcraft,

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.190
her uncle had summoned it.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.590
Our world is finished', he said,

00:57:57.590 --> 00:58:01.140
'you and what I had trust you
now will be the last reminisce

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.510
of our civilization'.

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:04.940
He opened the child's rug sack

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.920
and placed inside
it a large parcel.

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.520
'Do with it what you wish'.

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.420
The child adjusted the
straps on his shoulders

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.610
to settle the weight
on her back.

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.170
Outside the three-night
moons were falling

00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:19.600
from the sky toward her planet.

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:23.090
If she felt distressed,
her face betrayed nothing.

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:26.190
But her uncle sensed it, and
in these final moments he broke

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:30.360
with social procedures
and attempted sympathy.

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.960
'While this is certainly not the
time to disorient my faculties

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:38.540
with sentimentality' -- he said
-- then he paused 'my niece,

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.610
what I mean to say is
if we should meet again

00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:46.060
in the next life, I hope'
-- before he could finish,

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:49.420
the white maids rode through the
gates and an explosion of smoke

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.370
and lighting had struck
her uncle down dead.

00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:57.250
The force of the blow knocked
the child through the portal.

00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:59.520
The sound of rushing
water will care.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.000
She was in a clotted
forest surrounded

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.420
by tall towers of limestone.

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.160
She'd lost track of her rug
sack and searched for it,

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.630
before locating it
by the riverbank.

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:12.930
Streams lumps had formed inside
it and were shifting around,

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:17.380
slowly, like an owl snake
uncoiling its feathers,

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.630
the top of the rug
sack flew open

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:23.610
and out tumbled two tiger cubs.

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:25.990
The child was struck
by how small they were,

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:29.100
how they lacked mastery
over their motor skills.

00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:31.650
But the most extraordinary
characteristic

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:35.550
about them was they
emitted not a single sound.

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:40.960
Not a meow, squeak nor purr
-- they were silent tigers.

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.900
After they shared a deep
drink from the river,

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.200
the child scoot them up

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.130
and secured them back
inside her rug sack.

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:52.660
She found a road and
road it for many days.

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:55.330
The tiger cubs were so
quiet, if it hadn't been

00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:57.460
for their intermittent
wrestling matches,

00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.090
she would've assumed
they expired.

01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:03.160
By the time she reached the
port town the tiger cubs were

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.090
perpetually falling asleep.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:09.150
Every so often, she reached
behind her to scratch their ears

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:13.350
and pet their bellies to
ensure they could still wake.

01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:14.880
They did not find the rest

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.450
that they'd hoped
for in the port town.

01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:20.570
The citizens demanded payment
before they would provide the

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.650
child with food and shelter.

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:27.010
"Unfortunately, I have nothing",
she said, standing up straighter

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:30.660
to keep her rucksack and
tiger cubs out of sight.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.650
Her stomach contracted with
hunger, and she felt the paws

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:36.570
of the tiger cubs
kneading her back.

01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:41.120
She thought of her uncle's last
words, the world they lost,

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.330
the difficult choice
she now had to make.

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:47.740
She found the section of the
market where animals were sold,

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:51.480
and lifted the two tiger
cubs out of her rucksack.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.680
Many collectors inquired
about them,

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.090
but when the tigers' vocal
derangement was revealed,

01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:58.700
customers left.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.180
"Of what use are mute
tigers?", They said.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:05.700
The merchants were closing down
the market stalls for the night

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:09.680
when a gust of wind blew through
the town, a woman shrouded

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.730
in a tattered cloak limped
slowly toward the child

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:15.020
and her silent tiger cubs.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.190
In exchange for one
of the tigers,

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:19.850
she presented the
child with a machete.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:24.030
"It is enchanted", the cloaked
figure said before slipping away

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:26.510
into memory.

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:29.210
The child and the
remaining tiger continued

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:31.270
on in this new world.

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:33.210
When the child wielded
it, she could cut

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:36.870
through the thickest tree truck,
the densest seal, but they kept

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:39.160
to themselves and
focused on the mundane

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.590
but peaceful task of living.

01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:44.390
The child collected firewood
while the tiger watched her

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:45.690
from a tree.

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:48.850
The tiger a into lakes
and rivers to catch fish,

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:51.400
and the child cleaned
it with her machete.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.250
They raced across the forest
together, the child clinging

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.700
to the back of the tiger.

01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:01.430
They played the way cats would,
pouncing, racing, fighting.

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:03.520
They moved on when restless.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.800
They slept out on open fields
and watched shooting stars,

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.370
tracing it with their
fingers and claws

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:12.760
like they were the ones
tearing up the sky.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.790
Sometimes they wondered about
the lost member of their trio,

01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:19.010
but never discussed it in the
language that they shared.

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:20.890
"Dwelling in the
past is not essential

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:25.110
for surviving the present",
she could hear her uncle say.

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:29.000
The child grew into a woman,
the cub into an adult tiger,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.750
but still they were hunted
by a lingering sense of loss.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.690
Consequently, they
never wandered too far

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:36.070
from each other.

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:37.870
Like the sun and the
moon, when one appeared,

01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:40.700
the other was not far behind.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.140
When they reached the city
between two mountains,

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:46.720
an assembly of witches
and warriors approached.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.050
A white mage was wreaking havoc
at the edge of their world

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.080
and they were going to stop him.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.320
Would the young woman warrior
and her battle tiger join them?

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.110
The two conferred privately
before arriving at a decision.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.750
"Certainly!", the child
said to the assembly,

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.090
"Our own home world is lost.

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:07.880
We have grown accustomed to
this one and would prefer

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.910
that it not end prematurely".

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:13.640
The child and her tiger covered
many lands with the assembly

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.970
of witches and warriors
and fought hard

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:19.660
against the sorcerers and goblin
soldiers of the white mage.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.640
They rushed headlong into war,
clearing entire battalions

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.850
with their combined ferocity.

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:27.630
The tiger's sharp claws
and fearsome teeth,

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:31.050
the child's strength and skill
with her enchanted machete,

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:34.400
these helped to turn the
tide of crucial battles.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.340
In the final confrontation,
however, the warriors

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.520
and witches were
thoroughly laid to waste,

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.170
their contorted corpses
were scattered at the feet

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:45.900
of the white mage
in his throne room.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.870
-- I have destroyed countless
worlds, and will continue doing

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:53.410
so -- he said -- Who are
you to suggest otherwise?

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:55.360
-- The child braced
her enchanted machete

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.390
and struggled to her feet.

01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:58.950
Suddenly, she felt a touch

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:02.480
on her shoulder beckoning
her to stay down.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.130
It was her tiger, whose fur
was covered in deep gashes

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:08.990
and purple patches of blood.

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.400
-- The silent tiger from a
lost world -- said the mage --

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.920
How utterly useless -- The
tiger lurched from the center

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.020
of the throne room to
face the white mage.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.900
Then, it crouched
close to the ground,

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.370
and exploded into a sprint.

01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.250
Just as it was about to pounce,

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:27.350
the white mage conjured
a frost spell,

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:29.820
and hurled a shard
of ice at the child.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:33.300
In an instant the tiger
changed course midair

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.950
and leapt out in front of it.

01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:38.230
The ice tore into the
tiger's soft belly

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:41.490
and remained there
until it melted.

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:44.570
The child dragged herself over
to her tiger and turned her back

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.930
to the white mage to shield
her wounded companion.

01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:52.010
She alternated between
scolding and thanking the tiger.

01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:54.840
Sensing this was the end,
she cried for her world,

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.460
her uncle, and her tow tigers.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:01.220
She scratched behind the tiger's
ears and stroked its tail.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:04.400
The tiger nuzzled
her calloused hands.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.100
-- Please, forgive me for
separating you from your sibling

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.470
when you were merely
cubs -- she said --

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:13.140
I was immature and lacked the
requisite sources, material

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:16.820
and intellectual, to
keep your bond intact --

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.960
Looking at her, the tiger purred

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.840
until the ground
trembled, and then died.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.780
In rage, she picked up
her enchanted machete

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.770
and hurled it at the white mage.

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:28.580
It pierced through
his magic defenses

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.860
and struck him in the chest.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.610
The white mage burst
into flames,

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:34.830
and his magical powers
dispersed,

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:37.470
ripping open another portal.

01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:41.180
A voice called from beyond,
"Hold a time and place

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:44.280
in your mind, and step through".

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.880
The child picked up
her enchanted machete,

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.670
and stepped toward the portal.

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:52.560
-- The white mage is dead, and
my tiger has deserted me --

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.200
she said -- Never did I
envision standing once again

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.530
on the crimson shores
of my home planet

01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:01.520
to gaze upon the
three-night moons".

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.310
Machete in hand, a
time and place held

01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:07.680
in her mind, she
stepped through.

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:14.270
The portal deposited
her in a port town.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.330
She found a tattered
cloth in the ground

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:18.790
and wrapped it around
her shoulders.

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.260
She remembered where
she needed to go.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.750
The merchants were closing down
the market stalls for the night,

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:26.470
and in the section where
animals are being sold,

01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:29.490
a child stood holding
out a rucksack.

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:33.260
She limped slowly toward the
child and traded her machete

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.660
for one of the two
silent tiger cubs.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.790
-- It is enchanted -- she
said before slipping away

01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:41.810
into memory.

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:43.610
Thank you.

01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:55.200
[ Applause ]

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.930
&gt;&gt; Lisa Sasaki: All I have to
say is Vt does have a kitty,

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:02.450
and I just imagined that he
wrote that just like tumbling

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:04.240
around with your kitty,
and that's very cute

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.170
so thank you for that.

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:09.150
Our next reader is Mark Keats.

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:12.900
Mark Keats was adopted from
South Korea at the age of three.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.420
He earned his MFA in Fiction
at the University of Maryland

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.200
and is a recipient of
a Kundiman Fellowship.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.180
His work has appeared or is
forthcoming in [inaudible]

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.380
with Ron Corderly
[phonetic] and others,

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:28.320
and he's currently a PhD
candidate in the English

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.870
and Creative Writing Program
at Texas Tech University.

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:34.780
I know he's currently
dissertating.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:39.340
So, please give Mark
a warm welcome

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.510
in the middle of
his dissertation!

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:50.600
[ Applause ]

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:58.140
&gt;&gt; Mark Yeats: This is not
intimidating at all, right?

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.750
[laughter] I would also like
to thank Karen Tei Yamashita

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:05.120
for her lovely lecture, I
think it's very appropriate.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.890
It's very shocking to
me, a literary hero

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:10.490
and also someone whose books
are on my reading list,

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:14.560
it's sort of very interesting
to sort of accepting

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.880
that continuity of Asian
American literature,

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.790
to be part of that.

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:21.620
I would like to thank
the Smithsonian,

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.430
the Library of Congress, the
Asian American Literary Review,

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:27.000
and especially Kundiman.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.790
I had not heard of Kundiman.

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:33.890
I still don't know quite perhaps
who first told me about them,

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:36.720
but [inaudible] if it was
worth, you know, applying again

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:40.060
because I was not part of
the first fiction concord,

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.110
and he said resoundingly
"Yes, apply.

01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:44.520
It will change your
life" And so, I did,

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.370
and I participated last year,

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:48.620
and it certainly
did change my life.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:52.030
I think the first thing it
did ultimately was to suggest

01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:54.500
that there's this community of
other Asian American writers

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.050
out there that are
struggling and succeeding,

01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:00.990
and pursuing writing, not just
sort of as a side project,

01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:03.960
but for their career, and I
was just overwhelmed by that.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.760
I would also say that I've never
felt that comfortable in a group

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.950
of people, and so it's
a lovely experience

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:12.250
to fell just sort of yourself.

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:16.210
I'm going to read
three short pieces.

01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:20.990
The first piece is called
"Adoptive Fragment number five".

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.760
When you ask, they will
say, "Your birthmother,

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.460
she made a tough decision".

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.100
You'll think, "But she decided".

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.770
When you ask your adoptive
mother, she will say,

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:32.070
"I've always loved you.

01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:33.370
I've always known".

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:36.510
She will kneel down and put her
arms around you, and look you

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:38.670
in the eyes, "I choose you".

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:40.960
You will think, "You decided"

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.330
When you ask your
adoptive father,

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:43.710
he will not speak right away.

01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:45.160
It has never been his way.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.560
Instead, he will hold his coffee
mug midair, purse his lips,

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.340
consider his response.

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.260
He will say, "Well, of course,
what your mother said is true.

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.130
We saw your picture and knew".

01:09:57.130 --> 01:10:00.040
You will think, "Yes, of course"

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.880
"You knew, and you decided".

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.540
When you ask your adoptive
older brother, he will shrug,

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:07.480
smile uneasily, say,
"What's it matter?

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.080
You're my sister.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.760
"Yes", you will think,
"It was decided".

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.730
When you ask your dog, she
will look at you calmly,

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:18.190
her tail thumping lightly,
she will bark once and again,

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:21.380
and you will know somehow that
the translation will be that,

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.460
"it has always been decided".

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:28.330
This next piece, and I do
want to give a shoot at,

01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:30.440
this piece was published in
[inaudible] and they're based

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.060
out in Burke, Virginia,
which is pretty local here,

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.540
and to their editor
Cara Lakowski [phonetic]

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.160
who was a big part
of this story,

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.100
and when they published
this, it really made me feel

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:41.400
like a writer finally, right?

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.700
When you publish something --

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:47.060
"Lessons from Oregon"
The [inaudible] is rain.

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.660
I don't have to tell
you about that, right?

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.830
It doesn't reveal itself
until after October.

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:54.840
Then, it rains a lot,
but during September,

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.200
the month I was supposedly
born, the weatherman said

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.870
that it would be
gray and menacing,

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:02.490
the rain wouldn't happen
until Thursday this week.

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:04.470
And I had trusted
him, his voice,

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:07.370
his way of predicting
[inaudible].

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:09.850
As I walked to work on
Tuesday, wondering how I came

01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:12.170
to be teaching elementary
school children about parts

01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:14.130
of speech, it rained hard.

01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:16.440
Then, as if it wanted
to surprise me,

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.400
show its capriciousness, stopped
once I reached the school's

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.860
large glass door.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.720
Hair matted down
form the wetness,

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.500
another teacher opened the
door, looked and said to me --

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.410
Where's your umbrella?

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:30.070
-- The man said it wouldn't
rain until Thursday --

01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:33.670
She responded -- Silly boy,
always bring your umbrella --

01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:37.990
Lesson one -- always bring your
umbrella [inaudible] Assumption

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:42.150
-- you have an umbrella
[inaudible] Coffee is clearly

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:43.450
better here, I think.

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:45.930
It doesn't matter when
I drink coffee anymore.

01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.760
Sometimes after I
drink, I fall asleep,

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.090
as if I drank to fall asleep.

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:52.670
And when I dream, I
dream I have three cats,

01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:54.540
three brand new cats.

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.110
I've always been a dog person,

01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:58.870
so I don't know what the
dream means [laughter].

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:00.870
It bothers me that I'd have
so many cats [laughter].

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:05.010
But now after a few
months, I can't sleep.

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.570
So, I drink more and
think of those three cats,

01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:10.460
their names, their
personalities.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.950
I run on the apartment's
treadmills at two

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:15.310
in the morning, and come up
with names like Larry, Louis,

01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:19.040
Leopold, all names that might
reflect where I was raised.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.340
Lesson two -- adjusting

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.840
to the time difference will
take longer than expected.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.980
Lesson 2.5 -- get a cat,

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:29.010
maybe two because the
apartment doesn't allow dogs.

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:30.790
-- Sure -- I say to my
mother, who happened to forget

01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:32.760
about the three-hour
time difference,

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.810
but I'm awake -- the insomnia.

01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:36.860
I boil water to run
the French press.

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:39.480
Does it really make a
difference if it's 3:30am here,

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.000
6:30am on the East Coast,
when your mother calls?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.300
-- How's my favorite son doing?

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.890
-- She asks -- I'm your
only son -- I say --

01:12:46.890 --> 01:12:48.340
You didn't answer
the question --

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:50.930
she says [laughter]
Lesson three --

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:53.500
you can't hide from your mother,

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:56.490
even on the West
Coast [laughter].

01:12:56.490 --> 01:13:00.350
mom calls again early -- Did
you check the top cabinet?

01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:01.650
-- I say, looking out my window.

01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:05.190
I hear the cabinet door
ease open, then close shut.

01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:06.560
-- Thank you -- she says --

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.570
I don't know what
I'd do without you --

01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:11.390
You seem to be doing OK -- I
say -- did you make a decision?

01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:13.710
-- She says -- are
you going to meet her?

01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:16.000
Oh, I almost forgot -- she
adds -- your cousin Laura,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.550
she's pregnant -- Lesson four --

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:21.210
be born or adopted into
a family with siblings.

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:23.950
Lesson 4.5 -- get mom a hobby,

01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:28.570
maybe a cat [laughter] Lesson
4.75 -- when you're adopted,

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:30.050
birthmothers will
find you [laughter].

01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:32.460
The school where
I teach English,

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.680
Fiona asked me why I talk funny.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.860
She has a large mole
near her bottom lip,

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:39.310
with her hair pulled back
in pigtails, and the kind

01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:40.730
of earnest expression synonymous

01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:42.720
with first graders
and their questions.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.270
-- Funny? -- I repeat,
looking at her,

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:47.710
unsure if I can really
hear what she hears.

01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:50.780
-- Fiona -- I say, about to
talk about regional dialects,

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:52.370
before I realize I don't
know how to explain

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:54.290
that to a first grader.

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:58.270
Lesson five -- stop talking
funny [laughter] Also,

01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:59.640
no more stickers for
Fiona [laughter].

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.940
It's fiction.

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.240
It's OK, right?

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.540
[Laughter].

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:09.220
I named my cats Louis
and Clark; the irony is

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.550
that they're indoor cats and
I live in a studio [laughter].

01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:14.380
When they follow me around,

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.180
I pretend that I'm
the Columbia River,

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:19.100
so I sneak around the
apartment with them in toe.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.680
Sometimes I create
an obstacle for them

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.180
and say, "This won't easy.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.530
[Inaudible] and marking
new lands is never easy",

01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:27.750
but they just rub
against my leg,

01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:29.790
wait for me to bend
down and pet them.

01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:33.420
Lesson 6 -- get a hobby
and/or get out more.

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:37.470
A cannon beach on an unclear day
[inaudible] my house reminds me

01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:40.660
of one of my favorite painting
"Wanderer above the Sea of Fog".

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.230
It's been six month since I was
laid off and move to the west

01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:46.380
from the East Coast, away
from family and friends,

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:49.380
away from familiarity,
away from the letter

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:52.250
that had arrived telling me
that she was looking for me,

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:55.040
and I think as my shoes make
sets of impressions on the firm

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.270
and sooty-looking sand, as
the strong wind fills my shoes

01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:01.090
with imperceptible pieces,
"I think all we needed was

01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:02.660
to keep pretending
that we didn't exist,

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.510
that we didn't need each
other, that it was OK,

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:09.840
that we forgave each other, that
that sometimes happens in life".

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.580
But when that letter
came, the distance

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.990
that the [inaudible] became a
momentary lapse, merely a delay

01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:18.320
between the things we had
meant to say, the things some

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.530
of us hoped to say, and I hear
it in my head when I imagine

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:23.590
and hope that she
will say, "I'm sorry,

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:27.040
I'm sorry" Lesson seven -- there
are unforeseen consequences

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.410
to everyone's actions.

01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:34.000
In this last piece -- actually,
I wrote it for my wife,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.770
who is in the audience
struggling to have some sleep,

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:39.490
she worked a night shift
as an ICU nurse last night,

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:42.120
so I'm grateful that she's here.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.130
It's real brief, it's
called "Family Traits".

01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:48.440
It's an elusive thing,
one I assume we will see

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.590
when the baby comes,
if the baby comes.

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:54.700
So much depends on the baby,
I think, for us to see.

01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.660
In my friends' family photos,
it's almost always the eyes,

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.940
and sometimes it's the
nose, the cheekbones,

01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:03.730
the way they all smile,
sometimes serious, sometimes,

01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:07.230
not so much, perhaps,
even caught in the moment.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:08.530
You can't hide that, I think,

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.940
no matter how much my friend
tells me she'll never be

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:13.250
like her mother or father.

01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:16.120
Even in my family I can see
it, though it's less genetic.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.600
The way we sometimes slide
our hands through our hair,

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.090
raise our eyebrows
a little, exhale.

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.590
It's in the way we eat,
and though I don't go

01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:24.960
to church anymore, the
way I fold my hands

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.560
and bow my head a little.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.160
It's in the constant worrying
and unnecessary apologizing

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.910
for the simplest thing.

01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:32.740
The dog, too, has
gotten in on the act,

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.150
as if he's forgotten
his previous doggy life

01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:39.170
in West Texas and absorbed
[inaudible] East Coast.

01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:42.160
Sometimes, when he sits by the
slider and peers out, it's hard,

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.930
you say, not to think about
me in the other room reading,

01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:46.230
looking at a window,

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:48.070
and wondering also
what they look like,

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.370
what they both look like.

01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:51.160
And, of course, I
find myself thinking

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.250
about your parents too back
in Korea, and the face I fell

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:57.060
in love with might be
separated into two.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.860
Thank you very much.

01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:09.050
[ Applause ]

01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:10.610
&gt;&gt; Lisa Sasaki: That's so great.

01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:11.950
Thank you, Mark.

01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:15.830
Actually, I just wanted to
just mention that Kundiman,

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:20.530
we have for 14 years
sponsored a retreat.

01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:25.630
So, that's how everybody
knows each other.

01:17:25.630 --> 01:17:33.150
It is at Fordham University
in the Bronx, and people apply

01:17:33.150 --> 01:17:40.500
and 18 writers per genre,
poetry and prose come together,

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:48.080
and study with like six
total, but three writer

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.840
who are a bit more established.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:56.000
So, it is a community but we
also are very much looking to --

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:03.590
programs like these help enable
us to reach a wider audience

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:05.960
and to welcome more people in.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.500
It's an intimate program,
but we want to continue

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.290
to welcome people into
the cult, so thank you.

01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:15.230
OK, our last and
final reader, our last

01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:18.590
and final last [laughter]
I'm a writer too, apparently.

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:21.810
Our last reader is Sejal Shah.

01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:23.170
Sejal's essays have appeared

01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:25.880
in the Asian American
Literary Review, Brevity,

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.010
The Kenian Review
online, Waxwing,

01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:30.610
and several anthologies,
including the just released

01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:33.380
"Mad Heart, Be Brave:
Essays on the Poetry

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:37.200
of Agha Shahid Ali"
Recently, she has been sending

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.280
out two manuscripts, "How to
Make Your Mother Cry: Stories",

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.430
and "Things People Say: A
Book of Essays" She teaches

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:48.870
at Writers and Books, a
community-based literary center

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:51.920
in Rochester, New York,
and serves as the co-chair

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.220
of Kundiman North East.

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.510
Everybody welcome Sejal.

01:18:55.510 --> 01:19:19.070
[ Applause ]

01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:20.370
&gt;&gt; Sejal Shah: I always
have a lot of stuff.

01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:21.670
Can you hear me?

01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:24.210
OK, I'm going to be
reading from "Mad Heart,

01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:29.760
Be Brave" which is edited
by Kazim Ali, and its essays

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.910
on the poetry of
Agha Shahid Ali.

01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:36.130
First, I wanted to thank
also the organizers

01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:40.670
of the conference, to Lawrence,
the Smithsonian, to Kundiman,

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:45.150
to Sara and Cathy, especially.

01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:49.280
Kundiman welcomed me as a
fellow in poetry five years ago,

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.360
even though I did
an MFA in fiction,

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.170
but my background is also poet,

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:58.770
so this was before there
was a fiction retreat,

01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:01.100
but Kundiman also
changed my life.

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:05.270
To Kaya, and to Nila, to the
Asian American Writers Workshop

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:09.950
and [inaudible] to the
Library of Congress

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:13.480
and [inaudible] Casper, to the
Asian American Literary Review,

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:16.590
and to the discipline of
Asian American Studies,

01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:20.310
which saved during my
MFA, and to Kundiman

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:22.380
which has been a home for
me these past five years,

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.940
and thanks to all of
you for being here.

01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:41.720
I'm going to take a picture
of you [laughter], smile!

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.110
This is amazing [laughter].

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:50.730
So, a special shout-out to
[inaudible] from the Margins

01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:53.580
for editing and publishing
the original essay.

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:57.190
And it's based on my remarks

01:20:57.190 --> 01:21:04.220
at Shahid's memorial,
[inaudible] in 2002.

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:12.080
This is for my grandmother.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:17.170
Also, get your library
to order this [laughter].

01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:21.920
The title's called "The
World is Full of Paper,

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:26.050
Write to Me" You might recognize
those words from Shahid's poem

01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:31.780
"Stationery", and if you
haven't read it, you should.

01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:36.810
Shahid was the first and only
person to call me a yankee.

01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:40.860
I first met Shahid in 1996
at Harvard University.

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:45.150
It was a winter evening,
in my memory,

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.400
Shahid wears a narrowed
jacket, something pale in color,

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.930
and he glows the ways snow
glows on certain winter nights.

01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:56.290
He read from his
collection, "The Country

01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:59.600
without A Post Office", which
held the political violence

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.100
in Kashmir in its backdrop.

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:07.160
Afterwards, I told Shahid I
had applied to the MFA program

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.310
at [inaudible] and that I
hoped to study with him.

01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:13.140
-- Come, come -- he said.

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:17.750
Shahid was warm,
charismatic, irreverent,

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:20.970
I fell for him the way you fall
for someone across the room

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:25.410
at a party and then feel
compelled to approach.

01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:30.690
As soon as I saw and heard him
in Cambridge, I was transfixed.

01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:33.360
My name was a part of his name,

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.770
I decided it was
destiny [laughter].

01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:39.550
Knowing almost nothing
about Kashmir

01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:43.070
and the Indian military
occupation, I thought of Shahid

01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:45.690
as simply an Indian
American writer.

01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:47.890
I hoped to find in him a mentor.

01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:52.430
At the time, I had met only
one other South Asian writer,

01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:57.600
Bharati Mukherjee, who declared
herself an American writer only,

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.600
rejecting any hyphen
or descriptor

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.980
such as Indian American
or South Asian,

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.460
Bengali American,
or Asian American.

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:10.610
She wished to be understood and
accepted as an American writer,

01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:12.250
as American as anyone else.

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:15.520
I couldn't blame her.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.200
When I arrived in [inaudible]
in the fall of 1997,

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:24.360
I immediately asked Shahid if I
could take his poetry workshop.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.700
Although I was a
fiction student,

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:30.100
Shahid said -- Sure, why not?

01:23:31.410 --> 01:23:33.660
-- Don't worry, it's
only five pages.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.930
That was the first.

01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:39.540
Shahid often rewrote our poems,
starting from the bottom,

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:42.450
working his way to the top.

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:44.930
He suggested new
possibilities for each of us,

01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:48.110
reading his revisions
in a lilting voice.

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:52.450
This rewriting occasionally
hurt my feelings [laughter],

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:57.020
often bewildered me, and
mostly infuriated me [laughter]

01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:00.850
In my poem "Alexander Street",

01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:04.730
the first line became
"Instead the 28th".

01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:08.530
Shahid crossed out so many
lines in another poem that out

01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:15.290
of 25 lines only eight remained
[laughter] There are copies

01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:23.900
of his comments on my workshop
poems in the book, and yes,

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:28.400
here's another that
got reordered.

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.130
I never sent these out.

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:34.850
Rob was in that workshop
with me.

01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:40.240
I've never read this with
someone else who was there too.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.380
I was horrified.

01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:45.070
In college, my poems have
received every literary

01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:47.710
prize awarded.

01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:50.610
No one had taken my
writing apart line by line,

01:24:50.610 --> 01:24:54.420
and dismantled their basic
architecture, what I thought

01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:58.860
of as the poem's
intention and integrity.

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:03.580
Still, I could see that Shahid
was doing something interesting.

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:07.560
I must've realized that I needed
to pay attention because even

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.810
after 15 years, after almost
20 years, I had still held

01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:16.830
on to all of Shahid's
written comments on my work.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.180
One month into the semester,
Shahid delivered a piece

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:26.270
of advice to me, announced
to our entire workshop,

01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:28.640
"Never use the word 'soul'
in a poem" [laughter],

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.520
he declared and then grinned.

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:37.650
He was both teasing
and completely serious.

01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:44.890
I winced, I had just brought in
a villanelle, "Onyx, Obsidian,

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.780
Flocks, Coal", in
which "soul" was one

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:49.580
of the repeating end words --

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:56.180
[ Laughter ]

01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:59.640
3 [Laughter] I have remembered
his dictum through the years

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:03.210
and have heard myself saying
it to my own students.

01:26:03.210 --> 01:26:07.490
We want our poems and stories to
be soulful to possess qualities

01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:11.200
of the infinite in them, but
it's difficult for the word

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.970
"soul" to do the
work of that desire.

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:17.830
Though miff by his
handling of my poems,

01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:21.500
where was the unadulterated
praise?

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:25.580
[Laughter] I was, like everyone
else, still taken by Shahid,

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:30.160
admiring both his exquisite
poetry, and his generous nature.

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.400
In workshop, he recited
each of our names

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.710
as though it were a poem,
brilliant, somehow miraculous,

01:26:37.710 --> 01:26:41.690
and mysterious, complete
in and of itself.

01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:47.450
It's the wonderful Carry St
George Comer, Andrew Varnon,

01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:55.170
Robert M Casper, Daniel Hales.

01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:58.230
Twice that fall he invited
our class and other friends

01:26:58.230 --> 01:27:01.410
and admirers for sprawling
dinner parties, people spilled

01:27:01.410 --> 01:27:03.420
over from room to room.

01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:06.600
When I offered to cook,
Shahid laughed and said,

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.600
"You American-born Indians
are the most terrible cooks"

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:17.410
[laughter] I was taken
aback, but had to laugh.

01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:20.240
One evening when the stove
burners were not working,

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.130
and the food had to be
warmed up somewhere else,

01:27:23.130 --> 01:27:27.100
Shahid charmed us for hours,
as only a good host could,

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:31.390
playing Hindi film
music, and ABBA.

01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:35.750
Why not? The perfect
Shahidian combination.

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:38.220
No one minded not
eating for a while,

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:40.790
we may not have even noticed.

01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:43.460
He broke into songs.

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.290
-- Hey -- I said --
I know that song --

01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:47.850
and began dancing the
Barathanatyam steps I had

01:27:47.850 --> 01:27:50.150
learned as a child.

01:27:51.510 --> 01:28:03.510
[ Sings ]

01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:09.630
[ Applause ]

01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:12.290
Shahid clapped his hands
in encouragement, --

01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:14.630
Bha, bha -- he said finally.

01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:17.470
The subcontinental applause
I had sought [laughter]

01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:18.770
finally [laughter].

01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:28.860
In my copy of "The Country
without A Post Office",

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:32.100
he filled the entire front
page with his effusive script

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:39.700
in blue fountain pen ink, "For
Sajel M. Shah, Shah of shahs.

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.980
So royal, so princely.

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:45.850
So regal, dash.

01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:49.780
So, she who couldn't go to
Spain is going to Italy, ah!

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:54.920
He decorated this note with
long dashes flourishing

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.720
on either side of the "ah!"

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:59.680
spanning the width of the page.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.790
Later he continued
in another pen,

01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:03.710
"and now where is the lipstick?

01:29:03.710 --> 01:29:05.850
Purple of color.

01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:07.470
Sajel has the magic".

01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:11.380
Who else could have written
about the purple lipstick I wore

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:14.430
that year in a way that
transformed my name,

01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:18.130
travel plans, and shade of
lipstick into near poetry?

01:29:18.130 --> 01:29:21.770
It was what we all wanted, what
anyone wants from someone he

01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:25.240
or she admires, and
certainly what I wanted,

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:29.480
for them to see the
magic that is only you.

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:33.450
As a professor and teacher
myself now for many years,

01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:39.180
I understand his rewriting,
as painful as it was for me,

01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:44.980
as another form of attention,
even as another kind of love.

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:50.390
It is a strategy I use too
in the workshops I now teach.

01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:54.500
Shahid was trying to lessen
my dependence on narrative,

01:29:56.130 --> 01:30:00.010
my desire to tell a
story within a poem

01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:01.310
And to instead allow the
poem to unfold, to breathe,

01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:02.610
to live through the generation
of lyrics possibilities.

01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:03.910
During my first year of
graduate school I had reason

01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:05.210
to call Shahid once
or twice at home.

01:30:05.210 --> 01:30:06.510
His answering machine
message was simply,

01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:07.810
"I knew you'd call" [laughter]
The first time I heard it,

01:30:07.810 --> 01:30:09.110
I hung up [laughter] Shahid had,
as usual, caught me off guard.

01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:10.410
His voice left me
speechless and smiling.

01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:11.710
Shahid's message
was to-the-point

01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:13.010
and too short, like his life.

01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:14.310
We flocked to him, poets and
writers, ambitious dreamers.

01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:15.610
I see him in his
kitchen turning toward me

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:16.910
in a royal blue sweater,

01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:18.210
his shirt sleeves
unbuttoned and pushed back.

01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:19.510
He is cooking for us.

01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:20.810
I've snapped a photo and caught
him off guard in the picture,

01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:22.110
but he's still posing,
still gesturing,

01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:23.410
still lovely, still young.

01:30:23.410 --> 01:30:24.710
He would probably
hate me saying so.

01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:26.010
He would hate me saying so,

01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:27.310
but I think his eyes
looked soulful [inaudible]

01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:28.610
"I knew you'd call"

01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:29.910
[ Laughter ]

01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:31.710
The first time I
heard it, I hang up.

01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:35.160
[ Laughter ]

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:38.420
Shahid had as usual
caught me out of guard,

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.940
his voice left me
speechless, and smiling.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.680
Shahid was to the point and
too short, like in his life,

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:51.090
we [inaudible] poems and
writers, ambitious dreamers.

01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:55.050
I see him in his
kitchen turning toward me

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:58.600
in a royal blue sweater, his
short sleeves unbuttoned,

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:02.690
and pushed back,
he's cooking for us.

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:06.060
I snapped a photo and caught
him unguard in the picture,

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:09.240
but he still posing,
still gesturing,

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.140
still lovely, still young.

01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:16.660
He would probably hate me saying
so, he would hate me saying so,

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:19.720
but I think his eyes
looked so fool [phonetic].

01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:23.510
I knew you'd call.

01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:37.070

and to all who teach and to all

of you who weren't here

01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:55.230
for the amazing morning
event, my name is Rob Casper,

and I'm the head of the
Poetry Literature Center here

01:31:57.330 --> 01:31:58.700
at the library.

01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:02.240
I could not be prouder to
host the last public even

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.770
for the inaugural Asian
American Literary Festival here

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:09.050
in Washington, D.C. It
has been a labor of love

01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:11.170
and hugely important
undertaking,

01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:12.880
and I want to thank
all the sponsors,

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:15.970
especially the Smithsonian
Asian Pacific American Center,

01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:17.560
and Lawrence Min
Lee Davis [phonetic]

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.730
for making this festival
a reality.

01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:23.700
We've spent many, many days
and nights talking about how

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:26.870
to make this, and to see
you all here today is just

01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:28.580
beyond inspiring.

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:31.340
First, let me ask
you to do what I did,

01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:34.010
which is to turn off
your electronic devices

01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:37.460
so that we don't have any
problem with interference.

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:41.130
Take a second to that.

01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:44.210
Second, I'll tell you a
little bit about the Poetry

01:32:44.210 --> 01:32:45.510
and Literature Center.

01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:48.340
As the home of the
US Poet Laureate,

01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:51.870
we just announced Tracy K
Smith is our 22nd Poet Laureate

[ Applause ]

01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:01.400
As the home of the Laureate,
we have a special place

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.930
in our hearts for
poetry and we prove it

01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:06.720
through our annual series
of literary programs.

wonderful, exciting event.

This morning we honored
Kundiman, and featured a trio

01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:29.570
of their fellows which
was just incredible.

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.280
This afternoon, we
turn to poetry,

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:35.990
and just as we had acclaimed
writer Karen Tei Ymashita start

01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:39.390
things off this morning with a
beautiful and moving lecture,

01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:42.760
we have asked poet Kimiko Hahn
to set the stage this afternoon

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:46.710
with a lecture titled "Angel
Island: The Roots and Branches

01:33:46.710 --> 01:33:50.700

up for Fred Sasaki!

introduce the final reading.

The final three readings have
happened throughout the festival

01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:13.880

this, but I'll tell you too --

experiencing them on stage.

Kimiko Hahn is the author of
nine books of poems including

01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:09.250
I've known and worked
with Kimiko, most recently

01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:12.530
at the poetry side of America
where she currently serves

01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:15.400
as president of the

is a dream-big motivator with
a knack for bringing people

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.770

who celebrates tradition
while reveling in play.

A devotee to her students,
and one of my dearest

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.040
and most cherished cohorts.

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:43.760

heard her present

for the National Book
Festival when I first started

01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:50.340
at the Library of Congress,
back in 2011, I'm so happy

01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:52.990
to welcome her today
to this festival.

01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:55.510

welcoming Kimiko Hahn.

Not just been a year.

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:19.500
I think at least one decade,
if not one and a half, or so.

01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:33.470
Alone with everyone else who
has else spoken and read,

01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:38.330
I too feel honored, and
thankful, and especially

and the other people
who made this a reality.

It's just incredible,
and brilliant.

01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:12.140
What an urgent time
for a radical soul,

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:16.020
what a time to reaffirm
that our histories are

01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:22.810
that of obedient Orientals, in
fact, not any kind of Oriental.

01:37:22.810 --> 01:37:27.620
We carved protect poems on the
walls of our detention center.

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:32.910
We rebelled against the lunas in
a field of vulcanic back soil.

01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:36.910
We protested when forced to live
in a horse stall, we said, "No,

01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:42.270
and So" You also volunteered
for the Armed Services

01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:53.280
to prove patriotism forming the
42nd Infantery Regiment Combat

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:58.290
Team, which I think
my uncle was in,

01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:04.600
the most decorated unit US
history is "go-for-broke".

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:09.300
We embroil it, we were born
right here, we assimilate it,

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.620
and we challenge the
assimilation as paradigm.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:17.590
What a radical moment
for us to be together.

01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:22.330
Over the past several elections,
candidates have either connected

01:38:22.330 --> 01:38:25.550
or missed grassroots movements.

01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:30.630
Yes, grassroot organizing
again, for the basics,

01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:34.350
from loading rights
to immigration rights

01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:38.210
to healthcare, I'm
so honored to be here

01:38:38.210 --> 01:38:42.530
at Smithsonian Asian
Pacific American Center,

01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:47.560
and also the Library of
Congress, the Apex mission is

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:52.690
to be a cultural laboratory
envisioning [inaudible]

01:38:52.690 --> 01:38:56.140
as a form of community
organizing.

01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:59.810
That is so brilliant,
I love that.

01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:03.380
I'm going to say it again,
[inaudible] as a form

01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:06.210
of community organizing.

01:39:06.210 --> 01:39:08.960
Thank you.

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:13.030
Our former Poet Laureate
Juan Felipe Herrera said

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:17.330
of his own coming-of-age,
and offbeat education --

01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:19.750
"Listening to the
poets around and ahead

01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:22.040
of me, I was taking note.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:27.900
So, you know, society was our
workshop" I've been invited

01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:30.580
to give a sense of
our collective story

01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:34.520
from my personal, and
modest point of view.

01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:41.530
How unlikely that a little
Eurasian girl, you know,

01:39:41.530 --> 01:39:43.990
[inaudible] born and
isolated in Pleasantville,

01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:47.800
New York would be
here to address you.

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:53.050
Thankfully, I came of age
in the 1960's and 70's.

01:39:53.050 --> 01:39:56.370
Thankfully, after a year
living in the Japan,

01:39:56.370 --> 01:39:58.530
my parents enrolled
my sister and me

01:39:58.530 --> 01:40:03.110
into Japanese language classes,
and Japanese dance lessons,

01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:07.950
at the New York Buddhist Church
on Riverside Drive in Manhattan.

01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:10.050
How could my parents have known

01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:15.190
that in dance class I'd meet
Aichi Kochiyama and come

01:40:15.190 --> 01:40:17.550
to know her radical family.

01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:22.390
Her mother, Yuri Kochiyama, well
known for her radical politics,

01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:27.750
held the dying Malcom X
in the Audubon Ballroom,

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:31.420
Saturdays in the city
were my workshop.

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:37.030
By high school, I was pretty
steep in Japanese culture,

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:40.770
more than most Asian
Americans of my generation.

01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:45.260
My politics were
limited to rock and roll.

01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:50.180
Not too shabby if you consider
ten soldiers and Nixon coming

01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:56.140
for dead in Ohio, and we
don't need to escalate.

01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:01.930
You see, war is not the answer,
for only love can conquer hate,

01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:04.490
but how could my
parents have figured

01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:07.410
that after dance class I
would hang out in the dojo

01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:11.660
with the judo boys, or as
Grace Jones would purr,

01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:15.830
"checking out the race"
[laughter] And, by the way,

01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:20.670
I'm really envious that
Karen had photographs.

01:41:20.670 --> 01:41:24.400
Mei-mei and I were quite the
hotties back then [laughter]

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.210
and I wish we had
had picture of us!

01:41:28.210 --> 01:41:34.200
So, I'm sorry, next time
[laughter][inaudible] So,

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.100
thank you [laughter] I
was fishing, wasn't I?

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.470
[Laughter] So, getting
back to checking

01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:46.290
out the race [laughter],
enter a young man,

01:41:46.290 --> 01:41:49.210
a Japanese American radical
whose mother had been

01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:54.630
incarcerated in the infamous
Topaz War Relocation camp.

01:41:54.630 --> 01:41:58.780
Dating him, I hung out at
Chinatown food co-op meetings

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.720
with the likes of Peter
Quang [phonetic] and sat

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:07.130
in on Marxist study groups,
and culture was never marginal.

01:42:07.130 --> 01:42:11.590
The city on Saturdays
is where I felt alive.

01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:16.370
In 1970, the basement workshop
on Elizabeth Street was opened

01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:20.630
by artists such as Tomie
Arai, a distant relative

01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:24.720
as it turned out, and
writers such as Fay Chiang.

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.780
Here are the opening stanzas
from Fay's poem "Chinatown".

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:41.900
"Mahjong and dice on the tables
upstairs, confusion of trucks,

01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:46.120
and cars, and calls, and
children, and cats, and dogs,

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:51.860
and stream of people falling
off the mountain of gold.

01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:55.580
Eddie died yesterday, another
street kid shot his fucking

01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:59.870
brains out and Eddie's
in heaven east river.

01:42:59.870 --> 01:43:03.870
Did you know about Mrs. Tong
jumped off a building looking

01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:07.070
for peace six stories
above mott?

01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:11.600
And hey, old Louie just passed
away in his sleep, the fool,

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:15.250
sleeping with the
gas pipes on, again.

01:43:15.250 --> 01:43:16.740
Did you hear about Lee?

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:18.760
that he couldn't take
his henpecking wife,

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.250
and screaming babies, and
rotten kids, and his waiter job,

01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:25.610
and promises that couldn't
be bought with pennies

01:43:25.610 --> 01:43:32.070
that he split before
his head did?"

01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:35.770
From these Asian American
circles, I became acquainted

01:43:35.770 --> 01:43:37.950
with those on the West Coast.

01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:40.620
Not surprisingly, their
militancy was ahead

01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:42.960
of the movement in New York.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.440
There were poets such
as Mitsuye Yamada

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:49.860
who wrote this poem
"Evacuation".

01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:55.550
As we boarded the bus,
bags on both sides,

01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:58.400
they'd never packed
two bags before

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.700
on a vacation lasting forever.

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:06.160
The Seattle Times
photographer said -- smile --

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.350
so, obediently, I smiled.

01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:11.630
In the caption the next day read

01:44:11.630 --> 01:44:15.840
"Note smiling faces,
a lesson to Tokyo".

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:22.250
And there was Nellie Wong,
here's an excerpt from "Away

01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:27.620
from The Blue Swans"
"Away, away from antlers,

01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:32.550
dried lizard necks hidden like
pearls in herbalist shells,

01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:36.520
women warbling Chinese
songs, their voices drifting

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:42.280
out the hot summer air, hanging
onto men in grey felt hats

01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:46.890
with silver dollars dangling
in their pants' pockets.

01:44:46.890 --> 01:44:51.490
Crossing the boundaries to
the TMD on 11th in Broadway,

01:44:51.490 --> 01:44:56.410
past Jack's Footlong Hot Dogs,
smelling popcorn at the antics

01:44:56.410 --> 01:44:59.240
of Abbot and Costello.

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:03.750
Arm in arm, our bravery slung
by our mother's warnings.

01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:07.780
Uptown to the paramount in
all it silver, and purple,

01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:11.270
and red velvet carpets
chewing spearmint

01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:13.690
through the double
feature and returning

01:45:13.690 --> 01:45:18.990
to Chinatown sucking preserved
plums, and agreeing to lie"

01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:23.860
And across the Pacific,
in the Hawaiian Islands

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:27.890
of mother's birth, there was
burgeoning Asian American writer

01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:30.960
scene, and the group
"Bamboo Ridge",

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.150
and here they are,
Bamboo Ridge, people.

01:45:33.150 --> 01:45:34.950
We love you!

01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:39.120
[ Applause ]

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:43.230
One of the writers from the
same generation of poets

01:45:43.230 --> 01:45:48.030
who I just read was Juliet
Kono, and she's here.

01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:50.300
Juliet, I love you [laughter].

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:54.600
And she had her very
excellent collection

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.720
"Hilo Rains" published
as a double issue

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.010
of Bamboo Ridge Journal.

01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:05.080
Please listen to this excerpt
from "Smoke: An Apostrophe

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:07.380
to The Speaker's Mother".

01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:10.260
"You were 13.

01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:13.180
Your father has made
you quit school.

01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:16.900
You can no longer play
with the other girls.

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:20.180
You must now cut
cane like a man,

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:25.540
and every day you watch the
lunas burn adjacent field

01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:28.600
where yellow flames
crackle and lift high

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:31.820
into smoke, filling your coughs.

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:35.540
Soot rains, the skies
look overcast

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:41.570
as if someone has tossed a throw
net over you and hauled you in,

01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:49.000
a good day's catch for the
next day's work, and the next."

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.100
You may have noticed that every
poet who I've been reading

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:58.680
so far are women, and that's
because these are the ones

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:01.490
that in effect became
my mentors, so I'm going

01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:05.150
to continue in that vein.

01:47:05.150 --> 01:47:08.460
In concert with community
organizing, writers

01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:12.980
and educators published
newsletters, mimeographed,

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:15.020
journals and anthologies,

01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:22.470
the first one I'd ever held was
[inaudible] published in 1974

01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:27.090
by [inaudible] and Sean Huang,

01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:31.500
I think Garrett called them
the gang of four yesterday.

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:36.700
10 years later, Native American
Joseph Bruchac published an

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:41.700
anthology of Asian American
poetry, "Breaking Silence".

01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:45.710
These anthologies became the
start of my self-education

01:47:45.710 --> 01:47:48.270
in Asian American poetry.

01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:53.840
The legendary West Coast radical
Janice Mirikitani opens her poem

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:56.660
"Breaking Silence" with
the executive order

01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:01.340
"Take only what you can
carry" and she uses quotes

01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:04.470
from her mother's testimony
before the Commission

01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:07.360
on Wartime Relocation
and Internment

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:10.820
of Japanese American Civilians.

01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:15.740
Here's an excerpt from
"Breaking Silence".

01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:21.570
"And then, all was
hushed for announcements.

01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:24.490
Take only what you can carry.

01:48:24.490 --> 01:48:28.100
We were made to believe
our faces betrayed us,

01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:32.360
our bodies were loud with
yellow screaming flesh,

01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:37.050
needing to be silenced
behind barbed wire.

01:48:37.050 --> 01:48:41.660
'Mr. Commissioner, it seems we
were singled out from others

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:43.520
who are under suspicion.

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.770
Our neighbors were of
German and Italian descent,

01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:49.180
some of whom were not citizens.

01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:55.040
It seems we were singled
out' She had worn her sweat

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:59.230
like lemon leaves, shining
on the rough edges of work,

01:48:59.230 --> 01:49:01.890
removed the mirrors
from her room

01:49:01.890 --> 01:49:05.340
so she would not be
tempted by vanity.

01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:09.110
Her dreams honed the
blade of her plough.

01:49:09.110 --> 01:49:11.970
The land, the building
of food was noisy

01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:14.510
as the opening of irises.

01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:19.990
The sounds of work bolted
in barracks, silenced.

01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:24.100
'Mr. Commissioner, so when
you tell me I must limit my

01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:29.520
testimony to five minutes,
when you tell me my time is up,

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:35.100
I tell you this -- pride has
kept my lips pinned by nails,

01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:41.470
my rage coffined, but I assume
my past, to claim this time,

01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:43.310
my youth is buried

01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:49.120
in [inaudible] ghost
visits Hamachi Gate,

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.050
my niece haunts Tune Lake'
Words are better than tears,

01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:59.970
so I spilled on, I
killed this, the silence".

01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:03.120
No surprise that many

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.590
in the movement didn't
consider a biracial poet truly

01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:08.150
Asian American.

01:50:08.150 --> 01:50:13.570
I wasn't completely at home in
those circles, not completely.

01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:20.140
So, determined to learn my
craft, I put in undergrad time

01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:22.450
at the University of Iowa.

01:50:22.450 --> 01:50:25.380
There I studied with
Marvin Bell, Louise Glück,

01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:30.550
Charles Wright, and the then
graduate student, Rita Dove.

01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:33.490
These were radiant
workshops, and they were also,

01:50:33.490 --> 01:50:36.260
except for Rita,
pretty darn white.

01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:40.830
From there, I returned to New
York to find more of myself.

01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:44.540
Poets were reciting poems
on the street and continuing

01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:47.610
to ally themselves
with social issues.

01:50:47.610 --> 01:50:50.320
Pedro Pietri, one of
the original founder

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.590
of the Nuyorican Poets Café,

01:50:52.590 --> 01:50:55.850
handed out poems written
on condom wrappers.

01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:59.140
This is before the AIDS crisis.

01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:02.620
Louis Reyes Rivera told me
more than once, "Kimiko,

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:07.400
take your palm off the damn
page" The city was again

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:08.920
my workshop.

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:12.570
I would also meet
radical feminists

01:51:12.570 --> 01:51:15.190
like Patricia Spears Jones,

01:51:15.190 --> 01:51:18.610
Sandra Esteves, and
Frances Chung.

01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:22.580
From Frances, posthumously
published, "Crazy Melon

01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:27.300
and Chinese Apple" a
poem, "Double Ten".

01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:32.500
"Early morning, the Sunday
sound of an accordion.

01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:35.690
A conversation with
two Ukrainian women

01:51:35.690 --> 01:51:40.020
about calling the plumber,
taking baths in our kitchens.

01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:45.130
You like the green
stone around my neck.

01:51:45.130 --> 01:51:46.430
Later on, the [inaudible],

01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:50.730
a black man struggling along
singing a Chinatown ballad

01:51:50.730 --> 01:51:53.590
as I sing one of Philly's songs.

01:51:53.590 --> 01:51:57.820
In her kitchen, warmer
than mine, a strong smell

01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:05.030
of black mushrooms" In
1981 I organized a panel

01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:09.530
of Asian American writers for
the National Writer's Congress,

01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:12.650
sponsored by the
Nation Institute,

01:52:12.650 --> 01:52:14.800
just the Nation Magazine,

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:18.050
I believed those genuinely
liberal writers didn't truly

01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:22.480
comprehend the depth and
turbulence that would simmer up,

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:26.150
especially by so-called
minority writers.

01:52:26.150 --> 01:52:30.010
Not only did I meet
Jessica Hagedorn,

01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:33.770
[inaudible] I connected with
poet comrades, Luis Rodriguez

01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:38.100
who would go on to
found Tia Chucha Press

01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:42.110
and Community Center, and
also Michael Ward who is now

01:52:42.110 --> 01:52:44.790
at the African Diaspora Museum.

01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:48.740
And later Jessica invited me
to read at Basement Workshop,

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:52.770
yay [laughter] How could I
have known just how cool it was

01:52:52.770 --> 01:52:54.710
to be the warmup
act for [inaudible],

01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:59.580
who at that moment
became a fast friend?

01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:04.650
For starters, we organized
political cabaret in Harlem.

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:17.020
Around this time too, there was
a changing aesthetic in the air.

01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:22.120
Jessica's pet foods and tropical
apparitions would present

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:26.750
in print the kind of lyrics
she sassed out in the clubs.

01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:29.470
Her poetic voice
would later grow

01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:33.050
into characters from her novel.

01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:37.180
Here's the last two stanzas from
the poem "I Went All the Way

01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:41.250
Out Here Looking for You, Bob
Marley" [laughter] written

01:53:41.250 --> 01:53:43.340
with the endnote
"Kingston, Jamaica,

01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:50.950
1977" "And this just isn't fair

01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:54.500
because you are the
only one I trust.

01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:56.160
I have to know.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:59.350
Were you shot in the
arm, like they said?

01:53:59.350 --> 01:54:04.270
And don't they know they
can't kill music like that?

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:08.620
They should heed from
America and relegate you

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:12.440
to the Sheraton Hotel's
Junkanoo Lounge

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:14.100
as a malnourished [inaudible].

01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:21.240
And this just isn't fair because
you are the only one I trust,

01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:23.650
and I haven't even met you yet,

01:54:23.650 --> 01:54:30.340
and I am waiting" There
was a continuing debate

01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:34.020
on whether one had to write
about Asian American issues

01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:36.660
to be an Asian American writer.

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:40.860
Thank heaven for Mei-mei
and her innovative spirit.

01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:44.770
You will hear her later, but
meantime here's an excerpt

01:54:44.770 --> 01:54:48.840
from -- a newer poem
than back in the day,

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:51.050
it's an excerpt from, "Hello,

01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:57.070
the Roses" "The rose
communicates instantly

01:54:57.070 --> 01:55:01.480
with the woman by sight,
collapsing its boundaries,

01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:05.480
and the woman widens
her boundaries.

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:12.430
Her rate of perception slows
down, because of its complexity.

01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:16.750
There's a feeling of touching
and being touched, the shadings

01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:20.640
of color she can
sense from touch.

01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:27.410
There's an affinity between
awareness and blossom."

01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:30.330
Thank the heavens too

01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:36.610
for lending us Theresa Hak Kyung
Cha whose Avant Gard polyphonic

01:55:36.610 --> 01:55:41.410
cross-genre "Dictee"
was published in 1982,

01:55:41.410 --> 01:55:43.840
the same year she was murdered.

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:48.260
Here's an excerpt.

01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:51.230
"She would take on
their punctuation.

01:55:51.230 --> 01:55:54.360
She waits to service this.

01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:57.330
Theirs. Punctuation.

01:55:57.330 --> 01:56:02.190
She would become,
herself, demarcations.

01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:03.830
Absorb it.

01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:08.570
Spill it. Seize upon
the punctuation.

01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:11.800
Last air. Give her.

01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:14.240
Her. The relay.

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.630
Voice. Assign.

01:56:16.630 --> 01:56:19.420
Hand it. Deliver it.

01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:26.190
Deliver." Cha was a
first-generation Korean.

01:56:26.190 --> 01:56:29.970
Of course, all along, different
waves of immigrants mixed

01:56:29.970 --> 01:56:35.560
into the Asian American groups
of 2nd, 3rd, 4th generations.

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:40.000
Two of those brilliant writers,
[inaudible] who came here,

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.970
who was born in Kerala, in
Southern India, and came here.

01:56:44.970 --> 01:56:48.970
And Miomi Kim, who of course
was born in Seoul, Korea.

01:56:57.570 --> 01:57:01.780
Myong and Mei-mei unlike some of
the other poets I've read broke

01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:04.840
through into the MFA scene.

01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:08.710
Then, along came Marilyn.

01:57:08.710 --> 01:57:14.150
"I am Marilyn Mei Ling Chin.

01:57:14.150 --> 01:57:16.870
Oh, how I love the resoluteness

01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:20.510
of that first-person
singular followed

01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:24.930
by that stalwart
indicative of "be",

01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:29.890
without the uncertain
i-n-g of "becoming."

01:57:29.890 --> 01:57:33.630
Of course, the name had
been changed somewhere

01:57:33.630 --> 01:57:38.070
between Angel Island and
the sea, when my father,

01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:44.840
the paper son in the late 1950s,
obsessed with a bombshell blond,

01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:49.660
transliterated "Mei
Ling" to "Marilyn."

01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:53.950
And nobody dared question
his initial impulse,

01:57:53.950 --> 01:57:58.300
for we all know lust
drove men to greatness,

01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:02.190
not goodness, not decency.

01:58:02.190 --> 01:58:05.960
And there I was, a
wayward pink baby,

01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:09.190
named after some tragic
white woman swollen

01:58:09.190 --> 01:58:12.140
with gin and Nembutal.

01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:15.660
My mother couldn't
pronounce the "r."

01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:22.310
She dubbed me "Numba one
female offshoot" for brevity:

01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:26.760
henceforth, she will live
and die in sublime ignorance,

01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:31.000
flanked by loving children
and the "kitchen deity."

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:37.610
That's the opening
to Marilyn's --

01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:42.080
probably one of her most
well-known early poems

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:48.070
"How I Got That Name: An
Essay on Assimilation".

01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:51.430
Marily's poetics were
an exuberant mix,

01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:56.280
an elegant strictness learned
from classical Chinese poetry,

01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:58.820
and also apprenticing at Iowa

01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:01.810
with Donald Justice,
and Jane Cooper.

01:59:01.810 --> 01:59:05.160
It is with Marilyn that
I most share aesthetics,

01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:09.280
although where she calls on
the formal to be reckless,

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:12.070
I could do the opposite.

01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:15.200
The first time I
made the acquaintance

01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:19.670
of Marilyn's work was when
I was co-poetry editor

01:59:19.670 --> 01:59:22.400
at Bridge Magazine in Chinatown.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:26.180
I was also studying Japanese
at Columbia University,

01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:30.820
which did not lead to a PhD,
mainly because I couldn't focus

01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:33.210
on learning my congee.

01:59:33.210 --> 01:59:36.870
I had one foot on campus,
and the other in the streets

01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:40.280
or more literally at the
Hungarian Pastry Shop

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:43.740
on Amsterdam Avenue,
which is still there!

01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:45.840
[Laughter] Where I'd sit
with a yellow legal pad

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:48.130
and pen writing what
would become

01:59:48.130 --> 01:59:51.640
"Air Pocket" and "Earshot".

01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:55.090
Although I did not
become fluent in Japanese,

01:59:55.090 --> 02:00:00.530
I did begin on awareness that
my incipient poetics were a part

02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:02.490
of my body.

02:00:02.490 --> 02:00:08.750
Classical Japanese aesthetics as
much as William Carlos Williams.

02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:12.410
In fact, as an aside,
even my new work prompted

02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:18.240
by science abides by a Japanese
aesthetic, which I write

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:23.150
about in Brain Fever,
in an essay.

02:00:23.150 --> 02:00:27.360
During this time too,
there were several growing

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:29.850
political-cultural movements.

02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:34.710
Artists called against U.S.
intervention in Central America,

02:00:34.710 --> 02:00:39.730
anti-apartheid organizations and
several allied with organizing

02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:42.790
around issue about homelessness.

02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:47.330
We organized greetings,
publications, went to Nicaragua,

02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:51.700
danced, had babies,
looked for teaching jobs,

02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:55.840
hung out with Adrienne
Rich and June Jordan.

02:00:57.180 --> 02:01:02.450
Curating pushes one to widen
circles of people and aesthetics

02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:05.420
and that is just
were I found myself.

02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:10.070
When Basement Workshop shut its
doors, I open "Word of mouth",

02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:11.710
a series that found a home

02:01:11.710 --> 02:01:15.210
in the Chatham Square
Public Library.

02:01:15.210 --> 02:01:20.540
Curating allows one to meet
much admired writers, for me,

02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:24.790
I was pleased to have a full
house for Trinh T. Minh-ha,

02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:27.970
who was born in Hanoi in 1952.

02:01:27.970 --> 02:01:30.670
The innovative filmmaker
and poet

02:01:30.670 --> 02:01:35.820
who wrote the groundbreaking
book of theory, Woman, Native,

02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:40.970
Other: Writing post
coloniality and feminism.

02:01:49.590 --> 02:01:52.500
Also, my contemporary,
Cathy Song,

02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:59.210
one a 1992 yield younger
poet award for Picture Bride.

02:01:59.210 --> 02:02:02.050
Here are the closing
lines from a later poem:

02:02:02.050 --> 02:02:08.540
"Don't talk like you came
from the pineapple fields,

02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:11.180
meant we couldn't
tall with our mouths,

02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:16.010
full of broken sentences,
couldn't shove "yuh?"

02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:19.340
Like food heaped onto spoons.

02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:22.950
Don't talk like you just came
from the pineapple fields,

02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:25.840
meant we had to speak
proper English.

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:29.720
We remained silent instead,
our tongues harnessed

02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:33.290
by the foreign shoelaces
of syntax,

02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:36.130
restrictive as the new
shoes Father brought home

02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:38.200
for us to wear.

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:43.090
But, you may wonder,
"what happened

02:02:43.090 --> 02:02:46.470
to the whole roots
theme in my title?".

02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:51.290
You know, who knows
what the roots are,

02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:56.700
until someone has the courage to
dig or someone notices something

02:02:56.700 --> 02:02:59.720
that seems out of place".

02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:05.290
Back in 1991, the first
edition of Island was edited

02:03:05.290 --> 02:03:11.500
and translated by Him Lai,
Genny Lim and Judy Yung.

02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:14.030
This in exception
of the anthology,

02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:15.550
The Big Aiiieeeee [phonetic]!

02:03:15.550 --> 02:03:19.460
literally brought to life
both original Cantonese

02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:24.740
and translated poems that
were carved onto the walls

02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:30.810
of Angel Island Detention Center
by Chinese hoping to immigrate

02:03:30.810 --> 02:03:35.510
between 1910 and 1940.

02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:40.270
Here is one of the many
poems, wish we had more.

02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:49.340
From the book Island: "Instead
of remaining a citizen of China,

02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:51.690
I willingly became an ox.

02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:57.890
I intended to come to
America to earn a living.

02:03:57.890 --> 02:04:00.890
The Western styled
buildings are lofty;

02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:04.500
but I have not the
luck to live in them.

02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:10.100
How was anyone to know that
my dwelling place would be

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:12.690
a prison?"

02:04:12.690 --> 02:04:16.350
Going back a few years
from the 1991 publication,

02:04:16.350 --> 02:04:23.270
in 1988 financial redress
was awarded to 82,000

02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:28.590
of the 120,000 detainees
of Japanese ancestry

02:04:28.590 --> 02:04:32.970
who had been incarcerated in
war time detention centers.

02:04:32.970 --> 02:04:36.420
They're followed a renewed
focus on those who struggled

02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:40.790
to survive and because
of what poetry can do,

02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:44.590
give song to protest and
passion, we have books

02:04:44.590 --> 02:04:48.660
such as Poets Behind
Barbed wire,

02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:55.360
here is one of the translated
poems: "Fifty and more

02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:59.860
of us prisoners gather
here to burn incense

02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:02.420
on an empty sardine can.

02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:05.920
For the repose of
a departed soul."

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:13.030
These are poems that were
written in the detention centers

02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:15.670
and then later translated.

02:05:15.670 --> 02:05:25.650
Karen mentioned Yoshiko
Uchida, the memoir Desert Exile,

02:05:25.650 --> 02:05:28.940
in that memoir there are poems

02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:33.690
by her mother whose
pen name was Yukari:

02:05:33.690 --> 02:05:38.090
"Four months have passed,
and at last I learn

02:05:38.090 --> 02:05:42.880
to call this horse
stall my family's home".

02:05:52.580 --> 02:06:00.860
Rereading the work of Violet
Kazue de Cristoforo was surely

02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:04.700
one of the most exhilarant.

02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:09.560
I was stunned to
recognize a literary root

02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:14.980
that hadn't struck me when the
collection came out in 1991.

02:06:17.390 --> 02:06:20.240
Here is one of the pieces:

02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:28.730
"Strong sunrays barracks are
all low and dark, sun rays.

02:06:28.730 --> 02:06:31.930
The arrival of spring and
summer is typically late

02:06:31.930 --> 02:06:34.760
in the high plains of Tule Lake,

02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:37.900
the largest of the ten
internment camps built

02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:42.880
to house more than 18,000
detainees on about six miles

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:45.990
of black volcanic ash.

02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:49.990
After the long, gloomy
winter days the intense glare

02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:54.380
of summer creates a strong
contrast and makes the low,

02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:58.180
dark, tar-papered barracks
seem even more dismal

02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:01.560
and disheartening
for the internees."

02:07:03.670 --> 02:07:12.970
The section in which
appears a Poetic Reflections

02:07:12.970 --> 02:07:16.790
of the Tule Lake
Internment Camp, 1944, sorry,

02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:21.880
this section appears
on this section

02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:25.110
of the [inaudible]
titled Poetic Reflections

02:07:25.110 --> 02:07:29.200
of the Tule Lake
Internment Camp, 1944.

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.640
What may not be apparent
by this title is

02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:38.680
that poetic reflections are a
form in Japanese literature.

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:42.810
You may know it as
Haibun, a mixed genre

02:07:42.810 --> 02:07:47.210
that typically combines
prose and Haiku.

02:07:47.210 --> 02:07:49.600
Here is another one
of her pieces.

02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:52.570
It's a little bit longer.

02:07:52.570 --> 02:07:57.620
So, we start with the Haiku
and it looks like a title

02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:02.530
but it's a Haiku:
"Flowers on Tule Reeds

02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:08.780
and Sandy Flats Brother
Confined over 200 Days,

02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:11.270
Brother's Imprisonment".

02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:17.370
The November 4, 1943, warehouse
incident, caused by reports

02:08:17.370 --> 02:08:19.950
of thefts of food
for the internees

02:08:19.950 --> 02:08:25.580
by War Relocation
Authority (WRA) personnel,

02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:31.010
resulted in confrontations
and disturbances at Tule Lake.

02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:35.230
Brother Tokyo, an innocent
bystander, had been asked

02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:38.960
to help restore order
among the agitators.

02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:42.100
As he was about to do
so, he was arrested

02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:46.340
by WRA Internal Security
Personnel and accused

02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:49.260
of taking part in the disorder.

02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:52.600
During a night of brutal
interrogation he was cruelly

02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:56.750
beaten and, not only was
he denied medical treatment

02:08:56.750 --> 02:09:01.590
for his injury, but he was
a prisoner in the "Bull Pen"

02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:06.010
of the camp stockade -- a
place for maximum punishment

02:09:06.010 --> 02:09:08.440
for serious offenders.

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:13.740
Following the occurrence,
army troops took over control

02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:19.000
of the camp and martial law
was declared at Tule Lake.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.540
Then came spring,
the snow melted

02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:25.600
and the Tule leaves
sprouted and grew.

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.280
By July the reeds
even had blossoms.

02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:33.470
Brother Tokio was still
confined in the 'Bull Pen'

02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:36.830
after nine months
of imprisonment

02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:39.830
without trial or a hearing.

02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:43.480
Fall was about to come again
and, under those conditions

02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:46.390
of dark uncertainty
and desperation,

02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:49.370
everything was measured
in terms of the growth

02:09:49.370 --> 02:09:52.720
and death of the Tule reeds."

02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:59.130
I have been writing in a
form known as the zuihitsu,

02:09:59.130 --> 02:10:00.970
a classical Japanese form

02:10:00.970 --> 02:10:05.150
that is neither poetry nor prose
although a piece can resemble

02:10:05.150 --> 02:10:07.340
either or a combination.

02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:11.160
Haibun, for example,
is considered zuihitsu.

02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:14.780
Also, Bash?'s The Narrow
Road to the Interior,

02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:18.310
which is a title I stole
for my collections.

02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:24.930
For me, to find a
writer, to rediscover her,

02:10:24.930 --> 02:10:27.700
who expressed herself
in this form,

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:30.290
was a shock of recognition.

02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:33.810
Again, I feel deeply connected
to a literary heritage

02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:36.690
that includes cross genre work.

02:10:36.690 --> 02:10:40.680
I recognize this
foremother for what she is.

02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:44.260
A writer, a pioneer, and
an Asian American woman

02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:45.560
who defiantly gave her name

02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:52.530
as Violet Kazue Matsuda
de Cristoforo,

02:10:52.530 --> 02:10:57.930
formerly Kazue Matsuda,
Internee ID No.

02:10:57.930 --> 02:11:09.120
29001 I want to thank the
organizers for asking me,

02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:12.580
inviting me to write
this, this summer.

02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:15.300
Half over has been my workshop.

02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:21.830
Just as Juan Felipe continued in
the comment that I began with,

02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:24.460
society was our workshop,

02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:28.430
it is always our workshop
whether we write alone

02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:31.850
or whether we write out in
the open it is not possible

02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:36.190
without social combustion,
social change,

02:11:36.190 --> 02:11:40.130
social human beings with voices
and hearts, and struggles

02:11:40.130 --> 02:11:43.030
and conflicts and
happiness and joy and riding

02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:46.770
on horses in full regalia.

02:11:46.770 --> 02:11:51.590
In closing, I have
a gift for you,

02:11:51.590 --> 02:11:58.850
and you may have copies
of it, is a Cento.

02:12:00.750 --> 02:12:09.320
This is a form where you
swipe lines by other writers.

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:15.400
I have taken a line from
every poet in the anthology,

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:21.960
and it's all in the same order
of the anthology: "Angel Island:

02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:25.380
A Cento" Thank you poetry
magazine [laughter] --

02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:29.310
Angel Island: A Cento.

02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:40.210
"Let the walls hiss/and
smoke when/I return to shore.

02:12:40.210 --> 02:12:45.780
Someone is scolding a dog,
barking now for/decades --

02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:54.080
I don't have emotions right now,
I like that he expresses himself

02:12:54.080 --> 02:13:00.300
to me as a kind of
witness in transition --

02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:04.510
by "women," he meant
Arab and Muslim women.

02:13:04.510 --> 02:13:10.250
A cop arrested her, trapped her
in the back of the police van.

02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:13.630
-- hope wrapped in old
newspapers and thrown away

02:13:13.630 --> 02:13:18.620
like offal, cleaned from
a fish the size of a man.

02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:23.780
This place in which I dream the
new body, whole and abiding,

02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:26.780
all the girls go suzie.

02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:30.740
Dance is a body's
refusal to die --

02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:35.330
as foretold by the Muslim
woman from Hornachos,

02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:42.710
shutters over the eyes, (the
CD: Converge, Jane Doe).

02:13:42.710 --> 02:13:46.300
Once, I was afraid
of being changed.

02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:48.140
Now that is done.

02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:51.170
To be an artist, you
must not blunt your,

02:13:51.170 --> 02:13:54.040
troubling vision,
no matter how queer.

02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:59.130
[Speaking French],
where do we come from?

02:13:59.130 --> 02:14:01.990
When the rains arrive,
we should be delighted

02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:07.480
to be taken/in drowning,
in devotion.

02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:11.100
The car radio plays
its one song.

02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:14.920
The song, therefore,
is important.

02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:20.750
Where are we going, Wayne
Kaumualii [phonetic] Westlake?

02:14:20.750 --> 02:14:24.870
Can't they hear kalapani
in my voice --

02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:27.760
I am trying to be marvelous.

02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.020
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, ¡wow!

02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:38.530
The trick of the model
minority, walk away.

02:14:38.530 --> 02:14:42.500
I try to imitate them at home,
mira mamá, but my mother yells

02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:44.270
at me, says they
didn't come here

02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:47.070
so I could speak
some beggar language.

02:14:47.070 --> 02:14:50.640
Now that the hillbilly
whisper guides me which way

02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:55.570
to turn how far up the
turn is for the bird,

02:14:55.570 --> 02:14:57.830
everything hangs in the air.

02:14:57.830 --> 02:15:02.250
'Ay Dios', she exclaimed,
surrounded by photos,

02:15:02.250 --> 02:15:07.350
niños and nietos, where
I'm the only chino --

02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:12.410
You speak of a very good
sort of Englishness,

02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:15.690
who are you to mix up languages?

02:15:15.690 --> 02:15:22.760
Grouse, crow, craven,
or have in the past --

02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:25.600
His tongue tingled ripely.

02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:29.110
To make you a noun forever.

02:15:29.110 --> 02:15:32.180
A cunning rabbit
needs three holes,

02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:35.430
but I have never seen the field.

02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:38.090
All my life I hid in
the library reading

02:15:38.090 --> 02:15:42.060
about Greek heroes
smiting their enemies.

02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:44.040
Mother died a refugee,

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:48.850
she thought the status
was a promise of return.

02:15:48.850 --> 02:15:55.110
Tonight, spring infuses
fall, and memory's wick --

02:15:55.110 --> 02:15:59.930
observatories rise above
the snow, militarized.

02:15:59.930 --> 02:16:03.240
I think I could wrap
my arms all the way

02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:10.090
around the 24,901 miles
circumferenced Earth.

02:16:10.090 --> 02:16:13.070
And circle and contain.

02:16:13.070 --> 02:16:17.990
I worry that when I love
him he will die too.

02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:22.590
The radio in the kitchen is
stuck in the year I was born.

02:16:22.590 --> 02:16:26.740
The capitals of the
world are burning."

02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:28.540
Thank you so much.

02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:43.110
[ Applause ]

02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:45.270
?? Fred Sasaki: Thank
you so much, Kimiko.

02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:47.090
Let's have another round
of applauses for Kimiko.

02:16:47.090 --> 02:16:48.890
Thank you, that was beautiful.

02:16:48.890 --> 02:16:57.040
[ Applause ]

02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:01.300
So, wow, what an especial
few days these have been.

02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:04.940
I want to say how
marvelous it's been to see

02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:08.990
so many Asian-American writers
and readers in one space,

02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:11.080
so good job everybody.

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:16.210
So, I am Fred Sasaki, the art
director for Poetry Magazine.

02:17:16.210 --> 02:17:19.650
And, Poetry Magazine, if you
don't know was found in 1912

02:17:19.650 --> 02:17:22.710
by Harriet Monroe,
coming out of Chicago.

02:17:22.710 --> 02:17:25.480
And also, I want to say a
quick hello to our friends

02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:30.420
on the internet, I understand
this is also a webcast, and so,

02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:35.130
after the show today you can
click on poetryfoundation.org

02:17:35.130 --> 02:17:40.090
and check our newly
redesigned website

02:17:40.090 --> 02:17:42.350
and subscribe to the magazine.

02:17:42.350 --> 02:17:46.160
You can purchase the issue
that we are talking about

02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:50.440
and we will enjoy
readings from in a moment,

02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:53.630
but you probably be even
happier if you subscribe

02:17:53.630 --> 02:17:57.300
to a full year of
Poetry Magazine.

02:17:57.300 --> 02:18:02.850
So, pardon the cliché, but in
poetry we continuously strive

02:18:02.850 --> 02:18:05.070
to make it new and, so,

02:18:05.070 --> 02:18:09.060
this July/August issue debut
is a brand-new cover program

02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:13.700
created by pentagram and
along with the website,

02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:15.960
and also online you
can check out a suit

02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:18.770
of podcast and other features.

02:18:18.770 --> 02:18:21.340
So, like it was said early,

02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:24.830
I have been with Poetry
Magazine for 17 years.

02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:26.590
Believe it or not.

02:18:26.590 --> 02:18:28.560
Along with Stephen
Young we started off

02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:32.080
in the Newberry Library,
kind of talked our way

02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:34.300
in the stacks building,
in a small room

02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:39.820
with a window probably
about this wide.

02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:45.110
It's been such a great
journey to go from there

02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:49.750
to now free-standing building in
the Superior Street in Chicago,

02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:53.450
a building made of windows
essentially, and then to be here

02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:56.480
at the Library of the
Congress with you all.

02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:58.780
It is such a pleasure,
and I want to say

02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:02.630
that within those 17
years, and I'm biased,

02:19:02.630 --> 02:19:04.480
this is my favorite issue

02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:09.510
that I've seen published
during that time.

02:19:09.510 --> 02:19:12.280
[ Applause ]

02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:15.150
I would actually go so far

02:19:15.150 --> 02:19:17.240
as to say this is the
best issue [laughter]

02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:21.250
that I've seen so far.

02:19:21.250 --> 02:19:25.810
But, without further due, I will
introduce to you our readers

02:19:25.810 --> 02:19:28.450
who will be reading work
that is in this issue.

02:19:28.450 --> 02:19:32.460
I won't read their bios, for
that you will have to spend $3

02:19:32.460 --> 02:19:34.830
after the show and
pick up the issue

02:19:34.830 --> 02:19:38.110
of your own, which
you will love.

02:19:38.110 --> 02:19:43.230
So, in this order coming to
stage is Mei-mei Berssenbrugge,

02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:48.580
John Yau, Paisley Rekdal, Kazim
Ali, Khaty Xiong, Sally Wen Mao,

02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:50.660
Rajiv Mohabir, and Gerald Maa.

02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:52.510
Thank you so much,
thank you for coming.

02:19:52.510 --> 02:20:13.040
[ Applause ]

02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:15.440
??Mei-mei Berssenbrugge:
I'm very happy

02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:19.390
to be here, thank you everyone.

02:20:19.390 --> 02:20:24.720
My poem "The new boy", was
written in New Mexico and it's

02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:30.970
in four sections: "You may find

02:20:30.970 --> 02:20:40.180
at the market a casual comment
swerves into?conversation that's

02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:45.210
deeply metaphysical with
a young man by produce.

02:20:45.210 --> 02:20:50.610
He wears a white T and
jeans, ordinary yet careful

02:20:50.610 --> 02:20:55.960
about his food --
Every time I meditate,

02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:59.720
I begin in space among
the stars -- he says --

02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:05.770
Many of these being
-- he continues --

02:21:05.770 --> 02:21:11.810
are not physically 3-D, so it's
frustrating to describe them.

02:21:11.810 --> 02:21:18.250
I have the impression their
silver color comes from within.

02:21:18.250 --> 02:21:26.010
They look at me with tremendous
love from almond-shaped eyes.

02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:28.030
There's no sunlight.

02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:31.900
The whole cloud structure
is luminous

02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:34.930
and the ground crystalline.

02:21:34.930 --> 02:21:39.250
A lot of purple and
blue, like twilight --

02:21:39.250 --> 02:21:47.280
It's a complex, partly
inarticulate narrative,

02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:51.200
perhaps because he feels
I won't believe him,

02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:54.860
yet he's spontaneous.

02:21:54.860 --> 02:22:00.790
I don't need to question
the reality of his story.

02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:03.170
He's sincere.

02:22:05.930 --> 02:22:11.800
There's more energy now as heat,
connectivity, radio waves, data,

02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:17.480
X-rays, and all kinds
of interactions.

02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:22.260
We operate with higher
electrical current inside,

02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:26.750
which can?rejuvenate you
physically by the nature

02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:34.900
of connectivity,
moving?freely around the body.

02:22:34.900 --> 02:22:40.000
The next week, smiling,
mid-sentence, 'seeing Earth

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:46.100
from deep space, blue and
alive' More often now,

02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:51.990
ETs are discussed at the
co-op, also, coincidence,

02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:57.480
spirit molecules, time tunnels,
and quantum uncertainty,

02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:00.120
since we're close
to The Institute.

02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:06.020
I like that he expresses
himself to me as a kind

02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:10.060
of witness in transition.

02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:15.690
He's read my work, and thinks
me more knowledgeable than I am,

02:23:15.690 --> 02:23:18.660
since my poems aren't true.

02:23:20.010 --> 02:23:25.760
-- Pleiadians create new visuals
through which I can imagine --

02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:31.830
he says -- My care is
required for witness

02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:37.340
to resonate energetically
with listener,

02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:41.050
however nonchalant I appear.

02:23:41.050 --> 02:23:46.830
The more compassion one has
for non-normal experiences

02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:52.570
of others, the sooner
consciousness will shift toward

02:23:52.570 --> 02:23:54.690
the stars.

02:23:54.690 --> 02:23:59.610
To him, this means shifting
the ethical structure

02:23:59.610 --> 02:24:02.770
of communicating a narrative.

02:24:02.770 --> 02:24:14.770
'I think of myself in
a service capacity'".

02:24:14.770 --> 02:24:19.350
"One silvery insect
was seven feet tall;

02:24:19.350 --> 02:24:23.300
I shook his claw
and we conversed.

02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:27.220
Sometimes reptiles
hoard crystals to send

02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:29.810
and receive information.

02:24:29.810 --> 02:24:37.170
Lipids in a membrane behave like
that, channeling the atmosphere.

02:24:37.170 --> 02:24:42.690
At home I write,
'The membrane is

02:24:42.690 --> 02:24:48.750
like a liquid crystal
to the sky'.

02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:51.690
Next week, in line, he's
with a beautiful woman

02:24:51.690 --> 02:24:54.860
with a worn face who knows me.

02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:56.830
-- She's not well,
and she wants me

02:24:56.830 --> 02:25:00.650
to visit them and their animals.

02:25:00.650 --> 02:25:04.710
They know they don't end
when they die -- she says --

02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:11.770
It's sad they're leaving,
but it's voluntary,

02:25:11.770 --> 02:25:17.130
they've relatives on other
planets, sentient beings

02:25:17.130 --> 02:25:20.530
with the right to vote.

02:25:20.530 --> 02:25:24.440
Have you ever watched an animal
and suddenly it disappears?

02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:27.730
He chips in.

02:25:27.730 --> 02:25:34.370
Witness involves a significance
equivalent to truth.

02:25:34.370 --> 02:25:39.140
The whole idea of visiting
another planet, communicating

02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:45.120
with a being from another
world, to me that's spiritual.

02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:53.090
When they speak, they
subtly vary certain sounds;

02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:58.140
I hear words, but their sound
carries different meaning

02:25:58.140 --> 02:25:59.450
to my body.

02:25:59.450 --> 02:26:06.770
Some words I read weren't
there when I began.

02:26:06.770 --> 02:26:12.100
Use these new words,
enhanced by your imagining,

02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:18.270
to allow our dimension to
emerge -- they told me --

02:26:18.270 --> 02:26:28.110
Imagination stabilizes the shift
-- In Santa Fe, in Tucson, Lima,

02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:33.560
La Paz, people see
extraterrestrials.

02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:41.990
When I step outside, a velvety
multitude of moths and insects,

02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:46.490
transparencies, on
my screen door whirls

02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:50.510
up to the porch light.

02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:55.830
Milky Way shines 3-D with
white clottings and dark rifts,

02:26:55.830 --> 02:27:00.370
covering the ground and
trees with phosphorescence.

02:27:00.370 --> 02:27:06.060
Comets, asteroids from deep
space, planets moving at will,

02:27:06.060 --> 02:27:11.430
contribute to this
glamour of wonder.

02:27:11.430 --> 02:27:15.920
He shows me how to pull
frequency, starlight,

02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:19.180
down through his
body into the ground,

02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:22.810
and I try it; I'm more open now.

02:27:22.810 --> 02:27:30.330
I can carry more light, which
fuses with similar energies

02:27:30.330 --> 02:27:32.560
in mass consciousness.

02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:39.890
Earth will radiate this
consciousness as a star or a sun

02:27:39.890 --> 02:27:42.800
on horizons of his other worlds.

02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:47.890
-- Let us hold that
portal open for you,

02:27:47.890 --> 02:27:54.990
in the form of your little crush
on him, of light streaming down,

02:27:54.990 --> 02:28:02.520
and feel a surrounding new
ideal -- they say to me --

02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:07.140
Now, imagine yourself
in the Pleiades.

02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:12.560
You wish to give a present to
the source, like compassion

02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:15.240
or rainwater from home --

02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:22.610
Early on, I divined that
this book already exists

02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:25.350
in the future.

02:28:25.350 --> 02:28:29.870
After all, I'd thought of
it; it's a probability,

02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:35.540
somewhere, complete, on a shelf.

02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:41.350
My intention is to seek that
future edition and consult it

02:28:41.350 --> 02:28:46.320
to create this one,
the original, for you."

02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:49.510
Thank you.

thank everyone who invited me

02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:20.610
but especially, Timothy, you
sent me an email inviting me

02:29:20.610 --> 02:29:23.250
to contribute to this issue.

02:29:23.250 --> 02:29:27.010
At first, I thought he was
playing an April fool's joke

02:29:27.010 --> 02:29:30.820
but then I realized
it wasn't April.

02:29:30.820 --> 02:29:40.850
I'm going to read two pantuns,
"Something to Look Forward To",

02:29:40.850 --> 02:29:46.790
I imagine this is written
by a man about my age

02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:52.250
but perhaps not: "A
blue and green city,

02:29:52.250 --> 02:29:58.380
with the sun rising behind
it, just not swiftly enough.

of observed?phenomena?

02:30:53.950 --> 02:30:56.460
You might need a reevaluation,

02:30:56.460 --> 02:31:00.420
an estimate, or an
era to expire.

of joining the circus?

02:32:59.080 --> 02:33:00.790
You might find a home there.

Our company motto:
'other than you,

Choosing suitable punishments
is an unavoidable necessity.

my place in the universe,

suitable punishments is an

Thank you everyone who's
been organizing this,

it's just been a
fantastic event.

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:43.940
I was going to read the poem
that appears in Poetry Magazine,

02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:50.000
Driving down to Santa Fe: "Quick
swim up through my headlights:

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:56.070
gold eye, a startle in black:
green swift glance raking mine.

02:34:56.070 --> 02:35:00.220
A full second, we
held each other, gone.

02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:04.500
Gone. And how did I
know what to call it?

02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:10.110
Lynx, the only possible reply
though I'd never seen one.

02:35:10.110 --> 02:35:13.530
The car filling with
it: moonlight, piñon:

02:35:13.530 --> 02:35:17.130
a cat's acrid smell of terror.

02:35:17.130 --> 02:35:22.670
How quickly the gray body fled,
swerving to avoid my light.

02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:25.670
And how often that
sight returns to me,

02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:30.480
shames me to know how much
more this fragment matters.

02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:34.120
More than the broad
back of a man I loved.

02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:36.660
More than the image
of my friend,

02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:40.220
cancer-struck, curled
by her toilet.

02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:43.860
More than my regret for
the child I did not have

02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:47.500
which I thought once
would pierce me, utterly.

02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:50.520
Nothing beside that
dense muscle,

02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:54.500
faint gold guard hairs
stirring the dark.

02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:59.670
And if I keep these scraps of
it, what did it keep of me?

02:35:59.670 --> 02:36:02.260
A flight, a thunder.

02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:06.700
A shield of light dropped
before the eyes, pinned inside

02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:10.470
that magnificent skull
only time would release.

02:36:10.470 --> 02:36:14.140
Split back, fade and reveal.

02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:16.510
Wind would open him.

02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:21.260
Sun would turn him
commonplace: a knot of flies,

02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:25.920
a rib cage of shredded
tendon, wasp-nest fragile.

02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:30.090
The treasure of him,
like anything, gone.

02:36:30.090 --> 02:36:34.910
Even now, I thumb that face
like a coin I cannot spend.

02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:38.540
If something in me
lived, it lived in him,

02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:42.780
fishing the cold trout-thick
streams, waking to snow,

02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:46.570
dying when he died,
which is a comfort.

02:36:46.570 --> 02:36:48.130
I must say this.

02:36:48.130 --> 02:36:52.110
Otherwise, I myself
do not exist.

02:36:52.110 --> 02:36:54.560
It looked at me a moment.

02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:58.560
A flash of green,
of gold and white.

02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:02.250
Then the dark came
down again, between us.

02:37:02.250 --> 02:37:06.090
Once, I was afraid
of being changed.

02:37:06.090 --> 02:37:08.350
Now that is done.

02:37:08.350 --> 02:37:11.380
The lynx has me in its eye.

02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:13.720

And just read you a poem
that I've been working on

02:38:05.540 --> 02:38:10.540
and it's not in this
journal, but it's available.

02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:14.690
It's called Golden Boy.

02:38:14.690 --> 02:38:18.300
I went on a run through all
the monuments the other day

02:38:18.300 --> 02:38:20.590
down here, so I just been
thinking about monuments

02:38:20.590 --> 02:38:22.630
and came to me that I wanted
to read this poem to you,

02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:25.000

dollars food or god does shine.

02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:24.270
who have been here today,
and the last two days,

02:41:24.270 --> 02:41:26.960
three days of the festival.

02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:30.070
I'll be reading two poems.

02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:39.650
I lost my mother about a
year ago on May 16th, 2016,

02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:43.290
to a very violent car crash.

02:41:43.290 --> 02:41:47.210
She was on her way to
actually visit my late brother

02:41:47.210 --> 02:41:51.210
and his widow, and his
children and she never made it.

02:41:51.210 --> 02:41:53.790
And my family, they're
in California,

02:41:53.790 --> 02:41:59.570
and I have been residing in Ohio
the last decade, combined years.

02:41:59.570 --> 02:42:05.290
So, it was very odd to
receive this phone call

02:42:05.290 --> 02:42:06.680
in the middle of the night.

02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:09.360
It felt like a dream.

02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:11.030
And the first thing
I immediately thought

02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:14.760
of was my mother's
spirit, and her garden,

02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:18.050
she was a shaman,
a medicine woman.

02:42:18.050 --> 02:42:20.350
She healed people.

02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:24.320
So, actually the week
leading up to the weekend

02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:30.000
of her funeral I was home and
I made my way through the house

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.780
and found myself in her garden

02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:36.890
and already immediately
the garden had started

02:42:36.890 --> 02:42:38.920
to wither and die.

02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:43.530
And California summers
are so brutal, and so hot.

02:42:43.530 --> 02:42:46.070
So, I found myself there
and I was accompanied

02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:51.030
by a little mouse that
decided to join me

02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:55.670
for just a few seconds
before I scared it away.

02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:00.250
So, this poem is called
"In mother's garden":

02:43:03.250 --> 02:43:08.820
Quietly now a mouse in the
garden that has come to mourn

02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:15.150
with me or bite at every
insect twisting in this heat

02:43:15.150 --> 02:43:20.900
as you lie close and uncaring in
the army of the common housefly.

02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:27.210
Let it be known that in
death you harrowed in love &amp;

02:43:27.210 --> 02:43:32.660
in so doing traded your
ears for blackened ones,

02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:36.220
your crown the shade
of a new moon.

02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:43.650
Let this spell be known as the
fortune of a missing tortoise,

02:43:43.650 --> 02:43:49.030
brutal limbs and
wounds of multiples.

02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:54.420
Then, to soften alongside
the watermelon rinds

02:43:54.420 --> 02:44:00.870
on this blighted day, your body
presently absent including the

02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:05.850
mouse I have startled
into darkness.

02:44:05.850 --> 02:44:11.820
Who will help me love
the castor bean tree now?

02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:16.640
Which of these plants
will speak for you?

02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:20.450
Ignore me while I
weave between rows,

02:44:20.450 --> 02:44:24.610
swatting at the light I
have chased into the corner

02:44:24.610 --> 02:44:29.830
of your makeshift shed
still full of your fortune,

02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:33.610
the abundant secret
of mouse droppings.

02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:42.000
Meanwhile, stay dressed
help me be decent.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.190

02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:50.930

arise in one piece!

02:44:50.930 --> 02:44:53.230

Even the sun could
not spoil you."

02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:04.930
And then I'll be closing with
a poem that I brought shortly

02:45:04.930 --> 02:45:09.050
after returning from her
funeral, I currently live

02:45:09.050 --> 02:45:12.880
in Columbus, Ohio, and they
have a beautiful conservatory

02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:14.180

if you ever been there
it's really beautiful.

02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:23.270
And, I weirdly just found
myself kind of wandering

02:45:23.270 --> 02:45:27.560
through the space
because the monks believed

02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:32.220
that the deceased may often
visit you in the form of flora

02:45:32.220 --> 02:45:36.900
and fauna, and I knew it
was soon to be visiting

02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:40.220
and hoping to see her.

02:45:40.220 --> 02:45:43.510
But it was a healing
moment for me

02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:48.380
to have found myself
in this space.

a window, a white morpho,

02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:34.540
the only kind to perch
long enough for me

02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:41.630
to satisfy my collecting??its
lunar afterglow still hanging

02:46:41.630 --> 02:46:46.270
as I pulse and pace
to get a closer look.

02:46:46.270 --> 02:46:50.360
I am separate from the boy
who climbs a nearby tower

02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:53.150
and shouts for his father.

02:46:54.310 --> 02:47:01.560
Perhaps I am half of
this?a set of dots for eyes,

02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:06.720
spine for spine, my
insides half my father's?

02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:09.710
half my mother's.

sovereign cavities, mother
whose torso fell early

02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:26.590
in harvest??a bed of muscle
to hold her from splitting

02:47:26.590 --> 02:47:31.140
in two??and do we hear it?

02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:36.650
As in a fever the boy runs back
&amp; does not see the white morpho

02:47:36.650 --> 02:47:42.190
the way I must see it: my
personal moon stone-ripe

02:47:42.190 --> 02:47:44.740
in this foreign corner,

02:47:44.740 --> 02:47:50.020

02:48:56.150 --> 02:49:00.680
that has organized this
incredible festival.

02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:06.100
And I also want to acknowledge
that it's really strange

02:49:06.100 --> 02:49:08.700
to be standing on
this fancy podium

02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:14.800
and reading this poem
called "Inauguration Poem".

02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:20.290
So, close to the inauguration.

02:49:20.290 --> 02:49:25.970
And in this poem, I
took all the words --

02:49:25.970 --> 02:49:28.200
well there was a newspaper

02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:32.920
that published all the
words never before spoken

02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:39.820
in an inauguration until this
year, and I took all those words

02:49:39.820 --> 02:49:44.150
and I put them in this poem.

02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:53.600
And, I just want to say
that it feels so radical

02:49:53.600 --> 02:50:01.400
to create this space in this
location, to create this space

02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:07.560
that asserts on how important
language is and how words are,

02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:12.250
and how words and language is
related to power, and how words

02:50:12.250 --> 02:50:17.630
and language can exploit power
but also kind of reclaim it.

02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:26.840
And I hope we come away
from this weekend with that

02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:35.200
in our hearts, like
that idea that our words

02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:40.050
and our language
can reclaim that.

02:50:40.050 --> 02:50:43.300
OK, so, this poem is
called "Inauguration Poem".

02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:49.900
"A girl stalked a
sheep in a field.

02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:54.960
The sheep began to bleed
and the whole field smelled

02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:56.880
like carnage.

02:50:56.880 --> 02:51:02.200
A butcher had moved in
and slaughtered the sheep.

02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:05.870
Red, the stain on her dress.

02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:08.400
Empty, her basket.

02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:13.700
The depletion of resources
winter sowed??the house

02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:17.370
on the hill in disrepair.

02:51:17.370 --> 02:51:22.260
In the vacated house, the
girl tried to flush the blood

02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:25.620
down the toilet but the
infrastructure couldn't

02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:29.840
completely erase the
evidence of life.

02:51:29.840 --> 02:51:33.640
The girl studied
Islamic history,

02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:36.440
the origin of arithmetic.

02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:40.320
The stain turned
the girl into a lady

02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:45.230
in her country's blighted
first-world landscape.

02:51:45.230 --> 02:51:52.020
History's pages were open,
one by one they ripped.

02:51:52.020 --> 02:51:57.720
When she asked the spout
for water, it rusted.

02:51:57.720 --> 02:51:59.590
She grew cold.

02:51:59.590 --> 02:52:01.290
She grew weary.

02:52:01.290 --> 02:52:03.360
She grew sad.

02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:08.520
If only she could ban
the butcher in solidarity

02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:13.920
with the bad children,
the refugees and outcasts.

02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:20.190
Instead she drove into the city,
the urban sprawl swallowing her.

02:52:20.190 --> 02:52:25.360
She went into a store, got
caught stealing a candy bar.

02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:30.800
Surveillance footage
showed she had no remorse.

02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:35.760
She justified: We all
live on stolen land.

02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:40.130
Why not one bar of
chocolate, subsidized?

02:52:40.130 --> 02:52:46.980
Then she remembered prisoners,
their tombstones unmarked.

02:52:46.980 --> 02:52:52.480
A cop arrested her, trapped her
in the back of the police van.

02:52:52.480 --> 02:52:57.800
Trillions of atoms
spinning inside her body,

02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:03.370
an unrealized commodity
for strange men's agendas.

02:53:03.370 --> 02:53:09.640
Order, dystopia, blueprint
of urban catastrophe.

02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:15.020
The streets, without
strangers, all barren.

02:53:15.020 --> 02:53:20.570

protection, all windswept."

my little poem to live

02:54:25.010 --> 02:54:28.170
in this issue, and
it's called "Coolie".

02:54:28.170 --> 02:54:33.150
I am from a community of south
Asians taken to the Caribbean

02:54:33.150 --> 02:54:37.940
in the 1800s to cut cane,
and so, this poem is written

02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:40.850
in a form that I developed
while I worked with Kimiko

02:54:40.850 --> 02:54:43.270
at Queens College, I'm
calling it a [inaudible] poem,

02:54:43.270 --> 02:54:47.640
it's based on kind of folk
music that if you have gone

02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:50.020
down to Queens, any place,
you've probably heard it,

02:54:50.020 --> 02:54:52.420
like on streets,
coming from cars.

02:54:52.420 --> 02:54:58.100
And I developed the form
based on the song Kaise Banie

02:54:58.100 --> 02:55:01.180
by Sundar Popo, a
Trinitarian singer.

02:55:01.180 --> 02:55:05.960
And thinking about form carrying
history, this is a kind of form

02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:07.530
that carries my history.

02:55:07.530 --> 02:55:10.640
And it's written in
three different kind

02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:12.440
of movements, such languages.

02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:15.180
The verse is plantation
Hindi or Caribbean Bhojpuri

02:55:15.180 --> 02:55:18.000
which it's a language
that I come from.

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:22.380
The next is Creole
or Guyanese English,

02:55:22.380 --> 02:55:23.680
that I come from as well,

02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:25.650
and then the other one
of course is English.

02:55:25.650 --> 02:55:30.850
So, it starts with a chorus in
Caribbean Hindi, what I'll do is

02:55:30.850 --> 02:55:32.150
that I'll read it in the verse

02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:33.720
and then I'll read
the translation,

02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:36.160
but since it is a chorus,
at the very end of the poem,

02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:38.880
I'll read it again
in translation.

02:55:39.930 --> 02:55:44.240
Coolie, which is a bad, bad,
slur for Hindu-Caribbean people.

02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:46.510

?? Gerald Maa: It's
good to be here.

02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:52.720
So, when Lawrence told me to
read from this issue I turned

02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:57.680
to Emily Dickinson, because
for the longest time the poem

02:57:57.680 --> 02:58:01.150
in here, its title was
an appropriated lines

02:58:01.150 --> 02:58:02.510
from Emily Dickinson.

02:58:02.510 --> 02:58:05.510
Wanted to consult these lines
again just, touching the base

02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:07.170
of a poem I wrote years ago.

02:58:07.170 --> 02:58:10.750
And after that I played a
little sortilege with Dickinson,

02:58:10.750 --> 02:58:12.810
you know, flipping at
random for guidance,

02:58:12.810 --> 02:58:14.110
you know like Methodist do.

02:58:14.110 --> 02:58:19.340
So, if I'm a Methodist,
I'm a Dickinson Methodist.

02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:25.550
And it is just astounding how
consistently I get profound,

02:58:25.550 --> 02:58:26.850
it is.

02:58:26.850 --> 02:58:31.550
And I chance upon a
poem that could exist,

02:58:31.550 --> 02:58:34.450
you know it just broke all
the expectations that I had

02:58:34.450 --> 02:58:36.960
for Dickinson of
the Dickinson poem.

02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:40.910
In a large part, because of
its historical timeliness

02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:43.310
which I thought which
everybody thinks is anathema

02:58:43.310 --> 02:58:45.690
of a Dickinson poem, right?

02:58:45.690 --> 02:58:51.960
And, so, the poem goes:
"The mob within the heart.

02:58:51.960 --> 02:58:55.250
Police cannot suppress.

02:58:55.250 --> 02:58:57.320
The riot given at the first.

02:58:57.320 --> 02:59:01.120
Is sanctified as peace.

02:59:01.120 --> 02:59:06.620
Uncertified of scene
or signified as sound.

02:59:06.620 --> 02:59:11.350
But growing like a hurricane
in a congenial ground."

02:59:11.350 --> 02:59:15.570
And, so, I mean, I
should have stopped there,

02:59:15.570 --> 02:59:21.290
really [laughter] But, you
know, as deeply cynical

02:59:21.290 --> 02:59:26.040
as I am these days, as I can be
these days, I do have to admit

02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:29.360
to myself that often
times I have the privilege

02:59:29.360 --> 02:59:31.790
of crossing congenial ground.

02:59:31.790 --> 02:59:36.280
And I think that kind of the key
to that poem is taking genial

02:59:36.280 --> 02:59:40.190
of the roof for one of
my most loathed words,

02:59:40.190 --> 02:59:42.350
one of the words I
hate the most: Genius.

02:59:42.350 --> 02:59:44.020
Genial is the root for genius.

02:59:44.020 --> 02:59:49.010
And prefixing it with a word
that attributes that to a crowd.

02:59:49.010 --> 02:59:51.930
And, so, one of the takeaways

02:59:51.930 --> 02:59:57.470
from these three days is these
words not only in the podium

02:59:57.470 --> 03:00:01.820
but words that I heard across
tables, you know, overdrinks,

03:00:01.820 --> 03:00:04.380
small talk in the
hallway that does a lot

03:00:04.380 --> 03:00:06.220
of "ethics in work", you know.

03:00:06.220 --> 03:00:12.580
This is on tape so it's on
to perpetuity so I'm glad,

03:00:12.580 --> 03:00:15.030
this is the only thing
that people ten years

03:00:15.030 --> 03:00:20.120
from now will remember
or can find of me.

03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:21.680
I'm happy.

03:00:21.680 --> 03:00:24.440
But one of the things I
learned from these three days is

03:00:24.440 --> 03:00:28.080
that any form of politics
imaginable that I know

03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:31.940
that I want to be a part of
would be congenial in that way.

03:00:31.940 --> 03:00:35.460
And, so, it's a certain
bit of authority

03:00:35.460 --> 03:00:40.510
but please let's applause the
crowd and the host before I --

03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:46.870
[ Applause ]

03:00:46.870 --> 03:00:48.860
OK, now to the lesser work,

03:00:48.860 --> 03:00:52.850
my poem here it's
a three-part poem.

03:00:52.850 --> 03:00:56.020
I'm going to read, just
stick with the last part.

03:00:56.020 --> 03:01:00.190
In a service of time, and
is a little bit longer.

03:01:00.190 --> 03:01:04.300
It's a travel poem to a place
in Thailand, a city called Pai.

03:01:04.300 --> 03:01:09.030
I learned from Adrienne Rich
that dates are important, so,

03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:11.390
you know, I made
these travels in 2005.

03:01:11.390 --> 03:01:14.960
Wrote this poem, you know, a
couple of years after that.

03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:18.590
Now let me find the poem.

03:01:18.590 --> 03:01:20.990
I'm only reading
the last section.

03:01:20.990 --> 03:01:25.720
Yes? Takes time.

03:01:25.720 --> 03:01:30.470
You're my elder and I
review you on the page.

03:01:30.470 --> 03:01:32.030
[Laughter] The first words
he has ever spoke to me

03:01:32.030 --> 03:01:34.430
as a command, so I must hear it.

03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:37.400
[Laughter] I've been hearing
your commands in the page

03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:46.080
for so long, it's weird
to have it in person.

03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:49.750
OK, well [inaudible] OK,
I'll read it in whole.

03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:51.050
Thank you.

03:01:51.050 --> 03:01:53.610
It's called "The
Blighted Star Fruit":

03:01:53.610 --> 03:01:58.930
"To pass through astonishment
and know much too late.

03:01:58.930 --> 03:02:04.080
And because habit makes us
strange, I find myself searching

03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:08.010
on a landscape that generates
questions beyond its ability

03:02:08.010 --> 03:02:09.790
to solve.

03:02:09.790 --> 03:02:13.730
That dark post out there
might be this poem standing

03:02:13.730 --> 03:02:18.600
as you would?lead in the 4th
grade play??under theater lights

03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:22.090
and your shadows that
petal around you.

03:02:22.090 --> 03:02:25.410
And what should be
most memorable isn't.

03:02:25.410 --> 03:02:29.550
So, I recall those prolonged
moments of silence, incongruous.

03:02:29.550 --> 03:02:33.170
And revealing as
metaphor, most frequently.

03:02:33.170 --> 03:02:36.670
For instance, waiting
at the bus stop in Pai

03:02:36.670 --> 03:02:39.490
in a midmorning the hue
of the roadside guardrails

03:02:39.490 --> 03:02:42.600
that dot the cliff's
side like Morse code.

03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:47.030
Before leaving with trees, those
felled, ones half-painted white,

03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:51.370
the burnt trunks -- That passed
by like the so many phenomena

03:02:51.370 --> 03:02:54.390
of our days blurred
together into a motion.

03:02:54.390 --> 03:02:58.310
At times, convincing
as a nickelodeon's,

03:02:58.310 --> 03:02:59.980
I waited under the thatched roof

03:02:59.980 --> 03:03:02.830
of the station with
other travelers.

03:03:02.830 --> 03:03:05.150
With each in our
common solitude risen

03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:06.750
around like that Haydn piece.

03:03:06.750 --> 03:03:10.820
In the tunnel I descended into
on my way out onto Broadway

03:03:10.820 --> 03:03:15.220
from the 1 train some months
ago, it seemed of Hopper.

03:03:15.220 --> 03:03:20.440
Star fruit on the ground
discolored, withering, blighted.

03:03:20.440 --> 03:03:22.500
Three of the town's
strays hobbled

03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:25.080
by before midday's
heat stalled the town

03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:28.560
like some lost Stephano,
Trinculo, and their lamed,

03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:32.660
Dark sycophant?-- ?at least
that's what they were for me.

03:03:32.660 --> 03:03:36.910
It wasn't comfort, never
comfort, but something else.

03:03:36.910 --> 03:03:40.440
And when each moment with
expectations for more

03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:45.170
Than it can hold leads to the
next, and soon??as then --

03:03:45.170 --> 03:03:49.720
expectation fills up the day
as does your breath a balloon,

03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:54.050
the day floats with such
care and strange hours.

03:03:54.050 --> 03:03:57.770
And both pleasure and pain
are motions of the soul --

03:03:57.770 --> 03:04:03.770
plato wrote, ?poetry's
banisher, beauty's guard."

03:04:03.770 --> 03:04:09.230
Two. "My hands grow
differently used.

03:04:09.230 --> 03:04:10.940
While one hand thumbs pages,

03:04:10.940 --> 03:04:13.980
the other hand steadies
open the book.

03:04:13.980 --> 03:04:18.050
It's the other hand that rests
on the desk, forearm paralleled

03:04:18.050 --> 03:04:20.350
to the table's edge,
all the fingers,

03:04:20.350 --> 03:04:23.540
except the thumb
holding the blank field.

03:04:23.540 --> 03:04:28.430
One hand's mole a gnat flattened
between pinky and ring finger.

03:04:28.430 --> 03:04:30.640
The other hand's palm-side,

03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:33.390
below the skin enough it's
likely a splinter left

03:04:33.390 --> 03:04:35.320
for years.

03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:37.200
Just one hand fits my Discman,

03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:39.290
plugged in while
watching those around,

03:04:39.290 --> 03:04:42.880
no news-as-white-noise
here to occupy my sight.

03:04:42.880 --> 03:04:46.340
Kids who bus to school hours
away tooth picking slivers

03:04:46.340 --> 03:04:49.060
of chili-dappled
mango slices in.

03:04:49.060 --> 03:04:52.050
A triple-sweatered lady
palming back her hair

03:04:52.050 --> 03:04:57.270
in a thick Thai pre-dawn June;
the one foreigner other than us,

03:04:57.270 --> 03:05:01.280
earphone couched; and
her shape, dozed slack,

03:05:01.280 --> 03:05:05.440
coat-blanketed, neck
against my side.

03:05:05.440 --> 03:05:08.070
One hand rests.

03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:10.730
Half a day ago, under
a mosquito net,

03:05:10.730 --> 03:05:14.020
flushed with the desk fan
sitting on the rattan floor,

03:05:14.020 --> 03:05:16.070
one hand kept on the steady act

03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:19.410
of beckoning behind the
tongue-swelled clit,

03:05:19.410 --> 03:05:23.420
uncreasing the ridged roof,
almost like the mouth's roof

03:05:23.420 --> 03:05:25.630
as it slopes down toward teeth,

03:05:25.630 --> 03:05:29.220
like rubbing the dampened
cave wall, finger-darkened,

03:05:29.220 --> 03:05:32.580
as the guide turns
his back to us.

03:05:32.580 --> 03:05:34.780
The other hand traced
its crook?--

03:05:34.780 --> 03:05:38.370
that delta-creased pad set
between thumb and fingers,

03:05:38.370 --> 03:05:40.190
hand's most fleshy zone?

03:05:40.190 --> 03:05:41.940
-- ?on the torso.

03:05:41.940 --> 03:05:45.880
The other hand then stilled her
hip, mosquito net, weighted,

03:05:45.880 --> 03:05:49.600
walling out stitches of ants,
from its hook, a viscous drape

03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:52.530
like that through one
hand's two fingers.

03:05:52.530 --> 03:05:58.350
Oddly, only one hand drums along
the CD, Converge, Jane Doe,

03:05:58.350 --> 03:06:01.640
as the crowd would rupture
outward into a circle pit?--

03:06:01.640 --> 03:06:05.700
?a vortex in reverse --
if this were a concert.

03:06:05.700 --> 03:06:08.660
The other hand just
bides its time.

03:06:08.660 --> 03:06:12.100
Milton's clumsy other
hand, God's other hand

03:06:12.100 --> 03:06:15.880
that lessing chose, and that
Spaniard's other hand riddled

03:06:15.880 --> 03:06:19.180
useless at Lepanto,
a bullet lodged

03:06:19.180 --> 03:06:21.870
into that scurvied poet's chest,

03:06:21.870 --> 03:06:24.690
the other hand remembers
and betrays.

03:06:24.690 --> 03:06:29.220
The other hand cries out,
which was Keats's living one?

03:06:29.220 --> 03:06:30.870
Neither hand scarred yet,

03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:34.710
even after thumb-knuckle
tempted a sander in shop class,

03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:38.180
impulse from imagining too much.

03:06:38.180 --> 03:06:40.840
One hand's cushion
bears the pencil,

03:06:40.840 --> 03:06:43.920
my friend whose tasks are
split between his hands,

03:06:43.920 --> 03:06:48.430
"I eat with my left hand,
punch with the other"?--

03:06:48.430 --> 03:06:51.950
says we whack off with
the hand we write.

03:06:51.950 --> 03:06:54.690
Each hand on different
shaded denim thighs,

03:06:54.690 --> 03:06:59.130
The unclipped nails crude
halos of sun-blocking hills.

03:06:59.130 --> 03:07:04.050
One hand lets forth words;
the other hand holds it back."

03:07:04.050 --> 03:07:10.550
Three. Chased by a three-legged
dog to the temple stairs,

03:07:10.550 --> 03:07:13.940
past all the fallen star
fruit, the veined tips the last

03:07:13.940 --> 03:07:18.210
to wither, the through-light
flesh sun- and bug-eaten.

03:07:18.210 --> 03:07:21.410
We crossed paths with
a one-legged man?--

03:07:21.410 --> 03:07:24.820
?wordless sounds, in
that permanent wild gaze,

03:07:24.820 --> 03:07:28.030
crutching down the stairs, 400!

03:07:28.030 --> 03:07:31.450
As we stopped to catch
a break mid-flight.

03:07:31.450 --> 03:07:35.040
Our breath would last us a
run-through of the temple, and,

03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:39.540
in the first hallway?--
him?!, his phatic calls,

03:07:39.540 --> 03:07:43.520
tics and unwilled smile facing
the morning that just passed,

03:07:43.520 --> 03:07:47.150
the sun no longer in front of
his propped body, but above it,

03:07:47.150 --> 03:07:51.490
the valley overabundant with the
real light that stole our day.

03:07:51.490 --> 03:07:53.920
The fog too lifted
against my sight.

03:07:53.920 --> 03:07:55.220
We paused.

03:07:55.220 --> 03:07:57.910
Having just climbed the hill,
we agreed to leave our shoes

03:07:57.910 --> 03:08:00.120
on despite sandals
stationed on the stoop,

03:08:00.120 --> 03:08:03.080
and then we turned
towards that hall.

03:08:03.080 --> 03:08:06.460
-- Let's go -- he
ends, befriended,

03:08:06.460 --> 03:08:09.350
prayer Phaedrus-empty.

03:08:09.350 --> 03:08:13.320
?The driver gases the bus off
the parking brakes to idle back

03:08:13.320 --> 03:08:16.680
out the station; the attendants
scoop up the wood wedges

03:08:16.680 --> 03:08:18.620
and clatter the door shut.

03:08:18.620 --> 03:08:20.920
The passengers all shift.

03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:23.820
In the chapter among the
deformed and footless,

03:08:23.820 --> 03:08:26.860
Zhuangzi [phonetic] ends,
arguing for the greatest of men,

03:08:26.860 --> 03:08:30.980
a man void of feelings:
'The Way gave him a face,

03:08:30.980 --> 03:08:35.160
Heaven gave him a form,
can't you call him a man?'

03:08:35.160 --> 03:08:39.570
Yet there are things I
love: The sun, you, travel.

03:08:39.570 --> 03:08:42.750
And back again, the
thick fog parts us

03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:46.130
from the obliterating
Turner sun.

03:08:46.130 --> 03:08:48.610
Pretty soon, come
day, the motorbikes,

03:08:48.610 --> 03:08:51.340
The Rough Guide says, 'all
tourists should try will buzz

03:08:51.340 --> 03:08:54.150
by those three dogs',
all lethargic,

03:08:54.150 --> 03:08:56.860
the largest too tired
to dry-hump.

03:08:56.860 --> 03:09:00.310
His red tip unsheathing,
there's no neutering here.

03:09:00.310 --> 03:09:07.020
The black one, bald in spots,
wouldn't even fight it off.

03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:09.740
The mottled one coiled
back like the dog

03:09:09.740 --> 03:09:13.960
that badgers Bosch's wayfarer,
andaged, poor bastard,

03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:16.770
with his gnarled stick,
not looking at us,

03:09:16.770 --> 03:09:20.780
but rather caught looking back,
And above his head a doorway --

03:09:20.780 --> 03:09:24.550
?no, the gallows??-- The same
one Brueghel's final peasants

03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:26.560
romped beneath?

03:09:26.560 --> 03:09:28.650
My turn now to sleep.

03:09:28.650 --> 03:09:30.520
I can dab off from my jeans,

03:09:30.520 --> 03:09:33.680
your drool just reaching my
thigh as you do, with care,

03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:37.160
from our sheets when?-- yet
that stuff, all that stuff

03:09:37.160 --> 03:09:40.130
of ours still spots
our many beds

03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:44.180
with different aged salt-rings,
each gasp less a sound

03:09:44.180 --> 03:09:46.810
than a failure at silence.

03:09:46.810 --> 03:09:52.220
Before us another strange town,
while for others school, home,

03:09:52.220 --> 03:09:56.890
maybe work, a field,
someplace normal, there,

03:09:56.890 --> 03:10:00.940
someplace beyond sight
from its roadside stop.

03:10:00.940 --> 03:10:05.730
Abroad a month, toward a year
in another country, Anne?-- ?

03:10:05.730 --> 03:10:11.800
Anacrusis: these days I'm lost
in, reminded of my presence

03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:13.930
as if catching a stranger's wave

03:10:13.930 --> 03:10:18.510
to the yet-to-be-seen
man behind you as yours."

03:10:18.510 --> 03:10:23.390
