00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.540
Sarah has just shown you how to implement some methods of the person class. And

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.950
here were are back with the car, and ready to implement the remaining methods.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.400
Just to remind you, so far, we've implemented two methods. Add gas and drive.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.910
And when we drive the car, we can see that it has driven. But we have no way of

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.960
finding out exactly how much. So let's fix that. We need to add a method that

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.580
one can call to find out how many miles the car has driven. Here is the method

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.030
header. And here is the implementation. Note this return statement. That

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.240
indicates that this method returns a value, namely, the miles driven. Over

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.020
here, you didn't have a return statement because the method had return type

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.900
void. It didn't return an answer. The method over here has return type double,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.770
and it does return an answer. Any time you implement an accessor, you need to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.370
provide a return statement. Alright, now it's you're turn again. Go ahead and

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.300
implement this method. Just put your code in the box.
