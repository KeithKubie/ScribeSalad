you know that's how long we have to
 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.500
you know that's how long we have to
think about it and so we're able to take

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510
think about it and so we're able to take
 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.810

twists and turns you know we we go into

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820
twists and turns you know we we go into
 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.920
twists and turns you know we we go into
it thinking this is going to be our

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930
it thinking this is going to be our
 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.960
it thinking this is going to be our
angle and then we're diving into the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970
angle and then we're diving into the
 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.010
angle and then we're diving into the
research we have a wonderful research

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020
research we have a wonderful research
 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.910
research we have a wonderful research
staff and they say actually

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920
staff and they say actually
 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.930
staff and they say actually
is the more interesting part of the

is the more interesting part of the
story and then we are have the time to

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820
story and then we are have the time to
 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.670
story and then we are have the time to
go chase it that way instead right

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680
go chase it that way instead right
 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.990
go chase it that way instead right
