someone's talking all like that what I'm

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030
someone's talking all like that what I'm
 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.910
someone's talking all like that what I'm
going to listen for is the time that

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920
going to listen for is the time that
 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.830
going to listen for is the time that
they don't do that and that's what I

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840
they don't do that and that's what I
 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.630
they don't do that and that's what I
would start to study as a way of

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640
would start to study as a way of
 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.790
would start to study as a way of
characterizing them whereas I think a

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800
characterizing them whereas I think a
 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.430
characterizing them whereas I think a
professional mimic or an impressionist

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440
professional mimic or an impressionist
 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.469
professional mimic or an impressionist
would pick the thing they do the most

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479
would pick the thing they do the most
 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.719
would pick the thing they do the most
because that's what you and audience

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729
because that's what you and audience
 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.620
because that's what you and audience
could then identify as that person so an

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630
could then identify as that person so an
 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.139
could then identify as that person so an
impressionist doing George Bush is going

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660
you know the intonations that he keeps
 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.289
you know the intonations that he keeps
using over and over again but if I were

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299
using over and over again but if I were
 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.490
using over and over again but if I were
to study him

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500
to study him
 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.250
to study him
I haven't really I'd look for when he

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260
I haven't really I'd look for when he
 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.050
I haven't really I'd look for when he
did something that wasn't what we've

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060
did something that wasn't what we've
 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.230
did something that wasn't what we've
seen

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240
 
 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.010
 
I went to Washington and I interviewed

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020
I went to Washington and I interviewed
 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.490
I went to Washington and I interviewed
520 people or more and I was surprised

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500
520 people or more and I was surprised
 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.840
520 people or more and I was surprised
that I would say of those people the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850
that I would say of those people the
 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.420
that I would say of those people the
person Clinton was probably among the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430
person Clinton was probably among the
 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.720
person Clinton was probably among the
five who had the most musicality in

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730
five who had the most musicality in
 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.170
five who had the most musicality in
their language in other words in

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180
their language in other words in
 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.240
their language in other words in
Washington I would say you begin to find

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
Washington I would say you begin to find
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.580
Washington I would say you begin to find
less and less expression than you find

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590
less and less expression than you find
 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.220
less and less expression than you find
in other places because people are very

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230
in other places because people are very
 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.930
in other places because people are very
careful about what they say they're

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940
careful about what they say they're
 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.340
careful about what they say they're
going to be judged for what they say

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350
going to be judged for what they say
 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.430
going to be judged for what they say
they could say the wrong thing to say it

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440
they could say the wrong thing to say it
 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.700
they could say the wrong thing to say it
the wrong way and never live it down

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710
the wrong way and never live it down
 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.610
the wrong way and never live it down
so they have as someone said very

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620
so they have as someone said very
 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.620
so they have as someone said very
eloquently what Thomas Jefferson had

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630
eloquently what Thomas Jefferson had
 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.450
eloquently what Thomas Jefferson had
which is that Thomas Jefferson could

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460
which is that Thomas Jefferson could
 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.230
which is that Thomas Jefferson could
never be found in verbal undress and so

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240
never be found in verbal undress and so
 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.680
never be found in verbal undress and so
I was and so that kind of verbal

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690
I was and so that kind of verbal
 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.820
I was and so that kind of verbal
dressing makes it harder to find music

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830
dressing makes it harder to find music
 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.440
dressing makes it harder to find music
in the language I'm trying to find the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450
in the language I'm trying to find the
 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.390
in the language I'm trying to find the
time that people start to sing I called

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400
time that people start to sing I called
 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.980
time that people start to sing I called
it singing not actually you know

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990
it singing not actually you know
 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.120
it singing not actually you know

lalalalala but they really start to open
 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.930
lalalalala but they really start to open
up

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940
up
 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.370
up
rhythmically more than again what's the

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380
rhythmically more than again what's the
 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.550
rhythmically more than again what's the
text it's more about this singing as I

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560
text it's more about this singing as I
 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.890
text it's more about this singing as I
call it and I was surprised the extent

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900
call it and I was surprised the extent
 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.990
call it and I was surprised the extent
to which Clinton sang and the other

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000
to which Clinton sang and the other
 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.790
to which Clinton sang and the other
thing about Clinton that I enjoyed was

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800
thing about Clinton that I enjoyed was
 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.500
thing about Clinton that I enjoyed was
that he brought truth to something that

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510
that he brought truth to something that
 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.560
that he brought truth to something that
a linguist had actually told me many

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570
a linguist had actually told me many
 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.720
a linguist had actually told me many
years ago when I told her what I was

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730
years ago when I told her what I was
 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.360
years ago when I told her what I was
trying to do that is to say a form of

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370
trying to do that is to say a form of
 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.580
trying to do that is to say a form of
getting people to sing she had said to

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590
getting people to sing she had said to
 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.230
getting people to sing she had said to
me well I'm going to give you three

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240
me well I'm going to give you three
 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.930
me well I'm going to give you three
questions that can ensure that that that

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940
questions that can ensure that that that
 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.120
questions that can ensure that that that
will happen in the course of an hour if

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130
will happen in the course of an hour if
 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.160
will happen in the course of an hour if
you only have an hour to talk to people

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170
you only have an hour to talk to people
 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.289
you only have an hour to talk to people
and the three questions were have you

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299
and the three questions were have you
 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.330
and the three questions were have you
ever come close to death do you know the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340
ever come close to death do you know the
 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.540
ever come close to death do you know the
circumstances of your birth and have you

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550
circumstances of your birth and have you
 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.040
circumstances of your birth and have you
ever been accused of something that you

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050
ever been accused of something that you
 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.260
ever been accused of something that you
didn't do now when I first started my
