00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.590
Let's talk a little bit
about the US customary units

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.220
for distance.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.540
If we go to a human scale,
the most typical used unit

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
in the US customary
system would be the foot.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.930
And as you could
imagine, the term foot,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.710
and if you have many of them,
you are now talking about feet,

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.390
comes from the same
word on the human body.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.580
We have a foot or
we have two feet.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.560
Now, not everyone's feet
are the same length.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.230
But the length of a foot is
roughly a little bit larger

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.620
than most people's feet.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.630
And there are definitely
people whose feet

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.720
are the size of a foot.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.350
And if you're in the
US, you've probably

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.420
heard of people measuring
their height in terms of feet.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.120
So for example, a
slightly above average man

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.760
of slightly above average height
would have a height of 6 feet.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.700
So for example, right over here,
this gentleman right over here

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.470
was slightly above
average height.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.770
His height might be 6 feet.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.680
And that might also
be his wing-span.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.720
So it would be a distance
something like that.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.856
If you wanted to measure things
that are a little bit smaller,

00:01:11.856 --> 00:01:14.230
say smaller than a foot, or
if we wanted to measure parts

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.720
of a foot, then you
would go to the inch.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.190
And the relationship between
the foot and the inch

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:31.940
is that 12 inches are
equal to one foot.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.180
So for example, this little
mouse right over here,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.760
it might be reasonable
to measure it in inches.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.016
On this scale, an inch
might be, depending

00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:44.390
on the size of
the mouse, an inch

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.820
might be something like that.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.590
And it's also useful
for measuring things

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.690
like human height,
because very few people

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.510
are a whole number of feet.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.360
They're usually some
fraction of feet.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.070
So for example, I am
5 feet and 9 inches.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.500
And sometimes this
is denoted as 5,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.360
and you have this apostrophe
here, one apostrophe, and then

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.440
5 foot 9 inches, and this
is two apostrophes, kind

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.922
of saying hey, you're going
to the next unit down.

00:02:16.922 --> 00:02:19.810
These are the inches
right over here.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.310
Now if you want to
go to things that

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.610
are larger than maybe human
scale, we have units for that

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.590
as well, including the yard.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.150
The yard is equal to 3 feet.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.860
And 3 feet, well, each
foot is 12 inches,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.580
so this is the same
thing as 36 inches.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.630
And this is most typically
used for measuring

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.380
distances of a lot of some kind.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.870
And in the United States,
most famously for in football.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.320
So your regulation-size football
field, the playing field,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.460
the distance between
the end zones,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.740
is exactly 100--
I know you can't

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.850
see my writing there--
is exactly 100 yards.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.200
This distance right over here.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.340
Right between the end zone.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.980
Now, if you want to measure
even longer distances,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.885
that's where we go to the mile.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.360
And all of these units
are ancient units,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.750
going back, actually,
thousands of years.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.620
And the mile, based on
the reading I've found,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.260
was even used in Roman times.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.380
And actually, that's some
of the first examples

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.860
of this term being used.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.480
And it really comes from
the same root word as 1,000,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.240
of mil, of 1,000 footsteps
of a Roman soldier.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:04:00.080
And now, a standard mile
is exactly 5,280 feet.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.030
And if you wanted to
figure out this in inches,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.434
you could just multiply by 12.

00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:06.850
But just to get a
sense of a mile,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.384
here is a mile on
this map of New York.

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:14.300
So if you wanted to put
it right on Manhattan,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.620
this distance right over
here is about a mile.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.370
So you want to measure really
far distances, either from one

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.490
point in a city to
another, or maybe

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.350
even the distance
between cities,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.400
or maybe even the
size of the planet,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.500
or even the distance from
the Earth to the moon,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.510
or something like that, you
will hear that referenced

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.390
in miles, even the distance
between the Earth and the sun.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.680
People say it's
93 million miles.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.017
If you're talking about
maybe, a plot of land,

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.475
you want to measure
its dimensions,

00:04:45.475 --> 00:04:47.183
or you're talking
about a football field,

00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:48.900
then yards feel appropriate.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.620
If you're kind of
getting to human scale,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.210
well, human scale on
one level, but you

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.570
could get a little bit
larger if you're maybe

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.170
talking about the
height of a building

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.890
or something like
that, or you're still

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.820
talking about measurement
of say, a plot of land,

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.120
you will still hear people
talk in terms of feet.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.170
And if you're measuring
either parts of a foot,

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.050
or things that are
smaller than a foot,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.440
that's when inches
come into play.
