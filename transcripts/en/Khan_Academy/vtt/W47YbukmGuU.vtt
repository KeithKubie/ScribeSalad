00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:03.022
- [Voiceover] All right, in
this video we're talking about

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:07.683
the short answer section of
the AP U.S. history exam.

00:00:07.683 --> 00:00:10.771
In the first part of this
video we talked about

00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:14.277
the first two sections of this question

00:00:14.277 --> 00:00:17.481
which asked for examples of how contact

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.080
with Europeans changed
Native American society.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.821
And the three most important
things we talked about

00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.909
were first that you really
have to pay attention

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.461
to the timeline given
to you in the question

00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:32.064
because you don't want to give an answer

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:34.827
that's outside of that time frame,

00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:39.094
so only talk about the
period from 1492 to 1700.

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:40.859
Nothing after that.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.322
The second thing we
mentioned is that there

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:45.712
could be all sorts of right
answers to this question.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.428
So choose the things that you know best

00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:50.541
and feel most qualified to talk about.

00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:52.584
And third, if you're stuck,

00:00:52.584 --> 00:00:55.209
consider how a certain issue might affect

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:57.833
people differently of different races,

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.317
different classes, and different genders.

00:01:00.317 --> 00:01:02.709
You might find a new example
when considering those

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:05.843
that will help you answer
a more difficult question.

00:01:05.843 --> 00:01:09.141
All right, let's move on to
the last part of this question.

00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:12.670
For part C, we're now looking for kind of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.203
a counter example,

00:01:14.203 --> 00:01:16.965
a way that Native
Americans resisted changes

00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:20.216
brought on by Europeans
in this time period.

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:22.120
Now you might be tempted to talk about

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.932
the Ghost Dance,

00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:26.300
but remember that the
Ghost Dance wasn't until

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.344
the end of the 19th century.

00:01:28.344 --> 00:01:30.712
That's the 1880s, 1890s,

00:01:30.712 --> 00:01:33.638
so it's way outside the
scope of our time period

00:01:33.638 --> 00:01:36.028
here ending at 1700.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.746
So we're thinking back to the early period

00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:41.974
of contact, the early colonial period.

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:45.433
So what are some examples of resistance

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:47.361
to change in this time period?

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:50.704
Well, I think an obvious
example would be war.

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:53.815
Many Native Americans went to war against

00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:55.743
European invaders.

00:01:55.743 --> 00:02:00.272
Some good examples of this
might be King Philip's War

00:02:00.272 --> 00:02:03.430
in New England,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.917
or maybe PopÃ©'s Rebellion in the West.

00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:15.220
Let me give us a little bit
more space to write here.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.659
These are two really specific examples,

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.214
and I would recommend that you give

00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:21.768
specific examples whenever possible,

00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:23.835
even though it's not necessary at times,

00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:25.136
but it will show that you really know

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.411
what you're talking about.

00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:30.174
Another example of resistance might be

00:02:30.174 --> 00:02:31.790
going against some of the things we've

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.206
talked about earlier.

00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:34.647
So labor, for example.

00:02:34.647 --> 00:02:36.666
Well, not all Native
Americans were part of

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:38.501
an encomienda system.

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:41.540
Some of them chose to flee.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.025
It's one of the reasons why Europeans

00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:47.461
resorted to African
slavery in this time period

00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:49.528
because Native Americans
knew the landscape

00:02:49.528 --> 00:02:51.711
very well and could get away when someone

00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:53.405
tried to enslave them.

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.866
You could also talk about
some cultural resistance

00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:57.445
to European ways.

00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:01.829
For example, refusal to
convert to Christianity.

00:03:03.158 --> 00:03:07.779
Many Native Americans were targeted

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:11.493
by missionaries who were
coming to the New World

00:03:11.493 --> 00:03:14.884
specifically to convert Native Americans

00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:18.924
to Christianity along with
getting very wealthy, of course.

00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:21.222
But in many cases Native Americans

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:24.079
outright refused to
convert to Christianity

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.889
or they may have incorporated Christianity

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.629
into their own previous beliefs.

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.461
So any of these are good options.

00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:34.667
And I should think two
out of the three of these

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:36.316
are fairly simple.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:40.472
I think disease and also warfare

00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:43.479
are things that are going to come to mind

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.476
right away when we think about this early

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:47.403
period of contact.

00:03:47.403 --> 00:03:50.538
It's the second example that's
really gonna make you reach,

00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:53.834
and for that I recommend this strategy

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.506
of considering race, class and gender,

00:03:56.506 --> 00:03:58.619
because among one of
them there's definitely

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.080
going to be something that is relevant.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.585
So remember, any of
these answers is correct.

00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:09.058
You only need to choose
the ones that you know,

00:04:09.058 --> 00:04:11.961
and all you need to do
is write one sentence

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:14.817
about each of these options.

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:17.882
Keep yourself short,
simple and to the point.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.598
Answer the question and move on.
