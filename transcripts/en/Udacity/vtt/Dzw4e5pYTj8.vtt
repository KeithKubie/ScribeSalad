00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.930
Let's think about some of the first
things we would need to build

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.710
an application.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.990
Like a real estate listing site.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.100
First, we need to point
out locations on the map.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.160
We're going to start off by mapping our
listings using lat-long coordinates.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.950
We'll learn how to get coordinates
from addresses later in the course.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.050
In order to keep this simple, we'll
just make one point on our map at first.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.870
Within our initialized function,
we're going to create one lat-long.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.310
We'll use the syntax seen here, which
is creating a lat-long literal object.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.510
This point is in Tribeca.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.340
Next, how do we make
it appear on the map?

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.930
We can use the little universally
recognized icon called a marker.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.480
Markers are objects which can be
constructed either in the initialized

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.450
function or upon an action,
like clicking a button.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.770
Let's create a super simple marker,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.280
showing our first listing
at this point in Tribeca.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.120
We're creating a new marker instance
using the google.maps.Marker object.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.850
All the marker needs to know,
is the map that it should appear on and

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.519
where it should appear,
which is our point that we just created.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.095
We'll also give the maker a title, which
will appear if we hover over the marker.

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:12.545
There are a bunch more things
that we could specify.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:16.505
We can make it draggable, so that when
it appears, the user can move around.

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:19.765
We could specify an animations so
that it doesn't just appear on the map,

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:23.507
it drops, for example,
let's test this out.

00:01:23.507 --> 00:01:27.247
There's our marker, but a point
on a map doesn't do us much good.

00:01:27.247 --> 00:01:29.617
We have to tell the users
what they're looking at.

00:01:29.617 --> 00:01:32.347
Let's check out how to display some
information about the marker, next.
