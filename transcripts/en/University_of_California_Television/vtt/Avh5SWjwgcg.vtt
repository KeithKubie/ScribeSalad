00:00:01.927 --> 00:00:05.677
(fast classical organ music)

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.640
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.750
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.010
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.620
Our guest today is
Professor Harold Hongju Koh,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.480
who is the Gerard C. and
Bernice Latrobe Smith

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.870
Professor of International Law at Yale.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.260
He has served as assistant secretary

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.850
for Democracy Human Rights and Labor

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.910
in the United States Department of State

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.520
from 1998 to 2001.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.940
His publications include
Deliberative Democracy

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.940
with Robert C. Sly and the
National Security Constitution.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.140
Professor Koh, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.240
- Thank you for having me.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.900
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.010
- I was born in Boston.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.040
My parents both came as
students from South Korea.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.890
My father was the first Korean, I think,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.360
to study law in America.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.250
And my mother is a sociologist.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.720
- Uh-huh, and looking back,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.173
how did your parents shape
your thinking about the world?

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.810
- Totally, my father came at the time

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.890
when Korea was controlled by

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.210
the Syngman Rhee democracy, dictatorship

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.820
and when it was overthrown,
he went back to campaign

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.150
for the first democratic
government of Korea.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.710
And when that government was elected,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.480
he was appointed ambassador
to the United Nations

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.753
and then minister to the United States.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.650
And then his government, the
new democratic government,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.940
was overthrown by military coup

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.600
and my father refused to
serve the dictatorship

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.630
and spent the rest of his life in America.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.970
And that's how I grew up here.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.130
So, when I became an
Assistant Secretary of State

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.650
for a democracy for the United States,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.270
I went back to Korea,
it was an important way

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.970
of bringing my whole
family's life full circle.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.790
- And what about the
influence of your mother?

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.410
- Well, my mother's a sociologist

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.440
and she's an expert on
comparative cultures.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.810
She's one of the leaders

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.570
of the women's rights movement in Korea.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.360
And I think she is the
person who most influenced me

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.010
on how to understand human relations

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.080
and you know, that's become
a critical part of what I do,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.020
both as a lawyer and as a diplomat.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.880
- So, was there a lot
of talk about politics

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.760
around the dinner table
as you were growing up?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.910
- Yeah, I have five
siblings, my older brother

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.710
was a Commissioner of Public
Health of Massachusetts.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.310
- Oh, I see!

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.780
- He just recently became a professor

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.863
at Harvard Public Health School.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.060
I have a number of siblings for academics.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.830
One of my sisters, Jean Koh Peters,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.683
is my colleague at Yale Law School.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.100
- So, it's fair to say
that your whole upbringing

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.730
was a transnational process
in itself, actually.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.430
- Well, I think what I
was told quite early was,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.830
if you're going to be
between two cultures,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.150
why don't you use your bi-cultural
background as an asset?

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.140
And that then immediately
meant I should be

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.003
a diplomat or a lawyer or an academic.

00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:35.880
- And so, but the final
choice was law, why is that?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.930
Just because of the the
influence of your father,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.270
or the example he set?

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.470
- Well, I started out as a physics major

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.210
and my disadvantage was that

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.182
I wasn't that good in physics.

00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:47.240
(laughing)

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.340
I quite literally one day
was going to a physics lab

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.720
and somebody else was going to

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.850
a US and East Asia course

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.470
and I turned around
and went to that course

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.470
and I haven't looked back.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.760
- And did you have any mentors

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.360
in law school or even as an undergraduate?

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.380
You went to Harvard, I
think, in both cases,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.050
who really made an impression on you

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.400
and further defined the direction

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.240
that your life was gonna take.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.890
- Yeah, in college, two
mentors, I had Paul Freund

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.090
who was a professor Harvard Law School

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.910
and Edwin Reischauer who is
a US Ambassador to Japan.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.113
In law school,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.290
Arthur Miller, who was a
professor of Civil Procedure

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.680
and Abram Chayes,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.710
who wrote about
international legal process

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.650
and it's really his ideas of
international legal process

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.820
that I've tried to develop in
transnational legal process.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.870
Interestingly, two people

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.930
who I didn't study
with, Steiner and Vagts,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.820
are now people with whom
I co-authored a book

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.100
on transnational legal problems

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.860
and transnational business problems,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.173
which are also part of
my whole approach now.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.403
- Let's start talking about
your service in the government,

00:04:58.403 --> 00:05:01.870
because you actually started early

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.580
as a law clerk to a Supreme
Court Justice, right?

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.220
And that is this junket from the campus

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:14.420
to the halls of power,
I shouldn't say junket,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.173
I mean journey, let's say journey.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.120
- My first year I clerked
for Malcolm Wilkie

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.370
who is a Judge of the US Court of Appeals.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.710
So, the DC Circuit.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.860
He went on to be ambassador to Uruguay

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.730
and very internationalist,
he was one of the advisors

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.260
of the Restatement of
Foreign Relations Law.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.480
I then clerked for Harry
Blackmun, who among other things

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.110
I think was the most internationalist
Supreme Court Justice

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.040
we've had in some time.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.330
Then I worked for a big law
firm Covington &amp; Burling,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.040
which was Dean Acheson's firm,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.750
and then for the Justice Department

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.310
in the Reagan administration,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.150
and there I worked on
the suit by Nicaragua

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.080
against the United
States at the World Court

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.530
and the ratification of
the Genocide Convention.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.940
And then I came to Yale and
I taught international trade

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.840
and international business transactions.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.810
Then after 1990,

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.180
I decided to do more in
the human rights area

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.180
and I started with
another colleague a clinic

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.460
that would litigate Human Rights cases

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.800
and that clinic started
out doing alien tort cases

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.950
and then we ended up
representing Haitian refugees

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.230
and soon I was representing

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.930
Haitian refugees on Guantanamo and

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.513
argue that case at the Supreme Court,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.910
and then we ended up litigating

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.760
against the Clinton administration.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.293
And so, it was with a big
surprise that in 1998,

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.640
I get a call from my former student

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.210
who is Madeleine Albright's
advisor and he said,

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.690
how would you like to be

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.640
Madeleine Albright's Human Rights adviser?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.390
And I said, you know,
I spent most of my time

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.126
suing the Clinton administration.

00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:54.959
- I see.

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.387
- And he said, that's why we want you.

00:06:56.387 --> 00:06:58.210
You know, you're nobody's yes-man

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.640
and everybody knows where you stand

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.913
and it will give us
credibility to have you.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.740
So, I went in

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.990
and that was during the period of Kosovo,

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.113
East Timor, Sierra Leone.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.990
It was the last years of
the Clinton administration.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.720
And I actually think
that was a very good time

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.210
for Human Rights, particularly
looking back on it

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.060
from a post-9/11 perspective.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.360
- We'll talk about that in a minute,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.430
but let me go back a minute, so, what is,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.540
what you've just described
is, it must have given you

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.680
amazing insight into the differences

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.720
being in the ivory tower

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.470
and then being in the halls
of power and seeing this

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.510
very important distinction
between theory and practice.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.810
Looking back, what are your observations

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.720
that you want to share with us about

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.770
the differences between these two worlds?

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.570
- Well, my father I said
was my greatest teacher.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.390
In 1974, I was in Korea

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.210
doing some research for
my undergraduate thesis

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.880
and there's an attempt on
the life of the President,

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.660
and that was the same, and
they imposed martial law.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.530
And that same summer, Nixon resigned.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.647
Gerald Ford became president.

00:08:16.647 --> 00:08:19.450
And I called my father and
I said, isn't it amazing

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.110
that the largest country in the world

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.910
is changing power without
any guns or anything,

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.370
guns in the street or
any shots being fired

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.640
and Korea has never had

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.490
a peaceful transition of government?

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.505
And he said, that's the difference

00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:38.550
between dictatorship and democracy.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.640
He said, in a democracy,
when you're president,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.240
the troops obey you.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.790
He said, in a dictatorship,
when the troops obey you,

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.710
then you're president.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.730
And that to me was the first
time I really had a sense

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.110
of the importance of
understanding of the world,

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.720
how the world worked,
another thing he said was,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.970
theory without practice is as

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.513
lifeless as practice without
theory is thoughtless.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.660
And so, I think partly because of that

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.730
I became convinced that I had to somehow

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.610
make my academic work relevant

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.180
to what was happening in the real world.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.300
And when I got to the State
Department, I was struck,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.770
I've said this in a number of saying,

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.800
that people with ideas have no influence

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.707
and people with influence have no ideas.

00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:25.310
The people are making decisions

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.110
often have no time to
consult anything academic,

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.003
but if they do,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.600
it's not written clearly enough

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.200
for them to be able to apply it.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.480
On the other hand, the people with ideas

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.220
who do have time to
think about these things

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.940
often don't present their ideas

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.310
in a way that they can be used

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.850
by those who are trying to make decisions.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.990
So, I've tried to try to breach
that gap as much as I can.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.440
- And you're suggesting that

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.450
the potential for synergy is very great,

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.880
but that mediation is required

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.140
between these two worlds,
is that a fair assessment

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.150
Of what you see?
- Oh, very much so.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.703
When I was in the government,

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.820
every day matters would
arise on which I'd think,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.810
how can I be making this decision

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.410
in such a short term focus?

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.350
Somebody must have written about this,

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.000
somebody must have put this into a pattern

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.100
and I'd like to know what that pattern is.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.610
And I would send my staff out

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.300
to look for these articles and books,

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.770
but very often what they
came with, back with,

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.080
was so tangential

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.113
and so abstract that I couldn't
use it, it didn't help me.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.850
And I think when I went
back into academia in 2001,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.770
part of my thought was,

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.770
I need to figure out a
way to bridge this divide.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.460
- And what is the key to doing that?

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.480
I mean, having been in both places

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.960
and know what the,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.253
the common link might be?

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.770
- Yeah well, for me as a lawyer,

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.090
one of my particular focal points is on

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.630
how law influences
political decision-making

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.830
and I think many political
scientists assume

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.623
that law is somehow there,
but it's not really a factor.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.000
I think, particularly
after September 11th,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.561
people said, you know,
what's law got to do with it?

00:11:21.561 --> 00:11:23.280
You know, this is just about power.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.380
Everything that we did for 50 years

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.150
creating this legal structure

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.073
is somehow thrown out the window.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.510
I think what I've tried to
do and my work is to argue,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.860
here's how law affects political choices.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.760
If you do things with law
behind you, you're stronger.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.490
If you do things in the face of law,

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.390
or in violation of law, you're weaker.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.870
- Now, my training is in political science

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.920
and you know the old saying
in political science is,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.450
well, can you really have a system of law?

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.360
I'm simplifying here.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.370
If you don't have a cop on the beat

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.260
and of course in international relations,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.550
there's no cop on the beat

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.840
except somebody with enough
power to take an action.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.300
How do you respond to that?

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.210
Because clearly, law is more important,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.920
international law more
important than it ever was,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.320
but as you just suggested,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.023
it's harder to make people see
that in the first instance.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.130
- I guess I'd ask you this.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.883
Do we have burglaries in Berkeley?

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.793
- Yes.

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:30.010
- Well, you know, the fact that the law,

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.060
domestic law is under enforced
or imperfectly enforced

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.430
doesn't mean it's not enforced.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.343
And the core way in which
you enforced law in Berkeley,

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.400
Berkeley law is not by coercion,

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.640
but by norm internalization.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.080
You know, people internalize
a norm against burglary.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.070
And I would argue in the
same way internationally.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.730
There is a system of international law.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.880
It's imperfectly enforced,
it's under enforced,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.223
but again, the same mechanism is at work,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.610
norm internalization.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.800
You know, why don't nations
attack each other all the time

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.823
and take them over?

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.130
You know, maybe it's because
they fear coercion or sanction,

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.220
but in fact, it's because of a sense

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.653
of internalized restraint.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.430
You know, why don't people

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.000
sitting next to each other
in a restaurant in Berkeley

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.420
get up and start punching each other?

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.610
Maybe if they did,

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.130
they might get arrested for
disorderly conduct, but in fact,

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.943
it's because of a sense
of internalized restraint.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.183
So, the element I'm trying to find is,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.600
what is it that
internalizes this restraint?

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.760
How do you bring international law home?

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.970
And that's been the focus of my research,

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.309
particularly since I came
back from the government.

00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:44.020
- And, and...

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.907
America before 9/11

00:13:45.907 --> 00:13:48.880
and the current administration really had

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.590
an important

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.490
voice in making that

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.630
internalization possible

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.730
for other countries.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.640
I mean, we had a lot of power.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.850
We could have pushed people around,

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.140
used force and coercion, but we actually

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.750
tried to influence other nations

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.680
by setting up this
process of internalization

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.550
that you've just described.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.577
- Well, when I came to the government,

00:14:19.577 --> 00:14:22.020
the first conclusion I reached was that

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.990
the rule of law should be on the US side.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.730
You know, there's a system of
law that we helped to create.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.510
We sought it in our self-interest

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.940
and we accepted certain constraints

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.330
because we thought that in the long run,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:38.920
the overall costs and benefits,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.203
the benefits far outweighed the costs.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.040
So, that's why we support

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.440
various systems of
international adjudication.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.200
That's why we support the UN system.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.770
We need these institutions,

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.983
even if they cut our own
sovereignty a little bit.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.630
And I think that in the
post-Berlin Wall period,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.170
there was a feeling that

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.140
this is a chance for the system
to really become effective.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:11.140
And I now view this period
from 1989 to September 2001

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.210
as a period of global
optimism where people thought,

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.400
we can really use global cooperation

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.450
to solve global problems.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.920
One of those problems is AIDS,

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.710
another is global warming,
another is international crimes,

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.370
another is terrorism.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.500
Then 9/11 came along
and there were suddenly

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.063
two radically different
views as to how to respond.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.850
One group said, just forget this,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.850
throw it all out the window.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.770
The other said, look the same
approach should still apply.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:43.220
Use global cooperation
to solve global problems.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.850
And I think the
administration that came in

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.890
took the first approach.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.123
Let's go it alone, let's
do it unilaterally.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.080
You know, they broke out
of the Kyoto Protocol.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.400
They turned away from the
ICC, they attacked Iraq

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.730
with a coalition of the willing

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.190
rather than with the UN support,

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.620
and now they're surprised
when they've alienated

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.130
the people who they need to rebuild Iraq.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.290
And I think that that's what
makes this point in time,

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.113
2003, an interesting watershed.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.950
The question is, will the
United States continue to be

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.950
the world's primary advocate
of norm-based internationalism,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.770
or are we gonna put forward

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.720
a sort of power-based
internationalism as our,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.670
our prime mode of doing business.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.830
- Before we talk about

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.760
the changes under the Bush administration,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.540
let's go back, because
you were in a pivotal role

00:16:45.554 --> 00:16:47.010
at a very creative time

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:52.010
for moving this
internationalization of norms,

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.030
that whole process further along.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.610
Let's talk a little about that because,

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:02.610
you know, it's not just the
American political tradition

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.990
of dealing with these
problems that was at work,

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.910
but also the particular
leaders, academic ideas,

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.880
but also really nongovernmental
organizations and activism.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.300
So, talk a little about that dynamic

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.940
in that very creative period

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.933
before everything hit the fan with 9/11.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.460
- The best image that someone gave me

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.050
about being an Assistant
Secretary of State

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.890
is that you walk on to a tennis court

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.860
and someone gives you a tennis racket

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.933
and they say, the balls are
gonna start coming over the net.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.250
And balls start coming over the net

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.450
almost faster than you can see them.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.450
And you start trying to return them.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.290
And then after a while,
you've returning most of them

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.530
and then they say, you say to yourself,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.280
why not it hit them to one
place, why not have a plan?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.840
You try to hit the ball to the left side.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.650
And then suddenly a moment
comes where you say,

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.263
why am I not throwing the balls?

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.330
You know, why is my only approach

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.750
reactive rather than proactive?

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.030
And then you have to ask yourself,

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.503
well, what do I think are
our proactive principles?

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.560
And what I tried to do

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.490
and I think I talked
about it with Albright,

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.800
with the president was to say, you know,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.370
there are basically four
principles we really care about.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.730
First is telling the
truth in human rights.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.000
Secondly, promoting
accountability for past violations

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.120
while promoting reconciliation.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.350
Third, with regard to ongoing
abuses, present violations,

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:40.350
engaging violating countries
to try to get them to stop.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:45.650
And with regard to the future,
preventing future abuses.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.220
And the long-term solution
is by promoting democracy.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.480
You know, in the end, torture, genocide.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.770
these are not diseases, they're symptoms,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.830
symptoms of bad government.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.040
And so, we tried to
promote healthy government.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.540
Now interestingly here my brother,

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.933
the Commissioner of
Public Health said to me,

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.610
I used to treat smoking patients

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.520
and then I decided if
I want to make people

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.540
not get cancer I would
encourage them not to smoke.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.810
He said, if you promote a healthy body,

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.220
you don't have to deal with
the symptoms of disease.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.900
And I realized in the same way,

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.960
if you promote democratic government,

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.440
you don't have to deal
with the symptoms of,

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.063
of unhealthy government.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.250
So, those were our focal points,

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.410
truth-telling, accountability, engagement,

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.570
democracy promotion.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.250
And you know, we had
a very exciting period

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.310
after the fall of the Berlin Wall

00:19:49.353 --> 00:19:53.000
that was the largest expansion of freedom

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.740
in the 20th century,
the second largest came

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.020
during the time when I was in government.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.700
Nigeria and Indonesia,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.620
various parts of the former Soviet Union,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.543
all switched to a democratic
form of government.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.010
There's amazing fact, which
we uncovered, which was

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:15.010
that in 1971, there are only
25 democracies in the world,

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.270
and in 2000,

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.633
there are more than 120.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.830
In fact, when Colin
Powell's people asked me

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.620
to brief him on what the challenges were

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.070
for the democracy and human rights policy.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.970
They said, we'd like you to start with

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.919
maybe a presentation of about 15 seconds.

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:37.700
(laughing)

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.710
I thought about it and I said to my staff,

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.670
get me two maps, one is a
map of the world in 1970

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.410
with all the democracies in blue

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.750
and all the nondemocracies in red.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.423
Then get me another one
for 2000, same thing.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.450
And then when he said, are
you ready for your briefing?

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.930
I said, you know Secretary
Powell, I want to,

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.330
I want you to look at these two
maps that what you notice is

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.840
there are a lot more democracies now

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.420
than there were 30 years ago,

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.290
but the countries that are in red,

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.410
the nondemocracies, are
the ones that are giving us

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.290
the most human rights problems.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:13.470
The countries that are in blue

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.500
are the ones we can
cooperate with the most

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.510
to try to address those problems.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.470
And the major difference
is that you now have

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.130
many, many more countries
with whom you can cooperate

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.260
to deal with a much smaller
number of countries.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.470
So, your success in achieving this policy

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.320
will be your capacity to
mobilize the blue countries

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.370
to address the red countries.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.600
Now, I still think that's right.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.780
I think that's what we should
have done with regard to 9/11.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.740
- It seems like they didn't listen.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.133
Or some parts of the government.

00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:41.841
- I think Secretary Powell listened.

00:21:41.841 --> 00:21:43.480
And I think he had that view anyway,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.120
I'm not sure that others in
the government listened to him,

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.400
- As an academic

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.330
and somebody whose home
base is the university,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.690
and just listening to you talk yesterday,

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.690
giving the lecture, the Jefferson
lecture, and then today,

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:01.690
I have a sense of the strong
idealism that motivates you,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.400
And by that I mean, an image of the future

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.880
and working toward that as you
deal with concrete problems.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.410
How do you deal with the
situation in government

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.140
when things go terribly wrong

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.900
as obviously happened in Rwanda.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.270
That was probably before
you were in the government,

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:24.220
but, but, but you could
reflect on that situation

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:29.220
where the good guys may
not always do as much good

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.230
as they can at a particular moment.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:37.150
- Well, I think that we
learned a lot from Rwanda,

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.760
because there were danger signals

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.930
that were clearly ignored.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.420
And I think what we learned
was, and then at the end,

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.260
they were intentionally
ignored, to be honest,

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.260
I think nobody was ready to
make the commitment necessary

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.740
to prevent something from
happening and I think in the end,

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.203
people didn't know how
bad it was going to be.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.360
And I think the major
lesson I take away is,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.150
when those signals are so unmistakable,

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.743
you should not ignore them.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.920
I think it's the second point as well,

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.693
which is why do you serve
in the US government?

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.540
I was very lucky, I
was a tenured professor

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.730
and one thing I decided to myself is,

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.980
there's always gonna be
somebody in this job.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.653
If you care more about your principles

00:23:22.653 --> 00:23:26.490
than you do about your job
then you will never fail,

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.670
because you'll always be
viewed as having principles.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.160
And so, I have to be prepared

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.230
to threaten to resign if necessary.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.340
Now it wasn't a bad threat for me because

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.260
if I was fired, I could go back
to a tenured professorship.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.453
But I was very struck,

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:48.390
six American foreign service
officers resigned during Bosnia

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.160
before there was a commitment
to the Dayton Accords.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.670
And I asked a couple of
them, why did you resign?

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.830
And they told me they had
gone to the Holocaust Museum

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.110
when it opened and they
were looking around

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.190
and they saw cables that were sent

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.450
from the US State Department
about the Holocaust

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.700
and responses, which
were essentially saying,

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.340
we don't know if anything's
happening or not.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.340
And they realized that

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.920
they were ignoring
similar signals in Bosnia

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.430
and that if they did that,

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.730
they would feel as
responsible as if they had

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.420
witnessed the Holocaust and
not done anything about it.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.340
So, a couple of them came
back and resigned on the spot.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.590
And those actions,
those acts of principle,

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.900
I think really pushed the
Clinton administration

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.273
to really step up too
and face the problem.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.883
- Now we were on a trajectory before 9/11.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.070
You discussed that with us just now,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.270
and really a commitment to building

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.800
this international normative structure,

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.080
and as you said, this was pushed aside

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.730
by the choices,

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.113
through choices made by
the Bush administration.

00:24:59.678 --> 00:25:04.470
I'm curious as to why
you think that happened.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.440
I know you believe those
decisions were wrong,

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.240
but what is your analysis of the dynamic

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.120
that would create such a reversal,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.920
a reversal that even went against what

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.370
many former officials of
the first President Bush

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.170
thought was a way to approach
some of these problems?

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.500
- Well, I'm trying to put
myself in their shoes.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:35.130
I think the Bush administration
saw a radical discontinuity,

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.120
I call it Achilles and his heel.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.230
You know, on the one hand,
we're the most powerful country.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.410
On the other hand, we clearly
have an Achilles heel.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.023
We could be attacked and
3,000 people can be killed.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.620
So, how do we defend ourselves?

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.640
We adopt an approach of Homeland Security,

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.010
which they construed to
mean more security at home

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.543
and pre-emptive self-defense
toward people abroad.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.010
And then I think their focus
on Human Rights shifted

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.060
from freedom to, freedom
to speak, to freedom from.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.450
Freedom from fear was Franklin
Roosevelt's famous phrase.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.063
I think they thought, we
need freedom from fear.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:18.350
So, I think they essentially
inverted the framework

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:23.350
by which human rights analysis
had been going on for years,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.700
because they thought there was
this radical discontinuity.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.220
Now I think their great mistake

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.640
was to underestimate the strength

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.640
of the legal process that
surrounds what the US did.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.640
You know, I describe it
as a legal exoskeleton.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.730
The United States had
created a political order

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.170
and there was a legal framework

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:48.670
that kind of held it in place.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.040
- Internationally.
- Internationally.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.630
And the United States designed this.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.690
It was designed to help us.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.490
We could mobilize it, for example,

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:01.030
we mobilized that legal
framework in the first Gulf War

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.713
to lawfully drive Saddam
Hussein out of Kuwait.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.840
So, I think that what happened was,

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.490
the administration suddenly
felt this exoskeleton

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.690
as constraining and
they tried to break free

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.360
and it looked for awhile
as if they had done so,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.700
but I think, you know, what
we're seeing as I speak,

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.690
which is in October 2003,

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.093
you know, that exoskeleton is
flexible, is closing back in.

00:27:26.616 --> 00:27:29.340
The US government's
under a lot of pressure.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.420
It's pretty clear that the
unilateral actions they take,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.590
they've taken have really hurt
them, overseas and at home.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.460
I think they're now
trying to figure out a way

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.020
to get Iraq reconstruction funded.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.930
And so, I think what it shows
is that law is resilient

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.773
and that power has to
take law into account.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.330
- Now, in 1990,

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.960
you wrote a book after your experience

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.380
in the Iran-Contra matter on the,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.178
the National Security Constitution,

00:28:04.178 --> 00:28:06.570
and one of your arguments

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.040
there was that the foreign policy

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.640
and I will state it briefly

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.400
and you can correct me if I'm wrong,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.370
you know, could be made,
which reflected the,

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.460
the constitutional framework

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.910
which said that on issues
such as foreign policy,

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.300
there is, there is a shared responsibility

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.110
that although we have
separation of powers,

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:32.810
the dynamism between
the different branches

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.020
could make for a better policy

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.720
and that in the Iran-Contra
case that had failed.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.160
And you went on to say

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.250
that you thought that there had been

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.950
a failure of power-sharing because

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.910
there had been a failure,

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.990
there had been executive initiative,

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:56.410
congressional acquiescence
to that initiative,

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.030
and a judicial tolerance

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.060
of letting the executive
do what it wanted,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.500
or thought was best.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.203
So, the question is,

00:29:05.203 --> 00:29:09.240
does that analysis
apply in this situation?

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.780
I mean, why didn't the system

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.240
respond sooner to

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.552
the actions that the
Bush administration took,

00:29:21.552 --> 00:29:24.610
which essentially put aside the framework.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:29.610
Does your analysis apply to
what happened after 9/11?

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:31.083
- Very much so.

00:29:31.083 --> 00:29:33.190
I think you stated the thesis well.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.060
You know, the thesis of the book,

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.700
the National Security
Constitution was at the time,

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.570
many people were saying
the Iran-Contra affair

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.430
is kind of a blip, you know,

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.540
it's a failure of certain individuals.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.023
Admiral Poindexter, Oliver North.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.103
My argument was, this is systemic.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.930
There are two competing visions

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.300
of how to run foreign policy.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.740
One is executive dominance.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.150
The other is what I call

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.837
a balanced institutional participation,

00:30:00.837 --> 00:30:03.200
Congress, the president, and the courts.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.450
And what I was really saying is

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.080
the principle of checks and balances

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.170
doesn't stop at the water's edge,

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:12.560
that, that all three
branches have to participate,

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.280
but that there had been this pattern

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.940
of executive overreaching,
congressional acquiescence,

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.310
and judicial tolerance, which was building

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:22.890
this counter-paradigm
of executive dominance.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.300
Now the funny part was,
after I wrote the book,

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.450
we went through a period in which

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.750
the Clinton presidency had great weakness.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.500
Newt Gingrich came, a lot of people said,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.290
do now think you were wrong?

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.920
And I said, no.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.500
I said, the pendulum will come back.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.300
Look what happened right
in the wake of 9/11.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.930
You know, the president
said, I want a Patriot Act.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:45.060
You know, Congress extremely acquiescent,

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.203
the courts have up until this
point not really drawn a line.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.340
So, we're now in a
situation in which finally

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.970
some cases are working their
way to the Supreme Court.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.600
You know, particularly about,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.230
can you hold the US citizen
indefinitely without a lawyer,

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.740
calling him an enemy combatant?

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.200
That's the Jose Padilla case.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.200
And I think in the end, we're
basically looking to see

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.360
whether the president's
power can be restrained

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.890
by either Congress or the courts.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.150
Just analogize it back to The
Steel Seizure Case of 1952.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.950
- That was which case now?

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.440
- The Youngstown Sheet &amp;
Tube, The Steel Seizure Case.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.400
Harry Truman seized the steel mills

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.913
in Youngstown, Ohio,

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.880
during the Cold War

00:31:34.722 --> 00:31:36.470
and the Supreme Court said,

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:39.570
you can indefinitely
seize American property

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.103
at home in time of war.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.000
Now if that's so, how can you seize

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.280
an American citizen indefinitely

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.563
in time of even a war against terrorism?

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.920
So, what we're gonna see now is,

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.860
which image of foreign
affairs decision-making

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.360
will the Supreme Court accept?

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.360
Will it be this executive dominance model

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.210
or will it be this power-sharing model?

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.090
And I would argue it ought to
be the power-sharing model.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.370
I think the most important point
is, the power-sharing model

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.350
is not just good for
Congress and the courts,

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.110
it's good for the president.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.450
You know, when the
president goes it alone,

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.750
he may have greater
freedom in the early going

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.960
based on his popularity polls,

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.060
but when his popularity starts to drop,

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.720
he needs the support of Congress

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.810
and he needs the
legitimation of the courts

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.980
to carry on a balanced
constitutional foreign policy.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.010
And I think that's what we're seeing

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.420
with President George W. Bush now.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.570
He started with tremendous popularity

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.880
and then, you know,
over time it diminished

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.220
and now a majority of the American people

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:49.010
are criticizing the way he's
conducting our foreign policy.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.670
If he had gotten a statute
that clearly supported him,

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.020
if he'd gotten a judicial ruling

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.890
that clearly said he was in the right,

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.610
he'd be on much stronger footing.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.553
And I think it's in his
interest to seek those.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.460
- And in the case of this
particular administration,

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.660
it seems they've gone out on a limb

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.730
and the the route they
taken doesn't work actually.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.640
So, it's not just that
they violated the norms,

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.020
but the norms were in place for a reason

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.130
and now they're out on the limb,

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:23.730
which an election may
saw off, so to speak.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:26.250
- Yeah, I mean, I think that again,

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:29.510
it's this idea of a legal exoskeleton

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.470
that is not just a restraint,

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.610
but it's also a source of power.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.780
If you stay within the legal exoskeleton,

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.923
you're exercising legal power.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.650
When you step outside, you're
sacrificing your legitimacy.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.030
And the big challenge
for this administration,

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.500
can they fight outlaws while
staying within the law?

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.430
And I think that there's been
too much of a tendency to say,

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:57.560
fight fire with fire,
legal niceties don't count,

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.900
and then find that we are
viewed as big an outlier

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.700
as some of the countries
that we're criticizing,

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:09.700
and that weakens our cooperative
power, our soft power.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:11.670
I guess I'd put it this way.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.460
There are two kinds of, Joe
Nye the political scientist

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.610
says he distinguishes
America's hard power,

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.840
military and economic power

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:23.290
from its soft cooperative
persuasive power.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:27.270
And I see the rule of
law and our reputation

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.080
for promoting the rule
of law, human rights,

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.530
as core to our soft power.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.510
And we have been
squandering that reputation

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:37.980
and relying on our hard power.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.250
Well, it turns out hard power
is good for defeating Iraq,

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.600
it turns out it's not
good for rebuilding Iraq,

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:48.020
that we need soft power

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.973
and we are sacrificing that soft power.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.373
We're squandering it at a
time when we need it the most.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:01.420
- And one has the sense
that the very problems

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.060
that the Bush administration
is, are now confronting

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.550
in Iraq are the ones that
we worked on in the '90s.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.340
that we were building up a
way of thinking about them,

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.550
working through them and they sort of had

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.260
pushed all that off of the table and now

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.940
they're foisted by their own petard.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.690
- Yes, one argument I made
in the Jefferson lecture is,

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.920
did the United States have an option

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.820
other than to attack Iraq

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.760
with the British government
in the Spring of 2003?

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.740
And I think the Bush
administration framed it as,

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.500
attack Iraq with the Brits

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.333
or do nothing.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.540
And let's not continue with
weapons of mass destruction

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.930
and gross human rights violations.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.050
Well, I think many people then said,

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.033
well, if this is the choice,
better to get him out.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.980
What I have been arguing
is that, you know,

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.790
there was a third way that
was developed a long time ago.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.210
How was Milosevic removed?

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.270
The United States put pressure on him,

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.820
collectively, cooperatively
created a tribunal

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.410
where he could be tried,

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.720
encouraged popular democracy to thrive.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.520
He was gradually forced to leave.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.030
A democratic government replaced him

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.970
and he went to the Hague.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:23.500
So, if the United States
government had used a similar plan.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.020
You know, disarm Iraq without attack,

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.800
get Saddam to leave
without military force,

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.140
we could have maintained our legitimacy

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:36.150
without resorting to this
radical coercive alternative.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.060
So, I think those are that are
in the Clinton administration

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.510
I know have essentially felt
like there was a game plan,

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.210
there was a blueprint that
you could have followed

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.180
that was followed with
regard to Milosevic.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.870
Here, they didn't follow it,

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.050
and they took a route that
looked better in the short-term,

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:57.274
and it's turned out to be
much worse in the long run.

00:36:57.274 --> 00:36:59.950
- General Wesley Clark has an article

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.300
in the forthcoming issue
of the New York Review

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.160
where he essentially argues

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.460
that one of their failures
was to not draw on

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.380
what had become an interagency process

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.090
during the Clinton administration

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:15.610
to actually lay out within the government,

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.780
you know, planning about how one prepares

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.573
for the transition to democracy.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.550
- In Kosovo and East
Timor and Sierra Leone,

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:28.980
all of these were, you know,
post-conflict societies

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.240
in which major peacekeeping
rebuilding efforts were made.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.740
One of the great tragedies of Iraq,

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.640
Sergio Vieira de Mello

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.930
who was the UN administrator in Kosovo

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.230
and the UN administrator in East Timor

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:47.120
goes to Baghdad and he's
killed in a bomb attack.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.440
Why, in part because the
necessary preconditions,

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.520
the security arrangements

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.400
and other things weren't established.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.490
So, I think he knew even
at the time that he's going

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:00.940
that he was entering a much
more dangerous situation

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.413
in which basic groundwork
hadn't been laid.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:07.093
It's a tremendous tragedy for everybody,

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.850
that we didn't learn
the lessons of the past.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.960
- I want to ask you, do
you feel that there was

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.780
a political failure domestically

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:18.770
in the United States

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:23.770
among elected people in the
Congress to oppose the war?

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.373
Did they not meet the test
that you defined in your book?

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:30.103
- Yes.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.130
- [Harry] Yes, they failed?

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.010
- They failed.
- Yeah.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.040
- Well, let me give one example, you know,

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.810
the Patriot Act passed
with one dissenting vote,

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:39.933
Russ Feingold.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.560
The Patriot Act circulated in draft

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.740
when most of Congress
was out of their offices,

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.820
because of anthrax.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.800
So, many of them didn't even read it

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.390
and you know, you're passing
a law that you didn't read,

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:55.913
it's called the Patriot Act,

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.800
the authorization for use of force

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.540
essentially permitted the
president to attack any country

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.660
that he thought was a threat after 9/11.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.790
It didn't name names, you know,

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.640
declarations of war,
name particular country.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.470
So, as open-ended or is
one of the most open-ended

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.523
authorizations since the
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.700
Now, I think with regard to Iraq,

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.740
the Congress made an
absolutely critical error.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.483
In the first Gulf War,

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.560
the president went to the Security Council

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.660
and he got a resolution

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:34.220
authorizing an attack, but setting limits

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.390
and then Congress
authorized him to use power

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:38.830
necessary to enforce

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.430
the limited Security Council resolution.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.083
That was the right sequence.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.693
In this Gulf War, 2003,

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.280
the president goes to Congress and says,

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.603
just give me a resolution,

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.690
which I can use without regard to whether

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.460
there's a Security
Council resolution or not.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.360
So, they gave essentially

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.520
an open-ended Security Council resolution

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.913
before the election.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.860
Once he has that resolution,

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.140
he doesn't need a Security Council,

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.380
once he has a Congressional resolution,

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.870
he doesn't need a Security
Council resolution.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.780
So, then he goes to the
Security Council and says,

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.563
I'm going to attack Iraq
whether you say so or not.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.260
And then they go back and forth

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.960
and in the end he abandons the effort

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.630
to get a Security Council resolution

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:24.940
that would authorize the attack.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:29.150
And then he says, quite
in my mind unbelievably,

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:32.260
by the way, the old
Security Council resolution

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.440
justifies today's attack.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.590
It's pretty strange to think that France

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:41.460
in 1991 was authorized in
the attack of Iraq in 2003

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.990
when Chirac is sitting
there in 2003 saying,

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.420
I'm going to veto any resolution.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.830
So, I think that Congress
failed in terms of the way

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.760
in which they saw their responsibilities.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.630
They should not have been
giving a blank check.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:00.100
Now I think the president
was short-sighted also.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.680
He saw this blank check as
somehow in his interest,

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.930
but he's paying a price,
because now it's Bush's war,

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:13.100
you know, he didn't have
congressional approval at the time.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.940
So, I mean, it's too open-ended.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.430
And so, now Congress can
walk away from the war.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:21.630
So, I'm not blaming any particular entity.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:24.023
I think everybody covered themselves with,

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.910
with unglory in this episode.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:32.210
The president, I think, acted
without real consultation,

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:35.130
without getting specific authorization.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:38.600
Congress, I think, bailed
out, ran for cover,

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.510
and I think Congress,
I'm sorry, the courts

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.003
haven't yet adjudicated,

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.140
particularly in these detention issues,

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.480
but their challenge is coming up.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.710
- Now in a way, all of
this comes together,

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.450
all that we've been talking
about, the difference between

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.960
the Clinton and the Bush administration,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.413
the new problem after 9/11 that is the,

00:42:02.385 --> 00:42:05.930
the threat from either rogue
states or terrorist groups

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.310
obtaining nuclear weapons

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.130
and trying to use them
on the American homeland,

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:14.070
dictating in the Bush
administration's view

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:17.930
of pre-emptive strategy in the
case of North Korea actually.

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.293
So, I'd like to talk a little about that.

00:42:21.526 --> 00:42:24.610
You can bring a special insight

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:25.890
at many levels,

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:30.450
your background, but also
your work as a lawyer

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.590
and in the government, and so on.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.990
So, share with us some observations

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:38.860
how these two contrasting
views come together

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.823
in the question of how
to deal with North Korea.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.290
- When I went to North
Korea in November 2000

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.610
with Madeleine Albright,

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.910
it was the highest visit by

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.740
an American official to meet Kim Jong-il.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.793
From 1994 to 2001,

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.000
Kim Jong-il had entered
into this agreed framework

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.290
where he agreed to restrain
nuclear construction

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:05.813
in exchange for food, energy, et cetera.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.850
You know basically, North Korea

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.200
is a failed state under his leadership

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.003
and the clear impression
that we had at the time was,

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.430
if we can lure Kim Jong-il

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:22.810
into participating in a legal framework,

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:25.280
he will start to do things

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.600
as part of this contractual agreement

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:31.680
that will bring him more and
more into the world system

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.683
it's not, to some it's the
idea of Nixon going to China.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.683
And what I saw of him is, he's strange,

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.970
but he is not crazy

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:49.970
and he desperately wanted to
be closer to the world system.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.130
He wants to be part of it.

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:57.130
He wants to be, in some
ways, recognized by it.

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.090
Our meeting went very well.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.250
And then it was discovered that in fact,

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.690
he had been continuing
his nuclear development.

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:08.697
In other words, this agreed framework

00:44:08.697 --> 00:44:10.569
had not worked perfectly.

00:44:10.569 --> 00:44:12.150
- And this was, this discovery was made

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.520
in the Bush administration?

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.870
- Yeah, now my view is,

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.920
that's a little bit like discovering that

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:23.330
the speed limit is 60,
but people are going 65.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.540
The fact that the law
is not working perfectly

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.150
doesn't mean that it's not
having a restraining force.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.880
Nobody denied, in fact, the
Bush administration doesn't deny

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.740
that the existence of this legal framework

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:38.610
meant less nuclear weapons in North Korea

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:39.790
than there would have been,

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:42.103
plus it created a
framework of cooperation.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:45.720
What they do is, they break off the talks.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.720
And this now, and then start
making threatening statements

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:52.750
about Kim Jong-il, in particular,

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:55.550
this claim that he's
part of this axis of evil

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.240
that includes Iraq.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.310
And then it becomes clear
that we're gonna attack Iraq.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.483
Now, if you're Kim Jong-il,
you've been cooperating,

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:07.573
suddenly without much
change in your own behavior,

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:12.220
you're being identified as
part of this axis of evil.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.070
I think he reasonably
concluded from his perspective,

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.980
I better get myself some
more bargaining chips.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.140
And he started building more weapons

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.210
and then the United States was in a box,

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:27.380
because at this point we
didn't have the negotiators

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.840
who had negotiated the previous deal.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.790
We'd abandoned the previous framework.

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:34.790
We had created this feeling of hostility

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:37.010
and we couldn't use military force,

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:39.120
because it was too dangerous to use it,

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.650
because of the proximity
of Seoul to North Korea.

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.970
So, what happened after a couple of years

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:48.440
in which this whole
framework disintegrates,

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.580
North Korea builds more weapons,

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.370
we start trying to develop
another multilateral framework.

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.180
We've moved from one agreed framework

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.080
to an effort to create a
second one and my view is,

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.650
we never should have
abandoned in the first place.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:03.940
I'll tell you, Harry,

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.900
the greatest tragedy
from my perspective was

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:12.543
when we flew out of North
Korea into the South.

00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:15.420
It was an incredible moment.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.230
In North Korea, it's all
dark, there's no electricity

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:20.330
and we flew into South Korea,

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:22.710
then suddenly somebody
said, look there's Seoul.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:26.110
And it was just, you
know, millions of lights.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:30.490
And I thought to myself, that's democracy.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.720
You know, these people
are the same people.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.810
The only difference between
the North and the South

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:36.910
is a political system they lived under

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.290
and look at all this
light, all this prosperity.

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.440
And we landed and we
went to see Kim Dae-jung

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.367
who had worked with my father

00:46:42.367 --> 00:46:44.320
and now a Nobel Peace Prize winner

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:48.410
and he says, I have this dream now,

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:52.040
North and the South can be
like a federated Germany

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.820
and they can try to deal
with an organization

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.610
for Security and Cooperation in Asia.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:46:59.500
And we left and we flew back to America,

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.170
and I said to myself,

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:04.730
I'm gonna see Korea
reunited in my own lifetime.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:07.940
And the thing he said that
really stunned me was,

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.070
at one point he said, Kim Dae-jung,

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:12.780
this is the president
of South Korea, he said,

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:17.030
I would like to see the
World Cup Semi-Final

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.473
played in North Korea.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:21.600
What would happen,

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.390
the Bush administration
broke off the talks,

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:27.070
the World Cup Semi-Final
was played in South Korea.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.040
I don't know if you remember,
but the people who played were

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.450
Germany and South Korea.

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:35.560
Now if Kim Dae-jung's
dream had been carried out,

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.670
a reunited Germany would
have played South Korea

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:41.840
in the World Cup in North Korea.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.680
Every camera in the world
would have been there,

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.540
the North Koreans would have been cheering

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.240
for the South Koreans, it would
have opened up that country.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.820
I mean, think about what
ping-pong diplomacy did to China,

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.260
much larger country.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.393
They never could have,

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.950
they never could have
closed the box again.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:04.060
A process would have begun
in Kim Jong-il's North Korea

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.440
that he could not have closed off.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.580
Pandora's box of democracy
would have been opened

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:12.853
and I think about that all the time,

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:16.190
because I think that, you know,

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.440
since then it's been a couple steps back.

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.203
Now we're moving back
in the right direction.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.463
But I really do,

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.300
I really do want to see Korea
reunited in my lifetime.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.513
That was my father's dream and,

00:48:31.507 --> 00:48:34.460
and you know, I'd like to
see that dream come true.

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.823
- As you talk it, it
strikes me that one of the,

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:43.440
the dilemmas that somebody like yourself

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.780
who is an academic

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.400
with a theoretical long-term perspective

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:54.370
moving to government is
the short-term perspective

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.680
that seems to be present often

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.940
when one is in government.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.210
And I wonder if you would talk a little

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:05.390
about that frustration,
namely, you've just laid out

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.590
a beautiful long-term vision,

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:09.530
but in the short-term, you know,

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:13.570
things don't go the way
one would have wished for

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.450
if when we're moving toward the long-term.

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.750
Talk a little about that dilemma

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.873
of the academic in government.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:25.360
- Well, I think that

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.470
the academic tends to have theories

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:32.590
and tends to have visions

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:37.540
and the practitioner
has to get things done.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:40.000
And so, you know, the practitioner's focus

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.500
is almost always short-term

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.163
and the academic's focus
is always long-term.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.920
I think the key though is,

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.860
I've tried to adopt a,

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:56.500
a mentality of what I
call pragmatic idealism.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:01.023
You know, I believe that
civilization makes progress.

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:04.350
I mean, look at where we are now,

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:06.533
50 years after the Holocaust,

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:09.000
the things that are possible now

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.180
that weren't possible before,

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:12.910
and in the end, I think academic theories

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:17.320
have to not be based on
some theory of collapse or,

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.070
or failure but on some theory

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:22.113
of the possibilities of human cooperation.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:25.800
The story that says it the best was,

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.420
when I was in Belgrade
in Christmas of 1999,

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.080
there was a radio station called B92,

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.400
which had been very critical of Milosevic

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.083
and Milosevic shut them down.

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:41.513
And in the last days
before they shut them down,

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.670
I guess actually it was December of '98,

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.950
they asked me to come in for an interview.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:49.880
And I was talking to
an interviewer like you

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.940
in the studio just like this

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:52.723
and the guy was almost in tears.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.903
And at the very end he said,
we are about to go off the air,

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.470
and he said, what can you say

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.933
to our listeners that will give them hope?

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:09.350
And I said, Madeleine Albright

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.790
was born in Nazi Germany.

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:14.640
She fled from the Communists

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.160
and now she's secretary of state

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.900
of the most powerful country in the world.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.003
My father,

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.410
you know, was exiled from

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:26.200
a dictatorial government in South Korea

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.790
and now his son is the assistant
secretary for Human Rights

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:31.830
of the United States, and guess what,

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:33.600
both of our countries are free,

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.030
the Czech Republic is free.

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:38.090
South Korea is a burgeoning democracy

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.513
and I said and Yugoslavia will be too.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.970
And you know, it's true.

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:47.083
You know, Belgrade is
in a post-Milosevic era.

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:51.610
So, I can be discouraged about 9/11,

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:53.570
but I can't look at my own life

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:58.570
and not feel as if as an
academic or as a practitioner,

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.830
pragmatic idealism should not be my focus

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.350
and fundamental optimism

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:07.468
about the possibilities of civilization.

00:52:07.468 --> 00:52:11.403
- And really, the bottom
line here in these, these,

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.350
this positive direction
that you're talking about

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:19.070
is really what we started
with, your interest,

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:23.070
namely the effect of
transnational processes

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:26.940
on both individuals and states

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.473
and also the internal
processes of those states.

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:35.130
- I've come to think of the
idea of transnational process

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:36.283
as like medicine.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:39.440
When I first put the idea out,

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.830
a lot of political scientists said to me,

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:44.093
what's your theory,
what's your prediction?

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.100
As if this was a sort
of scientific process

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.200
that's gonna play out.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.590
And as I worked on it, I started to think,

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:56.360
you know, it's not so
much a scientific theory

00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.740
as it is a blueprint for action.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:03.040
And we need able practitioners

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.090
who are gonna push this process along.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:08.240
Yeah, I don't think human history
just plays out inevitably.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.590
I think it's contingent on human action.

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:13.160
So, when people say to me,

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.660
what does your theory now predict?

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.610
I would say, you know,
will the patient died

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:18.550
or will the patient live?

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:20.481
You know, it depends. (laughing)

00:53:20.481 --> 00:53:23.750
You know, it depends on how
good a doctor he or she has

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.270
and how quickly they identify what's wrong

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:30.230
and how far they push
for the right results.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:32.080
- So, it's a craft.
- It's a craft.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.870
And my view is, there
was a choice after 9/11.

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:39.320
I think we made a lot
of the wrong choices.

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.230
I think we're now starting to recognize

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:42.990
that we made the wrong choice.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.700
So, you know, even when we make mistakes,

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.860
there's a self-correcting
nature of the system,

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.160
but I think you know,

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.550
it's the job of people
who care about this system

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:56.523
of making progress to push
it in the right direction.

00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.220
That's why I'm very inspired

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:04.190
by the quote from Robert
Kennedy at Cape Town in 1960s.

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:05.023
He says, you know,

00:54:05.023 --> 00:54:08.100
every time a person stands
up against injustice,

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.260
they sent forth a tiny ripple of hope,

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.270
which crossing one another

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:15.850
from a million centers
of energy and daring,

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:17.780
create a tide that can bring down

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.320
the mightiest walls of injustice.

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.350
And when you think about it,
he's really talking about

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:25.350
what one person can do in
transnational legal process

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:26.910
to change the world.

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:28.750
Now when he said it, he was in Cape Town

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:33.750
and now South Africa is a
constitutional democracy.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:37.960
And you know, I think there are
people who are living proof,

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:42.663
Martin Luther King, Nelson
Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi,

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:48.100
that you know, having
this pragmatic idealism,

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:52.420
connecting intellect to
action, a theory to practice,

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:56.990
has the possibility to change
the world for the better.

00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:00.040
- Professor Koh, on that very
hopeful and positive note,

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.034
thank you very much for joining us

00:55:02.034 --> 00:55:07.034
and sharing this fascinating
intellectual Odyssey with us.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.250
- Thank you very much for
having me, I really enjoyed it.

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.960
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.915
for this Conversation with History.
