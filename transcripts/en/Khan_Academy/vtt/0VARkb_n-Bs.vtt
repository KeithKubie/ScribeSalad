00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.100
We're asked to reflect
this line across the line y

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.707
is equal to negative 4.

00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:07.290
So you have this
line right over here,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.960
and they actually give us all
of these transformation tools

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.585
right over here where
we can Translate,

00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:15.460
Rotate, Reflect, Dilate, or
Undo what we were about to do.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.000
So they want us to
reflect this line across y

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.560
is equal to negative 4.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.980
So let's get the
Reflection tool out.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.250
So I clicked reflect and
let's make this line be y

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.880
equals negative 4.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.160
So let's see.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.200
That would look something
y equals negative 4.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.020
So we're going to reflect
this line across y

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.550
equals negative 4.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.370
So let's reflect it,
and there you have it.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.200
We reflected it across
y equals negative 4.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.490
And then they ask us to
answer some questions.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.390
When a line is reflected,
the image created is a line.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.350
We know this is true because
a reflected image, well,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.350
the original image
had zero endpoints.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.111
These are just two points on
the line, they're not endpoints,

00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:04.819
they're not defining
the end of the line.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.110
If they were both endpoints
it would be a line segment,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.510
but this line keeps
going in both directions.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.780
So we know this is true
because a reflected image has

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.630
zero endpoints, and
we got it right.
