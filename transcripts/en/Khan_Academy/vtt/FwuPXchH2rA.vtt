00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.300
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.350
make sure we're comfortable with
ways to represent and visualize

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.650
complex numbers.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.860
So you're probably
familiar with the idea.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.240
A complex number,
let's call it z-- and z

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.830
is the variable we do tend to
use for complex numbers-- let's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.870
say that z is
equal to a plus bi.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.220
We call it complex
because it has a real part

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.820
and it has an imaginary part.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.580
And just so you're
used to the notation,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.420
sometimes you'll see
someone write the real part,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.230
give me the real part of z.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.680
This is a function, that
you input a complex number,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.360
and it will output the real
part, and in this case,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.920
the real part is equal to a.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.260
And you could have
another function

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.870
called the imaginary part of z.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.810
You input some
complex number it'll

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.510
output the imaginary
part, or it'll

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.730
say how much are scaling
up i, and in this case,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.794
it would be b.

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:10.460
This is a real number,
but this tells us

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.970
how much the i is scaled
up in the complex number z

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.270
right over there.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.795
Now, one way to visualize
complex numbers,

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:21.170
and this is actually a very
helpful way of visualizing it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.750
when we start thinking about
the roots of numbers, especially

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.500
the complex roots, is using
something called an Argand

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.000
diagram.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.270
So this is this.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.186
And so it looks a lot
like the coordinate axes

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:37.940
and it is a coordinate axes.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.670
But instead of having
an x and y-axis

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.360
it has a real and
an imaginary axis.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.990
So in the example of
z being a plus bi,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.100
we would plot it really as
a position vector, where

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.480
you have the real part
on the horizontal axis.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.830
So let's say this is a and
then the imaginary part

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.320
along the vertical axis,
or the imaginary axis.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.400
So let's say that this is b.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.900
And so we would represent,
in an Argand diagram,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.100
the vector z as a position
vector that starts at 0

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.300
and that has a tip at
the coordinate a comma b.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.090
So this right here is
our complex number.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.070
This right here is
a representation

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.030
in our Argand diagram
of the complex number

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.549
a plus bi, or of z.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.090
Now when you draw it this way,
when you draw it as a position

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.640
vector, and if you're familiar
with polar coordinates,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.170
you're probably
thinking, hey, I don't

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.160
have to represent this
complex number just

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.570
as coordinates, just
as an a plus bi.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.910
Maybe I could represent
this as some angle here,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.380
let's call that angle phi,
and some the distance here,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.325
let's call that r, which
is kind of the magnitude

00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:56.950
of this vector.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.660
And you could.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.990
If you gave some angle
and some distance,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.380
that would also specify this
point in the complex plane.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.030
And this is actually called the
argument of the complex number

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.960
and this right here is called
the magnitude, or sometimes

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.819
the modulus, or the absolute
value of the complex number.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.360
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.985
Let's think about
how we would actually

00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:19.670
calculate these values.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.750
So r, which is the
modulus, or the magnitude.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.170
It's denoted by the magnitude
or the absolute value of z1.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.210
What's this going to be.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.730
Well, we have a
right triangle here.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.410
This side is b, length b.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.060
The base right
here has length a.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.680
So to calculate r, we can just
use the Pythagorean Theorem. r

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.320
squared is going to be equal
to a squared plus b squared.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.340
Or r is going to be equal to the
square root of a squared plus b

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.180
squared.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.000
If we want to figure
out the argument,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.445
this is going to
be equal to what?

00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:03.070
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.320
We have b and a.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.730
So what trig function deals
with the opposite side

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.470
of an angle and
the adjacent side?

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.710
So let me write all of, let me
write the famous sohcahtoa up

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.529
here. "Soh-cah-toa."

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.810
Tangent deals with
opposite over adjacent.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.310
So the tangent of
this angle, which

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.070
we called the argument of the
complex number, the tangent

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.240
of the argument is going to
be equal to the opposite side

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.460
over the adjacent side.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.440
It is equal to b/a.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.700
And so if we wanted to
solve for this argument,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.300
we would say that
the argument is

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.420
equal to the arctan, or the
inverse tangent, of b/a.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.290
Now, if we wanted
to represent, let's

00:04:47.290 --> 00:05:00.230
say that we were given the
modulus and the argument.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.570
Let's say we were given that.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.695
How do we go the other way?

00:05:02.695 --> 00:05:05.470
Right now if we have the a's and
the b's, the real complex part,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.880
I just showed you how
to get the magnitude

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.659
and how to get the
angle, or the argument.

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:10.700
But if you're given this.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.320
How do you go the other way?

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.470
Well here, if you're
trying to figure out

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.860
a, given r and theta--
so you're trying

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.040
to figure out an adjacent side
given angle and the hypotenuse.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.680
So adjacent over hypotenuse
is equal to cosine.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.360
So you would have
cosine of the argument

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.920
is equal to the adjacent
over the hypotenuse.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.420
It is equal to a/r.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.280
Multiply both sides by r,
you get r cosine of phi

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.980
is equal to a.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.740
Do something very similar for b.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.390
If we use sine, opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.160
Sine of the argument
is equal to b/r.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.330
It is equal to b
over the magnitude.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.920
Multiply both sides by
r, you get r sine of phi

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.400
is equal to b.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.220
So how would we write
this complex number.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.130
So this complex
number z is going

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.710
to be equal to it's
real part, which

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:23.620
is r cosine of phi plus
the imaginary part times i.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.820
Plus r-- let me do that
same green-- plus r

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.560
sine of phi times i.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.900
Now this might pop out
at you as something

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.525
that's pretty interesting, if
you ever seen Euler's formula.

00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:40.510
Let's factor out
this r over here.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.790
So this is going to be equal
to-- factor out an r-- r times

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.610
cosine of phi plus-- I'll
put the i out front-- i

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.630
sine of phi.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.410
Now what is this?

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.710
And if you've seen
the video, I do it

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.340
in the Taylor series,
a series of videos

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.590
in the calculus playlist.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.030
And it's really one of the
most profound results and all

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.310
of mathematics, it
still gives me chills.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.200
This is Euler's formula.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.424
Or this, by Euler's
formula, is the same thing.

00:07:15.424 --> 00:07:17.340
And we show it by looking
at the Taylor series

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.730
representations of e to the x.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.900
And the Taylor series
representations

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.650
of cosine of x and sine of x.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:31.300
But this is, if we're dealing
with radians, e to the i phi.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:38.814
So z is going to be equal
to r times e to the i phi.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.620
So there's two ways to
write a complex number.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.240
You could write it
like this, where

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.190
you have the real and
imaginary part, that's

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.620
maybe what we're used to.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.580
Or we can write it in
exponential form, where

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.420
you have the modulus,
or the magnitude,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.714
being multiplied by a
complex exponential.

00:07:59.714 --> 00:08:02.130
And we're going to see that
this going to be super useful,

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.794
especially when we're
trying to find roots.

00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:06.710
Now just to make this
tangible, let's actually

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.110
do this with an actual example.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.570
So let's say that I
had, I don't know,

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:21.070
let's say that I had to z1
is equal to square root of,

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:30.140
let's say it's square
root of 3/2 plus i.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:36.500
And so we want to figure
out its magnitude,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.809
and we want to figure
out its argument.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:40.650
So let's do that.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.940
So the magnitude of
z1 is going to be

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.700
equal to the square
root of this squared.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:56.700
So this is going to be equal
to 3/4 plus 1 squared--

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.130
or I should say plus 4/4.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.760
So this is going to be equal
to square root of 7/4, which

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.530
is equal to the
square root of 7/2.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.540
And now let's figure
out its argument.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:19.490
So if I were to draw this
on an Argand diagram,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.045
it would look like this.

00:09:21.045 --> 00:09:22.670
It's going to be in
the first quadrant,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.150
so that's all I
have to worry about.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.600
So let me draw it.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.740
Let me draw it like this.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.689
And so we have a situation.

00:09:33.689 --> 00:09:35.230
So it's going to be
square root of 3,

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.900
actually, let me change
this up a little bit,

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.800
just so the numbers get
a little bit cleaner.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.670
Sorry about this.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.240
Let me make it a little
bit, slightly cleaner.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.720
So just so that we have a
slightly cleaner result,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.690
because we want to make our
first example a simple one.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.940
So let's make this square
root of 3/2 plus 1/2i..

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.070
So let's figure
out the magnitude,

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.170
the magnitude here is z1
is equal to the square root

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.270
of, square root
of 3/2 squared, is

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.940
equal to 3/4 plus 1/2
squared is equal to 1/4,.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.650
This makes things a lot nicer.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.959
This is equal to the square
root of 1, which is 1.

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:16.750
And now let's think
about it, let's draw it

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:21.780
on an Argand diagram to
visualize the argument.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.115
So this is my imaginary axis.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.205
This is my real axis.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.000
And so this complex number
is square root of 3/2.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.730
The square root
of 3 is like 1.7.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:45.250
So if we have like 1, it'll
be like right over here,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.900
someplace right over here.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.310
This is square root
of 3/2, the real part.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.750
The imaginary part is 1/2.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.760
So if this is 1, this is
1/2, the imaginary part

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.960
is right over here, 1/2.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.900
And we actually also know
its length, its length,

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.880
or its magnitude is 1.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.850
So how do we figure
out phi over here?

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.814
We know that this side over
here is square root of 3

00:11:08.814 --> 00:11:11.230
over-- oh let me be careful--
we know that side over there

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.390
is 1/2.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.510
That's the imaginary part.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.720
And we know the base is
the square root of 3/2.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.880
So a bunch of ways
we can do this.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.352
One, you could just
do the tangent,

00:11:23.352 --> 00:11:25.560
because that involves the
opposite over the adjacent.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.270
You could say that
the tangent of phi

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.620
is equal to the
opposite, is equal to 1/2

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.430
over the square root of 3/2.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.620
And then you can take the
inverse tan of both sides.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.540
So this would be the
same thing as phi

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.040
being equal to the
inverse tangent,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.136
or the arctangent
of-- if you multiply

00:11:45.136 --> 00:11:46.760
the numerator and
the denominator by 2,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.790
this is 1 over the
square root of 3.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.050
You could do it like that.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:56.190
You can also say that phi is
equal to the inverse sine of,

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.080
so the sine of
phi is going to be

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.640
equal to the opposite
over the hypotenuse.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.210
So sine of phi is
equal to 1/2 over 1,

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.610
or phi is equal to
the arcsine of 1/2.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.590
And you could put that
into your calculator.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.750
Or you could recognize this
is a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.690
This base right here, square
root of 3/2, this is 1/2,

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.830
this is 1.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.099
So this angle right here
is going to be 30 degrees.

00:12:18.099 --> 00:12:19.640
And that's just from
pattern matching

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.720
from a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.290
You could look at these and
also get something similar.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.990
Now I want to put
this in radian form,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.781
because whenever I use
the exponential form

00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:30.000
you want it to be in radians.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.730
So phi is equal to
30 degrees, which

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.620
is the same thing as pi over 6.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.640
So if I wanted to represent
z1 in exponential form,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.351
it would be the exact same
thing as r, or its magnitude,

00:12:45.351 --> 00:12:47.850
which is 1-- I'll put the 1 out
there even though you really

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:55.580
don't have to-- 1 times
e to the pi over 6i.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.400
And we're done.
