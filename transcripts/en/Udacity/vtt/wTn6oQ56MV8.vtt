00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This notion of variables having different

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
values and different contexts

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is sometimes called scope.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's some sort of global scope that

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we start in where we're assigning values to variables,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but then inside myfun,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
there's a new x that has a new value,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and what this means is that our environment

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
cannot be a flat mapping.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We had hoped before that we'd be able to use

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a single Python dictionary,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but this myfun example shows that that's

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
really not going to cut it because in a single dictionary,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you can only have x bind to 1 thing,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we need to know that x is sometimes

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
outside x and sometimes os lasiandras.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's get some practice with these concepts with another quiz.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This one explicitly on scoping,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and we'll do it together in the interpreter.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So we have x gets outside x and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
y gets outside y just like before.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So I've written out this program,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and it's a little more complicated than last time.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It has 2 functions, funone and funtwo,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
my phenomenal cosmic naming scheme,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
with a few printouts.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
X starts out as outside x.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Y starts out as outside y.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When we enter function 1,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we print out current value of x in scope,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the current value of y in scope, and then we call function 2.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Function 2 also prints out its value of x and its value of y,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and down here we get the ball rolling by calling

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
function 1 on Hong Kong in 1997.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So the quiz for you is to fill in these blanks,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the 3 formal parameter declarations,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
2 for funone and 1 for funtwo,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but you can only use x, y, and z.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So for each one of these blanks, fill it in with

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
either x or y or z, and that's it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In order to make the output of this program,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
match exactly what we see down here,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
funone x Hong Kong, funone y outside y,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
funtwo x outside x, funtwo y funone y.

00:01:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is a bit of a puzzle, try it out.
