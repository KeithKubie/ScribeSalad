LARS RYSSDAL: All right.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.980
Thank you.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.530
Good morning, still.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.920
Everyone, hope you're hungry.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.517
Great to be here today.

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:10.600
We're absolutely thrilled.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.440
This is our first time with
"Art Culinaire" magazine coming

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.290
to the Zagat Kitchen
here at Google.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.980
And we-- myself
and Carol Newman,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.330
who's sitting right over
here-- publish a magazine that

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.729
has been in existence for
28, going on 29 years.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.050
The magazine is called
"Art Culinaire."

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.770
It's a hardbound
magazine quarterly

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.120
that has been showcasing the
great chefs in the world.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.730
We-- Carol had been the
editor of the magazine

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.960
for several years
in its former life.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.530
And we were able to bring
the magazine to California

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.600
in May of last year.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.060
And Carol has the
pleasure and honor

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.180
of curating the chefs
for the magazine.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.430
And in looking at who to talk
about and who to discover

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.340
and who's really
interesting and provides

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.680
great reading and
beautiful food,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.340
it was not difficult in
the early stages of our

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.750
developing the material
for the magazine

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.840
that we centered on a
young man in Oakland who

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.000
is a fascinating fellow,
handsome as all get out,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.240
benevolent and talented.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.570
I think I said that already.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.520
But you can't say it enough.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.980
So today, we have James.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.820
And we'll have him
re-pronounce his last name.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.660
It's Syhabout.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.716
From Commis.

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:04.840
He has several restaurants.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.190
We'll talk about the different
sort of iterations of his mind

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.980
and personality as it translates
into the restaurants he owns.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.340
The dish that he's doing
today-- we'll talk about--

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.810
is a cured salmon dish that
appears in "Art Culinaire 113."

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.540
I don't know if I
mentioned the magazine yet.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.440
We'll have these
available for James

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.120
to sign for you at the end.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.980
The dish that we'll
be doing today,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.420
again, the cured salmon dish--
I've got it bookmarked here--

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.100
will look exactly like this.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.690
OK?

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.940
And then after James
tells you how to make it,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.520
you guys can run home and
make it yourself and send us

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.750
pictures to make sure
that it looks exactly

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.980
like this when you're
cooking it in your homes.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.060
OK?

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.920
So I come from a family
that moved to America.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.430
I was born after my
family moved from Norway.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.070
And my sisters and I--
our dear departed mother

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.700
had an extremely strong accent.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.490
And your organization
built a server plant

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.330
on the footprint of the aluminum
plant my father used to manage.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.930
And when they came to this
small town on the Columbia River

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.290
in Oregon, my mom
was very excited.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.660
And she has this
affected accent.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.270
And if I say "Gyoogle,"
actually, I can't help it.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.750
It's my mother's
Norwegian accent.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.270
And she leaned on the Os
like a big long search.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.150
So if I'm "Gyoogling," I'm
thinking about my mother.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.270
The reason why I say that is
because James has-- his mother

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.250
is an incredibly important
part of his life.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.760
And we're going to
hand it over to James

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.950
to talk about that primarily.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.740
The role of your mom in
your adult life in business

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.929
in Oakland-- how does
that work for you?

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:12.470
JAMES SYHABOUT: I'm
a restaurant kid.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.589
So I grew up in restaurants
before I was a teenager.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.340
I knew I wanted to cook since
I was 10 professionally.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.540
I was the kid who was
sitting on the stools

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.780
in the mom-and-pop
Thai restaurants,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.767
picking stems off Thai
chilies, peeling garlic.

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:32.850
I didn't have a normal
weekend, because my weekend

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.269
was helping the family business.

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:36.560
But I enjoyed what I was doing.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.290
I have no regrets at all.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.240
And then it took a
turn with TV and seeing

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.105
the great chefs of Europe.

00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:50.140
And it was so much
different than what

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.290
I've experienced in my
parents' restaurant.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.250
Who are these guys in these nice
white starched jackets, cooking

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.660
this beautiful food?

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.270
And it was totally the opposite
of what my parents were doing.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.310
They were just-- Thai food.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.065
So it sparked my
curiosity, and I

00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:11.440
decided to pursue
it as a career.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.360
I went to culinary school.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.430
It definitely wasn't a
highlight in my career,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.650
but I just started training.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.340
You know?

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.080
Manresa down in Los Gatos was
somewhat my breeding ground.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.510
I've been there for five
years, and it kind of

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.140
sparked me to get
more interested.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.915
So I took a trip to
Europe for a year.

00:05:28.915 --> 00:05:31.005
It was like grad school for me.

00:05:31.005 --> 00:05:32.710
I ate out as much
as I can, burning

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.210
holes in all my credit cards.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.510
And it was worth
every penny of it.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.980
But going back full circle,
why I got involved in cooking

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.960
and why I like
cooking is-- is anyone

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.257
familiar with my
restaurants at all?

00:05:46.257 --> 00:05:48.340
They're all very different,
if you notice-- Commis

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.160
to Hawker Fare to The Dock.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
I've always been told,
if you ever do something,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.780
and you're really into it,
have it reflect who you are.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.190
Commis really
represents by training.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.470
It's kind of my discipline.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.630
So the OCD part of me is Commis.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.485
It's my training.

00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:07.360
But the soulfulness of
who I am, my identity,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.925
is Hawker Fare, kind of
cooking Thai street food,

00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:12.710
kind of rediscovering myself.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.700
And they say, as you
get older, you kind of

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.820
gravitate towards your past
and try to identity search.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.300
So that's a big part of it for
me right now is Hawker Fare.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.759
I'm opening one.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.800
After I leave here, we're
opening-- opening night

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.655
at Hawker Fare, San
Francisco is tonight.

00:06:26.655 --> 00:06:29.020
So we have a big
night ahead of us.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.910
I did The Dock.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.855
The Dock is West Oakland.

00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:33.342
That's where I grew up.

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:34.800
Oakland public
schools all the way.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.940
It's just kind of a
sense of community

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.191
that people-- Oakland
gets a bad rap in general.

00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.940
But there's a beauty
I see in West Oakland

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.090
that no one else sees.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.460
My partner Adam Lamoreaux
opened the first brewery there

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.910
in 50 years.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.650
Me and him partnered up and put
a restaurant next door to it.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.000
And looking around The Dock,
conceptually, what is The Dock?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.820
We're in the melting pot of
the Bay Area, all the shipping

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.710
containers.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.980
And we decided, let's make
it an international place.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.450
There's no rules.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.470
West Oakland, there's
no rules in general.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.890
There's not-- a
neighborhood doesn't exist.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.040
So who do we cater to?

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.090
It was like, let's just do what
we want and take it from there.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.850
As long as the food's
delicious, the vibe is great,

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.280
building a sense of community.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.800
And we kind of took
it and ran with it.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.070
It kind of simplifies
my street hood years.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.930
We play lots of hip-hop.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.165
We have-- we're going to
start doing shows there,

00:07:38.165 --> 00:07:42.670
like Hieroglyphics day,
the Oakland hip-hop band.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.170
So yeah.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.810
So it comes around full circle.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.090
So it's many compartments
of myself, per se.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.150
But "Art Culinaire,"
one of the magazines

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.280
I worshipped as a kid-- I think
I have issues from number 50

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.240
until now.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.050
It's a quarterly magazine,
idolizing all these chefs.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.630
And I was given a great
opportunity to take part.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.070
And how could I say no?

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.150
All the chefs I idolized
in the past, you name them,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.790
they're in there.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.110
So it was a real blessing
to be a part of it.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.795
In the book, we're
going to do more

00:08:18.795 --> 00:08:22.750
of what I do at Commis,
which is a reflection

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.130
of a place and a time.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.810
It's a snapshot.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.370
The dish in the book--
it was a spring dish.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:34.776
So it was green tomatoes, wild
salmon, wild coastal herbs

00:08:34.776 --> 00:08:36.400
that we foraged for
or my cooks foraged

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.159
for in the coast, up in
the hills of Oakland.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:47.230
So it's like a landscape on
the plate, an edible landscape.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.910
But today, we're going
to kind of switch gears.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.090
We're doing the same
dish, but I want

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.460
to let you know it's more
about the ideology of the dish

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.850
and the philosophy and the
thought, the train of thought,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.760
more so than the dish itself.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.260
Techniques can be
utilized universally,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.470
just swap out ingredients.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.620
That's all we're doing.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.110
That's all we're doing
as chefs, and kind

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.020
of adjusting to what your
ingredient is, per se.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.930
So today, we're going
to do-- we're still

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.800
in the middle of
winter, so kohlrabi.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.250
It is a swollen cabbage
stem in the brassica family,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:29.100
so same family as kale,
cauliflower, spinach, broccoli,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.410
romanesco.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.370
So we're going to
do a soup with this

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.508
with dill instead
of green tomatoes.

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:40.890
LARS RYSSDAL: And we've
got dill and some--

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.730
JAMES SYHABOUT: It's
a very simple dish.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.170
The more and more--
as I get older,

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:52.310
I'm realizing the most simple
cooking is the hardest to do.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.500
I always think about sushi.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.875
It's just fish and rice.

00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:58.000
But it's absolutely the
hardest thing to get right.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.600
I find myself, sometimes
I pile on ingredients.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.070
It's like, maybe
it's because I'm

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.930
trying to hide something and not
let it be bare and kind of let

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.890
it speak for itself.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.710
Soup is really simple.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.300
Take some kohlrabi.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.650
Actually-- yeah, we'll
do the soup first

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:23.330
because we'll take-- kohlrabi,
I like to use the whole plant,

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.440
if you will.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.120
There's also purple kohlrabi.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.630
It's just the skins.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.080
That's the coloring difference.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.510
The inside flesh is the same.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.900
So there's parts of
the kohlrabi that you

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.665
want to trim pretty deep, only
because it's very fibrous.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.730
And being at Commis, we
want to make everything

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.580
very elegant and
very silky smooth.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:58.510
So all these fibers will
kind of get in our way

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.480
when you're trying
to achieve that.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.280
You can also use a mandolin.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.820
I use mandolins all the time.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.180
Just watch your fingers.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.220
But even though we're
cooking it in the soup,

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.550
I still like to
slice it very thin.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.240
It creates less work
for the blender.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.590
LARS RYSSDAL: So the
mandolin is a slicing device.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.140
It is a plane with
a blade in it that

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.500
allows you to slice very,
very thin without taking

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.200
any of your knuckles or
fingers with whatever you're

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.140
slicing very, very thin.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.290
I like to use those for
making home potato chips

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.440
and things like that.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.570
JAMES SYHABOUT: So I like
to use-- at Commis, we

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:46.610
cook very light,
very minimal butter,

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.886
not so much scorching
heat, because we

00:11:49.886 --> 00:11:54.860
want to still remain intact
the entirety of the vegetable.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.550
So everything sits
really gently sweated.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.210
So this is just grapeseed oil.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:05.650
Grapeseed is the most neutral
oil that you can probably get.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.030
It doesn't impart any flavor.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.470
But it's a fat.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.350
It will help you.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.090
Just slices of kohlrabi.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.410
LARS RYSSDAL: And grapeseed oil
burns at a higher temperature,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.867
lower temperature than
olive oil or canola oil?

00:12:19.867 --> 00:12:21.950
JAMES SYHABOUT: It smokes
at a higher temperature.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.710
So ideally, I use grapeseed
oil for flavoring, making

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.500
flavored oils.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.708
Like we're going to make
our dill oil with grapeseed.

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.980
AUDIENCE: Where do you
buy that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.396
JAMES SYHABOUT:
The grapeseed oil?

00:12:33.396 --> 00:12:34.889
AUDIENCE: No, the vegetable.

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:35.930
JAMES SYHABOUT: Kohlrabi?

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.070
Whole Foods.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.020
Farmers markets might
have it right now.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.170
LARS RYSSDAL: It's
fairly widely available.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.250
It's a very stable vegetable.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.340
It stays in its ripe state
for a very long time.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.510
So it's easy for people
to stock them in stores.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:01.880
So it's really
versatile and again will

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.070
be in the produce--
it will stay fresh

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.790
in the produce section
for a long time.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.800
You start to smell
it a little bit?

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.435
It's good.

00:13:10.435 --> 00:13:11.810
JAMES SYHABOUT:
With seasoning, I

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.340
like to season
throughout my cooking.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.310
Some people like to
season at the end only.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.100
Only because I like to
create some depth with salt.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.640
Also salt allows
you to draw moisture

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.855
from the ingredient, from
whatever vegetable you have.

00:13:28.855 --> 00:13:31.230
It sort of really highlights--
just a little small pinch.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.150
Just be careful not to color.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.910
LARS RYSSDAL: So James,
you guys-- you really

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.980
encourage an atmosphere
of collaboration at Commis

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.860
in particular.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:59.030
The menu is constantly
changing, where at Hawker Fare,

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.680
they're foods from your youth.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.070
And the menu is
relatively consistent

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.940
as you would go there
from one month to the next

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.710
to another year.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.330
But in Commis, it's-- you spoke
of this being a spring dish.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.764
The menu is evolving daily.

00:14:16.764 --> 00:14:18.180
And that involves--
and you've got

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.750
a lot of collaboration going.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.910
People here are collaborating
on projects all the time.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:28.980
How do you accept things,
and how do you politely

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.005
decline an idea?

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.350
JAMES SYHABOUT: At
Commis, we believe--

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.260
we don't cook on
a timeline per se.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.470
People say, oh, how often
do you change the menu?

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.350
I'm like, I couldn't tell you.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.470
It depends what
shows up tomorrow.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.220
It depends what shows up two
days later, what we have,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.460
or what one of my cooks
found hiking in the woods.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.820
Or Morgan went out
surfing in Santa Cruz

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.020
and found some beach herbs.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.750
So it kind of all depends.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.270
We look at the menu as a
breathing-- its own thing,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.760
and it's living and breathing.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.960
So we print menus every day.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.670
The menu's always a
surprise to the guests.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.050
We never present menus.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.760
We just ask for
dietary restrictions,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.240
and then off we go.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.900
But collaboration
is a big part only

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.190
because I like to give my
cooks a sense of ownership.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.230
I think it's very important
when you're creating something.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.110
Yes, I'm the mentor.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.290
Yes, it's my restaurant.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.030
But I want to give them
a sense of ownership.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.450
So a lot of the dishes, they
need to have a voice in it.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.340
I'll have this crazy idea.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.790
I'll say, Keoni, oxtails
and blueberry powder.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.160
Make it happen.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.710
And he's just like, oh, OK.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.210
How about a little thyme
cream and burnt milk?

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.250
And I was like,
yeah, sounds great.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:56.660
And we don't know till we do it.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.249
So yeah.

00:15:57.249 --> 00:15:58.040
That's a good part.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.880
And then when the dish
becomes fully realized,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.780
he feels like he has
ownership or there's

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.180
a piece of him in there.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.322
And he's like really
proud of that dish.

00:16:07.322 --> 00:16:08.780
At Commis, we have
an open kitchen.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.686
So a lot of the food
gets brought to the table

00:16:12.686 --> 00:16:14.047
by the cooks as well.

00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:15.505
So it's kind of
taking another step

00:16:15.505 --> 00:16:19.310
and bridging that-- eliminating
that bridge between the diner

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.710
and the kitchen as well.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.690
I think that's very,
very unique and cool.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.560
Back to the soup.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.990
I added a little bit of water.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.390
Sometimes I use vegetable
stock if they have it

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.449
on hand, just a
little gentle simmer.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.490
I'm going to let that go.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.020
AUDIENCE: When do
you use the greens?

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.145
JAMES SYHABOUT: The greens.

00:16:35.145 --> 00:16:40.640
I use the greens at the
last minute in my soup.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.570
It gives a color.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.460
And also-- so this is going
to be cooking to a mush.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.060
So it's overdone.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.270
The greens, the leafy
greens, the more vegetal,

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.010
I throw in at the end
right before I blend it.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.430
And it kind of gives it
that raw vegetable taste

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.280
that I can't get if I just
blended raw vegetables.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.982
So it's kind of like
cheating in a way.

00:17:00.982 --> 00:17:02.440
LARS RYSSDAL: And
it picks up color

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.210
to create this
beautiful contrast

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.420
in the dish from this brilliant
red fish and some green

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.599
in the soup that is
hosting the fish.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:14.811
So it's a striking
contrast in color.

00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:16.810
JAMES SYHABOUT: And because
I'm blending it raw,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.410
I'm even chopping
this even finer

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.770
because I don't want to cook it.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.020
I'm just going to throw it
in, throw it in my blender,

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.953
throw my soup in,
puree it, and pass it.

00:17:23.953 --> 00:17:25.119
LARS RYSSDAL: So be careful.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:26.910
It sound like there'll
be a lot of throwing

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.110
going on here in a few minutes.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.714
JAMES SYHABOUT: Not literally.

00:17:31.714 --> 00:17:33.505
So while that's going,
I'll set this aside.

00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:39.560
LARS RYSSDAL: So gosh, you're
opening a new restaurant

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.930
tonight in San Francisco.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:42.990
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.031
LARS RYSSDAL: Did you
sweat before you came here?

00:17:45.031 --> 00:17:46.669
And now you're-- or are you--

00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:48.710
JAMES SYHABOUT: I've been
sweating five years ago

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.774
when I opened Commis.

00:17:50.774 --> 00:17:52.190
AUDIENCE: How long
did it take you

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.890
to plan opening up
that new restaurant?

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:59.010
JAMES SYHABOUT: You know,
the hunk of it at SF

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.665
was never, ever conceived.

00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:04.310
I was actually in
Thailand in September

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.975
when someone approached
me with an idea.

00:18:06.975 --> 00:18:08.350
I was like, yeah,
sure, whatever.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.016
You're dreaming.

00:18:09.016 --> 00:18:09.920
Whatever.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.580
So I got back in
October, and we sat down.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.230
And it was just like,
put some ink on paper.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.470
And I'm like, OK, off we go.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.470
And three months
later, we're opening

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.784
a restaurant in the Mission.

00:18:22.784 --> 00:18:23.575
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah?

00:18:23.575 --> 00:18:24.246
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:24.246 --> 00:18:25.080
AUDIENCE: Where is it?

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.555
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Valencia and 18th,

00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:28.767
right next door to Luna Park.

00:18:28.767 --> 00:18:30.350
I don't know much
about San Francisco.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.558
But everyone tells you it's
like the eye of the storm

00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:35.830
right now, as far as
demographics and things like

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.876
that.

00:18:36.876 --> 00:18:38.250
I grew up in
Oakland all my life.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.876
So it's--

00:18:39.876 --> 00:18:41.250
LARS RYSSDAL: So
you've only been

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.040
coming across the
bridge heading west

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.560
in the last couple
of months then.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.600
You've never gone across
the bridge before?

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.975
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Exactly, exactly.

00:18:48.975 --> 00:18:51.080
The first couple months,
I was getting frustrated

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.390
because I'm so spoiled having
ample parking in Oakland

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.030
and not getting tickets.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:01.490
And it was just like, oh,
this is no fun at all.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.630
But I got used to
it really fast.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.160
I had to.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.720
I didn't have a choice.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.490
So we want to cure our
salmon in the meantime.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.660
With curing salmon, we're
pretty much making gravlax.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.255
The way I cure salmon
is I still like

00:19:18.255 --> 00:19:23.450
to have it taste somewhat
itself, almost raw.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.040
I don't want to take it too
far where it's like gravlax,

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.500
and all you taste is salt
and sugar and spices.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.400
So I usually do, depending on
the thickness of the salmon,

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.680
just like a one-hour cure.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.550
I usually do two parts
salt to one part sugar.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.500
Sugar helps retain moisture.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.630
Salt draws moisture.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.482
So it kind of gives a pull.

00:19:44.482 --> 00:19:46.190
If it's just all salt,
it'd be all salty.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.854
And it would be dry.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.270
I'm just going to
eyeball it here.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.110
Feel free to be creative.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.030
That's the whole thing.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.230
Sometimes I would put
lemon zest in here,

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.895
black pepper, coriander.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.340
And in curing salmon,
I've seen techniques

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.012
where you pack it
with salt heavily.

00:20:09.012 --> 00:20:10.220
I just like a light sprinkle.

00:20:15.629 --> 00:20:17.420
As you're just heavily
seasoning something,

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.130
you don't have to dump it on.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.750
Usually I do it
with skin on salmon

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.610
only because it's much
more easy to slice.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.300
But we're just going
to work with this.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.692
And just let that sit in the
refrigerator for an hour or so.

00:20:30.692 --> 00:20:32.400
LARS RYSSDAL: Covered,
wrapped up tightly

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.025
in wax paper, plastic.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.334
JAMES SYHABOUT: Exactly.

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:36.625
LARS RYSSDAL: Any weight on it?

00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:37.280
Some people put weight--

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.571
JAMES SYHABOUT: No, just as is.

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.210
LARS RYSSDAL: --on fish to
help the curing process.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.245
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah, we
kind of want the salmon

00:20:42.245 --> 00:20:43.906
to be kind of unadulterated
in this state.

00:20:43.906 --> 00:20:44.680
LARS RYSSDAL: OK.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.760
And you're using king salmon
or Chinook salmon in this case?

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.290
JAMES SYHABOUT: We
usually use wild steelhead

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.230
when it's in season,
coming from Oregon or so.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.770
We try not to use farmed
salmon, only because the flavor

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.510
is-- to me, it's
nothing special.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.530
You can get it year round.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.650
But when salmon season-- like
local king salmon, we use.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.900
We use ivory salmon, which is
more ivory flesh from Alaska

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.900
that's really fantastic
and high in fat.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.470
But no, king salmon's just
as good, like farmed salmon.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.930
It's just fattier only
because it doesn't run wild.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.340
But I think the
most flavor comes

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:28.345
from like river,
sockeye wild salmon.

00:21:28.345 --> 00:21:30.170
I'll put this aside there.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.330
LARS RYSSDAL: And in
preparing the fish,

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.980
are you taking bones out along
the spine line of the fish?

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:37.697
Are you--

00:21:37.697 --> 00:21:38.530
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yes.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.580
I usually take the
pin bone of the fish.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.090
Or your fish market
will do it for you.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.760
But you can do it yourself.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.260
It depends.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.580
Like me-- we get salmon
that are 20 pounds.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.030
So it's a big piece.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.500
So the kohlrabi is
somewhat tender.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.490
Like I said, I might
add the leaves just so.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:01.252
I'm just bringing it back
to a boil just to scald.

00:22:01.252 --> 00:22:02.460
AUDIENCE: I can't really see.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.124
Is there still water left,
or did it all boil out?

00:22:05.124 --> 00:22:07.040
JAMES SYHABOUT: You can
adjust with more water

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.480
because the trick
is you want to get

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.880
the soup as thick as you can.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.210
And you can always adjust.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.550
It's harder to take it away.

00:22:19.516 --> 00:22:20.890
LARS RYSSDAL: So
the question was

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.360
about how much liquid
is still in the pan.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.570
And there is still
a ratio of, I'd say,

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:32.210
a third liquid to two
thirds of the kohlrabi.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:36.450
That liquid will need to be
in there to help emulsify

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.670
in the blender to
help create that soup.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.630
So it's not gone dry.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.110
It's not steamed dry.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:48.456
There's still liquid in
there, and you'll see it.

00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:51.840
JAMES SYHABOUT: There's a
trick with blending soups.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.985
I like to leave the blender
on for like five minutes,

00:22:54.985 --> 00:22:57.060
like a long, very long time.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.000
LARS RYSSDAL: And
would you say, when

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.280
you're furnishing your
home, is the first thing you

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.300
get a couch or a
Vitamix Vita-Prep 3?

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.592
JAMES SYHABOUT: That's
a good question.

00:23:09.592 --> 00:23:10.584
That's a good question.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.304
You see how green it is?

00:23:17.304 --> 00:23:19.512
You wouldn't get that if
you were to cook everything.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.270
Again, I'm adjusting
this recipe to kohlrabi.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.690
Kohlrabi, cabbage, things
like sauerkraut and things

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:37.730
like that.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.400
I like to add a little bit,
just a touch of sour cream

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.050
to kind of give it
some smoothness.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:48.130
It can also act as an
emulsifier as well.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.880
LARS RYSSDAL: Now if
Julia Child was here,

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.050
that would have been
a pound of butter.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.074
He's used about a
tablespoon of sour cream.

00:23:54.074 --> 00:23:55.490
JAMES SYHABOUT:
What does she say?

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.906
Moderation, but a
whole lot of it.

00:23:59.116 --> 00:24:00.140
Yeah.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.333
That was always a good one.

00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:04.257
I'll sort of just let it go.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.748
I won't go for five minutes.

00:24:14.748 --> 00:24:16.707
AUDIENCE: How long did
you boil the leaves for?

00:24:16.707 --> 00:24:19.040
JAMES SYHABOUT: Just throw
it in, bring it up, scald it,

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.330
and then that's it.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.980
LARS RYSSDAL: Just a kind
of a real hard blanch almost

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.250
to soften a little
bit, fix color, not let

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.760
the color fade in
too much cooking,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:39.080
and keep the green element
in flavor and in color

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.730
to the dish.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.730
And it's just beautiful.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.760
It looks like it's
plugged in right now.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.844
It's battery powered soup.

00:24:49.844 --> 00:24:51.260
JAMES SYHABOUT:
And then you would

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.926
want to chill it
immediately because you

00:24:52.926 --> 00:24:55.750
don't want to
overcook the leaves.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.350
It turns that army greenish
color and loses its freshness.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.710
LARS RYSSDAL: Pardon me.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.550
I'm going to take this
out of the way here.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:00.390
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Sorry about that.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.540
LARS RYSSDAL: So they can
see your hands and face.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.123
JAMES SYHABOUT: So
we've got our soup,

00:25:03.123 --> 00:25:05.060
and then we're going
to make dill oil.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.490
Herb oils in general,
grapeseed oil,

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.460
I usually do equal
parts by weight.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.330
We cook in metric
at the restaurants

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.430
only because it's more accurate.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.830
A cup of sugar or
a cup of flour,

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.280
it depends how much
you fill that cup.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.360
Or it could be how dry it is.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.000
But with weight, it doesn't lie.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:34.125
So with dill oil,
just lightly chop.

00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:36.000
Can we have somebody
grab me another chinois?

00:25:41.487 --> 00:25:42.320
I eat stems and all.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.100
It's fine.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.502
We'll save some for garnish.

00:25:46.502 --> 00:25:48.210
And dill oil is one
of those things where

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.030
it can be in your
pantry staple, like herb

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:55.050
oils, chili oils, basil oil.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:58.410
We usually have a library
of different oils.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:04.280
It's another way we
preserve seasons, actually.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.140
Like bay leaf flowers
from bay leaves.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.740
It comes maybe two
weeks in a year.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.310
The whole team,
like six of us, will

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:17.270
go out to the Oakland Hills,
grab bags of bay leaf flowers,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.814
pick them all, make oil
with it, dehydrate it.

00:26:19.814 --> 00:26:21.480
And we have it for
the rest of the year.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.550
Just kind of taking advantage
of our landscape, per se.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.050
Let's see.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.288
She's got a chinois for me?

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:30.913
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:30.913 --> 00:26:31.538
We'll grab one.

00:26:31.538 --> 00:26:33.030
JAMES SYHABOUT: OK.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.930
So it's pretty simple.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.980
Blanching locks in
the color of the dill

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:44.030
and also denatures the
filaments a little.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.040
It makes it more tender.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.072
So it gives it a
smoother puree as well.

00:26:48.072 --> 00:26:49.840
And I'm going to taste this.

00:26:53.975 --> 00:26:55.100
LARS RYSSDAL: Always taste.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.430
And clean spoons.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.414
JAMES SYHABOUT:
So this would be--

00:27:08.414 --> 00:27:09.830
it's a cold dish
because you don't

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.038
want the salmon to be cooked.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.810
And then can somebody
grab me the thing

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.726
of dill oil already made
up there at the top?

00:27:20.726 --> 00:27:21.350
The green bowl.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.590
So this is dill
oil that we made.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.395
We blanched the dill,
wring out all of the water

00:27:33.395 --> 00:27:37.180
as much as we can, which is
really important because you

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.080
don't want-- oil
and water don't mix.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:44.350
And water will actually
help oxidize the dill oil.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.870
And we let it sit,
and what happens--

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.500
we decanter it and pass
it through a cheesecloth.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.129
So it gets this vibrant green.

00:27:51.129 --> 00:27:52.170
You can pass that around.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.727
I have extra oil.

00:27:56.727 --> 00:27:57.661
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:57.661 --> 00:27:59.062
It's not infused.

00:27:59.062 --> 00:28:00.463
It's not dill-infused oil.

00:28:00.463 --> 00:28:01.400
It's--

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.510
JAMES SYHABOUT: It's
pretty much infused.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.061
Yeah.

00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:03.560
Yeah.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.680
Because we're getting
all the essential oils.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.554
LARS RYSSDAL: So the
question was, would this

00:28:07.554 --> 00:28:10.110
be-- the terminology
would be infused oil?

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:13.050
And yes, it would be
considered infused oil.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.890
But the other thing is if you're
making oils at home like this,

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.142
how long would you
recommend keeping those?

00:28:19.142 --> 00:28:21.100
JAMES SYHABOUT: If you
keep it in refrigeration

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.970
with no light, three months.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:31.150
LARS RYSSDAL: So you could
set up a large bottle of oil

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:34.170
and a set of infusions,
and keep them cool and dark

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.620
for a long period of time.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.620
And use a drop or two on
top of whatever it was you

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.420
were doing that would be
germane to that flavor

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.950
and enhance that flavor.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:43.090
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.490
It also freezes really well,
because oil doesn't freeze.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.460
But it keeps it from oxidizing.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.710
LARS RYSSDAL: So if you were
making then bloody marys,

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:53.560
and you wanted dill oil
ice cubes or oil ice cubes,

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.490
you could do that
too, that would

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.270
be fun on, well, every day.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.312
But yeah, no, every day.

00:28:59.312 --> 00:29:01.187
JAMES SYHABOUT: Could
I grab one of the-- can

00:29:01.187 --> 00:29:05.586
I have one of those
bowls for plating?

00:29:05.586 --> 00:29:06.107
Thank you.

00:29:06.107 --> 00:29:07.940
LARS RYSSDAL: And of
course, the full recipe

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.420
that James had submitted
to us is in the book.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.300
So although he eyeballed
the salt and sugar,

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.720
the measurements
are in the recipe

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.050
in the book for this dish.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.540
JAMES SYHABOUT: It's so funny.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.860
When I started cooking
Thai food again,

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.040
which I never thought
in my wildest dreams--

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.310
I kind of disowned my
heritage, just growing up.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:39.190
But it was just like I
was doing it all wrong.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.190
It's like a total
opposite discipline.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.920
Watching my mom
cook with her hands,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.510
just measuring, oh, a
handful of sugar, a handful

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.420
of this, a handful of that.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.510
But it actually
shows, like instinct.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.720
The reason why we measure things
is because in fine dining,

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.730
it's more of a science, per se.

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.400
And it's all about
ratios and whatnot.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.022
But with Thai cooking,
it's very instinctual.

00:30:03.022 --> 00:30:04.480
You don't want
ingredients to taste

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.974
like it's all bottled sauces.

00:30:06.974 --> 00:30:08.140
It's like a little mixology.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.348
It's like a little bit of
this, a little bit of that.

00:30:10.348 --> 00:30:12.290
Everyone makes their
sauces totally different.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.090
That's where I kind
of-- where I'm at.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.070
I'm coming to learn.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.950
Sometimes you kind of get
too geeked out on food.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:24.120
And it takes-- I think the
soul gets removed from it.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.940
And there's nothing wrong with
having instinct and owning it.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.950
Anyone can read-- anyone can
follow a recipe with a scale.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:36.860
But I think it's all about
making that dish your own.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:42.700
So don't ever be afraid to
throw in your own ideas,

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.940
leave some things out
that you don't like, add

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.760
something in that you do like.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.260
Trust me.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.990
We have many failures at Commis.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.780
There's some dishes, I'm
like, ew, it's gross.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.250
It's great ideas on paper.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.110
LARS RYSSDAL: Yeah.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.200
It's just a churn.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.610
When we make ice cream at
home, and it doesn't work,

00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:59.540
it goes away.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.430
And we say, it's just a churn.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.000
If you don't like what you've
cooked, it's just a dish.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.280
Start over and learn from it.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.637
JAMES SYHABOUT: One of my pastry
chefs-- for New Year's Eve

00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:11.970
at Commis, I let all my-- I
don't write the menu at all.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.660
I'm totally hands off.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.590
And all my chefs write the menus
and their names on the dish.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.700
And one of the dishes
was-- the pastry chef

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.741
wanted to do coffee and
cigarettes for New Year's

00:31:21.741 --> 00:31:23.770
Eve at the end of the meal.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.440
So I think it was like chocolate
ganache and tobacco ice cream.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.360
It was disgusting.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.844
It was gross.

00:31:30.844 --> 00:31:32.760
LARS RYSSDAL: Hopefully
it was after midnight,

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.924
and no one cared.

00:31:33.924 --> 00:31:35.340
JAMES SYHABOUT:
But we figured out

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.700
the way-- it was
too much nicotine.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.990
He used cigarettes
instead of cigars.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.982
So we found a nice Cuban cigar.

00:31:42.982 --> 00:31:44.440
The dish actually
went on the menu.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.310
It just needed some finessing.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:50.070
I blanched out the
nicotine a couple of times.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.060
So like I said, it's
collaboration work.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.110
It starts with the idea.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.820
And then we keep working
on the idea to-- nothing

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.920
gets lost or gets thrown out.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.234
It kind of gets filed for
revisiting until it's-- until

00:32:03.234 --> 00:32:04.400
we can't figure out anymore.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.274
It's like, all right.

00:32:05.274 --> 00:32:08.570
LARS RYSSDAL: So buddy,
in the interest of time,

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:10.410
we'll have some questions.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.415
And let's-- if we
can dish this up.

00:32:12.415 --> 00:32:13.790
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Yes, let's do it.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:17.420
LARS RYSSDAL: And take
questions and get you guys fed.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.300
Yay.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.590
And learn more about
what's on your mind

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.060
after this discussion.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.726
JAMES SYHABOUT: Did
that taste all good?

00:32:25.726 --> 00:32:26.651
I didn't taste it.

00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:27.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.955
I'm wondering how the
San Francisco Hawker

00:32:30.955 --> 00:32:34.230
Fare is going to be different
from the Oakland Hawker Fare?

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.390
JAMES SYHABOUT: We have
a much larger kitchen.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:40.830
We went under kind
of more rebranding.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.870
And there's a lot more
curries and soups, a lot more

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.354
chili dips.

00:32:46.354 --> 00:32:47.770
The ambiance is
totally different.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.390
So it's kind of
Hawker Fare grew up.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:50.973
The original Hawker
Fare had graffiti,

00:32:50.973 --> 00:32:52.190
and I got rid of that.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.087
So it looks like more
of a night market now.

00:32:54.087 --> 00:32:55.545
AUDIENCE: So it's
a different menu?

00:32:55.545 --> 00:32:55.990
JAMES SYHABOUT: Hmm?

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.770
AUDIENCE: It's a
slightly different menu?

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.430
JAMES SYHABOUT:
It's the same menu

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.840
plus a bunch of other
different items.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.730
My chef de cuisine there
is originally from Bangkok.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:09.940
So he comes from a
different point of reference

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.500
as far as Thai food.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.690
I'm from the east, from
Ubon, close to Laos.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:16.340
So it's a much drier climate.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.370
Everything's more funky.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.750
Everything's spicier.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.740
So me and him always butt heads.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.390
So that's why the Hawker
Fare in San Francisco,

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.100
we have a Thai style
som tam, and we also

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.240
have a Lao style som tam.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.390
One's more sweet with
peanuts and dried shrimp.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:34.890
The other one's sour
and funky with shards

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.900
of salted crab in it.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:38.552
Yeah.

00:33:38.552 --> 00:33:40.260
AUDIENCE: So it sounds
like you're really

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.050
spread thinly with
so many places

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.960
you're working on right now.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.480
How do you-- what's
your role in each place?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.767
That's the first
part of the question.

00:33:51.767 --> 00:33:52.600
Do you just oversee?

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.330
Do you come and try?

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:55.970
And then where is home for you?

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.050
Which place do you go to
and actually cook and enjoy

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.210
and create?

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.177
LARS RYSSDAL: That's a
really good question.

00:34:03.177 --> 00:34:04.760
JAMES SYHABOUT: It
depends on my mood.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.740
It depends where
I'm out of touch.

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:13.610
But my role overall is I'm kind
of hoping, holding hands, kind

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.020
of guiding them through
all the concepts and kind

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:21.150
of pushing them to do
research for new dishes.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.860
I took my chef from
Hawker Fare, Oakland

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:28.389
to Thailand for a month, and
that's all we did was eat out.

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:30.909
So I'm more of a
facilitator for them.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:35.070
I kind of come up
with the ideas,

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.080
help put systems in place.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.710
And I just hold their hands.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:42.600
And for me, where's home for me?

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.100
It depends on my mood.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.340
Some days, I just want to
wear jeans and sneakers

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:50.739
and a t-shirt, and go mortar
and pestle some papaya salad.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.280
And some days, I
want to put tweezers

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.550
out and put on a
starched chef's coat

00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.064
and get geeked out on using
a scale and liquid nitrogen.

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:02.540
So I go through modes.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.725
I think I'm very fortunate
I have those outlets, which

00:35:06.725 --> 00:35:08.850
is very helpful because
when I'm at one restaurant,

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.140
I'm actually looking
at the other restaurant

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.611
from the outside point of view.

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.110
Sometimes I'm at
Commis, I'm working

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:19.590
on dishes for Hawker Fare, and
I will serve it as a staff meal,

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.820
get feedback from them.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:22.822
But yeah.

00:35:22.822 --> 00:35:24.780
I mean, I would love to
be at Commis every day.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.940
It's kind of my sanctuary.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.274
You have to use all white.

00:35:27.274 --> 00:35:27.940
There's not art.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.160
I can think clear.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.270
Everything's very calm.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:38.450
Everything's very-- there's no
surprises, per se, at Commis.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:41.424
At Hawker Fare, there's
always an element of surprise.

00:35:41.424 --> 00:35:42.215
It gets fast-paced.

00:35:42.215 --> 00:35:44.070
It gets bustling.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.800
But sometimes,
you need that too.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.180
Just get the--
awake your senses.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.000
Get the pulse going.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.630
So I'm very, very
fortunate I have

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.252
those two different
outlets to run to.

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:54.960
LARS RYSSDAL: OK.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.560
And a question here?

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.470
AUDIENCE: Hi, Seth.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.060
So I live right around the
corner from Box and Bells.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.445
Unfortunately, it's closed.

00:36:01.445 --> 00:36:03.070
I was curious, what
do you think didn't

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.856
work about that restaurant?

00:36:04.856 --> 00:36:05.980
I thought it was wonderful.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.290
But obviously, it
didn't seem to connect.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.002
JAMES SYHABOUT:
Sometimes, as a chef,

00:36:10.002 --> 00:36:11.710
you're really passionate
about something.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.900
And you kind of want to
just stick to your guns.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.605
And I really wanted
a place where

00:36:16.605 --> 00:36:19.670
it was a very meat-centric
place, hopeful.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.690
Our opening menu was awesome,
but it was not for everyone.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:27.365
There was blood pudding poutine
on there and rib eye for two

00:36:27.365 --> 00:36:30.820
with snails, choucroute garnie.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.410
We made our own sausages.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.190
I was awesome.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.970
It was either people
who love it or hated it.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:41.750
It depends on the neighborhood
and the financial model too.

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.250
With being Rockridge,
you need to be

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.540
more in the middle,
what I've found.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.440
And that's something I
couldn't get myself to do.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.740
And I just-- I want to stand
behind the food I cook.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.240
And I think, same
for the cooks too.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.239
I'm like, well, are we
excited about doing this,

00:36:56.239 --> 00:36:58.470
or-- yes, we're in hospitality.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.670
We want to click.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:03.810
But when we're slaving behind
the stove for 16 hour days,

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.300
let's make ourselves happy here.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:05.800
Come on.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.530
Let's not lie to ourselves.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:13.610
So unfortunate, but time
and place for everything.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:15.860
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
favorite restaurant in Oakland

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.270
that's not yours?

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.450
JAMES SYHABOUT: I like
to go to order pizza,

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.850
like Charlie Hallowell's
places, like Boot and Shoe

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:24.240
Service and Pizzaiolo.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.460
I love going to those places.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.834
My kids-- I have
a three-year-old

00:37:26.834 --> 00:37:28.730
and an 18-month-old.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:32.050
So it's like our staple, go-to.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.230
It's just fantastic.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.830
It's easygoing.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.860
It's just delicious
home-cooked meals.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.990
It's very representative
of a home cooked feel it

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:45.000
in that genre of Chez
Panisse and whatnot.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.500
LARS RYSSDAL: Let's
finish the dish.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.730
And then we can--
Victoria can get

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.867
the books for people
for you to sign.

00:37:52.867 --> 00:37:53.950
JAMES SYHABOUT: One thing.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.080
After it's cured,
you can rinse it.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:56.660
Cold water.

00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:01.925
LARS RYSSDAL: So the
sugar and the salt

00:38:01.925 --> 00:38:07.180
have been sort of cooking
the fish a little bit.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.800
And now to let the-- as James
was talking about earlier,

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.620
he wanted the flavor of
the fish to rule this, not

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.170
the flavor of salt and sugar.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.670
JAMES SYHABOUT:
What we do at Commis

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.890
is we remove the
fat from the salmon

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.840
only because it
makes it too fishy.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.820
LARS RYSSDAL: So that's
the skin side of the--

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.450
JAMES SYHABOUT: The
skin side, yeah.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.991
LARS RYSSDAL: The skin side of
the fish that you're trimming,

00:38:28.991 --> 00:38:31.330
the part that was
next to the skin.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.384
Clean the fish up a little bit.

00:38:34.384 --> 00:38:36.050
JAMES SYHABOUT: And
the loin is actually

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.580
going to be a lot leaner
than the belly piece.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.420
So kind of pick and
choose what you like.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.675
Just small bite sized pieces.

00:38:42.675 --> 00:38:44.132
I'm going to do two pieces.

00:38:44.132 --> 00:38:45.590
LARS RYSSDAL: About
one inch cubes,

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.260
something like
that, it looks like.

00:38:51.269 --> 00:38:53.810
JAMES SYHABOUT: So I usually
put a little bit of a finishing,

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:54.768
like a coarse sea salt.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.640
A little bit of dill oil.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.810
And then usually-- we
have micro greens today,

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:08.395
but usually it's
all kinds of herbs.

00:39:08.395 --> 00:39:10.830
Herbs right now that
we find in the hills--

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:16.350
it could be chickweed, grown
elder, yarrow, New Zealand

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:19.720
spinach, tetragon.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.980
So it could be sometimes
up to 30 different herbs

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.650
that we just picked.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.985
And sometimes we buy
too from a farmer

00:39:28.985 --> 00:39:34.266
in Sebastopol for anise
hyssop and things like that.

00:39:34.266 --> 00:39:36.370
But these are kind of
like-- I like licorice,

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:42.480
so I always tend to go for more
licorice flavor herbs, which

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.005
wasn't the case
when I was younger,

00:39:44.005 --> 00:39:46.140
because you kind of grow up.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:50.320
You can put some dill
in there as well.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.110
I always serve it
in a nice cold bowl.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:57.100
It's very refreshing.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.959
And I would even pair this with
like a dry Riesling at work.

00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:02.500
LARS RYSSDAL: Dry
Riesling with that?

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.320
Fantastic.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.195
JAMES SYHABOUT: Yeah.

00:40:04.195 --> 00:40:06.330
So it's kind of like
really, really simple.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: So one
more time-- thanks,

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.231
everyone, for coming today.

00:40:09.231 --> 00:40:10.230
LARS RYSSDAL: Thank you.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:15.188
[APPLAUSE]
