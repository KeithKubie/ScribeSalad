00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.569
The Paperclip Controversy

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:06.590
The paperclip is today a ubiquitous item in
offices and homes the world over.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.309
So who invented it?

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.700
One very popular false origin of the paperclip
was that it was invented by Norwegian patent

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.059
office manager, Johan Vaaler.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.439
He was even granted patents in Germany and
the U.S. for a paperclip of similar design

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.779
as the Gem style paperclip, which is the most
commonly used paperclip today.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.109
However, Vaaler’s paperclip came after the
Gem paperclip was already popular throughout

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.109
Europe.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.701
His design was slightly different than the
Gem paperclip in that it didn’t include

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:37.130
the all too critical second loop that makes
the Gem style much more functional.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.390
His paperclip had the papers inserted by lifting
the outer wire slightly and pushing the papers

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.790
into the clip such that the rest of the clip
stood out from the paper at a 90 degree angle,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.960
which was necessary because of the lack of
the critical second loop to allow the papers

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.110
to be more or less embedded in the clip flatly.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.640
This also made it so the papers wouldn’t
be held together very well as they relied

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.940
only on how bendable the wire used was to
hold the papers.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.570
The Gem style paperclip, on the other hand,
exploits the torsion principle to help bind

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.620
papers together.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.340
Vaaler’s design was never manufactured or
sold and his patents eventually expired.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.630
Why Vaaler gets the credit in so many places,
including in many encyclopedias and dictionaries

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.230
after the 1950s, is largely thanks to a patent
agency worker who was visiting Germany to

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.400
register Norwegian patents in the 1920s.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.440
When he was doing so, he noticed Vaaler’s
design for the paperclip and wrote an article

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.330
stating Vaaler was the original creator of
the paperclip.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.320
This misinformation found its way into encyclopedias
around the 1950s thanks to WWII.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.659
During WWII in Norway particularly, along
with France and some other occupied countries,

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.850
the paperclip became a symbol of unity for
those rebelling against the Germans.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.320
It is not thought that the Norwegians did
this because they thought a Norwegian had

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.930
invented the paperclip, but rather because
it simply signified being bound together and

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.790
was useful as it wasn’t initially a banned
symbol or item by the Germans and could be

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.780
easily clipped to one’s clothing.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.720
Eventually, the Germans caught on and people
were prohibited from wearing paperclips.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.260
After the war, the fact that the Gem style
paperclip had served as a symbol of unity

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.390
resulted in interest in the origin of the
paperclip, at which point the article written

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.769
by the patent agency worker and the subsequent
patent by Vaaler, who was now long dead, was

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.769
discovered.

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.529
It was overlooked, of course, that his design
was different than the Gem style paperclip

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.139
and apparently they didn’t bother checking
that the Gem style paperclip had already been

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.680
around by the time Vaaler patented his version
of the paperclip.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.659
It made a good story though, particularly
after the war and how the paperclip was used

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.299
in Norway among other places, and so this
false origin subsequently found its way into

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.969
many encyclopedias.

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:48.169
The myth is so popular, in fact, that a Gem
style, 23 foot tall paperclip was placed near

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:53.870
a university in Oslo in 1989 to honor Vaaler,
who in fact had nothing to do with the Gem

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.419
style paperclip design.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:00.280
Further, a commemorative stamp was created
honoring Vaaler that also depicted the Gem

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.180
style paperclip, not Vaaler’s design.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.510
Another false origin of the modern day paperclip
often attributes it to Herbert Spencer, who

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.540
was the man who came up with the term “survival
of the fittest”.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.560
He claims in his autobiography that he invented
a pin that bound papers together.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.389
This led to the false belief that he invented
the paperclip.

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.529
In fact, though, his drawing of his binding
pin looked more like a cotter pin and, thus,

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.189
held papers together more like Vaaler’s
design.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.499
Unlike Vaaler’s design though, this cotter
pin style clip wouldn’t stick out nearly

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.290
as much and, thus, was a bit more functional.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.269
So who really invented the paperclip as we
know it today?

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.189
It is thought to have first been made by the
Gem Manufacturing Company in Britain around

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.939
the 1870s and later introduced to the United
States around the 1890s.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.390
This is also why the Swedish word for paperclip
is “gem”.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:04:02.319
As for who within that company invented it,
this isn’t known, as it was never patented.
