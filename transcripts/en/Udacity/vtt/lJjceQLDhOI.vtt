[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.990
I wonder where Walter is.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.530
It's taking him a really
long time to get back.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.369
&gt;&gt; Whoa, are you okay?

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.270
&gt;&gt; I'll be okay.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.720
&gt;&gt; Walter, what happened to you?

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.000
&gt;&gt; Well,
after my normal wrist workout routine,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.430
I was trying to organize my
shopping list for the big benefit.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.170
But now that we've got about 20 users,
it's been much harder to find my lists.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.737
I just had to keep scrolling and
scrolling and scrolling.

00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:33.150
&gt;&gt; It's okay.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.490
Let it out.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.840
&gt;&gt; Well, then a bunch of users who
didn't even have anything to do with

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.120
the benefits started
adding a bunch of items.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.610
Maybe they were confused.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.000
Or maybe they were bored and
just trying to find someone to torment.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.030
In any case,
I had to delete each item one by one.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.930
Then I had to go in and
manually add 50 items.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.960
My wrists started hurting and
I typed through the pain.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.560
&gt;&gt; My gosh.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.350
What is wrong with you?

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.583
Can't you see he's in pain?

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:05.860
We can't celebrate.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.300
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry Walter.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.270
This actually is sounding like
something we have to add.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.837
A way for
users to kind of limit who can see and

00:01:13.837 --> 00:01:15.998
edit items on their shopping lists.

00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:18.665
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and some sort of sorting
functionality might not be a bad

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:19.280
idea either.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.030
&gt;&gt; Well, with Firebase queries, we
could tackle the sorting functionality.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.080
Sharing might be a bit more difficult.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.300
We'd have to think about designing
the database as the user base grows.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.020
We could look at that in version 0.4.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds like a great idea.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.040
I'll get looking at that right now.
