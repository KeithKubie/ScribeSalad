00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.170
Let's see if we can use our
existing factoring skills

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.350
to factor 30x squared
plus 11xy plus y squared.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.170
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.219
and see if you can
handle it yourself.

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.760
Now, the first hint
I will give you--

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.970
and this might open up
what's going on here--

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.650
is to maybe rearrange
this a little bit.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.340
We could rewrite
this as y squared

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.430
plus 11xy plus 30x squared.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.850
And my whole
motivation for doing

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.670
that-- there are ways to
factor a quadratic where

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.350
your first coefficient, your
coefficient on this first term,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.940
is something other than 1.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.210
But we haven't seen that yet.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.844
And so rearranging it this way,
this got us a little bit more

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:43.760
into our comfort zone.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.350
Now our coefficient is a
1 on the y squared term.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.080
So now we can start to think
of this in the same form

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.590
that we've looked at some of
the other factoring problems.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.760
Can we think of two numbers
whose product is 30x squared

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.019
and whose sum is 11x?

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.420
Notice, 11x is the
coefficient on y.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.390
We have y squared,
some coefficient on y.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.610
And then in terms
of y, this isn't

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.920
in any way dependent on y.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.930
So one way to think about this,
if you knew what x was, then

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.220
this would be a
quadratic in terms of y.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.440
And that's how we're really
thinking about it here.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.570
So can we find two
numbers whose product

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.590
is 30x squared and two
numbers whose sum is

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.120
the coefficient on this y term
right here, whose sum is 11x?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.160
So let's just think about all
of the different possibilities.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.290
If we were just thinking
about two numbers

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.680
whose product was 30
and whose sum was 11,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.660
we would be thinking of 5 and 6.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.180
5 times 6 is 30.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.157
5 plus 6 is 11.

00:01:46.157 --> 00:01:47.240
It's some trial and error.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.590
You could have tried 3 and 10.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.510
Well, that would have been--
13 would be their sum.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.780
You could have tried 2 and 15.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.560
That wouldn't have worked.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.360
But 5 and 6 does work
here, so we've already

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.950
seen that multiple times.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.810
So 5 and 6 would work for
30, but we have 30x squared.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.400
So what if we have 5x and 6x?

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.260
Well, 5x times 6x is 30x
squared, and 5x plus 6x is 11x.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.130
So this actually works.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.120
So then our factoring
or our factorization

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.760
of this expression
is just going to be

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.260
y plus 5x times y plus 6x.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.460
And I'll leave it up to you to
verify that this does indeed,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.010
when you multiply it
out, equal this up here.
