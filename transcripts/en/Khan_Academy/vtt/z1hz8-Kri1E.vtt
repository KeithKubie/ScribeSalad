00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.620
An electronics warehouse ships
televisions and DVD players in

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.640
certain combinations
to retailers

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.310
throughout the country.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.660
They tell us that the weight
of 3 televisions and 5 DVD

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.160
players is 62.5 pounds, and the
weight of 3 televisions

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.040
and 2 DVD players-- so they're
giving us different

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.940
combinations-- is 52 pounds.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.200
Create a system of
equations that

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.810
represents this situation.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.770
Then solve it to find out how
much each television and DVD

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.990
player weighs.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.280
Well, the two pieces of
information they gave us in

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.760
each of these statements can be
converted into an equation.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.280
The first one is is that the
weight of 3 televisions and 5

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.780
DVD players is 62.5 pounds.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.550
Then they told us that the
weight of 3 televisions and 2

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.790
DVD players is 52 pounds.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.670
So we can translate these
directly into equations.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.810
If we let t to be the weight of
a television, and d to be

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.910
the weight of a DVD player, this
first statement up here

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.090
says that 3 times the weight
of a television, or 3

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.860
televisions, plus 5 times the
weight of a DVD player, is

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.430
going to be equal
to 62.5 pounds.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.380
That's exactly what this first
statement is telling us.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.390
The second statement, the weight
of 3 televisions and 2

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.520
DVD players, so if I have 3
televisions and 2 DVD players,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.300
so the weight of 3 televisions
plus the weight of 2 DVD

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.920
players, they're telling us
that that is 52 pounds.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.180
And so now we've set up the
system of equations.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.080
We've done the first part,
to create a system that

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.420
represents the situation.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.070
Now we need to solve it.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800
Now, one thing that's especially
tempting when you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.560
have two systems, and both of
them have something where, you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.510
know, you have a 3t here and
you have a 3t here, what we

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.400
can do is we can multiply one of
the systems by some factor,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.910
so that if we were to add this
equation to that equation, we

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.770
would get one of the terms
to cancel out.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.340
And that's what we're going
to do right here.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.750
And you can do this, you can
do this business of adding

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.530
equations to each other, because
remember, when we

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.870
learned this at the beginning of
algebra, anything you do to

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.030
one side of an equation, if
I add 5 to one side of an

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.970
equation, I have to add 5 to
another side of the equation.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.890
So if I add this business to
this side of the equation, if

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.890
I add this blue stuff to the
left side of the equation, I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.320
can add this 52 to the
right-hand side, because this

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.730
is saying that 52 is the same
thing as this thing over here.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.840
This thing is also 52.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.150
So if we're adding this to the
left-hand side, we're actually

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.220
adding 52 to it.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.120
We're just writing it
a different way.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.150
Now, before we do that, what I
want to do is multiply the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.590
second, blue equation
by negative 1.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.100
And I want to multiply
it by negative 1.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.540
So negative 3t plus-- I could
write negative 2d is equal to

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.390
negative 52.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.360
So I haven't changed the
information in this equation.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.890
I just multiplied everything
by negative 1.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.090
The reason why I did that is
because now if I add these two

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.380
equations, these 3t terms
are going to cancel out.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.470
So let's do that.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.790
Let's add these two equations.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.170
And remember, all we're doing is
we're adding the same thing

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.110
to both sides of this
top equation.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.700
We're adding essentially
negative 52 now, now that

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.660
we've multiplied everything
by a negative 1.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.330
This negative 3t plus negative
2d is the same thing as

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.680
negative 52.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.690
So let's add this left-hand
side over here.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.410
The 3t and the negative
3t will cancel out.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.660
That was the whole point.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.940
5d plus negative 2d is 3d.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.340
So you have a 3d is equal to
62.5 plus negative 52, or 62.5

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.810
minus 52 is 10.5.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.445
And now we can divide both sides
of this equation by 3.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.940
And you get d is equal
to 10.5 divided by 3.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.670
So let's figure out
what that is.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.110
3 goes into 10.5-- it goes
into 10 three times.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.450
3 times 3 is 9.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.940
Subtract.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.650
Get 1.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.520
Bring down the 5.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.510
Of course, you have your decimal
point right here.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.010
3 goes into 15 five times.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.450
5 times 3 is 15.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.190
You've got to subtract,
and you get a 0.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.490
So it goes exactly 3.5 times.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.590
So the weight of a DVD player--
that's what d

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.570
represents-- is 3.5 pounds.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.300
Now we can substitute back into
one of these equations up

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.399
here to figure out the weight
of a television.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.520
We can just use that
top equation.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.790
So you get 3t plus 5 times the
weight of a DVD player, which

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.010
we just figured out is 3.5.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.420
Remember, we're just looking for
values that satisfy both

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.600
of these equations.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.920
So 5 times 3.5-- needs
to be equal to 62.5.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.380
So you get 3t plus-- what
is this going to be?

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.850
This is going to be 15
plus 2.5, right?

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.850
5 times 0.5 is 2.5,
5 times 3 is 15.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.610
So it's 17.5, is
equal to 62.5.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.815
Now we can subtract 17.5 from
both sides of this equation.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.520
And what do we get?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.960
The left-hand side is
just going to be 3t.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.690
This cancels out, that was
the whole point of it.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.240
3t is going to be equal
to-- let's see.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.060
The 0.5 minus 0.5,
that cancels out.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.830
So this is the same thing
as 62 minus 17.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.050
62 minus 7 would be 55.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.770
And so we're going to
subtract another 10.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.830
So it's going to be 45.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.980
So this is going to
be equal to 45.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.960
Now you can divide both sides
of this equation by 3.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.250
And we get t is equal to 15.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.580
So we've solved our system.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.070
The weight of a DVD player is
3.5 pounds, and the weight of

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.060
a television is 15 pounds.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.630
And we're done.
