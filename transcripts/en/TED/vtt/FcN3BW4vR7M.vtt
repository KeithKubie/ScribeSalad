00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:15.825
At age four, I found a garden,

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.249
living underneath the kitchen floor.

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:22.252
It was hiding behind
leftover patches of linoleum

00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:25.533
on the worn-out floor
my mother was having removed.

00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:29.347
The workman was busy
when the garden caught my attention.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.370
My eyes became glued to the patterns
of embroidered roses

00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:37.793
blooming across my childhood landscape.

00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:42.461
I saw them and felt
a sense of joy and adventure.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:46.574
This excitement felt like
a feeling to go forward

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:49.266
into something I knew nothing about.

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:54.855
My passion and connection to garden
started at that exact moment.

00:00:55.427 --> 00:00:58.395
When spring arrived,
I ran so fast through the house,

00:00:58.419 --> 00:01:00.156
speeding ahead of my mother's voice.

00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:05.355
I pulled on my red corduroy jumper
and my grey plaid wool hat

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.569
before my mother could get her jacket on.

00:01:07.982 --> 00:01:10.877
I catapulted out of the front screen door

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:14.055
and threw myself
on a fresh carpet of grass.

00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:18.998
Excited, I bounced to my feet
and flipped three more cartwheels

00:01:19.022 --> 00:01:20.822
before landing by her side.

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:23.876
Mother dear was in the garden

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.871
busy breaking up the soil,

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:29.037
and I sat beside her,

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.641
playing with mud pies in the flower bed.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.839
When her work was done,

00:01:34.863 --> 00:01:39.235
she rewarded me with an ice-cold glass
of bittersweet lemonade

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:43.046
and then lined my shoes
with sprigs of mint

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.403
to cool off my feet.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.895
My mother cooked with the colors
and textures of her garden.

00:01:50.538 --> 00:01:54.314
She baked yams and squash

00:01:54.338 --> 00:01:57.133
and heirloom tomatoes and carrots.

00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:02.164
She fed love to a generation of people

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:06.218
with purple hull peas and greens.

00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:09.720
It seems that during my childhood,

00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:14.522
the blooms from my mother's gardens
have healed all the way from her halo

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:17.079
to the roots on the soles of our feet.

00:02:18.427 --> 00:02:21.680
In our last conversation before her death,

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:25.053
she encouraged me to go
anywhere in the world

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:26.743
that would make me happy.

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:32.597
Since then, I have planted her gardens

00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.153
through art installations
throughout the world,

00:02:35.177 --> 00:02:37.710
in countries of the people that I meet.

00:02:38.386 --> 00:02:42.537
Now they are lining
parks and courtyards,

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:46.438
painted on walls and even
in blighted lots off the street.

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.608
If you were in Berlin, Germany,

00:02:49.632 --> 00:02:53.051
you would have seen my garden
at Stilwerk Design Center,

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:58.481
where rosemary and lavender,
hydrangea and lemon balm

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.839
trailed up the glass elevators
to all six floors.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.402
In 2009, I planted "Philosophers Garden,"

00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:08.624
a garden mural,

00:03:08.648 --> 00:03:11.931
blooming at the historic
Frederick Douglass High School

00:03:11.955 --> 00:03:13.364
in Memphis, Tennessee.

00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:17.640
This schoolâ€™s garden
fed an entire community

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:21.169
and was honored by Eleanor Roosevelt
during the Great Depression.

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:28.051
Again, in 2011, I planted
at Court Square Park --

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.560
six entry gardens

00:03:30.584 --> 00:03:35.176
with 80 varieties
of deliciously fragrant floribunda

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.171
and hybrid tea roses.

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:43.974
Gardening has taught me
that planting and growing a garden

00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:47.347
is the same process as creating our lives.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.878
This process of creation
begins in the spring,

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.702
when you break up the soil and start anew.

00:03:54.764 --> 00:03:58.809
Then it's time to clear out
the dead leaves,

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:01.253
debris and roots of the winter.

00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:04.569
The gardener must then make sure

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.505
that a good disposition
and the proper nutrients

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:11.515
are correctly mixed in the soil.

00:04:12.713 --> 00:04:16.959
Then it's important to aerate the topsoil

00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:19.359
and leave it loosely packed
on the surface.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.204
You won't get those
beautiful blooms in life

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:25.536
until you first do the work just right.

00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:29.172
When our gardens are balanced with care,

00:04:29.196 --> 00:04:33.005
we can harvest the beauty
of living a life of grace.

00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:36.293
In the forests,

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:40.529
when trees realize through their roots
that another tree is sick,

00:04:41.277 --> 00:04:44.006
they will send a portion
of their nutrients to that tree

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.430
to help them to heal.

00:04:46.188 --> 00:04:48.664
They never think
about what will happen to them

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.652
or feel vulnerable when they do.

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:52.895
When a tree is dying,

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.001
it releases all of its nutrients
to other trees that need it the most.

00:04:59.163 --> 00:05:02.527
Below the surface,
we are all connected by our roots

00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:05.085
and sharing nutrients with each other.

00:05:05.758 --> 00:05:09.677
It's only when we come together
that we can honestly grow.

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:15.943
It's the same for humans
in the garden of hardship.

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:18.126
In this garden,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.417
when the caterpillar transforms
into a chrysalis,

00:05:22.518 --> 00:05:24.343
this involves some struggle.

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:26.255
But it's a challenge with a purpose.

00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:28.851
Without this painful fight

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:32.053
to break free from
the confines of the cocoon,

00:05:32.077 --> 00:05:35.601
the newly formed butterfly
can't strengthen its wings.

00:05:36.228 --> 00:05:40.592
Without the battle, the butterfly dies
without ever taking flight.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:43.675
My life's work

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:50.295
is to illustrate how to integrate
human connectivity into the garden.

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:56.585
Gardens are full of magical wisdom
for this transformation.

00:05:57.817 --> 00:06:01.528
Mother Nature is creative energy
waiting to be born.

00:06:03.084 --> 00:06:04.695
Gardens are a mirror

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.319
that cast their own reflection
into our waking lives.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.712
So nurture your talents and strengths

00:06:11.736 --> 00:06:14.323
while you appreciate
all you've been given.

00:06:15.331 --> 00:06:17.204
Remain humble to healing.

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:20.141
And maintain compassion for others.

00:06:22.092 --> 00:06:24.862
Cultivate your garden for giving

00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:27.011
and plant those seeds for the future.

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:32.322
The garden is the world
living deep inside of you.

00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:34.577
Thank you.

00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:35.752
(Applause)

00:06:35.776 --> 00:06:36.958
(Cheers)

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:39.626
(Applause)
