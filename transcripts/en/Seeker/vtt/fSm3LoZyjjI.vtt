00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.360
Rockets of the future might look like rockets
of the past… but they could also be super

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.530
sleek amazing futuristic single-stage jet
planes.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.890
You know?

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.250
It depends.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.920
Hey fabulous flyers Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.250
Rockets are essentially the same today as
in the 1960s.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.160
They use better computers, lighter materials
and more advanced fuels, but they're still

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.580
burning massive amounts of fuel to get a payload
into orbit (or further).

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.500
But all that aside, what would a rocket of
the future look like?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.650
Kind of like planes and missiles of today.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.770
By their nature, it's the job of a rocket
to generate enough thrust to leave Earth's

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.770
orbit.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.630
The escape velocity is upwards of 25,000mph
(11km/s).

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.570
That requires a lot of fuel for missile-like
systems, and somewhat less fuel for space

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.600
planes, but it sort of depends on the job
they need to DO.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.940
For example, NASA wants to go to asteroids
and Mars.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.649
They went to the moon with Saturn Five, so…
let's copy and improve on that!

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.190
Enter, the SLS, or Space Launch System.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.189
NASA took what they learned from Saturn launches,
and from the Space Shuttle, and built on them.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.950
The design isn't super sexy because it's built
on these "proven" (read: old) technologies.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.229
The Solid Rocket Boosters are improved versions
of those from the shuttle program.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.130
Same fuel, almost twice as tall, but basically
the same.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.399
And the main stage is powered by RS-25 engines,
also, the same as used on the shuttle!

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.670
They're doing this, because they know it works.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.310
If it works as planned, it will have more
thrust than a Saturn V and will one day send

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.920
humans to our neighbor planet!

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.920
Yay!

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.619
But not everyone needs to go to Mars…

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.111
So some companies are using airplane technology
to get high-enough into the air, and then

00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:44.259
switching to a rocket engine to enter space
and drop off a satellite or, maybe, humans.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.329
Jet engines need oxygen to combust fuel and
generate thrust, and space doesn't work that

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.329
way.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.889
So, a British company called Reaction Engines
Limited has been working on a space-plane

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:59.659
hybrid for more than 30 years, called Skylon
that works both IN and OUT of the atmosphere.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.099
They created the Synergetic Air-Breathing
Rocket Engines (SABRE) to burn oxygen in the

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.590
atmosphere (when available), mixing it with
onboard liquid hydrogen to go five times the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.040
speed of sound.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.209
Once it's too high to use the available oxygen,
the Skylon uses the same engines but adds

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.010
onboard liquid oxygen, mixing THAT with the
hydrogen!!

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.180
It's crazy, but they've successfully tested
the engines and hope to fly soon.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.739
Ideally, those little wings will let craft
land and be reusable, because rockets are

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.739
expensive.

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.060
With the rise of profit-based commercial space
companies, you can guarantee future rockets

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.769
will be reusable.

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.490
But another company, Airbus, doesn't want
to save the whole rocket, like REL, just the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.620
important parts: the avionics, main engines,
and computers.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.550
Their Adeline system sits at the bottom of
the ESA Ariane 6 rocket stack, holding all

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.069
of those things inside of it.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.890
When the rocket gets the payload safely into
orbit, it heads back to Earth, using its little

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.480
wings to glide safely to a runway for re-use!

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.280
Until some new technologies come along and
make the fuel MORE combustible, or we find

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.360
another way to get to space.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.140
Future rockets will look a lot like the tech
we have now, only better.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.090
And the rockets of the future will have to
be more specialized.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.510
Some, like the SLS, can lift heavy humans
so they can go on to Mars, others will pop

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.519
little satellites into orbit and duck back
to Earth… and still others may do jobs we

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.639
haven't even thought of yet.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.109
There may be another way to get to space in
the future though… a SPACE.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.109
ELEVATOR.

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.570
Get in on the literal Ground Floor, and ride
a cable all the way to space.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.879
Check out how that might work along with some
other transportation futures in this video…

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:53.139
Do you have a favorite rocket?

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.139
Why?

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.760
I love the Space Shuttle, I'm a space camp
nerd…

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.920
I went back in the 90s and it was like a dream.
