00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.020
The Curious Case of Coffin Births

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.440
When you die, your body is, in a quite real
sense, never more alive.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.060
Beyond the amazing number of microbes that
already call your body home (more of their

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.560
cells than your own at any given time), other
bacteria and varying fungi and fauna colonize

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.000
the body with great rapidity after death.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.860
As the body becomes biome, flesh undergoes
a dreadful pantomime of balloon animal elasticity

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.850
– swelling, bloating, and distorting.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.559
This danse macabre is quite likely not what
one has in mind when one hears of life after

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:42.559
death.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.330
However, these commonplace morbidities of
life in death pale in comparison to one of

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:55.140
the more unusual, and completely tragic, graveyard
phenomena – postmortem fetal extrusion (a.k.a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.820
coffin birth – where the dead mother gives
birth after the fact to an equally dead baby).

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.980
Historical texts bear this gruesome curiosity
out with clinical chill.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.220
In 1551, one of the earliest known documented
cases of coffin birth was recorded: a victim

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.470
of the Spanish Inquisition, swinging at the
gallows, gave birth hours after her execution.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.080
In 1633, in Brussels, a woman who died in
labor convulsions gave postmortem birth three

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.140
days later.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.550
In 1650, a parish register noted, “April
ye 20, 1650, was buried Emme, the wife of

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.520
Thomas Toplace, who was found delivered of
a child after she had lain two hours in the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520
grave.”

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.720
In 1677, another woman died in labor; six
hours later abdominal movements were observed

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.880
and still eighteen hours after that her deceased
child was born.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.050
In 1861, sixty hours after a woman died in
convulsions, she “gave birth” to her eight

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.380
month old baby.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.640
The idea of postmortem birth has been recognized
as both a mythological notion and a medical

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.070
possibility for centuries.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.920
Indeed, the Greek God of medicine, Asklepios,
was cut from his mother’s womb after she

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.970
was killed upon Mount Olympus.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.970
The earthly heirs of Asklepios, medical professionals
of yore, made common practice of opening the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.630
bodies of dead pregnant women, aware that
live birth was still possible if they were

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.630
fast enough.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.420
Indeed, the Catholic Church, intent upon delivering
children from the purgatory of death before

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.340
baptism, supported this as church doctrine
– priests were called upon to perform the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.319
postmortem cesarean on pain of excommunication.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.250
At times, some physicians didn’t even bother
to wait for the mother to die if it seemed

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.600
absolutely certain that she would do so anyway,
further helping to ensure the survival of

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600
the child.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600
(For more on all this, see: The Truth About
Julius Caesar and Cesarean Sections and The

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600
First British Surgeon to Perform a Successful
C-Section Was a Woman Disguised as a Man)

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.700
But this is an article about when the baby
is not cut out.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.160
So what happens then?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.560
Dead bodies decompose.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.460
This process involves the diminution of oxygen
which in turn is accompanied by the multiplication

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.050
of anerobic bacteria which leads to a buildup
of gases like carbon dioxide and methane created

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.940
on breakdown of the body.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.640
The gases cause the body to swell up significantly.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.000
It is those gases which perform a similar
role to the contractions a woman experiences

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.790
during normal childbirth.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.620
The increased volume of gases in the deceased
pushes on the uterus, forcing the dead fetus

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.110
through the vagina (and occasionally also
forcing the uterus itself to prolapse out).

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.290
Thus, through the decomposition of the dead,
a gruesome birth is simulated- hence the term

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.660
“coffin birth.”

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.660
Given that all it potentially takes for a
coffin birth to happen is the death of a pregnant

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.520
woman where saving the baby isn’t attempted,
why don’t we hear about these coffin births

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520
today?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.800
Beyond cremations, this is primarily due to
the ubiquity of embalming the dead.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.270
Chemicals used to preserve the body and make
it presentable slow down decomposition and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.910
flush the normal bodily fluids and a significant
number of microbes away.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.190
The result is removal of many of the elements
that are so instrumental to coffin births,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.030
making them an extremely rare occurrence in
modern times.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.800
Rare, however, is not never and documented
coffin births do occasionally still happen.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.379
For instance, in 2005 in Hamburg Germany,
a pregnant woman was found dead and in a relatively

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.100
advanced state of decay in her apartment,
dying of a heroin overdose.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.250
During the subsequent autopsy, the head and
shoulders of the fetus were noted to be protruding

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.930
from the woman’s vagina and it was determined
to be a case of postmortem fetal extrusion,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.919
a.k.a. coffin birth.

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.639
Similarly in 2008 in Panama, a pregnant woman
who had disappeared was found decomposing

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.460
in a field days later, victim of a homicide.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.050
Her decaying fetus was discovered in her underwear.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.189
Just a few years ago in 2013, a pregnant Eritrean
migrant drowned when the ship she was taking

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.050
to Italy capsized.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.009
When a diver recovered the corpse, the baby
was discovered in the mother’s leggings.

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.029
Not all postmortem deliveries result in the
death of the baby, however, though these are

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:57.339
then technically not classified as postmortem
fetal extrusion.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:01.520
Such was the case of a 23-year-old woman in
India in 2007.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.939
After contractions started, she killed herself
but her body ultimately completed the birth

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.340
of the infant naturally- a rare example of
postmortem delivery.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.930
The baby was later found alive and still attached
to the dead mother’s body, an instance where

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:45.680
life and death had a truly tragic umbilical
connection.
