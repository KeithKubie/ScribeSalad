00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.700
Hey, you remember Wicked?

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.960
That Broadway show that took the world by storm by

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.400
looking at a popular story and giving it a new point of view?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.080
And, everybody has been trying to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.980
rip-off in one way or another recently?

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.840
Well, now we have Disney's version!

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.380
Uh... one of many.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.880
But, this is one that actually takes place in Oz too.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900
It's Oz the Great and Powerful.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.580
An imaginative take from director Sam Raimi,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.800
who mixes imagination and wonder with

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.700
awkwardness and, a lot of clumsy choices.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580
A magician, played by James Franco,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.080
wants to make a name for himself by doing great things,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.120
but he just can't seem to get off the ground.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
Well, one day he literally gets off the ground with a balloon,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.600
gets sucked away into a storm, and wakes up in the land of Oz.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.800
He of course comes across some interesting characters and some interesting baddies,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
and he tells everyone that he is, in fact, a powerful wizard.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.000
By using his illusions and salesmanship,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.100
he convinces everyone he can do great things and for the most part everyone believes him.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.900
But soon an evil witch, played by Rachel Weisz,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.900
Tries to use his tricks to her advantage

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200
while also using her sister, played by Mila Kunis,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.400
by manipulating her romantic interest in him to fulfill an evil plot.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.080
OK, so what are the good things?

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.200
Well, as you'd imagine, especially being a Sam Raimi film, it IS very visually interesting.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.020
Some of these backgrounds look a little repeated,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.100
like we saw this in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland or Lord of the Rings, but

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.600
then you get some really cool scenes, like the opening is done in a different aspect ratio.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.900
This is obviously supposed to be very similar to the trick

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.300
they did in the first film where it starting in black and white and then it goes to color;

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.800
Not only does this start out in black and white, but  it's not in widescreen.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.400
And even when it's not in widescreen they use the 3D effects very cleverly.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.200
Like when someone shoots fire out or throws a hat,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.000
it actually goes outside the boundaries.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.600
And it works more to its advantage when you travel to Oz and they go to widescreen

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.200
and you see how vast and gigantic it can be.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.200
Sometimes, I have to admit,  it does kind of capture the spirit of the original Wizard of Oz.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.300
There's a wonderful scene where he comes across this little china doll

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.200
and tries to glue her back together.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.000
Everything about this scene is, gah, for a lack of a better word, magical.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.200
It's just a magical, wonderful, little moment.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.500
The music, the pacing, the acting, the effects,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500
the effects are unbelievable here.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.000
You really feel like this thing is alive.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.600
It's a really charming, tender moment that I really wish the rest of the film was like.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.500
But, sadly, it isn't.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.900
It just kind of feels like some choices were made that shouldn't have been made.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
James Franco can be an unbelievably good actor but

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.900
he seems kind of miscast here.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.600
I feel like there should have been someone a little older or a little bit better at being a fast talker;

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.400
He just looks like a guy trying to play a con artist, not an actual con artist himself.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.500
The whole film as you probably imagine is building up to the classic "lair revealed" story

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.040
and I HATE these stories, I think we're all so sick of it.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.400
I think we put up with it more if tons of creative stuff was coming and yeah,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.400
there are some really creative scenes.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.000
But story-wise, it goes the route you think it's gonna go

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.500
and, yeah, the whole time you're watching it you're thinking:

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.900
"Huh. Wasn't this done a lot better in Wicked?"

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.700
And speaking of which, let's get to the ultimate blunder in this movie:

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.300
Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.000
Oh, Lord, this is a good actress,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
she can do good stuff, but this is completely the wrong choice.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.200
It's like having William Shatner as Hamlet, or Leonardo DiCaprio as The Mask,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.900
just some things don't go together and you know they're not gonna to go together

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.000
but you kinda hope it's like Michael Keaton and Batman,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.400
like everyone thought it wasn't going to work

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.200
but maybe it'll play out maybe the director saw something that nobody else saw,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.600
But no,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.700
The makeup is ridiculous.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.100
The voice she has isn't dramatic and it isn't intimidating.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.700
It just looks like a little girl dressing up for Halloween and screaming:

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.200
"I'm the Wicked Witch! Believe me, I'm the Wicked Witch!"

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.600
It's hard to watch. Like, REALLY hard to watch.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.400
And like I said, this is a good actress she has tons of other work to her credit,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.600
this just isn't going to be one of them.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.900
The majority of feedback I hear on this movie is mostly really negative.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.800
Like, people not only dislike this movie, they HATE it.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800
They just thought it was the pits.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.900
Well I think, some scenes are, I can't quite  go that far.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.000
The liar revealed story IS painful, but the rest of the set up I thought was actually kind of clever.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
If given a little bit more focus, and a few different choices made,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I think this could have been, actually, a really good story,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and a downright really great film.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.700
But as is, kind of like the Spiderman Movies;

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.300
They're well intended and creative and visually interesting, but, they're just kind of awkward.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.400
The moments that work are really great moments,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.200
the ones that don't, are just kind of uncomfortable.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.400
I guess I wasn't expecting that much, I mean, I wasn't especially excited for this movie,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
so maybe there wasn't as big a disappointment for me.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.400
I'm still glad I saw certain scenes. I like some of these creative characters,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.200
I like when they're flying in the bubbles, I like when he's putting the China Doll back together,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.600
I like some of this imagery. But clearly some of these casting choices should have been moved around,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.700
some of the dialog could have been a lot more clever,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.000
the pacing in some moments could have been a little tighter,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.600
which leads to an obviously good intentioned, but still clumsy movie.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.600
If you're in the mood for some good visuals, and a couple of nice scenes,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.200
I say this isn't that bad of one to check out.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.000
But if you're in the mood for something that's much more complete and put together,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I say you're probably gonna need a lot more glue.
