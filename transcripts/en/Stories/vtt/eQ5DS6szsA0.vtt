00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:01.700
CANDIDATE 1: OK.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.120
I'm looking for a trendy
girl with a simple smile.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.620
BREE: Dating by VHS-- this
is what technology assisted

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.760
dating looked like
before the internet.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.295
But who are the people
who actually met this way?

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:16.711
STEVE LIDDICK: I
don't go to bars.

00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:19.116
I'm not a church person.

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:20.720
Where else do you go?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.389
So this was the
perfect opportunity

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:26.060
to meet people in a
comfortable, safe atmosphere.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.280
BREE: Steve and Sherry
Liddick are two early adopters

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.730
of dating technology.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.940
SHERRY LIDDICK: I was a
year out from a divorce.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.280
And then when I was
suddenly single.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.780
How do I do this?

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.190
BREE: Yeah.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.440
Steve and Sherry
met back in 1978

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.530
through a video dating service
called "Great Expectations".

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.999
They've been married
for 37 years.

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:46.540
STEVE LIDDICK: I
happened to see over

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.660
the shoulder of some guy who
was watching a video tape--

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.295
this really pretty girl.

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:56.750
And she was the right age
and the right everything.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.000
BREE: It was sort of like
the analog version of online

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.890
dating.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.560
Paying members would
go into an office

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.646
and look through a
binder full of profiles.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:06.020
If you saw someone you liked,
you'd watch their interview

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.970
on a VHS tape.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.650
Hi, my name is Bree.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.606
And some of my interests
include roller disco, squirrels,

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:19.070
and Ronald Reagan-- no crazies,
no lazies, must love daisies.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.860
What did your friends
and your family

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.590
think about you guys using
a video dating service?

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.969
STEVE LIDDICK: Loser.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:26.510
BREE: Really?

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.884
STEVE LIDDICK:
What kind of loser

00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:30.145
would go to a video
dating service?

00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:31.020
SHERRY LIDDICK: Yeah.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.000
They thought it was
a little strange.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.350
BREE: Video daters had a
bad reputation lasting well

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.850
into the age of YouTube, when
leaked videos like this one

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.000
became viral.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.227
PHIL: My name is Phil.

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:41.810
Most of my friends
called me Big Phil.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.518
CANDIDATE 2: I'm
looking for the goddess.

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:45.200
Are you the goddess?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.730
BREE: What do the two of you
think about online dating?

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.313
SHERRY LIDDICK: There
are an awful lot

00:01:49.313 --> 00:01:52.530
of people that don't have good
intentions on those sites,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.120
I'm sure.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.790
But there might be
that one that works.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.680
BREE: Did you
think, at the time,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.850
that technology would
become what it is today

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.880
and that it would help us
find relationships easier?

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.380
STEVE LIDDICK: I
don't think we were

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.170
able to think beyond video tape.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.010
Well, look at the different
media that are available now.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.200
We could not even
have imagined that.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.220
BREE: So, while I'm
browsing people on Tinder,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.200
I can think about you guys being
the OG-- the original pioneers

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.162
of video dating.

00:02:39.162 --> 00:02:41.120
STEVE LIDDICK: Well, the
thing about technology

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.540
is, it's there.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.750
We have to deal with it.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.180
If you were traveling from
New York to Los Angeles,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.560
would you go in a covered wagon?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.950
That's the same theory
I have for dating.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.697
You use the technology
that's available now.

00:02:56.697 --> 00:02:58.530
CANDIDATE 3: I'm really
looking for somebody

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.740
I can feel special about.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.010
And I don't encounter
people like that very often.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.621
I'm hoping you're one of them.

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:05.120
BREE: Hey.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.510
Want to check out
more of my videos?

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.884
Head to the nuclear family
channel for some sketch comedy

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:10.030
gold like this video.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.308
WOMAN: I, state your name--

00:03:12.308 --> 00:03:14.970
MAN: I will fill that in later.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.760
WOMAN: Hereby present
this certificate

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.640
to acknowledge that I
value our relationship

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.747
to the tune of $10,000.

00:03:22.747 --> 00:03:23.830
BREE: Thanks for watching.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.770
