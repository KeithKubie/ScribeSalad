00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.700
Criticism is never easy. To learn that others
judge us to be foolish, perverse, ugly or

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.000
unpleasant is one of the most challenging
aspects of any life. However, the impact of

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.199
criticism is hugely variable – and depends
ultimately on a rather unexpected detail:

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.179
what sort of childhood we have had. The clue
to whether criticism will be experienced as

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:32.960
merely unpleasant or wholly catastrophic lies
in what happened to us many decades ago in

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.579
the hands of our earliest caregivers. What
is meant by a ‘bad childhood’ is here

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.670
a matter, rather simply, of love. An infant
arrives in the world with a very limited capacity

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.600
to endure their own being. It is the tolerance,
enthusiasm and forgiveness of another person

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.679
that gradually acclimatises us to existence.
Our caregivers’ characteristic way of looking

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:07.990
at us becomes the way we consider ourselves.
It is by being loved by another that we acquire

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.850
the art of looking sympathetically on our
cracked and troublesome beings. It is simply

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.930
not in our remit to believe in ourselves on
our own. We are utterly reliant on an inner

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.299
sense of having been valued inordinately by
another person at the start as a protection

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.310
against the subsequent neglect of the world.
We don’t need to be loved by many, one will

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.360
do, and twelve years might be enough, sixteen
ideally, but without it the eternal admiration

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.469
of millions won’t ever be able to convince
us of our goodness. And with such a love,

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:52.259
the scorn of millions won’t ever need to
be fatal. Bad childhoods have an unfortunate

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.090
tendency to drive us to seek out situations
in which there is a theoretical possibility

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.619
of receiving outsized approval – which also
means, along the way, a high risk of encountering

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.750
outsized disapproval. The emotionally deprived
return, almost manically to the question,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.750
never really settled of: ‘Do I deserve to
exist?’ And this is why they typically put

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.330
unusual effort into attempts to be famous
and visibly successful. But of course the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.610
world at large will never give the emotionally
nervous the unqualified confirmation they

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.360
seek; there will always be dissenters and
critics, people too bashed about by their

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.080
own past to be able to be kind to others,
and it is to these voices that those with

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.870
bad childhoods will be attuned, however enthusiastic
the crowd might be. We can observe, along

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.290
the way, that the chief marker of being a
good parent is that one’s child simply has

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.200
zero interest in being liked by large numbers
of strangers. We do not all hear the same

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.340
thing when we are criticised. Some of us,
the lucky ones, hear just the surface message

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.560
from the here and now: that our work fell
short of expectations, that we must try harder

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.320
with our assignments, that our book, film
or song wasn’t excellent. This can be bearable.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.090
But the more wounded among us hear far more.
Criticism takes them straight back to the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.290
primordial injury. An attack now becomes entwined
with the attacks of the past and grows enormous

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.750
and unmanageable in its intensity. The boss
or unfriendly colleague becomes the parent

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.341
who let us down. Everything is pulled into
question. Not only was the work subpar, we

00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:49.540
are a wretch, an undeserved being, a piece
of excrement, the worst person in the world,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.960
for that is how it felt, back then, in the
fragile, defenceless infant mind. Knowing

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.680
more about our tricky childhoods provides
us with a vital line of defence against the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.840
effects of criticism. It means that we can
be on our guard, when we are attacked, against

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.740
raising the stakes unnecessarily. We can learn
to separate out the verdict of today from

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.329
the emotional verdict we are carrying around
with us and always seeking to confirm with

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.580
the use of current events. We can learn that,
however sad the attacks we are facing, they

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.439
are as nothing next to the real tragedy and
the effective cause of our sadness: that things

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:39.020
went wrong back then. And so we can direct
our attention to where it really belongs;

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:46.060
away from today’s critics and towards the
unconvinced parent of yesteryear. We can forgive

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.120
ourselves for being, in this area, through
no fault of our own, fatefully sensitive – and,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.009
in essence, mentally unwell. We cannot stop
the attacks of the world, but we can – through

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:05.889
an exploration of our histories – change
what they mean to us. We can also, importantly,

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.850
get a second chance: we can go back and correct
the original verdict of the world. We can

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.169
take measures to expose ourselves to the gaze
of friends or, more ideally, of a talented

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.919
therapist who can hold up a more benign mirror
and teach us a lesson that should have been

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:32.320
gifted us from the start; that like every
human, whatever our flaws, we deserve to be here.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.440
