00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.608
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; With point slope form, we have one point that's fixed and then we'll plug in

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:07.724
the coordinates into this other point. 1 for the x and 2 for the y. Notice that

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:11.592
I'm always using parentheses when I plug in. That's because I don't want to make

00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:15.427
a mistake with my negative signs. Since both these numbers are positive, I can

00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:19.472
drop the parenthesis. And on the other side of the equation, we have our slope,

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:23.727
negative 3 halves. Now, I'm going to cross-multiply. Then, I carry out the

00:00:23.727 --> 00:00:28.796
distribution. Negative 3 times x is negative 3 x, and negative 3 times negative

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:33.865
1 is positive 3. On the right, I have 2 y and I have negative 4. I've re-written

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:38.491
this line up here and now I'm going to solve for standard form. I want the

00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:43.148
constants on the right, and the x and y on the left. If you got negative 3 x

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:47.678
minus 2 y equals negative 7, excellent work. Notice how every single term is

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:52.176
negative. Well, we could just multiply every term by negative 1 and make the

00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:57.052
entire equation and all it's terms positive. So, an alternative answer would be

00:00:57.052 --> 00:01:01.621
3 x plus 2 y equals 7. These are actually the same exact equation. This one has

00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:03.870
just been multiplied by a negative 1.
