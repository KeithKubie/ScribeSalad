1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,210
It's cool stuff. You'd love
it. I'm fascinated by wolves.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:08,100
I think wolves to me are probably the
most interesting animal in the wild.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,720
Can't candidates man,
while dogs of all kind are unbelievable.

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,990
They're so at the top of
their respective food chain.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,660
Yeah. We have a, a lot of coyotes around
here and basically they're little wolves,

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,280
the little sneaky wolves,

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,790
but a real wolves like wolves
in Yellowstone wolves in
the northwest area of the

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,374
United States.

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,700
Though there they have got to be some of
the most majestic animals cause hastick

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,760
they are there, they operate together
always yes. To these packs. Yep. You know,

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,560
so there's some sort of weird
kind of communication and,

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,680
and, and what's amazing is like the social
dynamic, like within the pack, you know,

13
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:50,010
the hierarchy and then on a hunt
like you go left, I go right.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,900
But without any verbal communication,
right.

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,740
And then coming together and making a
killer. I mean it's mind blowing stuff.

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,660
You know,
you talk about not understanding wildlife,

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,070
we don't understand how they do that.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,400
Right, right. We don't understand
what kind of communications going on.

19
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:06,810
Do you think there's some sort of
like telepathic or is it just a facial

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:07,920
recognition?

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,780
Recognizing cues and patterns that
they've established before of they see an

22
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,130
animal,
they note a flank it.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,540
I definitely believe it's that.

24
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:20,010
Like I definitely believe there is an
intrinsic understanding of you go left,

25
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,310
I go right. You know, facial
recognition, you know, your,

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,780
your expression tells me to do something
your dominant. I'm, I'm passive, you know,

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,800
learning that way. But I also think
there's something more than that.

28
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,090
Whether it's telepathic, whether it's
a low frequency sound that we're,

29
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,160
it's not audible to us.
I have no idea.

30
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,780
But I do think it's more
than just visual cues. Yeah.

31
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,650
That's where the,

32
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,670
apparently the myth of the Werewolf
comes from is that wolves are so smart.

33
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:49,930
They think that wolf and a person,
we're like combined together.

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,710
I don't believe that per se, but I can see
how that came up. You know what I mean?

35
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:58,190
It's totally, there's so smart. African
wild dogs are the same. Like they,

36
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,900
they hunt in these huge packs.

37
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,770
They go over these massive areas and then
they'll push a single animal into one

38
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,260
area to make the kill. And they're
not big animals there. Again,

39
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:10,970
like a coyote size, and they'll take down,
you know, a kudu or some huge antelope.

40
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,200
I mean, it's, it's incredible.

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,700
Well,
African wild dogs are so cool looking to,

42
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,490
with those black spots or yellow
and all the stunning, they just,

43
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,990
they look angry.

44
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,640
Yeah. Okay. You know, there's, I think
they're, they're my favorite of the key.

45
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,630
Like you love wolves.
I love African wild dogs.

46
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:30,710
I just think they're so beautiful and
majestic and unusual and they're just such

47
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,440
a cool animal.
Correct

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,470
me if I'm wrong, but I think all of
them come from the United States.

49
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,110
I think all of them originally came from
North America. Like I think [inaudible].

50
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,720
Yeah. All candidates came from North
America. I think that's Coyote America.

51
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,230
The gentleman who had been on the
podcast before, what is his name,

52
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,720
is escaping me right now. Uh,
but he, he wrote about it.

53
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,730
Huh? About, you know, all the various
jackals and Flores. Dan Flores.

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,420
That's it. He's, that is fascinating book.
Yeah. I'm going to write it down. Yeah,

55
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,900
I'd love to read it. Great. And I did
a podcast with him, uh, years ago.

56
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,800
That's excellent too.

57
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:10,720
And he has all sorts of crazy
insight as to native American,

58
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:15,670
North American animals that went
somewhere else, like a horses,

59
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,550
like horses were native to North America,

60
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,490
but they weren't here when the
European settlers came. They had,

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,930
they went extinct, but they
had been taken. They had
the, there were other places,

62
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,420
like apparently wild horses from Europe,

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,540
all originated from North America and
we're taking over and then another wow

64
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,211
from whatever.

65
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:38,380
And then when extinct here and then were
reintroduced with the European settlers.

66
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,010
Huh. That's interesting. Crazy. Yeah. And

67
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,601
that's the thing,

68
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:44,840
like with what I do looking for extinct
animals are proof that they're still out

69
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,880
there is like,
there are so many stories like that.

70
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:48,590
I didn't know that one in specific,

71
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,550
America's very well covered with eyeballs.

72
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,290
But what's to say there isn't some
remnant small population somewhere in the

73
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:01,730
middle of nowhere that nobody has found
these horses that have been untouched by

74
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:05,210
human beings for millennia. Right. And
that's, that's what I, that's what I do.

75
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,790
That's what drives me.
Right? Find this pocket,

76
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:12,500
find this animal that's been hiding
out undetected for thousands of years.
