00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:02.108
- [Voiceover] Hey, this
is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.108 --> 00:00:06.207
I am the History Fellow here,
and I am here with Emily.

00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:08.317
- [Voiceover] Hi, I'm the Biology Fellow.

00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:09.484
- [Voiceover] So, Emily and I are here

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:11.860
talking about Darwinism.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.260
I'm interested in Darwinism,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.299
because in the late 19th century,

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.522
usually called the Gilded Age,

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:21.929
there is a very prominent interpretation

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.242
of Darwinism that is
called, Social Darwinism.

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:30.706
Social Darwinism wasn't so
much an actual form of biology,

00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:33.802
as it was, kind of a misinterpretation

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:38.065
of how natural selection and
the theory of evolution worked,

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:41.011
that was used to justify or explain

00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.807
a lot of the social inequalities
of this time period.

00:00:44.807 --> 00:00:46.693
The way people often thought about it

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:49.864
was that white Anglo-Saxon people,

00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:52.897
so Europeans, Northern Europeans,

00:00:52.897 --> 00:00:55.480
were kind of the most evolved.

00:00:56.688 --> 00:00:59.992
This is our timeline of evolution,

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:02.909
from least evolved to most evolved,

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:06.866
and people like African Americans,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.383
or Asians, or Native Americans,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.127
or even Eastern Europeans,

00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:20.409
were less evolved.

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.576
That they were on a scale of evolution

00:01:26.192 --> 00:01:30.592
where they hadn't come
as far as Anglo-Saxons.

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:33.735
So, Emily, you're a biologist,

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:35.761
and I would love to get your take

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.184
on how it is that natural
selection actually works,

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:41.344
and how this doesn't
quite describe what was

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:42.618
really going on.

00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:44.514
- [Voiceover] Yeah, definitely.

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:48.159
So, maybe I can speak first
to that specific graph

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.048
that you've drawn on.

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:52.042
I think that this is
actually a common point

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:55.025
of confusion when it comes to evolution,

00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:57.163
that there's not really such a thing,

00:01:57.163 --> 00:02:00.178
as more or less evolved in evolution.

00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:02.403
So--
- [Voiceover] Okay, so,

00:02:02.403 --> 00:02:05.631
this gradient really doesn't exist.

00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:09.823
- [Voiceover] No, I mean,
there's sort of the,

00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:11.506
I think that people
sometimes see the pictures

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.488
of like, the ape standing up,
and turning into a person,

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:18.087
and they think, "Oh, this
is sort of a linear path

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:20.409
"from one thing to another."

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.576
What you really get is different
types of organisms evolving

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:28.363
from a shared ancestor, and branching off.

00:02:28.363 --> 00:02:29.295
So--

00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:30.128
- [Voiceover] All right so--

00:02:30.128 --> 00:02:32.711
- [Voiceover] Nobody
who's alive on Earth today

00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:35.690
has been evolving for more or less time,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.793
since their last common ancestor,

00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:39.964
than anybody else.

00:02:39.964 --> 00:02:40.989
- [Voiceover] So would you,

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.508
I'm gonna draw what I think
is how you're explaining this,

00:02:44.508 --> 00:02:47.181
and please correct me, as I go along.

00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:49.867
Say this is my common ancestor,

00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:54.461
and then would there possibly
be branches like this?

00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:58.311
- [Voiceover] Yeah, that's
a great way to draw it.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.845
Certainly, humans are all
extremely closely related

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:02.678
to each other,

00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:04.881
but we could even say this for us,

00:03:04.881 --> 00:03:07.048
versus a dog, a bacterium.

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:11.228
Pretty much anything, all life on Earth,

00:03:11.228 --> 00:03:13.193
shares a common ancestor.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.987
That bacteria is just as
evolved as you are, actually,

00:03:16.987 --> 00:03:19.713
in this sense of absolute time,

00:03:19.713 --> 00:03:21.191
since those two split apart.

00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.525
- [Voiceover] Right, so
from the moment that life

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:27.175
first appeared on Earth,
there has been so much time,

00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:31.635
and all of us have been
evolving from that point.

00:03:31.635 --> 00:03:33.989
Even whether you're a piece of bacteria,

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:34.822
piece a good word?

00:03:34.822 --> 00:03:35.852
A bacterium?

00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:37.204
- [Voiceover] There you go!
- [Voiceover] Excellent.

00:03:37.204 --> 00:03:38.405
- [Voiceover] Beautiful.
(laughs)

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:39.292
- [Voiceover] So bacterium.

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:40.959
I took biology once,

00:03:42.403 --> 00:03:44.509
or you are Albert Einstein.

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.453
You have been evolving for
precisely the same amount

00:03:47.453 --> 00:03:48.286
of time.

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:49.119
- [Voiceover] Yep.
- [Voiceover] Awesome.

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:52.651
Okay, wow, I'm really relieved
to find that I could describe

00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:54.192
that as well as I could.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.267
(laughs)

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:56.100
- [Voiceover] You did a great job.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.183
Beautiful.

00:03:57.183 --> 00:03:59.348
- [Voiceover] Okay, so you've done this,

00:03:59.348 --> 00:04:03.077
this distinction between
evolving from a common ancestor.

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:06.880
How is it that the actual theory
of natural selection works?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.698
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:04:08.698 --> 00:04:11.716
So, natural selection,
often people talk about it

00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:15.613
as sort of, having three key ingredients.

00:04:15.613 --> 00:04:18.495
To see how it works, let's
imagine that we're just looking

00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:20.775
at a population of beetles.

00:04:20.775 --> 00:04:24.192
So picture you're beetles, to start with.

00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:29.275
What would we need to have,
in order for these beetles,

00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:32.580
as a group, to evolve
by natural selection?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.908
One thing that we would need is,

00:04:33.908 --> 00:04:36.827
we would need some
variation among the beetles.

00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:37.660
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.179
- [Voiceover] So, if you
have identical beetles,

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:43.410
you're not going to have any
that are better at surviving

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.364
or reproducing, than any others,

00:04:46.364 --> 00:04:48.441
which is kind of a key ingredient,

00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:50.010
for what we're gonna talk about.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.843
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:04:50.843 --> 00:04:52.586
So, I've got two different beetles here.

00:04:52.586 --> 00:04:55.045
They're slightly
different from each other.

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.099
- [Voiceover] Awesome.

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.080
You've made them different
colors, which is perfect.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.663
We have variation,

00:05:00.663 --> 00:05:03.040
and the next ingredient
that we're going to need,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.447
is we're gonna need that
variation to be heritable.

00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:07.304
We're gonna say that those beetles,

00:05:07.304 --> 00:05:10.113
one of them is green
and one of them is blue,

00:05:10.113 --> 00:05:12.602
and that's because of
something in their DNA.

00:05:12.602 --> 00:05:15.043
They have differences in their DNA,

00:05:15.043 --> 00:05:17.659
that create the variation in colors.

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.242
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:05:21.973 --> 00:05:24.588
Alright, so, when you say
heritable, you mean that this

00:05:24.588 --> 00:05:28.192
is something that their
descendants could inherit?

00:05:28.192 --> 00:05:29.400
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.386
That is exactly it.

00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:35.204
So the final ingredient
is that, the differences,

00:05:35.204 --> 00:05:36.898
these heritable differences,

00:05:36.898 --> 00:05:39.914
need to affect how good the beetles are

00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:42.950
at leaving offspring
in the next generation.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.650
- [Voiceover] Alright, okay.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.335
- [Voiceover] For example, let's say,

00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:48.302
we would probably have
more than two beetles,

00:05:48.302 --> 00:05:49.968
in our actual population --

00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:50.801
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:52.290
- [Voiceover] But, let's say
this population has just moved

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.394
into a new area that is very blue colored.

00:05:56.394 --> 00:05:57.227
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:05:57.227 --> 00:06:00.617
- [Voiceover] So blue rocks,
blue flowers, whatever.

00:06:00.617 --> 00:06:02.499
There's also a bunch of
birds in that environment

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.355
that really like to eat beetles.

00:06:05.355 --> 00:06:06.188
- [Voiceover] Oh.

00:06:06.188 --> 00:06:07.021
- [Voiceover] I'm guessing,

00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:09.598
that if they have blue
beetles and green beetles,

00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:12.181
that one of those is
gonna show up a lot better

00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:15.081
against the blue
environment, than the other.

00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:18.454
Probably a lot of our
green beetles are gonna get

00:06:18.454 --> 00:06:21.462
picked off by birds, and
they're not gonna be able

00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:25.502
to leave offspring, because
gosh, they kinda got ate.

00:06:25.502 --> 00:06:26.335
(laughs)

00:06:26.335 --> 00:06:29.357
So, when you look at the
next generation of beetles,

00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:32.024
if we know that the
colors get passed on --

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:32.857
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:06:32.857 --> 00:06:36.311
- [Voiceover] We're gonna
probably see a bigger group of,

00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:38.244
a bigger proportion of that group,

00:06:38.244 --> 00:06:40.447
being made up of blue beetles,

00:06:40.447 --> 00:06:42.737
and less being made up of green.

00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:46.705
That is an example of
natural selection in action,

00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:50.217
where you can see that
organisms that survive and,

00:06:50.217 --> 00:06:54.663
specifically, reproduce better,
in a certain environment,

00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:58.403
are going to increase in
frequency in a population.

00:06:58.403 --> 00:07:00.858
You're gonna get more and
more of these blue guys,

00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:02.779
less and less of the green guys.

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:04.331
- [Voiceover] Is there
a word you would use

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:07.779
to describe this, sort
of, this adaptation?

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:09.478
Is that the natural selection part,

00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:12.101
as from variation, inheritable?

00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:16.196
Like, the natural selection
is just like a good situation?

00:07:16.196 --> 00:07:19.868
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I mean,
natural selection is really,

00:07:19.868 --> 00:07:23.839
just the differential
survival and reproduction.

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:26.580
As you mentioned a great word
there, which is adaptation.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.038
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:30.418
- [Voiceover] Adaptation
is the word that biologists

00:07:30.418 --> 00:07:34.501
often give to the process
of a population getting

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:38.865
better and better suited
to its environment.

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:42.274
You would say that the
population was adapting to being

00:07:42.274 --> 00:07:43.280
in a blue space --

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.863
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:07:44.863 --> 00:07:46.974
- [Voiceover] As it gradually
started to have more and more

00:07:46.974 --> 00:07:49.724
blue beetles, across generations.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.766
- [Voiceover] What I find
really interesting about this,

00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:57.494
is that it's entirely by chance, right?

00:07:57.494 --> 00:08:00.959
More or less, you've
got a genetic mutation,

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:04.526
and then that mutation happens
to suit the environment

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.742
that you're in, which allows
you to thrive and your genes,

00:08:07.742 --> 00:08:11.239
and your adaptations to
be passed on, over time.

00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:12.072
- [Voiceover] Yes!

00:08:12.072 --> 00:08:15.110
I mean, the variation would
have occurred randomly

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.967
to start with.

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:19.018
Like you say, it would've been a mutation,

00:08:19.018 --> 00:08:21.215
it didn't happen 'cause the
beetles went to a blue place,

00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:24.759
and said, "Gosh, I should be
blue, that would be awesome."

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:26.118
That was not what happened.

00:08:26.118 --> 00:08:29.078
It was already there and it
just happened to be successful

00:08:29.078 --> 00:08:30.583
in that environment.

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:32.895
If they'd gone to a green
place, well, guess what?

00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:35.646
You would've gotten exactly
the opposite effect.

00:08:35.646 --> 00:08:38.882
Suddenly, the green guys
would've been more successful,

00:08:38.882 --> 00:08:40.670

00:08:44.431 --> 00:08:46.067
