00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.300
Well, we've done a lot of work
with how fast something moves,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.250
let's see if we can work with
how fast something spins.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.820
Let's see what we can do.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.970
Since we're going to be working
with things spinning,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.080
let me draw a circle.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.370
Since things that spin
go in circles.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.810
And let me just draw the
positive x-axis because it'll

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.340
come in handy in a second.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.120
That's the positive x-axis.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.610
And let's say that I have an
object, and the circle is the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.860
object's path.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.705
So let's say this
is the object.

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:38.780
And it's going around
in a circle in a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.755
counterclockwise direction.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:41.030
Not squiggly counterclockwise,
it's just

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.620
going around this way.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.740
Let's say I wanted to figure
out, or I wanted to quantify

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.300
how much, or how fast this
thing is spinning.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
So one thing that you're
probably familiar with is

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.230
revolutions per second, or
rotations per second.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.130
So let's write that down, let's
just say for the sake of

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.110
argument that this was moving
at, I don't know, 1 revolution

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.630
per second.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.380
So after 1 second it goes back,
then another second.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.810
So that's how fast
it's spinning, 1

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.570
revolution per second.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.800
1 revolution-- I'll just
put rev-- per second.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.210
So let's see if we can quantify
that in angles, and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.130
we'll do it in radians, but you
could always convert it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.440
back to degrees, if you want.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.660
I don't know if you
can see that line.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.350
Let's just say that theta is the
angle between the radius

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.180
from the center to
that object, and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.840
the positive x-axis.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.980
So if this object is travelling
at 1 revolution per

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.090
second, how many radians per
second is it traveling?

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.120
Well, how many radians are
there in a revolution?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.740
Well there's 2 pi radians
in a revolution, right?

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.980
1 go-around in a circle
is 2 pi radians.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.950
So we could say, so this equals
1 rev per second, times

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.680
2 pi radians per rev, right?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.060
And then the revolutions
will cancel out.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.230
And you have 1 times
2 pi, so you have 2

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.620
pi radians per second.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:25.354
So this equals 2 pi radians
per second.

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:30.250
So that's interesting, we now
know exactly after 5 seconds

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.810
how many radians it has gone.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.050
Or after half a second, how
many radians has it gone.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.650
But that might be
vaguely useful.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.770
Let's see if we can somehow
convert from this notion of

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.530
how fast something is spinning
to its actual speed.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.950
I was tempted to say velocity,
but its velocity is always

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.190
changing, because the direction
is always changing.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.600
But the magnitude of the
velocity is staying the same,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.740
so its speed is staying
the same.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.680
But we'll say v for speed,
because that's what they tend

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.200
to do in most formulas
that you'll see.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.710
So let's think about it this
way, in 1 revolution-- so

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.760
there's a couple ways you can
think about this, but as we go

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.010
1 revolution, how far has
this object traveled?

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.250
Well, it's traveled the
circumference of this circle.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.770
And in order to know the
circumference, we have to know

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.680
the radius of the circle.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.540
So let's say that the radius
is r-- let's say it's in

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.870
meters, r meters.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:34.510
So how many meters will I travel
in 1 second, then?

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.870
Well, you could do the
same thing up here.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:46.360
1 revolution per second, times
2 pi r, where r is the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.810
radius-- whoops, 2 pi r, you can
ignore that line-- meters

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.950
per revolution, that's just
the circumference of the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.820
thing, of the circle.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.450
And that equals-- the
revolutions cancel out-- 2 pi

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.610
r meters per second.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.290
So it's interesting, given
the radius and how many

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.690
revolutions per second, we can
now figure out its velocity.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.490
So this right here is how fast
it's spinning, and this is the

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.290
object's actual speed, right?

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.030
And this term of how fast
something's spinning, that's

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.620
called angular velocity.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.620
And of course you know that
the term for how fast

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.240
something is actually
moving is velocity.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.240
And just so you know, the term
for angular velocity is this

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.310
curvy w, I think that's
lower case omega,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.050
that's angular velocity.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.070
So in this case, angular
velocity is equal to 2 pi

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.200
radians per second.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.060
And what's the velocity equal
to, or at least the magnitude

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.590
of the velocity-- I know the
direction's always changing.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.270
Well, we know that the velocity
is equal to 2 pi r

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.920
meters per second.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.860
So if we just ignore the units
for a second, where do you see

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.590
the difference between
the angular

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.620
velocity and the velocity?

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.850
The angular velocity in this
case is 2 pi, and the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.680
velocity is 2 pi r.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.630
So in general, if you just
multiply the angular velocity

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.530
times r, you get the velocity.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.650
So angular velocity times the
radius is equal to velocity.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.275
Or you can divide both sides of
that by r, and you get the

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:28.920
angular velocity is equal
to the velocity

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.490
divided by the radius.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.250
And this is a formula that you
should know by heart, although

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.820
it's good to know where
it came from.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.670
I guess I did it this way to
maybe give you an intuition,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.580
because I always have to
work with numbers.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.650
Especially when I'm new to a
concept-- so that's why I said

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.390
1 revolution per second,
instead of just putting

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.170
everything as a variable-- but
another way to think about it

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.840
is, what is the definition
of a radian?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:03.370
By definition, a radian-- if
this angle is x radians, it's

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.860
an angle, and it also tells us
that the arc that is kind of

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.590
projected by this angle,
is equal to x radiuses.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.700
So if each radius is 2 meters,
it would be x times 2 meters.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.700
So if this is x radians,
then this is going to

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.130
be x times r meters.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:34.860
And that actually comes from the
definition of the radian.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.410
And that might be more intuitive
to you, than the

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.230
original explanation, or
less, so hopefully one

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.250
of those two works.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.730
But as you can see, if this
angle is x, and this distance

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:52.050
is x times r, and if omega is
change in that angle, over

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.300
change in time.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.890
Then we know this is true too,
that velocity is just change

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.160
in this, over change
in time, right.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.680
Velocity is change in-- the
radius doesn't change-- change

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.280
in x times r, divided
by change in time.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.760
And we know once again
that this is omega.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.680
So another way we just showed
again, that omega times the

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.015
radius is equal to
the velocity.

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:23.860
Or the angular velocity
times the radius is

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.240
equal to the velocity.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.520
And this is a useful thing to
learn, we'll see it in a

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.020
couple of things, when I do
the proof for centripetal

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.600
acceleration in calculus, I'm
going to use this fact.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.510
And when I-- and actually I'm
probably going to record that

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.020
video now-- I'm actually going
to show you the law of

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.370
conservation of angular
momentum, which is very

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.260
similar to the law of
conservation of momentum, but

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.250
it deals with things spinning.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.820
And this notion of angular
velocity is

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.090
going to come in useful.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.440
So this is the important
takeaway, that w

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.670
equals v over r.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.070
And hopefully my video has not
confused you, and has shown

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.350
you that w, the rate at which
the angle is changing, is

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.700
equal to the velocity of the
object, or the magnitude of

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.330
the velocity, divided
by the radius of the

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.280
circle that it's spinning.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.420
I'll see you in the
next video.
