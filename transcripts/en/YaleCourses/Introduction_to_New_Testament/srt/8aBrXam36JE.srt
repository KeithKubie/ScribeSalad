1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,381
Okay.

2
00:00:01,381 --> 00:00:06,381
The word apocalypse is the
Greek word apokalupsis.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,880
That is translated as revelation
because that's exactly what it means.

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:14,150
I'm uncovering.
So you,

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,170
you will often hear the revelation of
John also referred to as the apocalypse,

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,830
cause that's also its
title. Now, one point,

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,190
please don't call it the revelations.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,630
I don't know why people
think gets revelations is the
name of the book. It's not,

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,220
it's the revelation of John. That's
the title. So the word just means Ian.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,300
Uncovering a river's nowadays in the
modern world to an entire genre of

11
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:43,580
literature of the ancient world,
most of which is Jewish. Uh,

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,980
but there are some maybe Greek apocalypse
things that people would call a Greek

13
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:51,410
apocalypse or apocalyptic type
literature in some Latin, uh,

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,660
texts are in Egyptian or
other Near Eastern, uh, uh,

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,701
situations.

16
00:00:56,701 --> 00:01:00,600
But most of what we call apocalypses
come from either an ancient Jewish or an

17
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:03,900
ancient Christian million.
These,

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,110
this kind of literature has
several characteristics.

19
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:09,510
The scholars have pointed out,
and I'll go over this very briefly,

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,070
they tend to be synonymous. That
is, they're set. They're set.

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,770
It deepen the past. Like we saw
the book of Daniel. In fact,

22
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:21,630
Daniel is where we get a lot
of our generic, uh, notions
of what an apocalypse is.

23
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,700
The too apocalyptic.

24
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:27,630
Most apocalyptic books in the
Bible are Daniel and revelation.

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,093
And then there,

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,550
there's kind of an apocalyptic world
view that I'll talk about also.

27
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,960
But when we talk about apocalypse,

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,080
we're talking about first
that genre of literature.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,800
They're usually synonymous there
ascribed to some ancient hero.

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,470
So we have apocalypses, uh, uh,

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,940
that are titled after Enoch said to me
by enoc who's lived way, way, way back,

32
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,290
just in the, just after Adam. Uh,

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,310
we have apocalypses attributed to
various other old testament characters.

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,810
Uh, so the idea as we saw with
Daniel is it's written at one time,

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,390
but the author claims to be riding
centuries before. And like we saw Dan,

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,510
Dan knew the case. They usually tell you
what's going to happen in the future.

37
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,140
Of course, it's actually in
the past for the writer, uh,

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,360
at all up until a certain
point. And then the end of, uh,

39
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,150
the current society or the end
of the world as we know it,

40
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,480
it's not normally the end
of the world entirely.

41
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:24,330
Usually what it is is a destruction.
And then a resettling,

42
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:28,740
a recreation of a physical world is just
a called it in the Kingdom of God or

43
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:33,030
something like that. So they usually
have a chronological span of time.

44
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,330
They have all kinds of images,
angels, demons, sometimes B,

45
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,430
sometimes monstrous kinds of beast,
as in you've seen also in revelation.

46
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,264
And in Daniel,

47
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,920
they're usually constructed as some kind
of narrative that the author will say

48
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:50,220
something like, I, I was
in a dream and I saw this.

49
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,850
And then this angel grabbed me and took
me to this part of Heaven and took me to

50
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,890
the third heaven or the fifth
heaven or the 12th Heaven.

51
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,430
And then I went down to the deep and
saw the dead. Think don pays in Ferno.

52
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,030
And the,
uh,

53
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,960
the way that Dante has led around into
the different parts of the cosmos.

54
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,940
And they have a cosmology, they
usually have a storied, um,

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,200
structure to the universe with several
different layers of heavens and often

56
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:17,140
several different layers of under a,
underneath the different hell,

57
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,730
hell's or Haiti's. So that's the
genre of the Apokyn of an apocalypse.

58
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,110
There's also the worldview of
Apocalypto CISM we'll call it,

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,880
and this is what we use this term
is because Paul, as far as we know,

60
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,370
it never wrote an apocalypse.

61
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,870
And yet his letters show strong
influence of apocalyptic autism.

62
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,110
That is an apocalyptic
worldview. You have, for example,

63
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:44,370
three different kinds of
dualisms you've already seen in,

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,590
in the gospel of John and their texts.
Uh,

65
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,850
how there's a dualism
between good and evil.

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,230
They're the good guys and the bad
guys there has gotten their Satan. Uh,

67
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,330
so there's an ethical kind of dualism.
There's also a spatial dualism.

68
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,050
There's a dualism of
up there and down here.

69
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,380
And so you have things that go on,

70
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:05,380
on the earth are simply shadows of
what's going on actually in the heavens.

71
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,610
It's like every country,
according to Daniel has its own prints.

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,560
By that he means some kind
of angelic being. So the
Persian, the prince of Persia,

73
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,850
refers in Daniel two,

74
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:19,780
some huge angelic super human
being who actually rules Persia.

75
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,470
The Prince of, uh, of Judah 10.

76
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,010
The Angel Judah tends to be
Michael or some other, uh,

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,230
Angel that you've probably
heard it like ref Raphael,

78
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,660
but each of the nations has its own angel.

79
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,660
So you can imagine sort of that Russia
has its angel and so then America has its

80
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,230
angel and if Russia and
America where to go to war,

81
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,970
this would be actually simply an earthly
shadow type reflection of the true

82
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:46,571
reality,

83
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:50,890
which would be going on as the angel of
Russia was battling the angel of America

84
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,180
in heaven.
So that's the way the world is,

85
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,870
that everything that goes on in our
cosmos is simply a mirror image of these

86
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:03,070
battles that are going on in the heavens.
So that's another dualism of space.

87
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,780
And then there's of course a dualism of
time. We've talked a lot about how, um,

88
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,610
for Daniel,

89
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:13,090
remember there's a dualism of
the before time in the aftertime.

90
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,880
So there's the time that Daniel's riding,
which is right up to this.

91
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:23,230
And then what'll happen
is some big cataclysm will
happen and then according to

92
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,540
Daniel,
the son of man will come down.

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,650
Battle against the bad evil
forces overthrow and talk
is the fourth epiphany is

94
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,720
and set up the Kingdom of God.

95
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,100
You have the same kind of structure of
the to the time before in the time after

96
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,370
in the New Testament, except
it's squirrely, right?

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,700
Because according say to Paul,

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,930
this is what's happened.
You have the now time,

99
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,930
which is still going on and
you had your future time,

100
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,510
which has already started
impinging on the present.

101
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,590
The thing that marks the beginning of
the end time has been the cross and the

102
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,170
resurrection of Jesus.
So Jesus was raised.

103
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,500
What do you have when people
are raised the end of the world,

104
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,840
the dead are supposed to be raised
according to Jewish mythology,

105
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,810
and this is something that
doesn't happen all the time,

106
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,530
and mainly it happens at the end of time.

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,970
So the early Christians who were there
were Jews expecting and apocalyptic

108
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,840
kingdom of God to happen that Jesus
probably taught this sort of thing himself

109
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,260
as an apocalyptic prophet.
But when Jesus was killed,

110
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,860
then the whole thing seemed to go arrive
because the Messiah is not supposed to

111
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:25,694
be killed.

112
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,910
Christians and followers of Jesus though
very quickly believed that they had

113
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,960
seen him after he died, so they believed
they had seen the resurrected Jesus.

114
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,760
We're not going to talk
about what they actually saw.

115
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,280
What happened is from a
historical point of view,

116
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,420
all we can say is that they believe they
saw him raised from the dead and that

117
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,500
meant they thought,
oh,

118
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,090
the end time must have already
started because he was been raised.

119
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:47,691
In other words,

120
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:52,610
remember how Paul talks about Jesus as
the first fruits of those who sleep?

121
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,720
That just means Jesus, just the first
apple on the tree in his resurrection,

122
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,370
that Butt and all the rest, but will
be raised when the final end comes.

123
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,990
But for the early Christians,

124
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:06,980
they believe the end had already to in
some sense started with the resurrection

125
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,050
of Jesus. So that's this
end. But then there's,

126
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,250
they also know the full end hasn't come
because we don't see the Kingdom of God

127
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,330
around us. Those Dan Romans are
still in charge. The, the, the,

128
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,720
the bad evil American government is
still running things in the world.

129
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,990
So this must not be the Kingdom of God.
Maybe the Kingdom of Obama,

130
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:26,720
but it's not yet the Kingdom of God.
So they,

131
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:31,520
the Christians expected Jesus to
come back down to come from heaven.

132
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,880
This was called the Paris Ia.
We've already seen it in several texts.

133
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,060
In First Thessalonians for example,

134
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,000
Paul talks about Jesus will come and
then we'll flap in there and meet him.

135
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,110
That's the Pyro,
Sia,

136
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:46,640
which is a Greek term that just means
presence or coming and we refer to the

137
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:51,140
time when a king or the emperor would
come to visit a city and all the people in

138
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:53,900
the city, the important people
would come out of the city,

139
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:57,380
out of the gates to meet the king and
give him gifts and the king would give

140
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:59,990
them gifts and then then I'll
accompany the king back into the city.

141
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,860
That's called [inaudible]. It's a purely
sort of political civic kind of term.

142
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,850
This is what early Christians used to
call the coming back of Jesus in his pair

143
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:11,840
of Ia. So Christians live
according to policy, theology,

144
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,240
right in this middle time of the,

145
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,910
of an overlap of the before and the after.

146
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,710
But that still before and after that you
see of apocalyptic CISM is still there.

147
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,130
So all these different dualisms
are one of the characteristics.

148
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,610
And you can see these sorts of things
even in texts that adopt themselves

149
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:31,880
apocalypses but they show
influences from these kinds of,

150
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,910
this kind of worldview and is
kind of narrative view of history.

151
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,360
And a cosmology often apocalypses seem
to have served as a form of cultural

152
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,450
resistance.
They make the most sense.

153
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:49,451
Often if you see them as being popular
among people who either are oppressed by

154
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:53,300
some more powerful entity, or at
least believe that they are oppressed,

155
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:56,640
they feel themselves to be
oppressed. So for example, uh,

156
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:59,610
it's a perfectly natural worldview can,
you can understand how the world view is.

157
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,260
If you believe you're an
oppressed minority and you
can't really fight against

158
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:05,310
the more powerful entity,

159
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,240
there's no way these early
little Christian groups
or even that the nation of

160
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:12,300
Israel could rebel against
the Roman empire. And when,

161
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,180
and so the idea is that well,

162
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,240
we will resist them and eventually God
will intervene in history with his angels

163
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:25,371
and his army and the divine armies will
come and we will fight alongside them to

164
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:31,020
overthrow the Greeks. Earliest
apocalypses Daniel was talking about,

165
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,290
uh, the Greeks and the Syrians,
the Greco, Syria and empire.

166
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,690
So the Greeks were the
first oppressive power that,

167
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,580
that people thought they
could overthrow this way.

168
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,250
And then of course the Romans become
the more oppressive power later.

169
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,660
So in Jesus' time and pause time,

170
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,600
it's the Romans who are the
enemy that will be overthrown,

171
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,190
but that will all happen.

172
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,190
So it's not always true that the
people who believe in these kinds of

173
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:56,580
apocalyptic ideas are themselves.
In fact, an oppressed minority.

174
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,290
After all, Ronald Reagan was the
president of the United States,

175
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,850
and he still believed this stuff.

176
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,940
He still believed that God
was going to come any day.

177
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,150
He thought it was going to happen right
then any day now. And God was gonna, uh,

178
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,560
you know,

179
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,470
have a big battle with Israel would be
involved in it and will the different

180
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:16,440
nations of the earth and then God would
set up the Kingdom of God in Jerusalem.

181
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,870
And so, you know, Reagan talked about
this on the phone with different, uh,

182
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,050
Israeli politicians and leaders.
So how,

183
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,620
how does this make
sense for Ronald Reagan,

184
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,120
the most powerful man in the world
to have this apocalyptic worldview?

185
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,673
Well,

186
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,840
Reagan spent a lot of his life feeling
like he was on the out and feeling like

187
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:40,710
he was not one of the liberal
establishment of the east
and this sort of thing.

188
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,550
So it doesn't necessarily mean that
people who hold these views are themselves

189
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,820
discriminated against minorities
or oppressed minorities.

190
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,460
But it usually means that they
perceived themselves that way.

191
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:53,310
Because otherwise if you,
if you really do have power,

192
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,050
you just make the world
like you want it to be.

193
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,880
You overthrow somebody or you wage a
battle and wage war and you fixed the

194
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:00,810
problem yourself.

195
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,910
It's when you don't have
the power politically or
militarily to fix the problem,

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,920
that this kind of worldview becomes
very, um, persuasive to you.

197
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,890
Very believable,
plausible.

198
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,380
So that's what the book of revelation is.
In fact, we use the title of revelation,

199
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:22,170
the apocalypse as the genre,

200
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,990
as the term for the whole genre
and for the whole worldview.

201
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,920
And it comes basically
from this book because a,

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,840
it's the most famous apocalypse
of all, naturally. The one,

203
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,840
the weird thing about revelation though
is that it's not pseudonymous. We don't,

204
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,470
that book says it's just
written by a guy named John. Uh,

205
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:44,060
it's not the same John who
was the brother of Zebbie.

206
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,880
It's not the same John.
If the,

207
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:48,570
if there was a John who wrote the
gospel of John and the letters of John,

208
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:49,830
which we don't really know who wrote them,

209
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,350
but whoever wrote revelation is not
the same person who wrote any of that

210
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:56,560
literature. This style is too different.
That theology is too different.

211
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,180
It's just clearly not the same person,

212
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,850
but he doesn't claim
to be any famous John.

213
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,140
He just claims to be John and and
so we call him often John the seer,

214
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,830
s e r as you know John the profit
or something like that so he,

215
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,290
he doesn't seem to hide who he
is and interestingly enough,

216
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:18,700
he doesn't place the composition
of his book centuries in the past.

217
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,890
He actually places it in his own time,

218
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,950
but this is also tells you what's
going on, where he thought he was.

219
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,060
He really believed that he
was right there in the end,

220
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:32,110
had already begun in a sense with Jesus
and so he doesn't feel the need to pray

221
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,010
to cast back into the past
and pro pro prophecy again,

222
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,610
he sees himself as a
prophetic figure like Daniel,

223
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,640
but prophetic fear not for the future.
He doesn't believe the future is going to,

224
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,030
there's going to be any more future. He
believes Jesus is coming back right now,

225
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,730
so he just places himself
right at the beginning.

226
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,450
It's also a little bit unlike some
apocalypse is because you have these seven

227
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:56,140
letters in the beginning of the book
that are addressed to seven different

228
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:57,880
churches in Asia Minor.

229
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,680
But one of the interesting things about
all of revelation is its structure.

230
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,720
I talked about Hebrews,
uh,

231
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,540
last week and I gave you an outline to
the letter to the Hebrews to show you

232
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:15,541
that it was a very elaborately structured
sermon and Hebrews was very well

233
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,160
written. It's one of the, some of
the best Greek in the New Testament.

234
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,110
Revelation is interestingly structured.
If you, and I'll show you why I say that,

235
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,940
but actually it's not very well written,

236
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:29,080
but the Greek is almost illiterate
and scholars have wondered about this.

237
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,430
Is it just because the writer of this
didn't have a very good education or some

238
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,210
people have using section,

239
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,210
maybe he's intentionally writing and
kind of a weird way as sort of almost a

240
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,790
form of protest himself
against people in power.

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,560
There's different theories about this,

242
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,500
but it's not very good Greek
and it's not very well written.

243
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:51,280
But it does have a fairly intricate
and interesting structure.

244
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,540
And I call this a structure
of cycles on the spiral.

245
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,660
I've titled Your Outline a spiral outline
of revelation because the story a lot

246
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:02,320
of people have read revelation.
Well,

247
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,550
let me also back up and explain what's
different this week from what we did last

248
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,340
week. Last week, if you recall,

249
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,550
I spent a lot of time talking
about Hebrews and medieval
interpretation because

250
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:16,300
I was trying to illustrate
how the historical critical
interpretation of these

251
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,970
texts that I'm teaching you in the
semester is not the only way to do it.

252
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,890
There are other kinds of allegorical,

253
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:24,850
theological literary ways to read these
texts and those are perfectly fine.

254
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,140
Now though,

255
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm completely reverting back to the
historical critical way of reading this

256
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:34,921
text because partly because the way that
so many people in popular culture read

257
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:39,400
revelation, especially very conservative
Christians, is to read it about our time.

258
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,460
It's been read over and over again to be
about English wars or World War One or

259
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:49,000
World War II or most recently in in the
late great planet earth and these kinds

260
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:49,450
of things.

261
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,690
It's about the Soviet Union versus the
United States of America and everything

262
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:57,230
that talks about is his, is referring to
what's going to happen in our lifetimes.

263
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,000
So the,
the weird animals,

264
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:02,030
the locus type things that have the
heads of men and fly through the air.

265
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,760
There are all kinds of modern Christians.
You say, oh, those are helicopters.

266
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,870
The author didn't know what a helicopter
look black in the ancient world.

267
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:11,810
So he just describe kind of what he saw.
But we know now those are helicopters.

268
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,620
So he's actually describing a big war
that's going to break out around Israel

269
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:18,890
and in Israel when the whole world's
going to come to this big cataclysmic

270
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:21,800
nuclear war. And it's all talked
about right here in revelation.

271
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,630
Well obviously I'm not going to do that.

272
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,800
What I'm going to show you
is how historians read this
text precisely by putting

273
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,330
it back in its ancient context.

274
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,950
But one of the things is if you notice
the book of revelation doesn't give one

275
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:36,230
strict timeline. In fact, it key,

276
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:41,231
it seems to have cycles of setting
up some kind of weird crisis,

277
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,150
having all these terrible things happen.

278
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,450
And then have something that looks like
a quasi resolution and then starting the

279
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,150
cycle again.
So that's so,

280
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,960
and it ends up being a big cataclysmic,
a crash at the end of the book.

281
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,891
So this is what I call this,

282
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,790
a spiral of cycles that are going
on in the book of revelation.

283
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,110
So first though,

284
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,260
look at just chapters six through eight
and I'm going to walk you through this

285
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:13,481
very rapidly because you can see something
of the structure of this book right

286
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:18,990
here. Now this is after you've had, um,

287
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,160
all the kinds of a song,
this,

288
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,490
the letters in the beginning of revelation
than you've had the throne room seem

289
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,960
of God was going to
talk about in a minute.

290
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:29,030
And all the songs that everybody's saying,

291
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,120
but let's just walk through
this first structure here.

292
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,510
Then I saw the lamb opened,

293
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:41,780
one of the seven seals and I heard one
of the four living creatures call out as

294
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:46,190
with the voice of thunder come.
I looked and there was a white horse,

295
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,660
its rider had a bow,

296
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,840
a crown was given to him and he
came out conquering and to conquer.

297
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,800
So this is conquering and
warfare is this first horse.

298
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,640
When you opened the second seal,
now you know what he's going with seals.

299
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,751
You picture this.

300
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,450
Now we've talked about how books were
composed in the ancient world and we

301
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:07,250
talked about scrolls. Things were in
scrolls, not in books like this, right?

302
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:10,670
With all the different pages all sewn
together. So what he's imagining,

303
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:14,240
what he's looking at, he's seeing is
there's this huge scroll in the sky,

304
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,541
you know,

305
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,990
and that and that this angel is his
holding and doing different things with,

306
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,020
well, when you want to
finish a letter or a book,

307
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,940
you roll up the scroll and then you put
a wax seal where the paper that at the

308
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,860
end of the role,
and that seals the book.

309
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,770
So anybody who wants to read
that letter or that book first,

310
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,550
the first time has to break that wax seal.
So that's the seals.

311
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,260
He's talking about.
Other wax seals on a scroll.

312
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,580
And so he imagines that you've got this
girl that has one seal and you can break

313
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,950
that seal and you can unroll
the scroll a little bit.

314
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,420
But then you get another seal so you
under undo that seal and you can enroll a

315
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:47,631
bit more.

316
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:52,080
So he's gradually unrolling this scroll
that's going to have all these things

317
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:53,640
pop out of it.
So this is big,

318
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:57,270
huge scroll that has can horses and riders
jumping out of it and flying through

319
00:17:57,271 --> 00:18:01,300
the air. He opened the second
seal, I heard the second
living creature caught out,

320
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:04,050
come and out came another horse,
bright red.

321
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,990
It's rider was permitted to take peace
from the earth so that the people would

322
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:09,240
slaughter one another and
he was given a great sword.

323
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,050
So if the first seal releases this
horse that it looks like empire,

324
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,440
the conquering of the conqueror.
The second is just general warfare.

325
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,640
When he opened the third seal, I heard
the third living creature collect come.

326
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,200
I looked and there was a black horse.

327
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,980
Its rider had a pair of scales in his
hand and I heard what seemed to be a voice

328
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:29,430
in the midst of the four living creatures
saying a quart of wheat for a day's

329
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:32,340
pay and three quarts of
barley for a day's pay.

330
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,010
But do my do not damage the
olive oil and the wine. So the,

331
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,010
the third seal is what?
Famine, famine and poverty.

332
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,290
When you opened the fourth seal,

333
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,740
I heard the voice of the fourth living
creature called.com and I looked and

334
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:48,330
there was a pale green horse.

335
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,570
It's writer's name was death
and hades followed with him.

336
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,080
They were given authority over the
fourth of the earth to kill with a sword,

337
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:58,470
famine and pestilence,
and by the wild animals of the earth.

338
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,350
So death is this foursome.

339
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,180
When I opened the fifth seal,
I saw under the alter notice he's,

340
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,680
we're not talking about horseman anymore.

341
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,650
You had four horsemen representing
four different things.

342
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,280
The fifth seal has
something like a digression.

343
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:17,190
The fifth seal is not another horse
like you expect. In other words,

344
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,470
you're given to expect that
you're going to see another horse.

345
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:22,320
It's going to be some other catastrophe,
but you don't get that.

346
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:25,080
You have a digression under the alter,

347
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,360
the souls of those who have been
slaughtered for the word of God.

348
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,420
And for the testimony they had given,
they cried out with a loud voice.

349
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,130
[inaudible] sovereign Lord,
holy and true.

350
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,640
How long will it be before you judge and
avenge our blood on the inhabitants of

351
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,300
the earth?

352
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,570
They were each given a white robe and
told to rest a little longer until the

353
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:42,450
number would be complete, both
of their fellow slaves. It says,

354
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:46,520
actually in the Greek, not servants
and of their brothers and this,

355
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:49,050
and it doesn't say sisters.
There's no, there's no,

356
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,690
almost no women in this text at all.
It's all men,

357
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,140
virgin men who've never been
polluted by touching women.

358
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,510
It's not exactly a pro woman book.

359
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,600
You might not get that idea if you
have an English translation that keeps

360
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:03,090
putting sisters in here, but it's,
and there are no sisters in this book.

361
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,350
There's the whore of Babylon.
There's the mother bride.

362
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,960
And then there are men,
uh,

363
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,501
your slaves,

364
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:16,260
your fellow brothers who are soon to
be killed as they themselves had been

365
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:18,630
killed. So what's the fifth seal? Well,

366
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:22,620
it gives them a vision of the altar of
God in the Temple of God. In heaven.

367
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,670
There's this big altar and under the
alter the souls of all the followers of

368
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:30,390
Jesus who have been martyred up to this
time and the souls of those people who

369
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:34,470
will be martyred and they're not
punished, right? They're saying how long,

370
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:38,580
how long? And he says, Oh, you know, keep
your pants on. Here's a white robe. Just,

371
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,920
you know,
sit there and be nice under the altar.

372
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,260
We're going to take care of it all very,
very soon.

373
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,980
So the fifth seal is actually a digression
that tells you the audience that if

374
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:53,590
you suffer in this present time,
it will be taken care of by God.

375
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,850
So he had these four building up of
terrible things and the fifth is a

376
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,760
digression that gives you comfort.
But now we're going to get back.

377
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,350
He opened the sixth seal. I looked and
never came out of her great earthquake.

378
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,200
The Sun became black as sackcloth.
The full moon became like blood.

379
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,790
The stars of the sky fell to the earth.

380
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,700
As fig tree drops its winter
fruit when shaken by a gale,

381
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,430
the sky vanished like a
scroll rolling itself up.

382
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:19,180
Remember I talked about how the sky
in ancient cosmology isn't just air.

383
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:20,890
It's actually a firm thing.

384
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,380
It's like a big piece of
leather or something like that.

385
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:27,370
This that sits up there and there's
water on the other side of it and in most

386
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,980
ancient cosmologies or something on
the other side of it. So when you,

387
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:32,920
when he talks about seeing the
sky rolled up like a scroll,

388
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,310
he means that quite literally this guy
goes straight, chick, chick, chick, chick,

389
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:38,980
chick, chick, chick, chick, chick in
rose up. And you can see heaven above it.

390
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,720
So the sky vanished like a scroll.
Every mountain and island was moved in.

391
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,050
It's place than the kings of the earth
and the magnets and the generals and the

392
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:48,490
rich and the powerful and everyone.

393
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:51,430
Slave and free hid in the caves and
among the rocks of the mountains,

394
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:54,430
calling to the mountains and rocks fall
on us and hide us from the face of the

395
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:55,360
one seated on the throne.

396
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,270
And from the wrath of the lamb for
the great day of their wrath has come.

397
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:01,930
And who is able to stand? So the
sixth seal is all hell breaks loose.

398
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,600
The Cosmos was coming
down on top of itself.

399
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:10,170
He's created an increasing level of
anxiety and catastrophe with this,

400
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,950
these sit others. But with that
fifth seal is kind of a digression.

401
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,070
After this I saw four angels.
Now you think, Oh man,

402
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,330
if the sixth seal was like that,
you know one more seal is coming up.

403
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,100
What's the seventh seal going to be?
So you can just [inaudible] remember this.

404
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,550
All this was read out loud in the ancient
world. So you're hearing all of this.

405
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,550
I saw four angels standing
at the four corners,

406
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:34,990
earth hurting back to the
four winds of the earth.

407
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,310
Now you get a bunch of other stuff.
I saw another angel ascend,

408
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,110
heard the number of those who are sealed.
Oh,

409
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,880
now you have all the followers of Jesus
are numbered into a different tribes of

410
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:50,710
12,000 piece and each of those tribes
is sealed to themselves in that

411
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:52,780
interesting.
And you have another use of the term seal.

412
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,700
But now this is a seal that's put on the
the faces of all the people who are the

413
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:01,990
true followers, who are the true
Israel? 12 tribes, like the 12 tribe,

414
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:04,660
the lost 10 tribes and the
other two tribes of Israel.

415
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,780
So there's the reconstituting of Israel
now and they're sealed and the seal is a

416
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:14,350
good thing. It means you won't be
harmed if you have this on you. Okay?

417
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,760
Net goes on all of chapter seven. Now
you're thinking, where's the seven seal?

418
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,430
You know, we had six, I know
there's another one coming.
Where is it? And you, you,

419
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:29,350
you have to wait all the way through
chapter seven wanting the seventh CEO,

420
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:33,040
but you're not getting it yet. In other
words, he's just stringing you along,

421
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,350
but he's stringing you along in a
way that's kind of good because he's

422
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,360
reassuring you. You know, the seven
seals come in and you're just,

423
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:42,490
you're pretty sure it's going
to be really, really, really,

424
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:46,760
really bad because the sixth seal was,
but before you get to the seventh seal,

425
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,220
you have this ceiling of you.

426
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:53,450
If you're a faithful follower of
Jesus with the reassurance of a seal.

427
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,420
So you have, and then you have some
songs. We're gonna talk about some songs,

428
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:59,090
but everybody comes in, you know,
it's like a Broadway play, right?

429
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,240
You have something happen and then the
chorus all runs on stage and they do a

430
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,880
little song blessed to be the lamb in the
pilot, in the power, power, power, power.

431
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:07,850
Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hailey. And then
they run off and you have more action.

432
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,300
So that's the way the story is structured
that way. Also, for instance, music.

433
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,530
So we get to the end of chapter seven
we're finally the tender and who gets to

434
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:17,510
chapter eight of course,
they're not numbered in the ancient world,

435
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:21,860
but when the lamb opened the seventh seal,

436
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,640
you ready for this? There was
silence in heaven for a half an hour.

437
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,540
That's the seventh seal.
Well, let's go on on this.

438
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:37,570
The text builds up tension and you hear
this read out loud and it keeps building

439
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:41,870
up this tension.
But then this,

440
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,930
the seventh seal is such a anticlimax
silence in heaven for a half an hour.

441
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,250
But then it doesn't explain anything
about that. It just starts over.

442
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,650
Then you have another
cycle a little bit later.

443
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,060
Another angel that golden censer came
and stood by the altar. In other words,

444
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:00,770
what you've got is something like this.

445
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,380
You have these four scroll, the
four seals, which are terrible,

446
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:10,790
terrible, terrible, awful things.
And then you have the fifth,

447
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,250
which is a digression. And actually
it's actually a good thing. It's this,

448
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,080
it's the telling of the souls have been
martyred. Don't worry, you'll be saved.

449
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,880
Here's a white robe, relax. And then you
had the sixth seal, which is another,

450
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,710
uh, worst thing than all these. It's
really, really bad and it goes on longer.

451
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,710
And then you had this long digression
again, this like five is like,

452
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,520
like the fifth seal. It's a ceiling of
the followers of Jesus with salvation.

453
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,840
And then after that digression,
then you have this seventh seal,

454
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:46,760
which is really kind of anticlimactic,
but it's not bad because you know,

455
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:48,110
silence in heaven for a half an hour.

456
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,980
Look at your spiral outline now because
this kind of structure of having a cycle

457
00:25:55,881 --> 00:26:00,710
of catastrophes that are interrupted
every once in a while by some kind of

458
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:05,000
digression that then
ends with something good.

459
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,090
That's the way the whole book
is structured in several,

460
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:10,340
in three different cycles.
So for example,

461
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:12,200
I said in in the fourth
chapter of revelation,

462
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,090
you have the big heavenly
throne room scene,

463
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,380
revelation five you have the introduction
of the scroll with seven seals in the

464
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:22,640
land and then you have the first cycle
of seven and that's what I just walked

465
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:27,560
you through just now. But then right
after eight one the silence in heaven,

466
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,730
it starts again with a second cycle and
you have an eight to introduction of

467
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:35,810
seven angels with seven trumpets. And
then again you have for the first, second,

468
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:38,450
third and fourth trumpet which
announced these kinds of catastrophes.

469
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,980
And then you have an interlude where
this ego comes through and announces woes

470
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,823
on everybody.

471
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,280
And then you had the fifth trumpet in
Chapter Nine One through 12 and the sixth

472
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:52,550
trumpet in Chapter Nine Verse 13 and
then you have chapter 10 which has been

473
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,160
another interlude which says that's
about the scroll of Prophecy.

474
00:26:56,161 --> 00:27:00,720
Chapter 11 you have the talk about the
temple and he has to measure the temple.

475
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,880
And then in chapter in chapter 1114
you have the end of the second. Whoa.

476
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,900
And that's one of the third world.

477
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:09,600
And finally in 1115 you
have the seventh trumpet.

478
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,330
And what does the seventh trumpet
introduce? Praise in heaven,

479
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,740
sorta like that half hour of silence.
And then you have a long interlude,

480
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:20,060
which is chapter 1213
and 14 which is about uh,

481
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,270
battles between the woman who's the
mother of the church or as a mother of the

482
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:28,200
savior. And the Dragon. Chapter 13
is about the dragon and the beast.

483
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,760
Chapter 14 is about the lamb, the horned
lamb, which represents Jesus, whose horn,

484
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,190
a horned lamb who has wounded.

485
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,970
And then you haven't an an
starting in chapter 15 verse one,

486
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,050
you have a third cycle of seven
angels and seven plugs are bowls.

487
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,960
And then you have the great conclusion,
which is a very end,

488
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:50,370
the destruction of Rome and chapters
17 through 19, the final battle,

489
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,380
which is chapter 1911 through 21,

490
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,080
the imprisonment and a mutual
destruction of enemies,

491
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,550
which just chapter 20 and
the establishment of the new
Jerusalem and chapters 21

492
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:00,384
and 22.

493
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,010
What is this structure tell us because
the structures in these different cycles,

494
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,690
it builds up crisis and
then it gives you something,

495
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,820
a relief at the end.

496
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,350
There's a famous New testament scholar
who teaches at the divinity school.

497
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,470
This time is not me, uh, who
teaches in the divinities goal.

498
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,130
Adella Yarbrough Collins. And many
years ago when I was still a student,

499
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:28,131
I read this book she wrote called crisis
and Catharsis and it's a wonderful book

500
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,640
about revelation.

501
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,800
And her thesis was the very purpose of
the book of revelation is to build up a

502
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:39,540
sense of crisis in early followers
of Jesus. If you're, if you're,

503
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,190
if you're too comfortable with your world,

504
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,700
you don't know that things are really a
lot worse than what you think they are.

505
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,270
So if it's addressed to Christians
who are, if they're comfortable,

506
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:51,210
it wants to make them
uncomfortable with Roman rule,

507
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,580
and if they're uncomfortable with Roman
rule and feel depressed and oppressed,

508
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,200
then eventually the book will
lead them to feeling comfort.

509
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,560
So crisis is created by the book in order
to have let you experience a catharsis

510
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,320
of the salvation and the looping structure
of the book tries to work that out

511
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:18,390
psychologically in its hearers and
you can see how it's going to do.

512
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:19,980
So the book is actually,

513
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:25,440
it's part of the thing about it is
meant to be performed. You, you,

514
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,100
you're hearing it read
out loud is a long book,

515
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,670
but you sit there and you imagine a
bunch of Christians in Asia minor in some

516
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:36,660
church, say in Ephesus and their meeting,
it's dark. They're meeting in some house,

517
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:40,340
somewhere in somebody's dining room
and somebody has sent around, uh, this,

518
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,550
this document and ask it to be red.

519
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,760
So you're all sitting around with just
some candles going on and somebody

520
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:48,370
reading this book and it's got
all these strange things going on,

521
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,520
strange creatures and
a lot of these songs,

522
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,080
the things that people are singing and
angels are singing and beasts are singing

523
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:59,200
and, and elders are singing.
It started liking that in
the fourth chapter. Look at,

524
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,590
look at the fourth chapter,
a revelation.

525
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,490
And this is where we're
in the throne room of God.

526
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,090
After this I looked and there in heaven
adore, stood open. And the first voice,

527
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:17,100
which I had heard speaking
to me like a trumpet said,

528
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:19,920
come up here and that will show you
what must take place after this.

529
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,050
And once I was in the spirit
and they're in heaven,

530
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:25,140
stood a throne with one seated on the
throne and one seated there looks like

531
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:26,310
Jasper and Carnelian.

532
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,310
And around the throne is a rainbow that
looks like an emerald and around the

533
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:32,700
throne or 24 Thrones and seated on the
throne to 24 elders dressed in white

534
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:35,580
robes with golden crowns on their heads
coming from the throne or flashes of

535
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:38,190
lightning. Rumblings and peals
of thunder in front of the thumb.

536
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:40,410
Seven flaming torches where
the seven spirits of God,

537
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:43,080
you have all that's going on and
then then they, they bake. They,

538
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:44,970
the four living creatures
are these monsters,

539
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:48,450
combination kind of monster creatures
are standing around the throne and they

540
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:50,520
start singing holy, holy, holy. The Lord,

541
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:53,400
the Almighty who was and
who is and who his do come.

542
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,250
And then you see other the 24 elders
in their singing another song.

543
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,080
The whole thing is meant to be seen
in your mind, not just read silent.

544
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,880
So we're going to do a little experiment
here to show how that might happen.

545
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,850
All right?
We're going to break up into thirds.

546
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,990
You get to be the four living creatures.
Alrighty.

547
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,330
And then we're going to split the rest
of the class right here. Y'All get to be,

548
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,840
I think it's the elders. I can remember,
but, and then you got another group.

549
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,730
So here, these are the quotations. So
here's, I want you to say this with me.

550
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,710
Very soft at first, right? And
don't rush, don't get faster.

551
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,870
I'm a musician. You know I'm going to
make you stick with the tempo I set

552
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,640
holy,
holy,

553
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:44,641
holy is the Lord God Almighty who was
and who is and who is to come play it.

554
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,240
Holy,
Holy,

555
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:54,241
holy is the Lord God Almighty who was
and two is and two is to come again.

556
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
Holy,
Holy,

557
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:03,481
holy is the Lord God Almighty
who was and two is and

558
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,130
worthy is the lamb that was slain.

559
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,070
Worthy is the lamb that was slain.
Don't rush.

560
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,190
Worthy is the lamb that was slain.

561
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,260
Worthy is the lamb that was slain.
Keep doing it.

562
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,550
Glory on or power to the
o Lord Most High Glory.

563
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,790
Honor power to thee.
O Lord Most High Glory honor.

564
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,810
Power to the o Lord Most
High Goolarri under power

565
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,790
to the island. I get a little
bit louder. Good. Laurie on

566
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,570
the smoke in the throne room

567
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,320
[inaudible] there are
beasts flapping their wings.

568
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:57,790
[inaudible] who was and who is and two
is now close your eyes and get louder.

569
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,250
Is the lamb that was slain

570
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,870
worthy is the lamb that was slain.

571
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,190
Worthy is the lamb that was slain.

572
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:18,010
Glory, honor, power to the now. Louder.

573
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,941
Laurie.

574
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:23,800
On her power to the alarm
most louder glory, honor,

575
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,760
power to the our lung.

576
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:30,590
Mo's Haim worthy is the lamb
that was slang ladders down.

577
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,810
Don't you shouting,
shout it.

578
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,350
[inaudible] [inaudible]
ladder.

579
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,250
Who was s stop.

580
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,953
It feels something.

581
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,530
There's both to feel something.
You're supposed to kind of feel weird.

582
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,110
You're supposed to feel, you know,
uncomfortable. Just a little bit.

583
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,280
You're supposed to feel a little tingle
because reading revelation as if it's a

584
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:17,380
blueprint for you know,

585
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,260
Jesus coming back and what's going to
happen with the Republicans and the

586
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:25,261
Democrats kind of misses the point
because what it really is doing,

587
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:30,340
it's trying to pull you into a
world at very performative world.

588
00:34:30,341 --> 00:34:32,770
That's the thing. This is, it
really is like a stage show,

589
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,700
except as the stage is the whole cosmos
and all kinds of weird things that are

590
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:37,534
happening all around.

591
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,020
So part of what's going on here to use
professor Collins phrase is it introduces

592
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:47,050
this sense of a crisis in the,
in the cosmos.

593
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,710
But it doesn't do that because
it wants you to in the end,

594
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:55,740
simply live in that crisis is because
the author believes God's gonna take care

595
00:34:56,081 --> 00:35:00,910
of the crisis of eventually,
but not necessarily today.

596
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,220
And so the book,

597
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:08,370
having this book performed in your Church
for you read out loud in the middle of

598
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,910
the night deals with your sense
of persecution if you have one.

599
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,440
But what if you don't have
a sense of persecution?

600
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,090
What of your actually fairly
comfortable with wrong?

601
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,770
What if you're, you know, fairly
well off. You've got a good business.

602
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,050
The Romana them, the Roman peace
actually allows you to travel.

603
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,730
You can get on a ship and not have
to worry about pirates unlike today

604
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,650
or unlock. It was 100 years
before this cause back. You know,

605
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:45,330
pump pay was the general who,

606
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,130
who cleaned the pirates out of the
Mediterranean in the first century BCE.

607
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,610
So if you're a businessman,
you're a fairly well off.

608
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,210
You might think that the Roman peace,

609
00:35:56,211 --> 00:35:59,940
there's a pretty good thing and sure a
few people's heads got to get cracked

610
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:04,200
every once in a while to keep the peace.
That's just the way it is. So the,

611
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,830
the letter, the, the book of revelation
seems to have a dual purpose.

612
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,530
It's like that old saying
about what good preaching is.

613
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,290
Good preaching is supposed to comfort the
afflicted and afflict the comfortable.

614
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,160
That's kind of what the book of
revelation seems to try to do.

615
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,600
So could cause notice. What is the
view of, of Rome that you get here?

616
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,180
Look in revelation 18 and 19.

617
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,653
Yeah.

618
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,670
If you got a picture of,
if all you had was the letters of Paul,

619
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,650
what might you think about
Rome? What might you think
about the government? What,

620
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,400
what might you think about the emperor?
If all you had were certain other,

621
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,280
uh,
books such as the pastoral epistles,

622
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,320
what would you think the about
their politics. But with this,

623
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:55,120
there's no way you could find
this author saying something like,

624
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,470
honor the emperor,

625
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,420
which is precisely what you get in some
other early Christian letters after this.

626
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:04,420
I saw another angel coming
down from heaven having
great authority and the Earth

627
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:07,780
was made bright with this blender. He
called out with a mighty voice. Fallen,

628
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:11,350
fallen is Babylon. The great has
become a dwelling place of demons,

629
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,350
haunt of every foul spirit,
a haunt of every foul bird,

630
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:18,280
a haunt of every fowl and hateful beast
for all the nations have drunk of the

631
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:20,890
wine of the wrath of her fornication.

632
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,680
And the kings of the earth have
committed fornication with her,

633
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,830
and the merchants and the earth have
gone rich from the power of her luxury.

634
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,720
This is clearly wrong.
Babylon is the code name for Rome here.

635
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,850
I mean, we know it is because,
and I'm, uh, chapter 17,

636
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,410
verse nine. In verse 18, he talks about
this city as being on seven hills,

637
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:46,360
referring to the famous seven hills
of Rome. And of course in chapter 13,

638
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,650
18,
uh,

639
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,080
this calls for women for
wisdom, not women, um,

640
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,340
so that no one can buy herself,
does not have the mark of the beast,

641
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:01,730
the name of the beast or the number
of its name. This calls for wisdom.

642
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:02,564
Let everyone,

643
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,110
anyone with understanding calculate the
number of the beast for it is the number

644
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:06,944
of a person.

645
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,280
It's number is 666 what is 666 well,

646
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:18,770
back in the 80s, some of us left
us, said Ronald Wilson. Reagan are,

647
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,750
you can come up with all kinds
of different other things.

648
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,190
Scholars think that if
you take the word Nero,

649
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,810
the name of the emperor,
uh,

650
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,290
and you spell it in near
Iran with a final end,

651
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:36,100
like you would a,
in the Hebrew letters,

652
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,360
it comes out to be 666 add
up those three letters.

653
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,860
Now you'll notice there's also a footnote
that says other ancient authorities

654
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:49,861
say 616 so some scribe comes
along and sees 666 is that,

655
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:54,640
oh no, that can't be right. It
must be 616 and it's actually,

656
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,100
that makes a lot of sense.
If this is supposed to refer to neuro,

657
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,910
because if you spelled Nero's
name slightly differently
in a way that was still

658
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:02,290
possible to spell it.
For the ancient world,

659
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:07,410
it comes out to be 616 rather than 666
which leads a lot of us scholars just to

660
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:08,860
thank the writers,

661
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:13,861
probably referring to narrow in some way
and Nero's a beast and Nero is that the

662
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:18,100
whore, the Rome is the
whore that's, you know,

663
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:21,880
had sex with every rich man and every
king throughout the whole world.

664
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:26,920
So this is not a very positive view of
Rome and Rome of course is completely

665
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:30,920
destroyed at the end. The,
the part about Nero's,

666
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,560
we don't know when this text was written,

667
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:37,360
some people actually
believe that revelation was
written in the 60s when Nero

668
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:38,081
was himself.

669
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:42,760
The emperor more tend to believe that's
written toward the end of the century

670
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,130
when Nero had already been dead.

671
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,840
But this refers to a great myth
from the ancient world called Nero.

672
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,723
Read a V Boosie.

673
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,120
Yeah. The myth was that Nero was
such a terrible, terrible, terrible,

674
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:02,330
bad man that even though
he'd been assassinated,

675
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,830
he was going to rise from the dead
someday or some people have believed he

676
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:10,430
wasn't ever a dad. He was just, he escaped
and was off living with the Parthians,

677
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:14,480
who are these people who lived on the
very eastern corner of the Roman Empire?

678
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:20,080
So the idea was Nia was
still alive somewhere and he
was gonna raise an army of

679
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:25,100
Parthians and he was gonna come back and
he was going to wage war and take over

680
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:26,360
the Roman Empire again,

681
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,770
or he was going to rise from the dead and
raise an army and take over the empire

682
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:35,630
again. And this was especially chilling
for followers of Jesus because Nero was,

683
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,530
was well known in the end of the century
for being the first emperor to have

684
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:42,830
persecuted the followers of Jesus in Rome.

685
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,730
The famous story is that, you know,
Nero, there was a big fire in Rome,

686
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,600
and Nero was blamed for
the fire because he was,

687
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:52,340
he clearing a bunch of
apartment buildings,

688
00:40:52,341 --> 00:40:54,560
have it lower income people
out of a certain area of Rome.

689
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:58,370
It's right by the coliseum to build
his huge big palace. And in fact,

690
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:03,290
now if you go to Rome, they've opened
up the Golden House, I call it. And, uh,

691
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:07,400
this was the palace that Nero built.
Um, and it's beautiful and you go,

692
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:09,770
you have to go under the ground to get
into it and see it and everything because

693
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,750
now it's all covered by the grant.
But do you go to Rome,

694
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,870
get tickets and go to the new rose palace?

695
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,260
Because it's only in the last several
years has been reopened for the public.

696
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:23,210
But the idea was Nero had actually burned
a bunch of tenements in our to make

697
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:26,570
room for his palace.
But because this was so unpopular,

698
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,990
he blamed it on the Christians. He
said, ah, the Christian set the fire,

699
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,490
the Christians are
those really bad people.

700
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,700
And the story goes that he had a big
barbecues in his palace grounds and he put

701
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,880
the bodies of Christians
covered with tar on steaks,

702
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,820
crucified them and put them on
steaks and let them, and they,

703
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:47,870
they're burning bodies provided
the torchlight for his party.

704
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,120
This is the story that was circulated
about Nero by later Christians and by

705
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:53,954
other people too.

706
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,150
So for followers of Jesus Nero was
this terrible figure who they were,

707
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,330
thought he might even rise again from
the dead and do battle against us.

708
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,330
So who does all this make sense of this?

709
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,360
The writer is giving this big myth.
Obviously the whore is killed,

710
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,340
Babylon is killed. Romans destroyed.
All the wealthy people are destroyed.

711
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:18,650
All the kings of the
earth and destroyed by,

712
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,180
by the angels and by Jesus coming down
and then the setting up of the new

713
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:26,540
Jerusalem with this gold and beautiful.
And there's,

714
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,460
there's no night or day there because
God is light and everybody lives happily

715
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:35,620
ever after. But what is the kind
of situation if this speaks to,

716
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,770
we're going to go back to the beginning
of revelation. Now look at chapter two.

717
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,960
These are the letters.

718
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,690
Do we know it was written
by a guy named John?

719
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,520
He says he was in prison on the isle
of Patmos in the Mediterranean when he

720
00:42:57,521 --> 00:42:58,354
wrote this.

721
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,110
And then you circulate it around and he
starts off with these seven letters to

722
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:06,670
seven churches, to the angel of
the Church in Ephesus. Ephesus.

723
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,660
Hmm. We've seen ethicists. Heaven. We,

724
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,750
one of Paul Pseudo Paul's letters
may have been addressed to Ephesus.

725
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,910
Paul apparently did found a church in
Ephesus and it was one of his this bigger

726
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:23,590
churches.
It seems like he spent years there.

727
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,610
These are the words of him who holds
the seven stars in his right hand,

728
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,600
who walks among the seven golden lamp
shade lamp stands. I know your works,

729
00:43:31,601 --> 00:43:34,990
your toil and your patient endurance. I
know that you cannot tolerate evil doers.

730
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:38,320
Do you have tested those who claim to
be apostles but are not and have found

731
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:41,350
them to be false so there's false
apostles want running around.

732
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,190
I also know that you are
enduring patiently and
bearing up for the sake of my

733
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:50,050
name and that you have not grown weary.
But I have this against you. See,

734
00:43:50,051 --> 00:43:54,040
some of the letters are mainly letters
of praise to the churches and some of

735
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,420
them are scolding letters.

736
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,710
So it's interesting to see what does he
scold people for and what does he praise

737
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:04,300
them for? Remember then from
what you have fallen, repent,

738
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:09,010
so this is a back slid church. He
thinks do the works you did at first.

739
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,730
If not,

740
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,640
I will come to you and remove your lamp
stand from its place unless you repent.

741
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,060
Yet this is to your credit,
you hate the works of the Nicolaitans,

742
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:18,760
which I also hate. While we don't want to
know anything about the Nikolay Athens,

743
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,050
so that doesn't tell us much.

744
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,830
Let anyone who has an ear listen to what
the spirit is saying to the churches,

745
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,120
to everyone who conquers,

746
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,720
I will give permission to eat from the
tree of life that is in the paradise of

747
00:44:28,721 --> 00:44:32,550
God to the, and then it goes onto
another. So there's false apostles.

748
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:34,060
But then again,
um,

749
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,480
to nine I know your
affliction and your poverty,

750
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:40,500
even though you are rich.

751
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,130
I know the slander on the part of those
who say that they are Jews but are not,

752
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:48,960
but are a synagogue of Satan. So there's
this poverty that he's praising poverty.

753
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:53,070
He talks about people who are Jews say
they're Jews, but they're not two 13.

754
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,290
I know where you are living.
This is to Pergamum,

755
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:58,560
which happened to be a huge
site of the imperial cult,

756
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,190
the cult to the emperor that you can go
there. Now I'm going to be there in June.

757
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,710
Why don't you jealous and you can
go to the top of this mountain.

758
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:09,711
The acra Acropolis in Pergamum and the
Austrian are archeologists are rebuilding

759
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,140
all these temples to uh,
um,

760
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,690
to Trajan and Hadrian
on the top of this film.

761
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,210
Of course Trajan and Hadrian
or after he wrote this,

762
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:21,990
but there was still a big emperor cult
there. I know where you are living,

763
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,540
where Satan's throne is.
Well,

764
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:28,890
maybe that's a reference to the
emperor cult itself. You are not,

765
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,410
you are holding fast to my name.
You did not deny your faith in me.

766
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:34,560
Even the days of Antipas my witness,
I have some things against you.

767
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:39,180
You have some, well, I'm running out of
time, but let me tell you what basically,

768
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:42,030
he really doesn't like.
He doesn't like a woman named,

769
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,870
he calls Jezza Bell who is one of
the prophets in one of the churches.

770
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,860
He doesn't like rich people.
He says stuff about idolatry,

771
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,490
which makes it sound like he doesn't like
people who are eating meat sacrificed

772
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:54,300
to idols.

773
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,540
We don't think there are any of these
churches that were actually practicing

774
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,710
pagan idolatry.

775
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,100
What probably going on is he's knows
that there are some Christians who are

776
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:04,980
eating meat sacrificed to idols
and he calls that idolatry.

777
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:10,310
Now let's think about which churches are
in this area of western Asia minor that

778
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:13,620
have women as leaders in them.

779
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:17,790
They've been told by their apostle that
it's okay to eat meat sacrificed to

780
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:21,120
idols,
and some of them are not that poor.

781
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:23,940
Like there seemed to be people in
Corinth who seem to be fairly well off.

782
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,640
Maybe this guy,
and this is just a theory,

783
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,390
but I think it's fun to think about
maybe he's actually writing to Paul's

784
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:35,391
churches precisely because
he thinks they're too
comfortable with Roman rule and

785
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:40,260
he wants to make them uncomfortable
with Roman rule in order to turn them

786
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:45,261
against Rome and to convert him to his
own vision about this anti Roman version

787
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:50,550
of the Gospel. And that's
why he constructs, as I said,

788
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,100
if you're troubled,
if you feel like you're oppressed,

789
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,200
you're supposed to be
comforted by this text.

790
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,760
But if you're too comfortable
with the Pax Romana them,

791
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,960
you're supposed to be made uncomfortable
by the text and get on the right side.

792
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,301
On Wednesday,

793
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:09,900
we'll talk about some texts that may have
been more comfortable with Roman rule.
