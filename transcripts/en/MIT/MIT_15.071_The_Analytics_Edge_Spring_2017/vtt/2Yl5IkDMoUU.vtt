00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.930
Let me comment on the
merits of heatmaps

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.710
as a way of representing data
in the context of representing

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.660
crime activity.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.350
Criminal activity-related
data often

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.200
has both components
of time and location.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.880
Sometimes, all that is
required is a line chart,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.180
but heatmaps can
visualize data that

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.190
will be too big for a table.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.070
Plotting data on maps
is much more effective

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.900
than a table for location based
data, and is eye catching.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.560
What is the edge of
predictive policing?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.970
Many police forces are
exploiting their databases

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.020
to focus finite resources
on problem areas.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.720
Not only do analytics
help improve policework,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.940
the outputs are also
good communication tools

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.590
to decision makers in
government, and the wider

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.690
public.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.210
The application of
analytics to data like this

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.180
is new and growing,
with companies

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.790
like PredPol and Palantir
leading the effort.
