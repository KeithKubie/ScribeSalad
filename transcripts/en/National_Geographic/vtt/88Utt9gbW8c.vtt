00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.509
 Mike Libecki:<i> Sixty five
 expeditions and counting</i>

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.012
<i> and the goal is to
 do 100 expeditions</i>

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.080
<i> by 100-years old.</i>

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.284
<i> This is what I call
 the Polar Bear Fang.</i>

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:21.487
<i> And I've been trying to
this tower for ten years.</i>

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.290
For a climber this is
as good as it gets

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.826
as far as unclimbed,
untouched.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.196
<i> This was a unique trip
because I had planned to go solo</i>

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.797
<i>and my younger brother said,</i>

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.700
<i> "Hey, I'd love to
 go on this trip."</i>

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.001 line:0%
And I was like, "We're going
to do this huge climb".

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.304 line:0%
He's not a climber but he
was gonna go along anyways

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.372 line:0%
and see what happened.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.675
And I thought, "Okay,
I can just teach you what to do.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:43.743
You can follow me up this climb.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.078
We'll go on the belief of
blood and brothers and

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:47.981
we'll communicate and
it'll work out."

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.715
<i>There's polar bears here.</i>

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:53.519
<i>The easiest way to be safe is
to sleep up high on a ledge.</i>

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.120
<i> You can see our
 base camp down below.</i>

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.858
<i>Immediately the next day,
after getting dropped off,</i>

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.494
<i>made a beautiful base camp,
 packed up our bags</i>

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:02.862
<i>and started shuttling loads.</i>

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.163
<i> That's the first view
 that we got</i>

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.931
<i> of the Polar Bear Fang
 from camp,</i>

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.634
<i> because there were some
big cliffs in front of us.</i>

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.403
<i> And so, at this point,
 we're getting up there</i>

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.304
<i> and we're starting to
 have to cross glaciers.</i>

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:14.907
<i> I'm teaching my brother
 how to tie into a rope.</i>

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:17.677
And, you know, how do you tie a
figure-eight knot again and...

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.011
<i> This is our high-camp,</i>

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:20.379
<i> From that high-camp,
 we still got about</i>

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.415
<i> half a mile to the
 base of the wall.</i>

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.517
<i> We went, we slept at
 the base of the wall</i>

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.918
<i> and we started climbing.</i>

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:28.854
<i>It got really serious because
my brother is not a climber.</i>

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.224
And so, he's on ascenders,
he's on Jumars

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.959
following me up the rope.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.361
and a lot of times we had fun
but lot of times I'm like

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.496
"Listen, you gotta do
this, this and this."

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.032
And, when I am leading pitches

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.101
I'm putting directionals in for
the rope to run a certain way

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.236
so he doesn't pull off a
rock and kill himself.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:47.673
And, you know, it was,
it was the real deal up there

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.642
and we put the cameras away.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.644
And I'm like,
"We've got to focus on safety."

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:54.513
There were three different
times I had to switch routes

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.181
because it was just too
loose and dangerous.

00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:58.651
There were two times where I
talked to him about it and said,

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:01.854
"We might have to bail,
it might be too dangerous."

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:04.323
And, honestly, my mom
she would kill me

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:06.759
if something happened to the
baby brother, to the youngest.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.860
( audience laughter )

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.629
<i>It was pretty exciting to stand
on top of the Polar Bear Fang</i>

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.600
<i> after a decade of
 wanting to be up there.</i>

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.002
( mimicking horns clashing )

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:19.072
Mike: Yeah, Year of the Ram!
Woo!

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:22.509
First ascent here in Greenland.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:25.945
Ah, now we got to figure
out how to get down.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.179
( audience laughter )

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.582
Time is now, life is sweet,
talk to you soon.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:31.317
( Mike chuckles )

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:34.621
He was a good sport to wear the
Year of the Ram mask, and...

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.822
But the summit is pretty
powerful, I mean,

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.491
there is an incredible feeling

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.227
about standing on a summit
in a fjord,

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.529
an area that's unexplored,
a climb that's--

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.197
You know, a new climb,
a first ascent, it's,

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:47.800
it's really a powerful feeling.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.168
<i> And to share it
 with my brother...</i>

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:51.137
<i> We're very close,
 we always have been,</i>

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:54.406
it was such a magical moment to
be up there with him.

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:56.943
And it was just incredible.
