00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:03.536
- This piece, I mean, wow.
- Yeah.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.271
- Yeah, that piece is a--
- Look at that red.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.407
I think it was
made in '25 or '26.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.576
- You're right.
- They called it a Red Bug.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.444
This was made by a company--

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.747
well, initially, Smith.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.415
So it was called
the Smith Flyer.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.250
And it had a fifth
wheel on the back.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.120
There was a wheel on the
back, OK, that drove it.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.856
And then later on,
in the teens, they

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.724
sold that to Briggs &amp; Stratton.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.093
And then a company
called Automotive

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:31.030
Electric Services bought this.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.333
And they started putting
these electric motors on.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.137
So the evolution of the Red
Bug or the Smith Flyer, this

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:40.273
is the last of it, with this
electric motor in this drive.

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.808
But yeah, they're super cool.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.718
There's a picture up
in the house somewhere.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.486
Walter's driving and
Beth's sitting beside him.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.587
It's a very cool picture.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.623
And they're, you know,
10 or 12 years old.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:59.559
It was originally bought
by my uncle for his family.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.561
Here's this a little
electric gadget that he

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.363
could just tool around in.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.231
We drove it around
the sidewalks.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.802
And he didn't really
like me to drive it.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.739
So the Red Bug, OK,
I'm interested in that.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:13.673
All right.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:14.641
And I'm interested
in the sign.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.742
OK.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.377
Do you have a number
on the Packard sign?

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.778
Five to six.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.581
In 1899, the Packard
automobile company

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:22.782
opened their doors.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:25.385
And they were in business
until the late 1950s.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.354
But in 1953, Packard
bought Studebaker

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.990
and became the
Studebaker-Packard Corporation.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.130
I think five to six is doable,
just because of the chip

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.432
I can see in the top,
and it's been repainted.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.034
If that chip wasn't there--

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.335
I haven't seen the
other side yet--

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.170
it'd be worth as much as 8,000.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.573
When you get up on it, you
can see that there's been

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.007
some restoration to the sign.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.109
There's some big chips
out of the porcelain.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.947
The paintwork was done well
enough to where, from far away,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:54.914
it looks amazing.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.716
But the sign,
guys, the guys that

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.886
want the mint signs
that will pick it apart

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.488
will notice that right away.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.957
They want mint stuff, almost
like a comic book collector,

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.358
when you're looking
at the yellowing

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:07.961
of the pages, and the edge, and
the cover, and all that stuff.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.262
They look at signs that way.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.998
What's also awesome is
the sign ring is there.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.666
They're always missing.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:14.434
What's it look like?

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.235
What's the back side?

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:18.371
[groans] Let me see here.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.406
I think-- it's very
similar to the other side.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.242
There's some-- there's
some big chips.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.210
See where-- see where
this was repaired?

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.712
I mean, not repaired,
but repainted.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.980
All right.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.214
That's the same thing that's
going on the other side,

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.349
but it's not repainted.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.984
Oo, aren't you so glad
you can see those now?

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.586
[laughs] Yeah, I
actually kind of am.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:37.724
Yes.
- How about 45 on the sign?

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.760
- How about 55?
- Yeah, I can't.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.961
I'm getting into-- I'm getting--

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.596
'cause I'm getting
into what it's worth.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.365
That's my retail number.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.267
That's not what
I can pay for it.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.301
Why don't we do this?

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:53.740
I do 45 on the sign
and 5 on the car.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.642
Hmm.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.744
Could you throw another $500 in?

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.112
That makes it an even $10,000.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:11.357
Yeah, I-- how about $5,000,
$4,500, and the grill?

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.259
And you're saying an
extra $500, right?

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.128
- Yes.
- Why don't we do an extra $200?

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.167
All right, we'll do it.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:22.168
I like it.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.303
I can see why the
family hired you.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:24.971
- That's what I do.
- I like it. yeah.

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:25.405
I like it.

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:26.105
I love--

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.106
All right, very cool.
