00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.080
Now, let's discuss some details
of intrusion detection.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.940
First, what are the key design elements
of an intrusion detection system.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.220
First, for
intrusion detection to even be possible,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.250
we need to make some
important assumptions.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.870
First, we can observe system and
network and user activities.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.750
Second, from the activities
that we can observe, normal and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.470
intrusion actions have distinct
evidence, that is, for

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.480
intrusion detection to even be possible,
we must be able to find evidence of

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.900
intrusions by observing systems,
networks, and user activities.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.410
When it comes to designing
an intrusion detection system,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.780
we must consider the following.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.530
&gt;From the point of view
of detection algorithm,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
we must consider the features,
meaning how do we capture and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.980
represent intrusion or
normal activity evidence?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.030
We must also decide
the detection models.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.180
Meaning, how do we piece
the evidence together, so

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.870
that we can decide whether
an activity is normal or intrusive.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.430
The system architecture typically
includes several modules including

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.810
audit data processor,
a knowledge base, a detection and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.950
decision engine, and alarm
generation and response mechanisms.
