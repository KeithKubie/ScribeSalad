TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.331
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:07.720
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.780
Drupe and Noom have
expanded globally

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.470
by localizing their
apps on Google Play.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.200
drupe increased their
daily active users by 300%,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.450
and actions per
average daily user

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.245
increased 25% in
the Indian market.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:24.550
For more details on each, and
a link to the localization

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.480
checklist, check out the post
linked in the description

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.210
below.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.890
Here's a cool new
open source tool

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.650
that does automatic line
breaking for Japanese

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.375
on the web.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.260
Now, this is
particularly important

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.300
because line
breaking for Japanese

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.730
otherwise occurs
randomly-- usually,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.290
in the middle of a word.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.200
Now, the tool uses
Cloud Natural Language

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.170
API to analyze the
input sentence,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.730
and it concatenates
proper words in order

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.440
to produce meaningful
chunks, utilizing

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.100
part of speech tagging
and syntactic information.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.596
The GitHub link is on the post.

00:00:57.596 --> 00:01:00.220
Now, there's been a major
refresh of the Google Cloud

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.780
Storage, which includes new
storage classes, data lifecycle

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.850
management tools, improved
availability, and lower

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.280
prices-- all to make it easy
for you to store your data

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.400
with the right type of storage.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.270
More details, with charts and
examples, are on the post.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.870
Google Stackdriver was
designed to make ops easier

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.640
by reducing the
burden associated

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.340
with keeping applications
fast, error-free,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.110
and available in the cloud.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.640
And it's now generally available
for hybrid cloud monitoring,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.720
logging, and diagnostics.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.480
For more information,
the announcement,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.750
and how to use Stackdriver,
including code,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.370
check out the links below.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.420
Chrome 55 Beta is now
available with input handling

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.790
improvements, async
and await functions,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.130
CSS automatic
hyphenation, and more.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.852
All the details and
code are on the post.

00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:53.720

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.550

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.550
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.550
Thanks for watching yet another
episode of "The Developer

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.050

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.365
If you'd like to see some
of our previous episodes,

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:10.864
they're right over
here on the left.

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.150
Ooh, that's a good one.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.070
I like this one, too.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.970
Oh, and don't forget to
