00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.740
PROFESSOR: An
advantage of expressing

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.640
the asymptotic notations,
in terms of limits,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.150
is that a bunch of
their properties

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.660
then become immediately obvious.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.010
Here's one.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.410
If f is little o of g, or f
is asymptotically equal to g,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.690
then, in fact, f is big o of g.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.620
Or we can reason
about this informally

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.140
by saying that the
first one means

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.700
that f is much less than
g, and the second one

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.950
means that f is
about the same as g,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.900
and the final one means
that f is roughly less.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.740
So being about the same
and definitely less,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.540
and certainly this
implies roughly less.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.800
But we can in fact
be entirely precise

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.770
just using the definitions,
because f equals o of g

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.320
means the limit
of f over g is 0.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.090
And f is asymptotically
equal to g means

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.230
that the limit of f over g is 1.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.820
And the definition of
f equals big o of g

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.700
is that the limit is finite.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.610
And clearly, if it's 0
or 1, then it's finite.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.260
Another such property is that
if f is much less than g,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.300
then g is not
roughly less than f.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.920
More precisely, if f
is a little o of g,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.560
then g is not big o of f.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.420
The left hand side says that
the limit of f over g is 0.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.390
But that implies that the
limit of g over f is 1 over 0,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.320
or infinity, which
means it's not finite,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.310
so g is not a big o of f.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.740
PROFESSOR: Now, the
usual way that big o

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.390
is defined in the literature
doesn't mention limits at all.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.650
And, in fact, as I said,
the definition really

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.120
isn't a limit, it's a limsup.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.820
And let me show you the
standard definition and then

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.880
explain why the limsup soup
captures it and is needed.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.530
So the official definition
of f is big o of g

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.370
is that there's some constant
multiplier, c, that you can

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.420
amplify g by, such that once g
is amplified by the factor c,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.100
then, in fact, f is less
than or equal to c times g.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.970
But this may not hold
right at the beginning.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.229
There's a certain point, n 0,
after which it holds forever.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.950
Let's try to illustrate
this complicated alternation

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.797
of quantifiers expression
with a diagram that

00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:17.630
may make it clearer.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.990
So suppose that
I want to express

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.620
the fact that f is big o of
g, where f is it a green line.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.630
So that green line is the
graph of f of x, the function.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.510
And g in blue is shown--
and as a matter of fact,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.770
g of x is less than
or equal to f of x.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.460
But nevertheless, f is
going to be big o of g,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.140
because if you multiply
g by a constant,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.150
it becomes sort of shifting it
up to be this constant times g.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.460
It becomes this purple
curve, and the purple curve,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.050
it gets to be above the green
curve, from a certain point on.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.330
That's n 0.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.800
So by raising up the blue
curve, g, by an amount c,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.530
to get it to be
this purple curve,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.490
the purple curve gets above f
from a certain point n 0 on.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.220
And that's why f is big o of g.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.870
Now, of course, multiplying the
blue curve, g, by a constant

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.350
doesn't raise it
up a fixed amount.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.650
It alters it, but if we imagine
that our curve was a log

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.830
scale, than, in fact,
multiplying g by c

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.890
is the same as adding
log c on a log scale.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.920
So the picture is
actually accurate

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.550
if the vertical
scale is logarithmic.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.630
So using this
standard definition,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.440
I can explain why in the
equivalent definition of terms

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.640
of limit, I couldn't say
limit, I needed to say limsup.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.050
Here's what limsup does for us.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.220
Suppose I have a function,
f, that's say, less than

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.410
or equal to 2g.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.260
Which means that,
surely, f is big o of g,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.300
according to the previous
definition, because you amplify

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.750
g by 2 and you get above f.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.650
The problem is that f of n
over g of n may have no limits,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.460
so I can't simply
say that f is o of g,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.550
because the limit of
f over g is finite.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.880
Let's see how that could happen.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.760
Suppose that f is in fact
equal to g times a number that

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.450
varies between 1 and 2.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.900
That's an example where
sin of n pi over 2

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.720
varies between 0,
1, and minus 1.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.160
And you square it,
it becomes 0 or 1.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.990
And you add 1 to it,
it becomes 1 or 2.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.940
So this is an expression,
which as n grows, alternates

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.930
between the values 1 and 2.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.500
And I'm multiplying
g of n by this factor

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.380
that's either 1 or 2.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.130
But the limit of f of n
over g of n does not exist,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:01.620
it's alternating
between 1 and 2.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.480
On the other hand, the
limsup f of n over g

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.160
is 2, which is
finite, and therefore,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.810
according to the limsup
definition, indeed f is o of g.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.600
Now, the technical
definition of limsup

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.390
is one that you can
read in the text

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.990
or find in a calculus book.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.570
It's basically the largest
limit point of the fraction

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.190
f of n over g of n.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.020
And if you don't know
what a limit point is,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.370
it's stuff that we
don't need to go into.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.580
But I did want you to understand
why formally, we need limsup.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.050
In most cases, the
limit exists, and we

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.880
can use the simpler limit
definition, rather than

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.360
the exists a constant, such
that for every number n

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.540
greater than or equal to
n 0, et cetera, which is

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.795
a more complicated definition.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.300
OK.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.710
Let's collect a couple
of more basic facts

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.070
about little o and big o
that we're going to need.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.845
Namely, that if a
is less than b--

00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:06.970
I know they can be
negative numbers.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.870
I don't care, but real numbers.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.640
If a is less than
b, then x to the a

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.540
is little o of x to the b.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.390
The [? proof file ?]
is almost immediately

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.210
from the definitions, because
to prove that x to the a

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.770
is little o of x
to the b, we want

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.200
to look at the quotient of
x to the a over x to the b.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.890
But, of course, the quotient
of x to the a over x to the b

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.760
is equal to 1 over
x to the b minus a.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.440
And since a is less than
b, b minus a is positive.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.030
So that means that as
x approaches infinity,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.870
the denominator is x to a
positive power also goes

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.520
to infinity.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.840
And therefore, 1 over x
to that positive power

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.710
goes to 0, which is the
definition of x to the a being

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.415
little o of x to the b.

00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:56.570
Another crucial fact is
that logarithms grow slower

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.720
than roots.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.350
So if you think of epsilon
as like a half or a third,

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.120
saying that the log
of x is less than

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.256
or equal to the
square root, it's

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:05.130
less than equal
to the cube root,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.470
it's less than or equal to
the 50th root doesn't matter.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.660
OK.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.110
This is a proof that just falls
back on elementary calculus.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.050
And I guess I've highlighted it,
because it's definitely worth

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.930
remembering.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.530
Logarithms grow
slower than roots.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.360
The proof begins with the
immediately obvious remark

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.560
that 1 over y is less
than or equal to y,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.370
because they're equal
when y is greater to 1.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.300
1 over y is equal to y when y
is greater than or equal to 1.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.270
And as y increases, y
gets bigger, and 1 over y

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.430
gets smaller, so the
inequality is preserved.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.780
That's easy, OK.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.650
Well that means that I can
integrate both sides starting

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.150
at 1.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.130
So if I take the integral
of 1 over y from 1 to z,

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.200
it's going to be less than
or equal to the integral of y

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.340
from 1 to z.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.130
Well, integral of
1 over y is log z,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.170
and the integral of y
to z is z square over 2.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.060
So what we get is this new
inequality, the log of z

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.910
is less than or equal to z
squared over 2, for z greater

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.230
or equal to one.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.330
So we're on the way there.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.120
We've got log of z is
less than z squared,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.000
but not z to any epsilon power.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.790
But we'll get that just by
making a smart substitution

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.020
for z, so that's the next step.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.680
We have that log
of z is less than

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.692
equal to z squared over
2 for any z greater than

00:08:26.692 --> 00:08:28.220
or equal to 1.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.210
Let's let z be the square root
of x to the delta, where delta

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.080
is simply some positive number.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.150
So in that case,
what's the log of z?

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.000
Well the log of the square
root of x to the delta,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.420
the square root means it's half
of log of x to the delta, which

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.050
is delta log x.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:52.000
So log of z is delta
log of x over 2.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.760
And, of course, z squared
is just x to the delta,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.000
so z squared over 2 is
x to the delta over 2.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.500
Now, I can just cancel
the denominators too.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.790
And I get that
log of x, and then

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.690
transpose the delta log of
x is less than or equal to x

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.620
to the delta over delta.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:15.290
But as long as delta is less
than epsilon, x to the delta

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.500
is going to be a little o
of x to the epsilon, which

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.990
means that x to the
delta times a constant,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.100
namely 1 over delta,
is also going to be

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.250
little o of x to the epsilon.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.830
And I've just figured out
that I've shown that log of x

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:35.380
is little o of x to the
epsilon as required.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.300
One more crucial fact that
I'm going to not prove,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.370
but I'll state is that
polynomials grow slower

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.400
than exponentials.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.480
This is closely related
to the fact that

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.340
logs grow slower than roots.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.330
But in particular, if
c is any constant and a

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.590
is greater than 1, then x to
the c is little o of a to the x.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.180
And there's a bunch of ways to
prove this using a L'Hopital's

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.320
Rule, or McLaurin Series,
and I'll leave it to you

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.660
to look up your
1801 calculus text

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.910
to find a proof of that fact.
