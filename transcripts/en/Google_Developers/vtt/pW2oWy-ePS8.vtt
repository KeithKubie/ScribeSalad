00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:08.280
CHRISTOPHER PATNOE: Hi there.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.890
Thank you for joining us
today with a conversation

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.580
on accessibility and AR/VR.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.334
Today, we're going to have a
quick overview of AR and VR,

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:19.500
just to provide some
background for those people who

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.870
aren't familiar.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.280
Then we'll share some
inclusive design principles

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.660
and guidelines.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.420
And then finally, we'll
review different disabilities,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.090
sharing some opportunities on
how to make your applications

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.160
and experiences more inclusive.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.500
My name is Christopher Patnoe.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.540
I'm a senior
program manager here

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.630
on Google's central
accessibility team.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.490
I've spent many years working
at Apple, building hardware,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.300
software, Sony Ericsson, making
phones, even Disney Mobile,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.556
making games.

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:51.930
I've been at Google for over
six years, where I worked on

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.170
Google Play Music and even
Daydream, our AR and VR

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.280
platform.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.265
I spent the past four
years in a 20% role

00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:00.510
working in accessibility.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.700
And in the past year,
I've been able to make

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.064
my side hustle my day job.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:05.730
RAN TAO: And hi.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.090
My name is Ran Tao.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.040
And I'm a software engineer
on the AR core team,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.270
as part of Daydream.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.460
I joined Daydream
last year, summer,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.980
after I graduated
from UC San Diego

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.270
where I studied computer
graphics and computer vision.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.000
I have been using a wheelchair
full time now for two years.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.790
And I'm passionate about
promoting accessibility

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.660
in Daydream and in the AR
and VR industry as a whole.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.460
So before we dive into making
AR and VR more accessible,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.740
let's first have
a quick overview

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.850
as to what is augmented
and virtual reality.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.340
Here's how we think
about these technologies.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880
We have VR, where the
world is hidden from you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.250
and the virtual
content surrounds you.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.710
VR can take you anywhere.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.750
And we have AR,
where you still see

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.910
the real world and
virtual objects

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.600
are superimposed on top.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.020
And so AR brings things to you.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.200
And let's talk about VR first.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.430
There's so many headsets
out there right now.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.220
And the industry
is growing rapidly.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.000
At Google, we've developed
Cardboard and the Daydream

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.670
View.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.120
And we partnered with Lenovo
to make the Mirage Solo.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.050
These three headsets
have a key distinction.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.180
So the two on the left there,
Cardboard and Daydream View,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.520
they have three degrees
of freedom tracking, which

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.100
means you can rotate your
head in any direction

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.420
and look everywhere.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.490
The experience is
kind of like a movie

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.654
projected on a
sphere around you.

00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:35.320
And you're in the center of that
sphere, so you can look around.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.110
But you can't really lean
in closer to any objects.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.920
And then we have the Mirage
Solo with WorldSense,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.184
which allows for six
degrees of freedom tracking.

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:45.850
That means not only
can you look around,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.300
you can also move forward,
back, up, down, left, right.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.150
And this allows for a much
more natural interaction,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.740
where you can duck when a
snowball is thrown at you.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.185
Over the past few years,
since Google's launched

00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:03.070
the Cardboard, so many
experiences have been created.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.160
You've probably heard of games
like Job Simulator or apps

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.050
like YouTube VR.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.300
My personal favorite
is Street View, where

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.160
I can go anywhere in the world.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.130
They even have 360 photos up
on the International Space

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.360
Station.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.500
And there's also artistic apps
like Tilt Brush and experiences

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.430
for meditation training
and so much more.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.650
And let's now move
on to AR, where

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.480
we can bring things to you.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.350
So Google's ARCore SDK, which
just launched this year,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.410
allows you to create these
experiences in Android, Unity,

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.390
and Unreal Engine.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.300
These AR experiences
cover similar areas to VR.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.550
And you can also do fun
things like adding stickers,

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.720
like the storm trooper here.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.070
Moving along now.

00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:51.070
CHRISTOPHER PATNOE: So
bringing in the concept

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.010
of inclusive design,
many people ask, well,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.780
what is inclusive design?

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.260
Well, to me, it means being
mindful in your choices

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.780
so that you don't exclude
someone accidentally

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.820
by a lack of thought.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.970
The way I got involved
here in accessibility

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.800
is when I was on
Google Play Music.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.140
A test engineer came up
and brought her device

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.210
and a speaker, plugged them in.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.625
I heard button,
button, button, button.

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:17.500
And I'm seeing people
smile here, because you

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.375
know what this means.

00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:19.852
But I didn't at the time.

00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:22.310
What this means is that the
application was not accessible.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.250
So I asked, what is this?

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.824
And she said, well, this
is your application.

00:04:26.824 --> 00:04:27.990
I said, well, that's stupid.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.160
How does someone use it?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.810
And she said, this
is why I'm here.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.790
And it was at that
moment that I realized

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.570
that it takes zero effort
to make your experience

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.800
or application not inclusive.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.300
It only takes a little
bit to make it inclusive.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.210
So that's what we're
here to talk about.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.990
And accessibility is
one of the key lenses,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.770
one of the most tangible
lenses for inclusive design.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.260
Well, why is
accessibility important?

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.940
Well, one, it's the
right thing to do.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.680
And two, it's
potentially big business.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.320
There are more than
one billion people

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.730
in the world who have some
form of disability, about 15%.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.390
About one in five
people in the US

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.226
will have a disability at
some point in their lives.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.850
Just to give you
another sense of this,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.940
there are more than 300 million
people who are colorblind.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.120
That's more people who
are colorblind that are

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.462
people of the United States--

00:05:18.462 --> 00:05:20.170
and I think that's
important to remember,

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.820
is accessibility is a spectrum.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.180
It's not a binary on, off thing.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.860
Many common
ailments, you may not

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.050
recognize have
[INAUDIBLE] disabilities

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.210
is like nearsightedness,
arthritis, or even a bad back.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.030
And there are still lots of
nuances within these groupings

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.350
of disabilities.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.960
It's more like cups
instead of buckets.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.150
Because as there are
individual people and people

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.400
have different abilities,
people have different kinds

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.066
of disabilities.

00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:47.440
And they're very subtle.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.430
But fortunately, the things
that help these different groups

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.770
bring up all the boats up
together at the same time.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.760
You also want to think about
situational or temporary

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.460
impairments like a broken leg
or carrying a bag of groceries

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.950
or even using your
device with bright sun.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.680
All of these things are
situational impairments.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.310
And finally, different people
learn at different speeds,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.265
either by disability
or simply stress.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.810
So the core thing I want
you to come away with is

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.730
don't design for yourself.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.530
Design for the broadest
possible markets.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.340
And you'll be surprised
who you're supporting.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.170
How do you do this, do you ask?

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.515
Well, I'm glad you asked.

00:06:31.515 --> 00:06:32.890
One of the ways
I talk about this

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.710
is a thing called the curb cut.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.980
What a curb cut is is
that part of the sidewalk

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.980
that is dipped down, usually
in the corner of blocks.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.080
This is designed to allow
people with wheelchairs

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.720
to be able to get up
onto the sidewalk.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.910
That's really
profoundly important.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.250
But it's also really useful
for people with suitcases

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.470
or bicycles or baby strollers.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.900
So the idea of a
curb cut is something

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.300
that can help many
people, but it's

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.730
profoundly impactful,
profoundly impactful

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.620
for people with disabilities.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.350
Another example, if
you had to help address

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.390
the needs of someone
who is hard of hearing,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.870
you're also helping people
who forgot their ear buds.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.730
And just so you know, this
means captions, for example.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.910
You're helping people who
forgot their ear buds.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.980
You're helping people
on a noisy train,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.430
or conversely in
a quiet room where

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.930
you don't want to make
a lot of noise, or even

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.730
non-native speakers.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.670
This one accommodation can help
lots of people, more people

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.000
than you might realize
at the beginning.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.940
Another example.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.898
And here's one that's
really close to my heart,

00:07:31.898 --> 00:07:33.350
or maybe many of you here.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.150
If you're stuck in
an airplane seat--

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.000
and some of you may have been
in an airplane quite recently--

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.240
you put on a headset and
something happens behind you.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.230
But you're strapped in.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.150
You can't get around.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.932
Well, what do you do?

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:48.140
Well, one curb cut is
something that the Google Earth

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.430
team solved.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.634
They actually rotate
the world around you.

00:07:52.634 --> 00:07:54.800
So you actually can have
what's happening behind you

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.840
be moved into the front.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.350
Also, YouTube VR has solved
the same kind of problem

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.490
by rotating the
world around you.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.090
So this way, you've improved
the world for people

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.130
in wheelchairs, airplane
seats, or even your comfy bed.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.110
There are few standards today
in terms of accessibility

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.820
around AR and VR.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.660
In fact, they are none.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.350
So here's an opportunity to
really do something exciting

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.480
that could really
impact people's lives.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.470
Even before AR, people
were using devices

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.730
to help improve their lives.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.240
People were using their
cameras on their cell phones

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.910
to magnify something.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:37.659
Well, this is actually
an assistive device

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.225
called a magnifier.

00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:41.600
But people didn't realize they
were using assistive tech.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.200
They were just using their
phone to magnify something.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.030
And it makes their life better.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.250
That's the whole idea.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.460
But now, with modern
AR and VR, you

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.960
can fly anywhere in the world.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.490
So someone who was stuck in
bed can visit the International

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.050
Space Station.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.182
Or you can measure the
couch in your room.

00:09:02.182 --> 00:09:03.640
Or if the game is
designed as such,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.290
you can sort of
see when someone's

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.290
shooting from behind you.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.819
Or how about when
you're stressed?

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:10.360
You can have the
most important piece

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.330
of information highlighted
or have everything else

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.100
be ignored for you.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.960
This is pretty
useful for everybody.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.480
And fortunately,
each of these things

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.030
are also profoundly impactful
for people with different kinds

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.010
of disabilities.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.840
And there's a lot of
ways that AR and VR

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.550
can help people, perhaps
in ways you don't expect.

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:31.435
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:31.435 --> 00:09:33.610
- Throughout my career,
I've had the opportunity

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.760
to care for children and
young adults with cancer.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.460
And seeing the
difficulties that they have

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.170
and the anxiety
that they develop,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.110
when I watch them
put on the headsets,

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.535
you can see immediately the
change in their body language

00:09:47.535 --> 00:09:49.300
and their facial expression.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.500
- Wow.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.360
- My husband tried Tilt Brush.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.000
- That was a great deal of fun.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.860
- Subsequently, he went
and bought art supplies.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.620
He took classes.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.760
- It took my mind away from
just passively experiencing

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.330
something.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.320
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:08.410
CHRISTOPHER PATNOE:
Research is being done today

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:13.220
that shows that VR can actually
help people feel less pain.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.010
And it can change
people's lives,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.940
introduce a new skill or talent
they never knew that they had.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.040
A wise man once said,
with great power

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.480
comes great responsibility.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.430
So how do you start?

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.870
Well, one place to start
is by with trusted experts.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.050
For over a decade, AbleGamers
have helped countless gamers

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.190
with disabilities either return
to games after traumatic injury

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.110
or start playing games,
despite a disability.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.985
They've either worked
with Sony and Microsoft

00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:44.520
to add accessibility settings
into their platforms.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.560
And they've come up with this
concept called includification,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.010
which comes in a
free 48-page PDF.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.630
And many of the
ideas from this talk

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.255
come from this
includification concept.

00:10:59.849 --> 00:11:01.390
RAN TAO: Let's dive
into a little bit

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.080
about what works today.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.670
So on the right there, you see
the new Android O accessibility

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.380
options and what it looks like.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.339
Many of the settings work
right out of the box.

00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:12.130
Don't worry about trying
to read it though.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.190
It's kind of small.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.740
So here's the highlights.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.950
There is color and
contrast adjustments,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.310
color corrections for different
types of color deficiencies.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.920
So my little brother has
trouble differentiating

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.021
between red and green.

00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:26.770
He has a hard time
telling who's the enemy

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.035
team, who's the ally team.

00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:30.130
So he's just shooting
around on the phone.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.260
And he actually turns on
this color correction mode

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.830
and it helps him a lot.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.980
Turning on these settings
automatically applies it

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.370
to the AR and VR apps.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.580
We also have mono
audio, which mixes

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.250
the right and the left
channels into a single channel,

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.920
and then puts those two
channels into both the earbuds.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.460
So you can watch videos
with just a single earbud.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.030
And this also
works in AR and VR.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.340
We also have magnification,
where you triple tap on

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.170
the screen to zoom in.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.960
And this works
really well in AR.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.720
And then we have Switch
Access and TalkBack,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.750
which I'll get into.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.260
So designing for accessibility,
things that you can do today?

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.950
Well, Switch Access and
TalkBack requires the app

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.800
to support Android
accessibility APIs.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.720
This is where you come in.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.050
The APIs are in Java, so you can
integrate them into your Java

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.780
or C++ apps.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.460
The switch access makes
it possible for people

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.980
with dexterity impairments
to use your app

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.360
with one or more switches.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.480
These switches can take
the form of buttons,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.330
like the volume buttons
on the side of the phone,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.500
or special sensors.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.740
Like, Stephen Hawking had
sensors that detected his cheek

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.300
muscle twitches.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.299
So with one button,
you can press to cycle

00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:46.840
through the different
items, like you

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.260
see that blue box highlighting.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.380
And when you get to
the one you want,

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.890
you press the second
button to select it.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.230
And then we have
TalkBack, which is

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.510
another way you can use to
interact with your phone.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.470
But I'll let my friend Victor
show you how he uses it

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.758
in a simple tic-tac-toe app.

00:13:04.758 --> 00:13:06.670
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.260
- My name is Victor
Tsaran and I'm

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.320
a technical program manager
on the Android Accessibility

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.120
Services team.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.310
Among other products,
we work on TalkBack.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.970
TalkBack is a screen reader
for people who are blind

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.230
or vision impaired.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:26.220
The way you use TalkBack is
via special touch gestures.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.890
The output, the feedback,
is provided by speech.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.609
- Tic-tac-toe.

00:13:31.609 --> 00:13:33.150
- There are two ways
you can navigate

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.700
the screen with TalkBack.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.400
The first one is called
linear navigation

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.260
and is performed by swiping left
and right with a single finger.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.720
When the element of
interest is located,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.081
the user double taps
on it to activate.

00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:48.080
- Next placed in center.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.990
O's turn.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.690
O placed in bottom left.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.230
Empty space button.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.200
X's turn.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.990
O's turn.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.100
O placed in bottom right.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.560
- Another method is
called touch exploration.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.600
In this method, you
direct the finger

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.640
across the elements
on the screen.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.130
Once the element of
interest is located,

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.380
you double tap on
it to activate.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.130
- Column two.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.180
Empty space button.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.670
X placed in center left.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.124
X wins.

RAN TAO: Awesome.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.880
I'm glad he won.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.500
That tic-tac-toe app uses
graphics that are rendered

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.810
in OpenGL in C++.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.850
And it allows Android
accessibility APIs

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.270
to interact with them.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:30.900
If you want, you can check out
the code at github.com/zork.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.150
And accessibility should
not be an afterthought.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.240
This is taken from a
recent trip to Japan.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.810
And in Japan, they have a lot
of older houses and businesses

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.640
where they
retrofitted with ramps

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.967
to make it more accessible.

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.300
And this ramp here, I don't
know if you can tell or not,

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.310
is like a 45 degree angle.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.000
So if I even tried
to go forward,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.237
I would just tip forward.

00:14:54.237 --> 00:14:55.695
Interestingly
enough, my girlfriend

00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:57.550
that took this picture,
as she was trying

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.079
to get back up that ramp,
she just kept slipping

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:01.120
and couldn't even get up.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.760
So not sure what's
happening there.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.490
This is another one.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.170
I still don't understand
what those are for.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.480
So start thinking
about it today.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.270
Start testing,
talking, and listening.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.520
Your users have a lot to say.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.250
Test your apps in
suboptimal conditions

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.370
with limited capabilities,
like with bright sunlight

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:31.150
or a noisy environment or
holding a cup of coffee

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.920
in one hand.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.880
Understand your users' needs by
reaching out to the community.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.070
Reach out to friends
or friends of friends,

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.410
people with different
accessibility needs.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.410
And listen to what they have
to say with an open mind.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.200
They have valuable
perspectives to share.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.180
And how should you
test your apps?

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.390
We think that inclusive
design shouldn't just

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.510
be the job of a single
accessibility engineer

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.190
or a team of engineers.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.560
It should be considered at
all phases of development,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.120
from idea to design to
develop, all the way to launch.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.670
So we've created
this mnemonic to make

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.120
it easy to promote inclusive
design process to all

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.650
of your developers.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.010
And this mnemonic is this
Saturday morning test.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.630
So imagine for a second you
woke up on a Saturday morning.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.310
You're groggy.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.550
You forgot your glasses
and your headphones.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.630
And you just want to sit down in
a comfy chair and play some VR.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.410
Well, this situation simulates
a significant portion

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.447
of different
accessibility needs.

00:16:37.447 --> 00:16:40.030
And if you have perfect vision,
borrow someone else's glasses.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.590
Try those on.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.470
With these limitations, make
sure of these four things--

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.460
that controls are simple,
the text is readable,

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.220
the items are reachable,
and the audio is optional.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.350
So again, accessibility
is an important lens

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.970
of inclusive design.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.650
And let's dive
into the specifics

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.630
of how you can apply
inclusive design

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.030
to your immersive applications.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.839
There's many
opportunities for actions.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.440
And we can break these down
into four big categories

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.030
of accessibility needs--

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:23.380
mobility and dexterity,
visual, audio, and cognitive.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.940
And we'll first cover
mobility and dexterity needs.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.110
This is one of the
largest areas of impact

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.830
and one of the easiest to
make accommodations for.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.670
Again, these include temporary
and permanent disabilities.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.130
So the surface area
here is really large.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.990
I'll run through it really
quickly, so hold on.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.090
We have people with
one hand available

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.020
or you're just holding a cup of
coffee, people with shaky hands

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.840
or you drank too much coffee.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.700
You have people
with limited finger

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.180
dexterity with challenges
grasping things and pressing

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.930
buttons, or people
just wearing gloves.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.030
You have people with a
hard time bending down,

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.730
grabbing things off the
floor or up high off

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.420
shelves, and people
of different heights.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.360
And then you have people
laying down, sitting down,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.650
difficulties turning around.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.560
Or perhaps they're
in an airplane seat.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.620
And this is one of my
personal difficulties.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.660
Ever since I started
using a wheelchair,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.810
honestly, VR has
been a lot harder.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.030
Tripping over the cord
used to be an issue.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:28.050
It's a lot harder to step over
the cord with a wheelchair.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.330
I also have trouble holding
things and moving around.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.480
So if I'm holding
the two controllers

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.360
and trying to push my chair,
it's not really happening.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.550
And I also have finger
dexterity problems,

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.040
where some of the muscles
in my hands just don't work.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.070
So I have trouble
pressing some buttons.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.440
Like, I'd jump back into
this game I used to play

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.600
and the enemies were
chasing after me.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.990
And I can't press
that sprint button.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.400
So just casually walking away.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.662
Did end well there.

00:18:57.662 --> 00:18:59.370
And I also have trouble
looking behind me

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.220
when things are all
the way back there.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.280
So actually, this is a
good opportunity for us

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.270
to do a real exercise together.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.470
So if I can get your
participation, please.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.890
Just indulge me for a second
and suspend your disbeliefs.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.070
Let's pretend we're Luke
Skywalker, Jedi in training,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.560
holding a lightsaber
in front of you.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.290
And there's a drone
flying around you,

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.869
shooting lasers at you.

00:19:22.869 --> 00:19:25.410
Now, you must defend yourself
from this drone shooting lasers

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.110
at you.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:30.180
So before you do it, try to
notice the things that happen

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.740
as you do this experiment.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.484
So the drone's in front of you,
you're blocking these shots off

00:19:34.484 --> 00:19:35.150
in front of you.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.130
Come on.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.740
Now, the drone's to your
right, so turn to your right.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.500
Block those shots.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.180
Don't feel shy about
your neighbors.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.420
The drone's behind you.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.110
Turn all the way behind you.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.735
And then now, the
drone's to your left.

00:19:48.735 --> 00:19:52.290
So I'm going to turn
270 degrees to my left.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.630
And then now, the drone
is back in front of you.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.410
So how did you do?

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.930
There are some good insights
we can pull out of this.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.720
Although it's possible
to turn around and block

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.917
all of these shots,
it's difficult.

00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:07.500
And if you're under
a time constraint,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.710
it makes it impossible
to use this application.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.920
And you want to really test
these situations yourself.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.120
Don't feel silly.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.250
These are very
valuable insights.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.840
So not only does
this apply to me,

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.790
it applies to you sitting
in these conference chairs.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.248
You don't want to whack your
neighbors with that lightsaber

00:20:23.248 --> 00:20:24.841
or the person behind you.

00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:26.340
And you want to
look silly sometimes

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.350
in these public situations.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.240
And make sure that
these interactions

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.260
are useful in your app as
you do these experiments.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.660
Now, let's dive
into some details

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.590
on how to make your
app more accessible.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.430
So you saw that
example of Google Earth

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.860
VR allowing you to rotate
the space around you

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.180
with a controller.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.300
Notice how there's also this
tunnel vision effect, where

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.600
it blurs out the surroundings
and creates this grid that

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.450
matches your real world
coordinates so you

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.330
don't get motion sickness.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.640
And Google Earth VR also
allows you to move places

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.990
with the controller.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.520
This is super
valuable for someone

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.280
trying to move around without
actually having the space

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.170
or sitting in a chair.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.330
And it's also
valuable to give users

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.940
the control of
having incremental

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.620
versus smooth rotations
and movements.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.650
This means snapping
those rotations

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.800
to 15 degree increments
versus smoothly going

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.710
around, or jumping
forward versus smoothly

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.300
gliding forward.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.690
And this provides users
a choice of comfort

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.250
versus finer grained control.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.890
And then let's
talk about height.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.870
There's users of
different heights.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.996
And it's super common in VR,
especially with little kids

00:21:38.996 --> 00:21:40.370
these days getting
really excited

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.020
about this new technology.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.336
My little sister
loves Job Simulator.

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:46.460
When it first came out,
she played it all the time.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.160
But she couldn't reach some of
the items off the high shelves.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.930
She's a 13-year-old
girl about this tall.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.480
So one day, we
discovered that they

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.330
added this new shorter human
mode at the launch screen.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.260
You turn it on and the world
shrinks down into a dollhouse.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.260
You're feeling like this
10-foot giant inside this house.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.380
And you can just reach
everything with ease.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.740
And she's logged 50 something
hours on this game now.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.770
Generally, you should design
to minimize for reaching

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.960
down low or up high.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.600
Perhaps using a magnetic
hand to grab things

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.520
would be one way to solve this.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.400
And interestingly enough,
with three degrees

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.740
of freedom controllers
like on the Daydream

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.380
View and the Mirage
Solo, the hardware

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.451
allows for more
accessible experiences.

00:22:29.451 --> 00:22:30.950
There's no need to
reach up or down.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.830
And custom controls,
allowing users

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.600
to choose what
works best for them.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.030
So for me, having the ability
to remap that sprint button,

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.650
I can finally use
that game again.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.410
And I play and I can
run away from enemies.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.930
And giving users
assisted controls

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.550
is another way to help.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:55.810
Some UI buttons are just
too small or not obvious

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.130
that they're interactable.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:01.070
So using this bendy laser is
one way to solve that problem.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.010
And shaky hands from
your morning coffee

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.350
won't be a problem
anymore either.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.290
A lot of these concepts
are borrowed from gaming,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.200
like assisted aiming
or assisted driving.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.500
These are well-established
interactions in console games

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.190
already.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.220
And they would be super valuable
for VR experiences as well.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.130
And finally,
sensitivity adjustments

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.630
on different controls, so the
joystick rotations, et cetera.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.420
It allows users to choose
between finer grained control

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.530
versus faster movement.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.110
And now, let's talk about
mobile AR interactions.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.320
Mobile AR borrows a
lot from mobile itself.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.840
The interactions are
well defined for 2D UI.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.240
But for 3D UI like
this, you want

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.490
to have adjustable
size and rotations

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.020
for different objects.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.990
This is another great curb
cut opportunity in AR,

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.930
as it allows for people to
use your app in small spaces.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.080
But it profoundly
impacts those using

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.720
your app stuck in a chair.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.320
And for me, I can't really
see up high or reach very far.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.060
And so I can move the objects to
places that works best for me.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.880
And having large tap
targets, it forces

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.970
for simpler user
interfaces, friendlier UI,

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.370
and also makes
text more readable.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.990
Generally, you want
the tap targets

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.780
to be at least finger size.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.480
And finally, having
alternative gestures.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.230
So an alternative to swiping
or shaking the phone,

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.440
having an extra tap target
to do these interactions

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.630
would be useful.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.944
Now, on to visual impairments.

00:24:33.944 --> 00:24:35.360
CHRISTOPHER PATNOE:
So as you look

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.322
towards visual
impairments, the groups

00:24:37.322 --> 00:24:38.780
of people that
you'll be supporting

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.690
are people without glasses,
people with glasses, people

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:45.060
with high contrast needs or
[INAUDIBLE] deficiencies,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.820
non-stereoscopic
vision, people who

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.900
are visually impaired or blind.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.390
This covers an
awful lot of people

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.790
throughout different
phases of your life.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.150
One of the most important
things you can do is have--

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.140
and you'll hear me say
this a couple of times--

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.390
multi-modal affordances.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.270
Here, this is a matter
of having audio and text

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.110
at the same time.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.300
If you have a narrative, have
it voiced over and written down.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.590
This would help for people
with both audio impairments

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.150
and visual impairments.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.540
The next is support for
large text and large fonts.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.600
That is so much easier
to see if you can.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.050
And the next one is a
contrary, good contrast,

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.601
in terms of your UI.

00:25:22.601 --> 00:25:24.350
You probably can't
read all of the letters

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.390
there because I intentionally
made the contrast

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.460
bad to reproduce the situation.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.190
Because if the contrast
is bad, it don't matter.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.810
People can't see it.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.880
And finally, if you
want to support people

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.650
with colorblindness, don't use
only color to support things

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.540
like health or progress.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.270
Please use dedicated icons
or textures in addition

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.520
to the color because this
way, there's a different way

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.200
to tell the difference.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.300
And always, please try to use
a colorblind safe palette.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.310
Now, a lot of people
ask when I talk about--

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.220
I do work at accessibility
and AR and VR.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.430
People ask, well, how do
blind people use AR or VR?

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.264
And I say, well, right
now it's really hard.

00:26:03.264 --> 00:26:05.055
And hopefully this is
something that we all

00:26:05.055 --> 00:26:06.050
can work on together.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.120
Because at this time,
there is no support

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.030
in the major game engines
for accessibility services.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.976
What happens is the UI in
three-dimensional space

00:26:14.976 --> 00:26:16.850
are literally just
textures hanging out there

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.690
with a script attached.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.970
There's no such thing as a
VR check box or text box.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.695
It's just a floating
texture that

00:26:24.695 --> 00:26:27.920
has a script that allows
it to act like a text box.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.300
There's no window manager.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.130
There's no way for
Accessibility Services

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.730
to understand how to navigate
what these things are.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.010
So this is work that
needs to get done.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.760
Now, this is not only true
for VR or 3D within AR,

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.210
this is actually true
within all 3D games as well.

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.640
So to that end, please don't
forget the Accessibility

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.970
Services glue code we mentioned
a little while ago from Zork,

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.580
github.com/zork.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.500
Yes, it's that Zork.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.020
And if you do want
this, please reach out

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.831
to the game manufacturers
and game engine developers.

00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:01.580
Those [INAUDIBLE] of
indie game developers

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.650
is not just the unholy duo.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:04.370
Reach out.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:08.020
Ask for it so they can do it.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.750
Moving on towards
hearing impairments.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.857
Here, you are helping
people with impairments,

00:27:12.857 --> 00:27:13.690
hearing impairments.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.850
But also again, it's
the noisy environments

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.740
or the quieter
environments or people

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.660
without their headphones.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.360
Here, again, this is that
multi-modal affordance

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.600
with the audio and video
happening at the same time.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.720
Captions and narration, it's
the same idea, but slightly

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.220
different instances.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.800
In captions, it's
normally video.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.470
But in narration, it's
cut scenes of a game

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.570
or just any kind
of conversation.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:41.470
Please include the captions
or narration in these things

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.590
so everyone can enjoy the
story that you're building.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:48.700
And often if you have
avatars in either VR or AR,

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.710
we find captions are
often connected to a word

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.872
bubble or a thought bubble.

00:27:52.872 --> 00:27:55.330
That's pretty useful, as long
as people know where to look.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.160
So be careful with that.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.550
But in terms of captions,
this is really important.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.630
And unfortunately, not
all platforms support

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.880
closed captioning in VR.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.270
YouTube VR has always
supported captions.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.000
And the way YouTube VR does
it, it's called head locked.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.370
So it's this little black
box with white letters.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:19.390
And as you turn your head,
it spins around with you

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.330
because there's no way for us
to tell where for it to go.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.580
But at least it's there.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.800
But again, not all VR
platforms support this.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.320
So if you have
video or if you're

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.970
using video in an application,
please burn it into the video.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.410
It's not the best solution.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.420
The best solution is
to support captions.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.975
But if you can't,
please at least do this.

00:28:39.975 --> 00:28:41.350
And when you're
doing it, there's

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.510
sort of two standards
that are most common.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.630
One is a three up
like you see here.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.250
It's 12, 4, and 7.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.310
And the idea here is
to make sure there's

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.859
always some bit of
the captions available

00:28:53.859 --> 00:28:55.900
in the peripheral vision
so you know that there's

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.565
something happening.

00:28:57.565 --> 00:28:59.440
But what's happening
and becoming more common

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.960
is four up, sort of
north, south, east, west,

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.200
or all the same sides of a cube.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.270
Put your captions in
these places and everyone

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.930
should be able to find them.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.740
Now, there's this
new format called

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.350
VR 180, which we just announced
with the Lenovo Mirage.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.490
This is a great camera.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:18.280
And the way to make sure that
you have your captions, when

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.150
you go into YouTube, put
everything in a 16 by 9 crop.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.890
And everything should
be visible there.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:24.931
And that works just fine.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:31.370
Moving on towards
cognitive impairments.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.780
The people that you help
here are distracted users,

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.590
like parents, people
with difficulty

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.800
remembering or understanding
language, like parents

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.430
or foreign language speakers.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:47.430
And what you do here is you want
to make your UI simple and easy

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.140
to use.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.840
Now thiis isn't your Thoreau
simplify, simplify, simplify.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.970
This is think about
the uses of your video,

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.530
the uses of your UI.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.680
How do you guide someone
from one idea to the next?

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.382
Make it intuitive,
not just beautiful.

00:30:01.382 --> 00:30:02.840
If you're talking
about a situation

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.950
where you have levels,
there's three things here

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.540
that are useful.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.444
One is have a sandbox level.

00:30:08.444 --> 00:30:10.110
For people who have
a hard time learning

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.777
or hard time
manipulating controls,

00:30:12.777 --> 00:30:14.610
give them a place where
they can mess around

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.490
and learn how to use your
game or your experience

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.340
without having it impact
their ability to actually play

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.290
the game moving forward.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.410
If you can't do that, make
sure you have good training

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.810
so you give people a safe
place, an opportunity

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.720
to learn how to build and
how to play your game,

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.700
how to use your interaction.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.200
And then finally, have
different difficulty modes.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.160
It's just standard
easy, medium, and hard,

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.409
but you don't want to be mean.

00:30:40.409 --> 00:30:42.750
You don't want to tell anyone
you're going easy on them.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.780
So I really like this story,
balanced and challenge

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.720
that some games
have talked about.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.330
It's a lot nicer, but
it gets the same idea.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.960
If you want someone to hear
your story, don't stop them.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.240
Let them play to their ability.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.950
And finally,
sometimes people just

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.957
can't get through the level.

00:31:00.957 --> 00:31:02.790
So why should they be
stopped in the process

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.590
of getting through your story?

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.380
In this case, come
up with an auto pass.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.080
Say, if you can't get
past it in 10 times,

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.640
ask, do you want to move
on to the next level

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.400
so they can see
what your story is?

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.780
Sometimes they'll say yes.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.250
Sometimes they'll say no.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.440
But why prevent them
from having the choice?

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.510
So auto pass is
a really nice way

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.952
to help people understand
and finish the work

00:31:23.952 --> 00:31:24.660
that you've done.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.770
Now, taking this step up from
sort of the game environments.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.906
But an hour ago, we've
just announced my team

00:31:33.906 --> 00:31:36.030
in the [INAUDIBLE]
accessibility has just announced

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.880
an application called Lookout.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.410
What this is, it's
an AR application

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.830
that uses the camera and
it uses visual detection

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.240
of the world around you.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.040
And it provides an
audio description

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.580
of the world around you.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.840
So in the image
here, on the left

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.870
we have a picture of lavender.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.825
And there's a caption
that says "Lavender."

00:31:56.825 --> 00:32:00.810
And what you would hear is
"Lavender at 12 o'clock."

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:05.982
On the right-hand side, we
have a series of contexts.

00:32:05.982 --> 00:32:07.440
There's three things
I want to talk

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.540
about here that are important.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.080
That context menu is actually
surprisingly important

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.527
because unless we
know your context,

00:32:16.527 --> 00:32:17.610
we don't know what to say.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:21.370
Or more importantly, we
don't know what not to say.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.310
If we don't know
what you care about,

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.629
we'll read everything to you.

00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:27.003
If I had this right here, I'd
say person, person, person,

00:32:27.003 --> 00:32:29.420
person, person, person.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.390
And it's all correct,
but it doesn't matter.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:33.950
So providing the
context gives you

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:35.866
an opportunity to actually
say the things that

00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:37.860
matter in real time.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.910
The second thing is a blind
user uses the camera very

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.560
differently than you expect.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.910
It's really true.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.310
When our testing, all
of our engineers--

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.400
because they're sighted--

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.730
would generally localize
the camera on the thing

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.500
that they wanted
to have recognized.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.360
Yet, we went into user testing.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.010
Boy, did we see really
different kinds of things.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:57.980
So what we ended up
having to do is actually

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.860
capture all of the video as
things are moving around,

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.760
stitch it together into a very,
very large image, and then

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.440
[INAUDIBLE] on all of it.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.240
Then we finally got the results
that we were looking for.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.930
And finally,
spatialness, where are

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.682
things in space matters a lot.

00:33:13.682 --> 00:33:15.140
If I'm describing
to you that there

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.730
is lavender in front of you,
it makes a big difference

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.500
if it's at 10 o'clock, 2
o'clock, or 12 o'clock.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.260
So when you're trying to
guide someone to something,

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.135
that sense of space
and where things are

00:33:26.135 --> 00:33:28.010
is really important in
terms of understanding

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:28.940
the world around you.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.290
So in conclusion,
y'all can wake up now.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.530
Please don't forget
these key points.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:43.460
One, don't design for
yourself or your situation.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.340
RAN TAO: Two, test,
talk, and listen.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.680
Sit down and take the
Saturday morning test.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.310
Check that controls are
simple, text is readable,

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:54.390
items are reachable,
audio is optional.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.110
And think about the
different types of needs,

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:01.427
from mobility, visual,
auditory, and cognitive.

00:34:01.427 --> 00:34:03.260
CHRISTOPHER PATNOE:
What are your curb cuts?

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.900
What is something
that you can do

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.880
that helps everybody, but has
a profound impact on someone

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.489
with disabilities?

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.480
And if you remember
nothing else,

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.769
you can always go to
AbleGamers includification.

00:34:13.769 --> 00:34:15.560
This is a really great
resource if you want

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.473
a one-stop shop for everything.

00:34:19.473 --> 00:34:20.889
RAN TAO: We want
to hear from you.

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:24.251
Provide feedback on this
session at that link.

00:34:24.251 --> 00:34:27.208
And thank you so much
for attending our talk.

00:34:27.208 --> 00:34:28.458
CHRISTOPHER PATNOE: Thank you.

00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:28.958
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:32.198
