Here is now finally the revelation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My weight is obtained if you assume as standard score of 2.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It so turns out.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Can you give me a good guess what my weight will be if the standard score is 2 for me?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I should add that the mean over here is the heavier of the two numbers.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, I don't quite weight as much as here.
