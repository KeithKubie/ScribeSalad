00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.640
- [Instructor] In this
video we're gonna use

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.240
a simple model for the
loanable funds market

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.240
to understand a phenomenon
known as crowding out.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.510
And this is making reference

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.640
to when a government borrows money,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.440
to some degree it could crowd out

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.940
private sector borrowing and investment,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.970
and it could have negative
consequences for the economy.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.310
You might have less
investment as a result,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.910
and you could have less economic growth.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.510
So let's see how the
crowding out can happen

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.087
using this loanable funds market.

00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:34.510
So, just to be clear what's going on here,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.850
horizontal axis, the
quantity of loanable funds.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.910
The vertical axis, you have
your price of borrowing,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.800
which is going to be
our real interest rate.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.880
And our equilibrium real
interest rate and quantity

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.460
is determined by the intersection

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.130
between the supply of loanable funds curve

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.870
and the demands of loanable funds curve.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.590
So what happens if,
let's just say step one,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.320
the government decides to borrow

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.830
to fund some of its spending.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.060
What is going to happen to these curves?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.861
Is one of them going to shift?

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:10.390
Well, sure.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.930
If at any given interest rate,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.890
all of a sudden you have a big borrower

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.470
in terms of the government
that now wants to enter

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.400
the market for loanable funds,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.380
at a given interest rate,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.540
that's going to increase the
demand for loanable funds.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.200
So the step one right over here

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.570
is going to shift the demand
of loanable funds curve

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.460
to the right, I'll just that
step one right over there.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.090
And so our new demand for loanable funds

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.860
might look something like this.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.860
And so let's call this demand
for loanable funds prime.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.030
So this is going to shift,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.030
shift the demand for
loanable funds to the right.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.220
Now, what does that going to cause?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.420
Well that is going to cause our
real interest rate to go up.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.900
Real interest, interest rate

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.890
is going to go up.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.890
You see it right over here.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.515
Our new equilibrium, you
do have more loanable funds

00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:11.820
that are being supplied and demanded,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.180
that are being borrowed.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.220
So this call this Q prime.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.230
But you see this happening
at a higher cost,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.120
at a higher real interest rate.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.281
So we call that R prime.

00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:25.150
Well, what's going to be the
impact in the private sector

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.140
of a higher real interest rate?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.220
Let's imagine for a second

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.820
this first blue curve was
just the private sector.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.220
Let's say that the government
just started to borrow

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.470
in this video shifting the curve.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.700
Well, if the blue curve was
just the private sector,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.430
at this new interest rate,
the private sector is willing

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.380
to borrow a lot less.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.980
So we could say, private sector, private

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.283
sector

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.730
borrows less,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.610
borrows less.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.010
And so what could that result in?

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.870
Well, then, you could have,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.670
and this is the negative
effects of crowding out,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.180
you could have, because
they're borrowing less,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.610
they're fueling less investment,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.980
then you're gonna have less capital,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.220
less productive capital that you can use

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.290
to produce things, so we could say,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.590
less capital accumulation,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.973
accumulation.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.970
Which is just another way
of saying, for example,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.670
people are investing less,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.240
because they're not borrowing as much.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.210
Investing less in factory
or some other thing

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.540
that might make people, or in technology,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.670
things that might make
them more productive.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.350
And so if you're having
less capital accumulation,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.610
that means that you're going
to have slower economic growth.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.340
One of the ways that a
country really pushes

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.340
its production possibilities curve out

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.490
or really pushes its long
run aggregate supply curve

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.890
to the right and has true economic growth

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.040
is through investment.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.570
But if you have, if you're
borrowing costs are higher,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.850
you're gonna have less investment,

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.553
less capital accumulation
and slower economic growth.
