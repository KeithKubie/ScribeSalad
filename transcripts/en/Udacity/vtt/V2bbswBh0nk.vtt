00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's learn some trigonometry.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, if you've already mastered trig, you don't have to watch this next part.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But you may be entertained, and if you haven't mastered trig, you're in a for a treat,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because this is one of the branches of mathematics

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that we use all the time in physics, and it's really fascinating.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's start by looking at a right triangle.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Isn't that nice with it's right angle marked by a square and it's three sides?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Okay, what can we learn from this triangle?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's first make a copy of it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Here is a copy, identical in every way--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
same angles and same sides. We call that "congruent."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That just means we have the same sides and the same angles.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If this has a length of 7, this has a length of 7.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If this has a length of 12, this has a length of 12.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Likewise for the angles.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
What if this triangle were a little bigger?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What if I were to expand it proportionally

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
so as it grows it grows the same way in each direction the same amount in each direction?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, clearly this is not identical to this triangle. These two are not congruent.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But they are similar in some ways,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so let's come up with a name to describe

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
two triangles that are similar in such a way.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In fact, let's call them similar.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
These are similar triangles,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and they're so vital to doing physics.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now, each of these triangles has three angles.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This one I've labeled 1, 2, and 3. This one 4, 5, and 6.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Do they have anything in common?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Are they equal?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Is this statement true, that angle one equals 4, angle 2 equals 5, angle three equals angle 6?

00:01:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check whichever of these statements are true about these two triangles.
