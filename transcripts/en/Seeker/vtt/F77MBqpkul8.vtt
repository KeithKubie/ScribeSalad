00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.759
The 
other day I did this video about time dilation,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:15.480
or the idea that time is relative to your
current speed, but that got me to thinking:

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:27.199
there's no such thing as not moving!

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.740
You might think you're just sitting there,
watching this video, maybe you're in a car,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.740
on a train or even on an airplane.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.650
But even if you were at home on your couch
trying to be as still as possible, you're

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.250
still traveling XXX,XXX miles per SECOND.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.250
EVERY SECOND.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.190
Sit still and think about that for a second…

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.830
The question “how fast are we moving?”
is FAR more difficult to answer than I thought

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.800
because there are so many moving parts -- literally…
pun intended.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.330
So, let's go through each level of motion
and then add it all up at the end.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.170
Starting small, you're not moving.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.009
Just to keep it simple, you're standing still
on the equator.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.950
As the Earth rotates, the equator is going
the fastest, and the poles are going slowest.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.990
If you were standing right on the north pole,
you'd simply rotate once every day, but on

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.260
the equator, you're going about 1,000 miles
per hour (1600km) in a circle, every day.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.280
You don't feel it, for the same reason you
aren't stuck in your seat while a plane is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.909
flying, speed is relative, you only feel it
when it changes.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.490
So anyway, you're already going 1,000 MPH
AS A PERSON.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.409
The Earth is traveling around the sun, once
per year.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.659
It's a trip of 584 million miles (942 M km)
to get the sun back to the exact same point

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.009
in the sky.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:49.470
That means, the whole planet is flying at
66,667 mph (107k kph) AS A PLANET!

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.219
Then, zooming out further, we are ALL tied
to the movement of the sun.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.030
The sun is flying through the galaxy with
all of us planets tucked into its gravity.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.170
Scientists determined, the sun is moving toward
other stars at around 45,000 miles per hour

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.340
(72,420kph) but we're ALSO moving "up" relative
to our galactic disc at about 15,700 miles

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.340
per hour (25.2k kph).

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.420
We're not going to fly out of the galaxy,
the gravity of all those other stars is going

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.840
to slow us down and pull us back in over the
next 14 million years.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.810
AND since we're about halfway out of the center
of the Milky Way, and as far as we can tell

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.130
the galaxy rotates once every 200 to 250 million
years; we're moving approximately 550,000

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.130
miles per hour AS A SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.290
We're not done yet either!

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.850
You, the planet, the solar system and…

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.410
The MIlky Way.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.720
Our galaxy is heading toward the Andromeda
galaxy at a pretty good clip.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.940
Numbers vary, a recent 2013 Space.com[a] piece
clocked it at 252,000 miles per hour.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.350
Again, with the three dimensional thinking,
the Milky Way is ALSO moving toward the constellation

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.740
Hydra at about 1,342,000 mph (216M kph) and
toward Virgo at like half that.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.560
So overall the Milky Way MIGHT be traveling
as fast as 2,237,000 mph (3.6M kph).

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.090
Another sidebar: the further away from YOU
that you get, the more difficult it gets to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.010
measure your speed.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:26.150
The reason we use constellations and other
galaxies is the same reason we use trees or

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.210
mountains here on Earth to gauge distance.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.780
They're large and far enough away that they
become a point of reference.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.020
We can measure our SPEED relative to theirs,
but of course, all the stars and galaxies

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.680
in Andromeda -- like a mountain -- are moving,
Andromeda is moving, the stars of the constellation

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.140
Hydra -- like the tree -- is moving…

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.740
EVERYTHING IS MOVING.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.750
AND the whole universe might be moving.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.750
Yep.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.750
The whole damn thing.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.750
I can get into that if you want!

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.440
Lemme know with a like and if we get to 10,000,
we'll come back to it.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.040
It's big, y'all.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.170
Now, to the MATHS!!

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:08.840
Your 1,000 mph, plus Earth's 66,667 mph, plus
our system's 550,000 mph, plus the galaxy's

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:17.919
2,237,000 miles per hour equals = about 2,855,000
miles per hour or about 800 miles every second.

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.009
Think about that.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.479
That's mind-boggling, and incredible.

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.410
The reason you're not clinging to the ground
in fright is because again, speed is relative.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.270
YOu're not feeling it because we're all on
this supersonic jet together.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.639
Us, and all the stars in the galaxy.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.090
How does all this make you feel?

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.090
Small?

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.090
Tiny?

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.090
Insignificant?!

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.090
Or super amazing and important!

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.470
There's WAY more to this than this simple
video is going to explore, but if you're like

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.439
me, this video gave you some feels.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.439
Express yourself!

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.439
Go on!

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.439
We'd like to take a moment to thank Subaru
making this big thinking video possible and

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.580
for keeping us in motion.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.030
Especially the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.710
Every sedan has its benefits, but only one
combines them all.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.710
It’s not just a sedan.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.710
It’s a Subaru.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.710
Now, to the MATHS!!

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.710
[FULLSCREEN GRAPHIC: *pop up each line as
he reads it* ]

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.710
You 1,000 mph
Earth 66,667 mph

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.710
Solar System 550,000 mph
Galaxy 2,237,000 mph

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.710
= 2,855,000 mph (800 miles / second)
Your 1,000 mph, plus Earth's 66,667 mph, plus

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.710
our system's 550,000 mph, plus the galaxy's
2,237,000 miles per hour equals = about 2,855,000

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.710
miles per hour or about 800 miles every second.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.710
Think about that.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.710
That's mind-boggling, and incredible.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.710
The reason you're not clinging to the ground
in fright is because again, speed is relative.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.710
YOu're not feeling it because we're all on
this supersonic jet together.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.710
Us, and all the stars in the galaxy.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.710
How does all this make you feel?

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.710
Small?

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.710
Tiny?

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.710
Insignificant?!

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.710
Or super amazing and important!

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.710
There's WAY more to this than this simple
video is going to explore, but if you're like

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.710
me, this video gave you some feels.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.710
Express yourself!

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.710
Go on!

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.710
We'd like to take a moment to thank Subaru
making this big thinking video possible and

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.710
for keeping us in motion.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.710
[VO: video 2015 SUBARU LEGACY @0:14]
Especially the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.710
Every sedan has its benefits, but only one
combines them all.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.710
It’s not just a sedan.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.710
It’s a Subaru.
