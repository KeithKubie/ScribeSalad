00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.210
- [Voiceover] We're asked
to order the side lengths

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.822
of the triangle from shortest to longest.

00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:06.041
And we have the three sides here,

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:07.202
and we could use this little tool

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:09.462
to order them in some way.

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:10.680
If we look at the triangle,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.384
we've been given the interior
angles of the triangle,

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:17.228
and they haven't told us
the actual side lengths.

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:19.062
So, how are we supposed
to actually order them

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:20.722
from shortest to longest?

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:23.961
Well, the realization
that you need to make here

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:28.096
is that the order of the lengths

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:29.757
of the sides of a triangle

00:00:29.757 --> 00:00:33.414
are related to the order
of the measures of angles

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:35.372
that open up onto those sides.

00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:36.812
What do I mean by that?

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.702
Well, let's think about these
three angles right over here.

00:00:39.702 --> 00:00:42.802
57 degrees, that is the
smallest of these three,

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:45.588
and so the side that
this angle opens up to,

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:47.260
or you can think of it
as the opposite side,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.208
is going to be the shortest
side of the triangle.

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.542
So, b is going to be the shortest side.

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:55.199
So, the next largest angle is 58 degrees,

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.743
and so a is going to be the middle side.

00:00:57.743 --> 00:01:00.644
It's not going to be the
longest nor the shortest.

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:01.720
So, a.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.261
Then 65 degrees, that
opens up onto side c,

00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:07.722
or the opposite side of that angle is c.

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:09.753
So, c is going to be the longest side.

00:01:09.753 --> 00:01:12.342
To get an intuition for why that is,

00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:16.080
imagine a world where the 65 degree angle,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.415
if we were to make it bigger.

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:19.343
If we were to make the
65 degree angle bigger,

00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:21.369
maybe by moving this point out

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.272
and that point out, what would happen?

00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:25.549
Well, side c would get bigger,

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.415
and because the angles of a triangle

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:29.914
have to add up to 180 degrees,

00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:31.433
if this one's getting bigger,

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.035
these will have to get smaller.

00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:37.030
Likewise, if I were to take angle...

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.328
let's say, if I were to
take this 58 degree angle,

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:41.511
and if I were to make it smaller,

00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:42.423
what's going to happen?

00:01:42.423 --> 00:01:44.722
Well, side a is going to get smaller.

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:45.824
So, the general principle,

00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:47.762
I'm not giving you any formal proof here,

00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:49.180
but the intuition is,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.430
is that the order of
the angles will tell you

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.148
what the order of the
sides are going to be.

00:01:54.148 --> 00:01:55.669
So, the smallest side is going

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.422
to be opposite the smallest angle.

00:01:57.422 --> 00:02:01.287
The largest side is going to
be opposite the largest angle.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.388
We can check our answer,
make sure we got it right.

00:02:03.388 --> 00:02:06.082
Now, let's do one that
goes the other way around.

00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:08.868
Here, we want to order
the angles of the triangle

00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:09.902
from smallest to largest,

00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:11.179
and we're given the sides.

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:12.607
Well, same, exact idea.

00:02:12.607 --> 00:02:14.418
The smallest angle is going to be

00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:16.101
opposite the smallest side

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.377
or the shortest side.

00:02:17.377 --> 00:02:20.083
Well, the shortest side is
this side of length 7.2.

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:23.438
The angle that opens
up onto it is angle a.

00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:26.816
So, that's going to be the smallest angle.

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:31.541
Then, the next smallest side
is the side of length 7.3,

00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:33.453
and the angle that opens up to it

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.496
is angle b right over here.

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:37.896
So, angle b.

00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:40.670
Then angle c opens up
onto the largest side.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.725
So, it's going to be the largest angle.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:43.386
So, we're done.

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:45.267
We've ordered the angles of the triangle

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:47.201
from smallest to largest.
