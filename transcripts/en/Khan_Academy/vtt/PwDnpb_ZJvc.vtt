00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.560
So let's think a little
bit about powers of 0.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.380
So what do you think 0 to the
first power is going to be?

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.367
And I encourage you
to pause this video.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:14.700
Well, let's just think about it.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.120
One definition of exponentiation
is that you start with a 1,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.010
and then, you multiply this
number times a 1 one time.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.840
So this is literally
going to be 1 times--

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.590
let me do it in the right
color-- it's 1 times 0.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.650
You're multiplying
the 1 by 0 one time.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.420
1 times 0, well, that's
just going to be equal to 0.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.710
Now, what do you think 0
squared or 0 to the second power

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.010
is going to be equal to?

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.490
Well, once again, one way
of thinking about this

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.880
is that you start
with a 1, and we're

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.820
going to multiply
it by 0 two times.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.971
So times 0 times 0.

00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:02.220
Well, what's that going to be?

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.060
Well, you multiply
anything times 0,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.240
once again, you
are going to get 0.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.600
And I think you
see a pattern here.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.050
If I take 0 to any
non-zero number--

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.300
so to the power of
any non-zero, so this

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:28.765
is some non-zero number, then
this is going to be equal to 0.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.810
Now, this raises a very
interesting question.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.660
What happens at 0
to the 0-th power?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.200
So here, 0 to the millionth
power is going to be 0.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.010
0 to the trillionth
power is going to be 0.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.710
Even negative or
fractional exponents,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.250
which we haven't
talked about yet,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.580
as long as they're
non-zero, this is just

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.700
going to be equal to
0, kind of makes sense.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.180
But now, let's think about
what 0 to the 0-th power

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.709
is, because this is actually
a fairly deep question.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:03.750
And I'll give you a hint.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.870
Well, actually, why
don't you pause the video

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.230
and think a little bit about
what 0 to the 0-th power

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.130
should be.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.070
Well, there's two
trains of thought here.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.822
You could say, look, 0 to
some non-zero number is 0.

00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:21.780
So why don't we just
extend this to all numbers

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.950
and say 0 to any
number should be 0.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.690
And so maybe you should say
that 0 to the 0-th power is 0.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.440
But then, there was
another train of logic

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.910
that we've already learned,
that any non-zero number,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.930
if you take any non-zero
number, and you raise it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.670
to the 0-th power.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.370
We've already established
that you start with a 1,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.910
and you multiply it times
that non-zero number 0 times.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.760
So this is always
going to be equal to 1

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.930
for non-zero numbers.

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:57.690
So maybe say, hey, maybe
we should extend this

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.490
to all numbers, including 0.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.870
So maybe 0 to the 0-th
power should be 1.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.560
So we could make the argument
that 0 to the 0-th power

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.780
should be equal to 1.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.100
So you see a conundrum
here, and there's actually

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.183
really good cases, and you
can get actually fairly

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:15.870
sophisticated with
your mathematics.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.530
And there's really good
cases for both of these,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.490
for 0 to 0-th being 0, and
0 to the 0-th power being 1.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.940
And so when mathematicians
get into this situation, where

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.856
they say, well, there's
good cases for either.

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:31.186
There's not a
completely natural one.

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:32.560
Either of these
definitions would

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.770
lead to difficulties
in mathematics.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.950
And so what mathematicians
have decided to do is,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.300
for the most part-- and you'll
find people who will dispute

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.100
this; people will say, no, I
like one more than the other--

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.870
but for the most part,
this is left undefined.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.580
0 to the 0-th is not defined
by at least just kind

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.480
of more conventional
mathematics.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.450
In some use cases,
it might be defined

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.400
to be one of these two things.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.990
So 0 to any non-zero number,
you're going to get 0.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.680
Any non-zero number to the 0-th
power, you're going to get 1.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.020
But 0 to the 0, that's a
little bit of a question mark.
