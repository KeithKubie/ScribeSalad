00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.500
It’s 2018 and recreational weed is now legal in California. It’s no secret that up until now,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
the war on drugs - and specifically on marijuana -

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.520
has unfairly locked up a disproportionate number of people of color.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.900
In an attempt to right those wrongs, the city of Oakland has mandated

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.980
that half of all weed business permits go to “equity applicants,”

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.060
or people who are low income and have a cannabis conviction,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.860
or who live in a neighborhood in Oakland that’s been a major police target.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.340
So now, established weed businesses like this one, called Nug,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.740
are training these folks to become potrepreuners.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.940
Careem Robinson is learning the business of cannabis, and at the end of his training,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.400
he’ll get his own 1,000-square-foot greenhouse. He says this opportunity saved his life.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.500
Two years ago I was ready to probably jump off a bridge.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.420
- Really?

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.860
And I believe in God and stuff, but I'm saying I had no hope at all. And I definitely didn't have no plans that

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.840
I would own my own business and I grew weed before, but never like this. So I'm really excited.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.900
Careem qualified for the equity program because he lives in an East Oakland neighborhood

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.780
with a disproportionately high number of cannabis-related arrests.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.020
Now, he’s preparing to profit from a business he was once criminalized for.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.220
Is this is the clone?

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.720
Yeah.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.000
We are going to put the clone of the weed plant in the soil.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.040
Exactly.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.240
So I’m planting a marijuana plant.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.760
The plants grow in what’s called the veg room, where they get 16 hours of light a day.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.520
When they’re ready to flower, they’re taken to the bloom room.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520
Go that way?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.020
Yeah.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.240
We set them up in a certain position, like dominoes basically. One, then one, then one, then one.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.760
So I put mine here?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.700
Put yours right here in the middle like that.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.760
What happens is it starts budding and when it starts budding, these white hairs, they start turning brown.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.680
That’s how you know it’s mature. This is where the money,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.340
or where the good stuff is made, at the top, not at the bottom.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.520
So, this is the good stuff right here. It's ready, almost.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.020
Almost, almost.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.520
The plants are left to dry for two weeks.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.340
You guys use straight up hangers.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.040
Real hangers yeah. And you see there’s different colors because there’s different strands.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.680
Then trimmers remove the buds by hand.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.260
This right here is where we keep our weed, our award-winning Premium Jack and other strands.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.940
These are the pounds. You can take a look at them.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.180
Every bag is a pound.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.480
Every bag in here is a pound.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.280
This is a pound of weed right here.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.820
It’s all different kinds of strands.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.780
Oakland’s statistics show how people of color like Careem have been unfairly targeted in the war on drugs.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.620
The city’s population is 31% white, 30% black, and 30% Latino.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.980
But in 2015, black people made up 77% of cannabis arrests. White people made up only 4%

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.220
even though studies have shown that both groups use marijuana at the same rate.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.240
I've seen police, well, they came and they said they were coming for weed

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.620
and they chopped down all our plants and took me to jail and they put me on probation

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.480
for three months, I mean, three years.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.300
They use weed as a gateway. So, now we don't have to have probable cause to stop you.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.400
You're on probation for weed. We stop you.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.940
And why are they targeting you?

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.320
'Cause I'm black and I'm in Oakland.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.480
Now that weed is legal, white entrepreneurs who have not been policed for cannabis

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.560
have found an immediate leg up.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.120
Oakland’s equity program is trying to correct the racial disparity by encouraging

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.880
businesses like Nug to take on equity applicants.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.220
In return for each applicant, Nug gets a general permit that could help them expand their business.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.480
Nico Enea is the CFO of Bloom Innovations, the parent company of Nug.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.640
He helped select Careem and the other equity applicants.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.140
We are giving them fully automated, state of the art, light deprivation greenhouses.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.560
They will have those greenhouses rent free for three years.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.440
In addition, we're giving them $10,000 for start-up funds.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.440
It's rewarding to see, and finding that right individual like Careem,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.400
who appreciates the opportunity and wants to capitalize on it.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.380
How much could he be making soon?

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.560
In excess of $100,000.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.380
Other cities in California are following Oakland’s lead in making the marijuana industry more fair.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.060
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento each have their own equity programs.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.440
If you were able to give a message to the city of Oakland, which we know has targeted people of color

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.780
and are now trying to sort of make amends with this equity program,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.880
what would your message to Oakland be?

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.260
That they need to support the equity program more, so more people like me can get a chance

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.280
because when the other people are supporting this thing then they could look at me and just say,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.560
"Well if it happened for him, maybe it could happen for me."

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.380
Basically, I got a new start. I’m 40 years old, and at 38, I didn’t have nothing going for me.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.180
I have hope now and I do have things working in my favor.
