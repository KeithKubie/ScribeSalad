&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren:
Thanks for everybody --

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.690
for coming out on this
absolutely gorgeous stage

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:33.670
to the November meeting of
the Washington Area Group

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.380
for Print Culture Studies.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:45.570
I'm Sabrina Barren, with my
colleague, Elinor Shevlin.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.470
We've been convening
this group for --

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.250
20 years, which is
kind of frightening.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.630
But thanks, everybody,
for coming out.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.200
We have a -- e-mail list.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.580
If you're not on the list,
and you'd like to be,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.500
talk to myself or Elinor.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.050
We can get you on --

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.270
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin:
In the back here.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.000
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren:
-- on that list.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.140
We have -- we do six programs a
year during the academic year,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.270
and this will be the last
one for this semester,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.950
this calendar year, and
then starting in February,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.480
we will have February,
March, and April.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.290
Mack Holt from George Mason,
a scholar of French history,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.440
is going to be one
of the speakers,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:09.960
a visiting Italian scholar
at Johns Hopkins is going

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.610
to be talking about
history of science and --

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.620
and then we have
an artist coming

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.580
from the Sorbonne who's going to
be here in the spring as well.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.870
So we're looking
forward to the rest

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.820
of what's been a great
program this year already.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.810
We're getting dinner
afterwards with the speaker.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.500
It's a good place to get
to know one another better,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.480
continue the conversation,
and if you'd

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.240
like to join us,
you're welcome to.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.970
We go to Tallay Todd [assumed
spelling] down by the --

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.330
so please consider that if
you're interested in doing that.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.060
We also like to hear from
anybody who would be interested

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.160
in presenting, or have any ideas
about people we should approach

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.460
for presenting to our group.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.420
We -- print culture,
anytime, anywhere,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.750
and that includes the digital,
as far as we're concerned.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.050
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin:
And manuscript, too.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.540
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren:
And manuscript, too --

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.500
paper, electricity,
you know, anything --

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.630
[laughter] anything you can
read, phone books, I don't know.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.930
Anything you can read.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.230
We've had some great --

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.850
you know, we've had Cuban
art books constructed

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.150
out of found materials.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.450
We've had Japanese
prints that --

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.750
I mean, we've just had fabulous,
fabulous, fabulous talks

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.050
over the years on a variety

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.350
of really interesting
-- interesting topics.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.650
But if you have any ideas,
we're always keen to --

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.950
and so, Ellie's going to give
our speaker today a little bit

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.250
more of an in-depth
introduction.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.550
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Hello, there.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.850
Yes, I'm so happy to
introduce Na'ama Zussman.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.150
She's an artist and
a Ph.D. candidate

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.450
in the cultural studies program

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.750
at the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.050
Her research, entitled
"Artist Books,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.350
a Framework of Redistributions,"
draws critical attention to --

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.650
draws attention, pardon,
to the critical impetus

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.950
of artist books, and the
link between the aesthetic

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.250
and the political
that they provide.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.550
Zussman holds a master's
degree in art and the book

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.850
from the George Washington
University's Corcoran School

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.150
of the Arts and Design.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.450
It has taken me a little
bit to get used to --

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.750
to put the George
Washington in front of that.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.050
Her thesis essay, which
received the award

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.350
for graduate critical writing,
discusses the coexistence

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.650
of artist books as
both map and territory.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.950
During her studies, she
completed an internship

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.250
at the rare book and
special collections division

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.550
at the Library of Congress,
where she gave a talk

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.850
on digressional wanderings.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.150
Zussman is a recipient of
numerous awards and scholarships

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.450
for academic and artist
merits, a guest lecturer

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.750
at various symposiums, and is
currently a research fellow

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.050
at ICRE, and that's the Israel
Center for Research Excellence.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.350
She's also published an essay
on the production of place

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.650
in Sam Winston's work
in the April 2016

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.950
of "The Blue Notebook," a
journal for artist books.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.250
Recent acquisitions
of her artist books,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.550
"A Survey of the World,"
were made by the rare book

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.850
and special collections division
of the Library of Congress,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.150
the Butler Library in
Columbia University,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.450
and the Boston Athenaeum.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.250
Let's welcome Na'ama Zussman.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:47.340
[ Applause ]

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.770
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: I want to
thank you, Elinor and Sabrina,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.870
for inviting me, and it's
an utter bliss to be here.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.030
I thought we were
supposed to meet at noon.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah [laughter].

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.630
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman:
Oh, okay [laughter].

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.930
&gt;&gt; I moved today, though.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.230
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Okay.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.810
I would like to open with Judd

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.380
and Renee Hubbard's
[assumed spellings] words,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.830
as published in 2005.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.950
"We still lack a generally
accepted and workable definition

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.430
of artist books, in spite of
many perspective commentaries

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.620
by American, British,
French, and German scholars,

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.370
who may not have always dealt
with the same subject matter.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.310
We may even wonder to what
extent we can define artist

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.310
books in terms of genre,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.970
or classify them
according to categories."

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.270
End quote.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.100
The myriad literature on artist
books proposes a true reflection

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.370
of the difficulties posed
by these artistic phenomena,

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.130
and reveal the debate's
labyrinthian nature.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.380
Hence -- and here, I'm relating

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.790
to Hubbard's concluding
clause --

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.360
we should wonder whether terms
as genre and categories are

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.710
at all appropriate when
discussing artist books.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.020
In addition, we should wonder
whether these difficulties are

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.000
not directly related
to the very subversive

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.400
and critical essence
of the artist book.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.180
In his essay, "Artist Books
Between Viewing and Reading,"

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.450
Warteets [assumed spelling]
discusses the difficulties

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.980
in rereading artist book.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.090
And argues that these
difficulties are the main

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.830
virtue, since, and I quote,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.940
"such a difficulty is directly
linked to their ability

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.200
to contest the institutional
norms of production

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.740
and reception that we have
inherited from literature

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.390
and the visual arts," end quote.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:49.000
In my research, I try to
change the course of the debate

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.530
from category-based
to an observation

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.110
of the ways artist books
stimulate experience.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.480
I try to divert the course
of the debate from the what

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.920
to the how, to examine
the nature of experience

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.400
in the artist book, and
comprehend how it weaves itself

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.530
in a non-accumulative way,

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.120
how it weaves its
own redistributions.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.380
Established in the 20th century,

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.070
an artist book is an
idiosyncratic manifestation

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.560
of art, a framework of space
and time conveyed through modes

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.200
of redistribution of a
cultural object, the book.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.990
For millennia, the book has been
emblematic infrastructure which,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.160
through both its textuality
and physicality, has mapped

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.610
and been mapped by the
formation of civilizations,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.490
cultures, and doctrines.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.400
Hence, the designation of the
book as an imprinted receptacle

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.180
for an artist book is
a categorical moment.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.270
Marked as a territory
of experience,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.670
the artist book becomes
dominant territory

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.310
that maintains its
embedded repository power

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.840
through redrawn trajectories.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.540
In addition, through its
attempts against fixation

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.620
on a predetermined world of
taxonomies and categorizations,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.380
the artist book poses questions
on artistic proxy's consumption,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.790
and its ability at
all to be categorized.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.670
Not only does the artist
book question its validity

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:22.620
and strength of its grip on
reality, but also its identity,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.910
and by that I refer to
some observation such as

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.260
that of Betty Bright
[assumed spelling],

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.730
who tries to situate
the artist book in one

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.780
of two poles, book or art.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.720
In her own words, "Is it
a book, or is it art?"

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.070
And, by Specter's
observation of the practice,

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.830
"we dress up to go
out and look at art.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.980
Undressed in bed, we read."

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.970
In this talk, I will
best portray the ways

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.850
in which our experience is
embodied in the artist book,

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.040
how it constantly oscillates
between the German duo

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.550
of erlebnis and erfahrung.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.790
While erlebnis marks one's own
lived experience, relating thus

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.620
to concrete, stimulating
event, erfahrung refers

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.660
to the accumulation of
the experience over time.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.170
And I shall elaborate on
this later in my talk.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.270
The artist book leans
upon millennia

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.340
of books accumulating
experience, and as both notion

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.530
and form, while it
simultaneously is registering

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.640
against the grain of those
very same experiences.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.840
Hence, it conveys a lived
and concrete experience,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.270
and opens possibility
of experimentation

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.410
that breaks the perception
of what can be known,

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.750
thought, said, and done.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.060
I start with the memory
of a book, of books.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.170
That memory is engraved in my
experience, in the erfahrung

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.250
of my conceptual and
physical gestures.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.700
It has shaped my
expertise in the book,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:03.950
and this is how I
approach the artist book.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.590
Book 91, also known as "The
String Book," was created

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.700
by book artist Keith
Smith in 1982.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.870
Book 91 is a composition of
paper and string with no text

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.720
or image, a composition for
the evocation of experience.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.800
The strings, knotted
to the pages and woven

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.650
through various-sized holes, and
are all bound to the physicality

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.860
of the codex form, bound to the
history of the book, and yet,

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.790
at the same time,
explore the boundaries

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.830
of the book as an idea and form.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.800
Smith manifests the presence,
and at the same time,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.200
the absence, and his
approach produces experience.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.020
When the reader/viewer
browses through the book,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.550
curves one's own way with
a string, there is a sense

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.310
of a tension between the memory
of given proxies of experience,

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.790
and the new path of
experiential use.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.410
The act of reading/viewing
is shaped by the physicality

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.370
of the book, and in
turn, the reader/viewer,

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.000
in one's own reading/viewing,
shapes the physicality

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.680
of the book, and
those expect to be led

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.070
after a linear narrative
find themselves disoriented.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.720
Book 91 goes against institution
norms of how to consume

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.260
and experience a book.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.610
Those would shape
our experience,

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:30.000
and maintain a given order.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.160
Strings in varied
lengths weave their way

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.200
through a complex pattern hole.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.530
The reader/the viewer takes an
interlude, hastily looks back

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.750
to follow the path the string
took, hangs onto the string

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.710
to see what path
they are trekking,

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.040
what course of realizations
they are fulfilling.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.770
Understanding that this is
not a regular usage of a book,

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.860
there is no textual or
image-based narrative to follow,

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.460
no churchly scriptua
for the literate,

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.860
no image for the illiterate.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.320
The lack of security a linear
narrative would have given,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.760
yet you are driven forward
following the string,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.210
casting the shadows of
your own experiences,

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.690
obligated to mediate
and unfold it,

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.340
incarnating one's own
experience, igniting

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.820
and activating this
fear of occurrences,

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.780
projecting one's own narratives

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.080
in an incessant move
of research.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.120
To borrow Dennis Schmidt's
[assumed spelling] words

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.000
about the transformation
of experience into text,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.770
"It is a transformation in which
experiences are articulated,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:49.880
structured, and woven
together into a text."

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.950
The strings, in turn,
respond to this mediation,

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.060
acting as both text
and image, and acting

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.120
and reenacting a story
told by the one who browses

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.380
through this book, recalculating
the grammar of the body,

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.430
enabling the freedom of
mapping in frank territories.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.650
The book is then closed, open
and closed to new occurrences.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.350
Each time this book opens,
new maps are projected,

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.170
new territories are established.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.950
"Every time we turn the page,"

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.880
writes Dick Hagens [assumed
spelling] in his essay,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.470
"A Book," "the previous
page passes into our past,

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.660
and we are confronted by
a new world," end quote.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.320
Thus, Book 91 is eternally
liminal, situated in being

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.540
at experiential threshold.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.910
It subverts as a natural
endeavor for resolution,

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.690
and its essence lies
in its continuous mode.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:49.170
The whole being of Book 91 is
in the experience it conveys,

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.440
and has, always liminal,
keep oscillating between page

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.410
to page, between the
past and the new world,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.990
between experience
and experience.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:04.560
I would like now to
develop the eclectic notion

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.860
of erlebnis and erfahrung.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.600
"Art," argues Caroline
Jones [assumed spelling]

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.470
at the preface of a captivating
symposium proceedings entitled

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:18.340
"Experience," "is a range
of marks, indices, rituals,

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.670
and materials that humans
make to stimulate perception.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.910
We do these things to draw
upon prior layers of experience

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.350
in order to produce,

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.400
paradoxically, the
genuinely new."

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.570
Allow me to repeat on
this last sentence.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.020
"We do these things to draw
upon prior layers of experience

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.580
in order to produce,

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.020
paradoxically, the
genuinely new."

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.170
While erlebnis denotes
a moment --

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.570
a moment in its full immediacy

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.790
that precedes all
interpretation, a subversive

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.860
and intuitive response
to the world,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.520
erfahrung is an experience of
an external and objective event,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.240
and the lessons one
learns from such events.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.880
If an erlebnis is initial flash,
erfahrung is the arrangement

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.670
that transform it
into knowledge.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.890
Like many German theorists,
Walter Benjamin distinguished

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.910
between erlebnis and
erfahrung, and understood

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.460
that erlebnis is a product
of modernity, and yet,

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.160
what set him apart was
his dialectic approach

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.360
to these two concepts.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.220
This dialectic I find
in the artist book,

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.970
which manifests its
critical impetus

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.220
through perpetual oscillation
between erfahrung and erlebnis.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.440
In this, I am also following
Benjamin's manifestation

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.740
of the dynamic relationship
of modernity with the past.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:53.110
"The Second Encyclopedia
of Telon," 1991,

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.840
although it was a work in
progress, so it's formal years

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.520
of the creation were
1998 to 2003.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.050
In the mid-1990s, a group of
German artists, Peter Milewski,

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.320
Inez Von Katterhaut,
Barbara Farner,

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.910
and Marcos Farner
[assumed spellings],

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.860
decided to give a
shape in reality

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.720
to the fictional encyclopedia,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.310
"The First Encyclopedia
of Telon."

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.230
A fictional encyclopedia
denoting a fictional place

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.280
which appears in the fiction
story [foreign language],

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:29.690
written by Horheleuse Bakhaus
[assumed spelling] in 1941.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:33.870
"In order to have an
experience through a book,

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.580
what the book says may
not be true in terms

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.250
of factual knowledge,"
argues Michel Foucault.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:47.200
In fact, and I quote, "an
experience is always a fiction.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.090
It's something that
one fabricates oneself

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.200
that doesn't exist before,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.760
and will exist afterwards,"
end quote.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.320
If that is so, is there any
importance at all in the fact

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.550
that Telon is fictional,
and consequently,

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.660
that there is an encyclopedia
as imitation of fictional world?

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.220
Considering this
fictional scaffolding,

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.690
here are some profound questions
that should be asked prior

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.800
to the realization of
such an encyclopedia,

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.170
and perhaps pondered through
by this group of artists.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:28.540
How can an encyclopedia, a
manifestation of erfahrung,

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.870
of the accumulative knowledge,

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.110
define and describe
a fictional world?

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.040
How can a text, which
is completely fictional,

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.820
be concretely shaped?

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.730
How can this experience be
available for others to have?

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.880
Considering an encyclopedia
is a demonstration of reality,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.410
what other shapes could it take?

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:55.920
In Telon, the spoken
language lacks noun, and so,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.970
how can an encyclopedia, whose
usage of nouns is ingrained

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.440
in its purpose, depict
a place with no nouns?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.630
How do you form experience?

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.200
As said, these questions

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.770
and assumption could have
been among what the artists

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.070
asked themselves.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.910
Nevertheless, after a period
of time, a disagreement arose

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.030
over the realization
of the encyclopedia,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.370
which led the group
to part ways.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.810
Also interesting to indicate,

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.050
that although both realizations
are utterly different

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.850
from one another,
they are both entitled

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.280
"The Second Encyclopedia
of Telon."

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.190
I will explore Farner's
realization,

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.650
since I find their encyclopedia

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.590
to put forward question
the artist book --

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.000
question about the artist book

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.480
and its subversive
and critical essence.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.900
In addition, Farner's
"Second Encyclopedia" poses

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.960
epistemological questions about
the relationship between reality

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.460
and knowledge, and how
knowledge is acquired.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:05.680
Specifically, it opens up a
realm for experience in a world

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.850
which is completely fictional,

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.270
where you can experience
a fiction.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:15.170
"On 'The Second Encyclopedia of
Telon,' and the deceiving sense

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.630
of recognition of text forms
and patterns one might draw,"

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.770
writes Barbara Farner, "a
link to the everyday life

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.320
of the viewer is forged,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.680
yet without ever
trapping them in it.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.870
Life is created,
not merely copied.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.450
The works and texts point
forward to an imaginary moment

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:42.280
in time, a dimension which
perhaps never be," end quote.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.370
Farner's "Second Encyclopedia
of Telon" is not end-oriented,

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.820
neither bound up with a desire
for resolution, nor closure,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.650
nor predicated on a linear
succession of denotation.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:20:00.460
In fact, Farner's "Encyclopedia"
is an independent entity,

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.920
a unit in itself, and
perhaps naming it the

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.630
"Second Encyclopedia"
rather than the first was

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.040
to elevate its independence.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.330
This is an encyclopedia
with no main plot,

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:19.130
which generates situation,
activities, topics, and ideas.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.860
"The Second Encyclopedia
of Telon" consists

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.270
of five green binders,
ordered alphabetically,

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.660
and separated by dividers.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.370
"The choice of ring binders,"
as Farner remark, "is not only

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.400
because they allow us the
maximum amount of freedom

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.680
for the entries we are
producing in size and type,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.750
but also because no
permanent order is dictated."

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.030
Additionally, and out of
the nature of a ring binder,

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.470
I would add the other --

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.300
the order of the entries in the

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.420
"Encyclopedia" can be
changed, added, and reduced.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.670
That is to say, one can arrange

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.300
and rearrange one's own
experiences, so both immediacy

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.040
and interpretation
are interchangeable.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.550
What entries are in
the "Encyclopedia"?

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:11.220
The five binders are an assembly
of varied and eclectic aspects

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.890
of life, as if they were
flashes of the shock experience

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.550
of erlebnis, yet
to be interpreted.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.190
Digressed from any
structural and linear narrative

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.950
of an encyclopedia, from
memory to tea ceremony,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:30.180
11 to technical report, fish to
surface, of gravity and levity

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.720
to spirit, history of the
manuscript to immortality,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:41.640
beyond to the familiar objects,
storm plans to lilac whispering.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.720
What is more, the physicality

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.030
of this encyclopedia
is respectively woven

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.270
with its functionality.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:54.530
Varied formats, sizes, bindings,
paper sizes, typefaces,

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:59.400
dimensions, and more are all
interchangeably inhabit the

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.840
encyclopedia, and bound

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:07.020
to the experiential
trajectory it offers.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.960
Another repeated
motif is the envelope.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.350
Most information is
kept in envelopes,

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.730
attached to the dividers
or to the binder's rings,

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.500
and it is up to the
viewer/reader whether

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.680
to follow this trajectory,
open the envelope,

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.210
unfold the content,
and experience it.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:34.210
Going through Farner's words
again, "The least of entries is

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.340
as if life is created,
not merely copied,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.670
and the entries are subjective
moments of lived experience

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.400
in their full immediacy, waiting

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.510
to be transformed
into knowledge.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.910
They are as well events
that allude to the fact

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.840
that Telon's grammar
lacks noun."

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.910
"Second Encyclopedia of
Telon," hence, is a subjective

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.830
and intuitive response to the
fictional world as depicted

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.740
in the first fictional
encyclopedia,

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.470
challenging hierarchies
and opening possibilities

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.630
of observation in a way
that breaks linearity.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:13.410
"The strategies of the dominant
order are undermined and altered

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.420
by reading tactics --
" Michel de Certeau

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.280
in "The Practice of Every Life."

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.280
Spatial practice -- reading --
enables reader to be travelers

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.700
through paths on land
owned by someone else.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.210
The text is of another person,

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.720
and the reader reinvents
the text, just like a tenant

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.950
who makes changes in
the rented property.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:41.090
Reading, hence, changes its
object and introduces a desire

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.550
to rewrite it, and
establish a new order.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:49.050
I find in de Certeau's
insights several vantage points

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.050
in "The Second Encyclopedia
of Telon."

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.700
The Farners, like
travelers, make their way

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.980
across fields they do not own,
of [foreign language], of Telon,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.670
and of "The First
Encyclopedia of Telon."

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.300
They read and view
while they, themselves,

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.810
produce an encyclopedia of their
own experiential vernacular.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:15.000
In turn, the readers/viewers/us
make changes

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.890
in the rented property,
disconnect Farner's work

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.940
from its soil, and offer great
possibilities of movement.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.600
And this move obviously
can continue infinitely,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.900
with no limitations.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:38.840
Sam Winston, "Backwords
Alternate," 2014.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.200
"Backwords Alternate" by Sam
Winston charts a framework

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.480
of experiences that raptures
and invents novel relationship

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.070
between the lived and
immediate experience,

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.270
and the accumulated one,

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.510
that which leans
upon one's expertise.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.800
It is a drawing of
the constant movement

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.330
between erlebnis and erfahrung.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.620
Winston, returning to
Caroline Jones' word,

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.190
draws upon prior layer
of experience in order

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:11.270
to produce paradoxically
the genuinely new.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.260
"Backwords Alternate" is
the chronicles of the --

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:19.240
of the interaction between
Kenneth Goldsmith's work "Day"

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.020
and Sam Winston's work, and is a
documentation of the fabrication

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.420
of the poem, "Backwords."

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.340
"Backwords Alternate" is the
physical dossier of the records

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.560
of its making, which consists
of three sections sewn together,

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.500
correspondence in
uncreative writing,

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.060
letter forms, and
the drafted poem.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.530
Accompanied to this dossier
are a letter-press print

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.080
and its printing plate.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.230
Standing and watching this
work is impossible in terms

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.940
of its realization,
since experience it --

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.050
experiencing it requires
numerous body gestures

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.310
and operations that would
go through the experience

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:03.610
and organize it, of
opening, spreading, glancing,

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.290
accumulating, delving,
standing, sitting, reading,

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.700
viewing, surveying, and so on.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:15.240
This -- of body gestures brings
back Babs Specter's [assumed

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.330
spelling] observation
about the practice --

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.960
the practices related
to the artist book.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.370
"We dress up to go
out and look at art.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.350
Undressed, in bed, we read."

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.140
In addition, it evokes
questions about bodily gestures

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.160
that perhaps are obvious to us
when we view art or read books.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.640
How does, then, our body work
in relation to the artist book,

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.820
and how does our body go
through the experience

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.170
of the artist book?

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.760
"We have to go through
the experience,"

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.880
to quote Jack Luc Nincee's
[assumed spelling] words,

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.150
"or there will be no such thing.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.770
What we call an artist
work is nothing other

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.960
than the organization
of this experience.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.900
A work of art is
constantly at work.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:05.670
It constantly opens itself anew,
constantly emerges," end quote.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:10.540
The first section of "Backwords
Alternate," correspondence

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.970
in uncreative writing,
follows the immediate exchange

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.750
between Winston and
Goldsmith, and reflects

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.430
on the conceptual
formation of the work.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:26.140
Goldsmith is known for
his work, "Day," 2003,

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.730
where he transcribed every
word, character, symbol,

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.760
and number of "The New York
Times" issue of September 1st,

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:39.330
2000 into an 836-page book,
while excluding any hierarchies,

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.980
which typically take the
form of typeface, size,

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.290
layout, and classification.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:49.420
By presenting each sign of
"The New York Times" equally,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:55.130
Goldsmith subverts a prominent
symbol of print culture,

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:58.630
contesting and breaching
thus the institutional norms

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.600
of production and
reception by turning it

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.160
into an initial flash,

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.420
that which precedes
the order of things.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.180
What is more, "Day" is a
presentation of a reverse order,

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.860
in which the secondary
arrangement --

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.640
the knowledge, the lesson
one learns from events,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.590
and the accumulative
experiences over time --

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.260
precedes the lived experience.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.160
What is already oriented,
categorized,

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:31.100
and classified makes place to
the unprocessed experience.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.730
Winston, hence, as the
correspondence reveals,

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:39.270
seeks to interrupt with part of
Goldsmith's poem, a work that,

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.380
itself, is already
the embodiment

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.090
of confrontational
experience to the one

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:48.110
"The New York Times" suggests.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:52.110
The second section is
letter forms, the blueprint

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.640
of the work, the drafting
of the meeting place

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.880
between Goldsmith's poem
and Winston's own poem,

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.120
which is printed backwards.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.130
Winston documents his
drafting of the redistribution

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.720
of Goldsmith, and
his own experiences,

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:10.130
and the cynic meeting
point of these two planes.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.000
He challenges what is
already experienced,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.430
while being both the
surveyor and the surveyed.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.330
Winston's layouts and
letters are stripped

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.130
of their signifiers,
de-territorialized

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:28.530
from their previous regimes of
identifications and experiences.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.120
To adopt Jacque Rancier's
[assumed spelling] words,

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.940
"the rapture of given relations
between things and meanings,

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.700
and inversely, invent novel
relationships between things

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.640
and meanings that were
previously unrelated."

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.390
Each of these meditative layouts
is, hence, a semiotic place

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:51.280
within itself, excluding
hierarchy of before and after.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.780
Each, a place with absorptive
and elusive boundaries

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.570
that documents its history,
and at the same time, confronts

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.030
and negotiates with it.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.910
Winston first charts a dialectic
of erlebnis and erfahrung

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.030
as if they keep oscillating
between one and the other,

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:12.520
freezing for a moment
to be delineated.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.410
Winston conveys a landscape
of the meeting place of layers

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:20.190
of experience, of the
immediate, fragmented experience

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.400
with the cumulative one.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.290
In addition, no one
can tell them apart,

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.850
and they can be found
ever present.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.260
This is, then, a record

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.700
of the most likely infinite
possibilities of staging

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.280
of experience and the population
of the page, and it is not just

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.370
about the collapse of
hierarchies, but rather the open

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.580
up of possibilities
of experience.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.160
Winston, hence, considers
both poems

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.950
as if they were raw materials,

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.080
critically initiated
lived experiences.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.410
He delineates communities
of experience

00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:00.440
that have no preconditions,
apart Goldsmith request

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.210
for using Times New
Roman typeface,

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.610
as shown in the e-mail exchange,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.350
juxtaposing them while
maintaining their --

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.750
laying out while weaving
together two contradictory

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.690
forces simultaneously --

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.780
"The New York Times" issue
of September 1st, 2000,

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:22.690
and the autonomy of the
aesthetic experience.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:27.400
The third second, a
drafted poem, is a journey

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.140
of its creation, as
Winston defines it

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.840
in the e-mail exchange, a
documentation of the formation

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.190
of Winston's poem "Backwords."

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.580
Winston documents this
accumulated process

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.180
of the forces that are involved
in his work, and the history

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:50.460
of his experience, starting
from 12 pages of his own script.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.970
Nevertheless, this
section is a process

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.460
of a reverse accumulation
and alteration,

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.350
a process of subtraction.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:02.730
And yet, despite lessening, a
drafted poem maintains its --

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.740
repository power until
it ends backwards.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:13.860
Two more planes are added
to "Backwords Alternate,"

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.750
the letter press print
of Winston's interaction

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.590
with Goldsmith text, and
the poem, "Backwords,"

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.180
placed at the top of the
dossier, and the printing plate

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.790
of this print placed
at the bottom.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:30.260
Yet both texts cannot
be read together,

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:34.080
neither on the plate,
neither on the print.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.170
In Winston's words,
as documented

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.950
in the e-mail exchange,

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.540
"The poem 'Backwords' only read
correctly on the printing plate.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:46.450
If it is printed, it is
backwards, but that, in turn,

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.680
makes your -- " "The New
York Times," he's writing,

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.290
to Goldsmith -- "'The New York
Times' text read correctly.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:56.030
So neither text ever sits
together the right way 'round.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.880
Sad, but true."

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.550
End quote.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.540
Perhaps not so sad.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.880
This is an eternal negotiation,
because these two planes,

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.040
the letter press print
and its printing plate,

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.340
function simultaneously.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:15.090
The experience of each feeds
the other in persistent return.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:18.500
Both Goldsmith and Winston's
texts alternate the role,

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:23.280
and work together regardless of
their supposed contradictions.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.330
In this, "Backwords
Alternate" is an artist book

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.060
that documents its
history, cumulates it,

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.900
and at the same time, present it

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.470
as if it were a lived
experience, the erlebnis.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.850
"Backwords Alternate" does
not produce consensus,

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.440
nor does it inscribe
given roles.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.800
It is a meeting place of little
communities of experience,

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.160
which are borrowed from
heterogenous domains.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.690
Winston, hence, weaves,
while maintaining this state

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.820
of negotiation, these
experiential communities.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.910
In my research, I point
to the artist book

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.090
as a critical territory
of experience.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:14.420
That territory of experience
is composed of the accumulation

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.350
of experiences brought by the
book, and its repository power,

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.680
and the lived experience
in its full immediacy,

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.150
that which precedes all
interpretation and reworking.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.750
In addition -- and here,
I return to the preface

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.480
of my talk -- I argue that one
should doubt whether we can

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.790
at all define artist books in
terms of genre and categories.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.400
In its constant oscillation
between the erlebnis

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.240
and erfahrung, and out
of the trajectories

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.170
of the lived experience,

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:47.630
the artist book rejects
any possibility of fixation

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.610
under absolute category.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:53.490
The three artist books I
discussed illuminate this

00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:56.080
oscillation each uniquely.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.370
Book 91 manifests the
fundamental question of how

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:04.350
to experience the artist book,
and how should it be approached.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.400
These questions are
raised in light

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.500
of the clear institutional norms
of reception that other artistic

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.400
and reading proxies maintain.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.500
In addition, Book 91
subverts the natural endeavor

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.640
for resolution, and its essence
lies in its continuous mode.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:26.590
"Second Encyclopedia of Telon"
raises epistemological question

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:30.010
about the relationship between
knowledge and experience,

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:33.300
and the extent to which
the experience is affected

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.980
by prior knowledge.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.780
This, in turn, raises a question
about how to convey relationship

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.270
between experience and
knowledge in the artist book.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.050
"Backwords Alternate" not
only charts a framework

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:51.250
of experiences that rapture
and invent new relationship

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.060
between the lived and the
accumulative experience,

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.780
but also delineates a
continuous oscillation

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.950
between erlebnis and erfahrung.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.500
In this, in addition,
this work, as the others,

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.920
deals with bodily gestures.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.530
How does our body work in
relation to the artist book?

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.690
How does our body go through the
experience of the artist book,

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:19.950
and how does our body change the
experience of the artist book?

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.540
These three artist books, thus,
captures the subversive essence

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.800
of the artist book, as an
idiosyncratic manifestation

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.180
of art, and show its
critical impetus.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.480
Thank you.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.520
And the books are here, but
maybe we are just getting

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.430
to the conversation now?

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.990
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Yeah, yes.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.330
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: Comments?

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:47.430
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:51.720
You're talking about
the creation of objects.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.020
What about the reception?

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:57.720
In other words, if an artist,
creator of an artist book,

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:02.370
has an idea, is there any
way of knowing whether

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:07.100
that idea is going to be
picked up by the person

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.820
who literally picks up and
looks at an artist book?

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.630
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: I think this
is a beauty with artist book,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.120
and obviously, you
know, in your reading,

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.400
you reinvent the
narrative as well.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:27.170
But I think that the artist
book enables this freedom

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:33.210
of experience, and there are
two levels of the experience.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:37.230
And I mentioned this when I
spoke about Michel de Certeau's

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:40.730
"The Practice of Everyday Life."

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:46.670
The writer or the creator,
the artist, makes changes

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:51.780
in other people land, and the
readers of your -- do the same.

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.670
There are a couple of
layers of the experience.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:58.480
It's not only the one

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.060
who
perceive/view/read/experience

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:06.220
the work, but also the artist.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.370
&gt;&gt; Its interpretation
doesn't belong to the artist.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.900
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yes, yes.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:15.660
But all -- but I've -- but
due to the nature, to the --

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.750
due to the nature
of the artist book,

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:23.300
which already carries
experience of its own heritage,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.990
of its own culture, you already
have a layer of experience,

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:31.220
even before you start
creating the artist book.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:36.330
The choice of -- to start a
work of art from a surface

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.290
that has its own
accumulation of experience

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:46.770
in itself is already
a layer of experience.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.830
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Yeah,
I actually have two kind

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.430
of different questions.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:55.400
One relates to "The
Encyclopedia,"

00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:01.080
and you were saying about
how it's a demonstration

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.980
of linearity.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.600
And I was wondering
if you could say more

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.530
about that, for two reasons.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.930
It's collaboratively
produced, and of course,

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:16.340
I've heard that before I saw
the other pages and everything.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:21.760
But I would think that it could
have been created in stages,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.250
and not from A to Z, or
however we often conceive of,

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.970
and just the fact that
it could move around.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:34.320
And connected to that, because
-- and I'm thinking of --

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.750
I mean, it invites
-- the encyclopedia,

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:43.140
rather than a linear reading, it
invites discontinuous reading,

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.950
because you go in, and --

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.800
you know, so I was
struck when I was --

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.170
the encyclopedia,
with linearity.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:52.820
Although, of course,
a book contain --

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:59.570
I mean, he talks about it -- in
here, really of kind of today,

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:03.350
mainly novels, and that's
about it, that are meant

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:06.810
to be read in terms of linear.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:09.180
So I could see how you could
say -- but I was interesting --

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.550
if you could say more
of what you meant

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:17.770
about a demonstration
of linearity.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.000
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: There
are two realizations

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.110
of this encyclopedia, which is
fascinating, but as I mentioned,

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:28.380
I'm dealing with
Farner's realization,

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:33.070
and the other realization is
by Milewski and Katterhaut.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:34.930
It's a library, as well.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.950
I think it's 50 volumes --
50 volumes of linearity,

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.020
master proofs of linearity,

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.290
and it's beautiful,
meticulously-done.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:49.140
And I -- but I don't find
the experience there.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:56.370
Beyond the well-crafted work,
I don't find -- it doesn't --

00:40:56.370 --> 00:41:00.730
I don't think that their
realization evoke any questions

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.660
about experience, about the
connection between experience,

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:07.400
knowledge, reality, fiction.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.870
And I do find these questions

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:15.170
in the Farners' realization,
and it's interesting.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:22.610
I don't know why they actually
decided to work from A to Z,

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:27.060
because the whole essence
of the work objects this --

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.940
but I would say that this
is the only linear part.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.240
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Okay.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.000
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Other
than that, the whole --

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.890
I mean, the encyclopedia --

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.000
there is nothing about
linearity in this --

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.460
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: So
it was really the kind

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.390
of traditional construction
in the invocation to go from A

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:49.850
to Z, even though in
neither the production

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.150
or reception, it doesn't.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.450
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yeah.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.750
I mean, you can browse
through the encyclopedia

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.430
without following the
A to Z, obviously.

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:59.600
You -- these are five binders.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.530
You are free -- you
have the freedom to --

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:06.540
as a tenant, to make changes
in other person property,

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:12.960
as Michel de Certeau says.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.890
And these -- also if --
you have the freedom to --

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:20.730
whether to open the envelope,
unfold the content --

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:23.880
which is very interesting.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.090
So you choose what
content to read,

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.210
what content to experience.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:34.410
Another thing that I find
very interesting is how --

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:36.630
what is the connection --
only at the beginning of this,

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:40.610
and I'm happy to hear
you -- your ideas.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:46.290
But I think this encyclopedia
raises epistemological

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:50.340
questions, and I didn't think
about them before in relation

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.980
to the artist book,
and the connection

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.510
between experience
and knowledge.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:59.280
And how do we know -- how does
our body know the experience

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.420
of the artist book,
and what do you do

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.870
when this is a realization
of actually something

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:06.240
that is completely fictional?

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.660
Where is the experience there?

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.960
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.470
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:11.770
Go ahead.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:15.570
&gt;&gt; I just have a followup
question about the Farners' --

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.630
or, Farner's "Encyclopedia."

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.640
How did the collaboration
break down, when it seemed

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:26.760
like it had the fluidity to be
such an exchange between people?

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.450
What transpired?

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:29.750
Do you know?

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.050
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: I
actually -- I don't know.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:34.800
I don't know what's happened,
and I ask Mark, and Mark told me

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:39.090
to ask Babs [laughter].

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:41.060
I don't know what
happened behind the scene,

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.040
but looking at the two
realizations, it's obviously

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.360
that there was a dispute.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.020
Because they are
completely different.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.320
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.620
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman:
I mean, it's a --

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.650
and by the way, when I'm looking
at other Barbara Farner's work,

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.640
the encyclopedia's different
from her other work as well.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.980
She's very craft-oriented
person, and this is --

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.070
it was like it's a whole
different trajectory

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.130
of her, yeah.

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:09.430
But I don't know.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.030
I mean -- and I think it would
be interesting not to write

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:14.430
about it, but I -- if
you can gain more --

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:16.180
but I wouldn't write
Barbara Farner

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.610
and ask her what happened.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:20.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no [laughter].

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.410
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman:
I really don't know.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.710
Yeah.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:25.700
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: Here's
another question, just to follow

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:34.910
up on the same thing, and
what Elinor was saying.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:42.670
It struck me as she was
talking that I don't think

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:47.170
that encyclopedias are
probably actually written

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.380
in alphabetical order.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:55.120
When somebody sits down to
create an encyclopedia --

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.420
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: That's true.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.720
That's totally true.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.860
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: -- I doubt
that they start with A, and --

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:09.870
I mean, even if it's just
one person writing it.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.430
And so, that had me
thinking about --

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:21.730
I'm one of these people who
works here in the library,

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:27.750
and is not trained
in the library.

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:38.370
So the ideas of discovery and
access were fairly new to me --

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.210
you know, I was already --

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:45.000
and I realized that a lot
of what libraries think

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.090
about is trying to make
material accessible or findable.

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:53.900
And so, that whole alphabetical
thing is simply age-old

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.090
convention to make
materials findable.

00:45:56.090 --> 00:46:00.570
And so, I just was
thinking about that --

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:05.070
your page numbers being
another version of that.

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:08.670
And I was just thinking
about that in terms

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:15.090
of what you were saying at the
beginning, about interacting

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:18.620
with the past, and the
forms, and also sort

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:22.260
of making something
new out of it.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.790
So it just struck
me as, you know --

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:25.890
the alphabetical thing is
about the presentation,

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:30.870
and maybe about the user, not
necessarily about the creations.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.170
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yes.

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:33.470
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: I don't know.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:34.770
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: I think so.

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:42.050
I think it's very interesting
point, and I'm almost --

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:48.510
I would say that I'm almost
positive that it wasn't done --

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:50.250
it wasn't done in linear order.

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:53.080
I don't think that the
other realization was done

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:58.370
in a linear order as well, but
this is how it's presented.

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:03.100
And this is -- this is the
accumulative experience,

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.780
the erfahrung that
we start with.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:09.410
So -- and this is why I'm
speaking about this dialectic,

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.600
and the continuous oscillation

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.790
between the erlebnis
and the erfahrung.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:19.450
How do you convey this lived
experienced out of something

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.210
that is already accumulated?

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:26.780
And this is why I
brought also Sam Winston,

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.250
because this is amazing, how
the work keep oscillating

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.990
between the layers of
"The New York Times,"

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:41.320
which is already an
accumulation of experience.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:49.280
And then Winston turn it into a
flash -- a new lived experience,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.310
and the whole structure
of his --

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:59.440
the formation of his
poem is going backwards.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.420
So he starts with
his erfahrung --

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.840
again, the accumulative
experience, and go backward

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.000
until he ends at the
lived experience.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.570
And I think this is -- I think

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:16.580
that this is how I
see the artist book.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:21.620
I think that this is
a -- it's a very --

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:29.060
it's a dialectic artist
phenomena, very different

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:36.260
from other genres
and artistic forms.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:48.510
And I think that I'm very
much into the critical impetus

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.120
of the artist book,
and I don't --

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:59.820
although many other artistic
forms wish to be critical,

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:04.350
political, I don't see this,
with the subversive trajectory

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.290
that the artist book offers.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:10.310
I think this is very
critical form of art.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:11.610
Beth?

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:13.910
&gt;&gt; So I went to Anton Kohold's
[assumed spelling] lecture

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:18.430
at the Codex Convention a
couple years ago, and --

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:19.870
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: San
Fran, yeah, two years --

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:21.170
&gt;&gt; -- yeah, San Francisco.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:22.470
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman:
-- three years ago.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:23.770
&gt;&gt; Is it three?

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:25.070
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: I think so.

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:26.370
You were there three
-- I think it was --

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:27.670
&gt;&gt; Anyway, the only term

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:28.970
that was used was
creative differences,

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.270
and now it's -- yeah.

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:31.570
But I could tell you that when
I first started on my project

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:32.870
that involved the two sets of
encyclopedias -- two things.

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:34.170
It really took me a while to
realize that they were supposed

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:35.470
to be about the same thing --

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:36.770
and the second thing was
that they all have --

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:38.070
I think have interest
because the other set on --

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:39.370
which is very interesting --

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:40.670
is written in several
different languages,

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:41.970
and very often uses color

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:43.270
to show you the differences
of those languages.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.570
So since I didn't
speak most of them,

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:45.870
it was all a guessing game
anyway, which I kind of enjoyed.

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.170
But I have to say I felt more
like I was being conducted

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.470
or led through the other
set, whereas this was a sense

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:49.770
of discovery in which
it didn't matter

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:51.070
that I didn't understand
half of what it was.

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:52.370
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: That's true.

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:53.670
&gt;&gt; I had so much fun -- it's
so much more interactive,

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.970
and again, you can choose
whether you go in and out,

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.270
and open it up, or how --

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:57.570
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: That's true.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:58.870
&gt;&gt; -- and you have this sense
of a collection of ephemera

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:00.170
with some other stuff in there.

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:01.470
But I think that the tactile
sense of moving the pieces

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:02.770
of that book, and the idea with
a notebook that it's a work

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:04.070
in progress, that there's
never really an end to it,

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:05.370
because every new
person who goes is going

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:06.670
to give it a new experience --
I think is what separates it

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:07.970
from the other one, and, for me,
ultimately is more satisfying.

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.270
&gt;&gt; Does it remind you
of childhood at all?

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:10.570
&gt;&gt; Yes, to some degree.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:11.870
That sense of discovery,
like when we were kids --

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:13.170
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking about
the binder.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:14.470
&gt;&gt; -- yeah, exactly.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.770
That's what I'm saying.

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.070
It's a work in progress, right?

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.370
Because when you bring
your notebook to school,

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.670
it's an ongoing experience.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:20.970
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: And you
have -- it's very interesting,

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.270
because they have fine-press
prints there, but they're all

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:23.570
in this very cheap binder.

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:24.870
And I think this is fascinating.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:26.170
The more I am involved in this
work, the more amazed I am,

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:29.890
the more experience I gain,
and it's -- I think --

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:32.440
yeah, I think it's an
amazing realization.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:40.870
&gt;&gt; There was another question --

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:46.020
&gt;&gt; No, I thank you very much.

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:54.490
This is -- your talk
has taught me a lot

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:58.570
about artist books
and libraries.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:02.600
You were talking about
categories and genres,

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:07.000
and how artist books
just don't' fit.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.300
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Reject, yeah.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:14.630
&gt;&gt; And I realized -- and I'm a
cataloguer here at the Library

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:18.180
of Congress, and
that's what we do.

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:21.840
We put things -- and we put
all of Na'ama's books together.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.850
We put, you know, Sam Winston's
books together, you know,

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:31.060
American history, and
it's very frustrating

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:39.060
for traditional librarians to
have to deal with them at all,

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.030
which is why so many
people want to say, "No,

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.860
no, no, it's sculpture.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.480
Send it to the National
Gallery."

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.780
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: I
actually look at --

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.780
I actually looked
-- how do you call?

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.080
The -- this compendium of --

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.600
this dictionary of
how to -- the --

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:54.900
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Cataloguers.

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.620
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: -- the --
yeah, but there is a name --

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.920
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: They
come out and -- yeah.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.220
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: --

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.520
the Library of Congress
has its own catalogue?

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.320
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, the
online catalogue.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.290
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yeah, so I
-- not the online catalogue,

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:10.200
the how -- the --

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:15.130
the categories, the
catalogue of the categories?

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:16.430
&gt;&gt; Subject --

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:17.730
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman:
Exactly, yeah.

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.630
So this is actually -- I'm
mentioning this in my proposal.

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:27.260
I said -- well, after all
this labyrinthian experience,

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:35.750
I'm saying, well, but, there
was an achievement in 1981 --

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:42.510
I think it was 1981 -- that was
the Library of Congress decided

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:44.680
to use the term artist book.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.870
And then, I found this
catalogue online, the --

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:54.040
this incredibly long amount of
subcategories, like you said.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:58.230
So artist book in this,
and in different countries,

00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:03.600
and artist book which are
more photography-oriented,

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:08.620
and so this -- and
it's an endless --

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:14.270
&gt;&gt; It's a real web, and
especially in the sense --

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:28.380
artist books end up in rare book
collections, and so the people

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:33.190
that are cataloguing,
and putting artist books

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:40.090
into categories are trained
in very traditional --

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:45.680
you know, usually
pre-1801 books.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.170
And so, they're rectangles.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:53.520
They fit on a shelf, and
they go in a straight line.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.730
I mean, this is what we do, and
it's all about finding things.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:58.710
You know, it's findability,

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:02.250
and so your talk has
helped me think about that.

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:05.260
And I for one -- I enjoy
cataloguing artist books,

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:09.980
because it is sort of a
mind-bending experience,

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:15.290
but many of my colleagues
are very happy about that,

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:18.260
because then they don't
have to [laughter].

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.510
And -- but anyway -- so -- but
your talk has helped me think

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:29.930
about this, and how -- it's a
real -- it's a real conflict,

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:33.500
in terms of how traditional
libraries are dealing.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.800
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yeah.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.100
Yeah, it's --

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.400
&gt;&gt; These works of art --
and is it art in a book?

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.700
Because that's all --

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:42.200
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: -- yeah, you
know, it's very interesting,

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:47.690
because I also find it -- I had
a paragraph that I took out,

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:52.560
when -- at the end of my
discussion of Book 91,

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:59.900
where I said that I think that,
in order to gain the experience,

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:04.620
it should be shown not
through any glass partition,

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.050
but it has to be in
library, browsed through.

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:11.630
And then, my advisor read
the talk, and he commented --

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:14.270
he said, "Oh, so now
you're being normative

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:18.190
with all your objections.

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:23.440
What is 'it should be
browsed,' or 'should be viewed'?

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.090
You are moving from being
epistemological person,

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:31.060
philosophical, and now
you're talking in terms

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:35.990
of where it should be viewed,
what are the right conditions."

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:42.790
And it was a very interesting
remark for me, and also,

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:45.140
I find myself --
I'm tempt to say

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.480
that this book should
be browsed,

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:53.740
but I don't want to go there.

00:55:53.740 --> 00:56:02.100
And I think that the artist
book, again, in its essence--

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:07.160
I -- doesn't wish to be
categorized also in viewing --

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:12.330
you know, in terms of
where to view it, or --

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:19.460
&gt;&gt; And don't tell me how
to look at this book.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.810
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: --
exactly, and I don't think

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:25.510
that the experience
is -- I think that --

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.180
again, if I'm talking about
experience, experience --

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:34.670
there is a whole
spectrum of experience.

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:42.730
One cannot say that this book
should be browsed through.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:46.180
You can have other
ways of experiencing.

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:49.340
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: You had
another -- you had a question?

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.490
&gt;&gt; So I was just curious.

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:56.440
I love the books that you've
chosen, and the points

00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.700
that you've made with them.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.380
Were there any close runners-up,

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.690
other books that you thought
made these same points,

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:09.880
but you weren't able
to include them?

00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.180
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: I did.

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.480
&gt;&gt; Just for time?

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.780
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman:
In my research,

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:18.350
I'm just finalizing the
list of books that I'm going

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:23.010
to write about, which is
very different from the list

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:25.500
that was approved at
the proposal [laughter].

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.960
No, but this is okay.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:32.670
I am going to write on "Unhappy
Readymade" of Marcel Duchamp,

00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:37.120
and I think this is a very
interesting work that --

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.590
using Euclidean book is
literally dismantling the --

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.090
the experience of civilization.

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:44.390
Sorry?

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:45.850
&gt;&gt; You've always loved that --

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.750
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yeah, I did.

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:49.050
&gt;&gt; -- work.

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:50.760
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: I
do, actually, yeah.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:54.620
And there is an Argentinian
artist, but I don't know

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.080
if I can pronounce
her name correctly.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:04.550
I haven't practiced it enough,
and I saw one of her works

00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:09.460
at MoMA's library
on Tuesday morning.

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.030
Her name is Mirfa der
Misache [assumed spelling].

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:14.560
Do you know her name,
this artist?

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.310
Der Misache?

00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:17.920
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I'm
thinking maybe [inaudible]?

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:22.700
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Mir -- no,
Mirfa der Misache, der Misache.

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:29.390
She invented -- I wouldn't say
even writing, but her subversion

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.980
against the Argentinian
government was

00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.760
through the free
set of sets of --

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.810
free strokes that she invented,
and the piece that I --

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:39.460
the work I saw at the MoMA's
library was a newspaper.

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.180
Which is fascinating, because
it's -- it is categorized.

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:46.620
You have bold titles,
and you have the --

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:53.250
and you even have different
typeface, but it's nothing

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:57.470
about writing, and nothing
that imitate to be writing.

00:58:57.470 --> 00:59:00.960
These are free strokes, but
the whole newspaper is --

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:06.250
and this was her way to
go against the government.

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:09.610
And I think it's
fantastic work, really.

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:13.090
The other work that I might
write about is On Kawara's

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:15.740
"I Met, I Read" -- "I Met, I
Read" -- the third one is --

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.040
"I Met, I Read" --
I don't remember.

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.530
Three -- three -- it
will come to me later.

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:21.830
He documents each of his
deeds on a daily basis,

00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:23.710
where he went -- oh, who he met.

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:25.650
I think it's even
more fascinating

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:29.830
than his date paintings,
because at the end,

00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:31.340
there are four pamphlets.

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.750
All the whole documentation
was done in 1969,

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:35.100
and the fourth pamphlet
is actually an interaction

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.400
between all the things --
all the people he saw, met,

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.700
all the -- all the places
he was, and this is amazing,

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.150
the continuous -- the infinite
possibilities of interactions

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:40.450
of his diaries, of
his documentation.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:41.750
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: Elinor,
you had another question?

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:43.050
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin:
Yeah, I was --

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:44.350
it's half-question
and half-comment.

00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:45.650
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Okay.

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:46.950
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: And
it seems like the --

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.250
many of the books that you're
looking at are the 20th,

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:49.550
21st century artist books.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:50.850
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yes.

00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:52.150
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Yeah,
because I was really taken --

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:53.450
and they're very
different, and this kind

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:54.750
of bolsters your point
about experience.

00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:56.050
But these works that have
also come out now playing --

00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:57.350
that kind of -- they're
printed works.

00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:58.650
They play with print.

00:59:58.650 --> 00:59:59.950
Not all the time, but
sometimes, they seem very much

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:01.250
in response to our
digital world.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.550
I'm thinking of J.S. Abrams

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:03.850
and Doug Dorse-esque
[assumed spellings],

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.150
with the envelopes
and everything else.

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:06.450
I'm thinking of B.S. Johnson,
"The Unfortunates," like a lot

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:07.750
of Ann Carson's [assumed
spelling] work ,

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.050
a lot of the work that comes --
but they're not artist books.

01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:10.350
They're something
-- I'm thinking --

01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.650
so, like, I'm thinking
of "Back to the Republic,

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:12.950
an Illuminated Manuscript,"

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:14.250
that you have artists
created this, too.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.550
I think Kidd [assumed
spelling] did one.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:16.850
Again, and most -- a lot of
them are book illustrators,

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:18.150
and they've decided
to embark on novels.

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:19.450
And this, for example, reminds
me of a page from either

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:20.750
"Revolution" -- Thurn's
"Revolution,"

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.050
where you actually have to
turn the book to read it,

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:25.660
or "House of Leaves," and it
also looks like performance art,

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.030
the installation
of text writing.

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:31.400
But what I really like
about this, that there is

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.910
so much experience and
movement on the page

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:37.490
without having something like --

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:38.980
where you should
-- performance art.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.280
It can be done with print.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.580
&gt;&gt; But there's also digital.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.880
I mean, a lot of
these texts are --

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.710
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Yeah,
they're only produced digitally.

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:47.200
They can't be produced
without the digital,

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.650
and these are not --
you're talking about --

01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:51.260
that's another major difference,

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.350
because these are
produced letterpress,

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.000
or other ways, right?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.710
But all these other works --
they're actually giving homage

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:02.220
to the printed word, but --

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.510
and print, and kind
of celebrating that.

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:07.070
But they couldn't
have been produced

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:11.010
without digital technology
to do them.

01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:12.310
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren:
I was going to say,

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:17.400
that actually would be produced
in -- first in Photoshop,

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.820
or in Illustrator, probably,
and then done palmer plate,

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.150
and then printed letter-press.

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:24.450
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Okay.

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:25.750
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: Yeah.

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:27.050
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: That's true.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.350
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: So it's
digital -- see, that --

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:29.650
all of this, and we don't have
some of these capabilities.

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:30.950
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: Yes.

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:32.460
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Which is
also rather ironic, sometimes,

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.360
in the sense of handcrafting.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.550
These -- because of what you
said, they're not the same,

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:40.280
but they're kind of
a family, or an --

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.630
and they're, I think,
to experience print.

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:45.530
But they're doing
their narratives.

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:47.780
They're not -- and
they're different kinds.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.880
Some of your books are
very much narratives,

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.110
but not necessarily linear.

01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:53.410
They're experiences.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.840
So it really is more of
kind of a supplement,

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.010
or kind of a complement
in to what -- make --

01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:59.380
your talk made me think about.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.680
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yes.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.980
I actually read the definition.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:06.780
I can't recall -- who was it?

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.790
He said -- he -- open
his book, and said --

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.570
he mentioned three books --

01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:16.270
Tristam Shandy [assumed
spelling], "Glas" by Derida --

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:20.510
I don't remember the third one,
but these are very nice books.

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:21.810
But they're not artist books.

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:23.110
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: Right.

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:24.410
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Why?

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:25.710
Because they were
not done by artists,

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:27.920
and I totally disagree
with this.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.790
And I don't think
-- I'm not here --

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:36.660
I would say even more than that,
I'm not interested in saying,

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.140
"This is an artist book, and
this is not an artist book,"

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.590
because then I object
my whole idea

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:48.440
of the constant oscillation,
and the rejection.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.380
I think these are -- these
books are definitely --

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:53.540
evoke experience.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.840
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin:
Yeah, I definitely do,

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.340
but other books do in
different -- they have the --

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:00.310
they're more genealogically
akin to these books,

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.110
and I'm not getting in a
debate whether you want

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:03.510
to call them or not.

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.360
I see a difference in them,

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.970
but they're genealogically
connected.

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:09.270
You know, that's --

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:13.140
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yeah, I
saw also a wonderful spectrum

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:18.560
of the layers of experience at
the New York Public Library,

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:24.970
where different artists redid
"Un coup de des" of Mallarme,

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:27.050
which was very interesting.

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:32.510
Because this is -- you
take work that is --

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:36.650
already exists, and you
re-experience it again

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:37.950
and again.

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:41.030
I saw Marcel Boudar's
[assumed spelling] recitation

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:44.210
of "Un coup de des," which
was very interesting, yeah.

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:45.510
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin:
It's a company.

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:48.290
Visual Design does that,
a publisher in London.

01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:50.490
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yes, yes,
Visual -- yes, yes, yes.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:51.790
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin:
Did Tristam Shandy --

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:53.090
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: I have --

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:54.390
I have Tristam Shandy
by them, yes.

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:55.690
&gt;&gt; Elinor Shevlin: --
yeah, they wanted to do --

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.090
it was Adam Thurwell
[assumed spelling], not Thurn,

01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:03.450
that I was -- I knew
I had that coming.

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:06.370
Forgot his name.

01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:09.560
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Delaware Library
-- our library director decided

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.230
that our special collections was
no longer two collector artist

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:19.210
books, and we asked her
what was an artist book.

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:20.510
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: And?

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:25.080
&gt;&gt; She had no answer.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.380
And [inaudible] then,
you have to say,

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.680
"Well, what is an artist?"

01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:33.880
It -- but you cannot
categorize --

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.240
I guess the only thing
one could say is,

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.610
you know it when you
see it [laughter] --

01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:40.430
which may or may not be true.

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:41.730
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yeah.

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:43.030
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: Any
other questions or comments?

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:47.000
We should take a few
minutes to look at what --

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.300
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yeah.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.600
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Barren: --
brought out for us.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.900
&gt;&gt; Na'ama Zussman: Yeah,
but please let me browse

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.510
through the books,
because -- thank you.

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:56.650
