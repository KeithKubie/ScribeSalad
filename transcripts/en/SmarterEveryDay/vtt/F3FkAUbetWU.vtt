00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
Hey it's me, Destin,

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.820
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.480
In one of the previous episodes, we shot a 22 caliber bullet against various Prince Rupert's Drops

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.400
and you saw it splatter against the glass

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.140
it was fascinating.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.540
Now a lot of people had comments on that, and they said that the problem was the lead would just splash against the glass, it didn't hold itself together.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:25.180
Instead of doing what we did last time, which was a .22 long rifle bullet which was about 36 grains, going about 1,200 feet per second,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:36.920
this time we're going to do this. It's a .22 Magnum bullet, I am bad at this, it is a 40 grain bullet, but it's going 1,875 feet per second, which is much, much faster.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.900
In my mind, the most important thing about this, is that it's a full metal jacket, meaning it shouldn't splatter like the .22 lead bullet did

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.300
It should hold itself together and impart more of that momentum to the Prince Rupert's drop.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.220
Anyway, if that doesn't work, then the other pistol that I have handy is this, my .38 special

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.000
.38 special is a much, much larger bullet.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.360
I know everybody wants me to do the .50 BMG, but I want to step this up incrementally

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.840
because I wanna find out where the point of breaking a Prince Rupert's drop is.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.960
So, I don't know if this is going to work but I have a 22 Magnum

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.600
the last time I did the shot was with a .22

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.970
wtih just the lead bullet now we have a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.680
full metal jacket so I'm going to shoot

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.540
the Prince Rupert's drop if I can get it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.720
in the right spot and see if the Prince

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.580
Rupert's drop will beat that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.700
here we go

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:37.910
What!? What? All right that was a full metal, that was

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.640
a .22 Magnum what on earth

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.030
okay

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.269
look at that they're tougher than I

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.450
thought okay we used a .22 Magnum last

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.459
time now we're going to do a .38 special

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.260
that was a Full Metal Jacket this is

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.970
going to be a full metal jacket you can

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.739
see that this particular Prince Rupert's

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.810
drop doesn't have a bubble in it and

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.299
that's atypical so I'm wondering if that

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.640
makes it stronger this is definitely

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.079
going to break because it's got a long

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.060
tail the question is if it breaks at

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.730
impact or if it breaks because of the tail

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.360
moving like we've seen before yes

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:09.560
oh no way no way oh shut up

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:18.329
please say you triggered oh god okay okay

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.720
dude it just took a .38 special all right

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.700
we just lost light so we can't do

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.209
another one today

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:15.160
that's absolutely ridiculous that might be

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.889
the best slow motion I've ever captured

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.509
I think it's stronger because

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.610
there's not an air bubble in it at all

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.310
and that's atypical we can see instead

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.840
of an air bubble it pulled in the outer

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.389
edge there, pulled in the outside this

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.180
is a special one you know the only place

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.039
to go here is higher caliber so we'll do

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.590
a .223 and AK-47 in the next video

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.300
(drop it, drop it) okay I hope you enjoyed

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.889
this episode of Smarter Every Day

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.020
obviously we can't rest here I'm going

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.380
to do this with bigger guns next video

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.600
pretty soon it's going to happen. Anyway -

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.240
I want to say thanks to the sponsor

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.540
which is Casper.com. Casper makes

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.240
mattresses and my wife told me years ago

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.210
that we were going to get a Casper and

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.880
once we did that they've been sponsoring

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:15.500
ever since. [Laughter] That stays, please say it

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.550
was in frame -- all right Casper ships the

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.800

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.330
so you're circumventing the whole like

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.550
you know store taking money off of you

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.349
process okay this is a really

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.479
high-quality mattress we've had one for

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.009
several years when it was time to get

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.539
one for the guest bedroom we decided to

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.050
do it because we liked the feel of it

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.960

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.740
