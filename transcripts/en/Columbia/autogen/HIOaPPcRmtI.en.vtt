00:51:28.779 --> 00:51:31.049
area half a million dollar while if you
buy one dunam which is a thousand square

00:51:31.049 --> 00:51:31.059
buy one dunam which is a thousand square
 

00:51:31.059 --> 00:51:33.689
buy one dunam which is a thousand square
meter on that table it will be ten

00:51:33.689 --> 00:51:33.699
meter on that table it will be ten

thousand dollars so the historic centers

00:51:38.519 --> 00:51:38.529
thousand dollars so the historic centers
 

00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:41.399
thousand dollars so the historic centers
that we are trying to protect are in the

00:51:41.399 --> 00:51:41.409
that we are trying to protect are in the
 

00:51:41.409 --> 00:51:45.209
that we are trying to protect are in the
center of this paper so you can imagine

00:51:45.209 --> 00:51:45.219
center of this paper so you can imagine
 

00:51:45.219 --> 00:51:48.269
center of this paper so you can imagine
the kind of pressure we have from the

another issue that I had forgotten to to

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:02.800
another issue that I had forgotten to to
 

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.620
another issue that I had forgotten to to
mention actually it's very difficult

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:04.630
mention actually it's very difficult
 

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:07.020

very tiny and the West Bank has almost
550 checkpoints so it's difficult to

550 checkpoints so it's difficult to
 

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.450
550 checkpoints so it's difficult to
move to move about and that's why

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:24.460

again during we can always say the

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:08.020
again during we can always say the
 

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.110
again during we can always say the
problem is either from the British or

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:10.120
problem is either from the British or
 

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.850
problem is either from the British or
the Israelis it's very easy for the

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:11.860
the Israelis it's very easy for the

any of our the mistakes
 

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:19.089
any of our the mistakes
but there is something called did not

00:56:19.089 --> 00:56:19.099
but there is something called did not
 

00:56:19.099 --> 00:56:21.549

land registration that happened in the

00:56:21.549 --> 00:56:21.559
land registration that happened in the
 

00:56:21.559 --> 00:56:25.150
land registration that happened in the
40s in which the British were trying to

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160
40s in which the British were trying to
 

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:29.410
40s in which the British were trying to
register each person's land and we call

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:29.420
register each person's land and we call
 

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:34.770
register each person's land and we call
it test VA and this did not happen and

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:34.780
it test VA and this did not happen and
 

00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.890
it test VA and this did not happen and
now people know exactly their lands and

00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:38.900
now people know exactly their lands and
 

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:42.160
now people know exactly their lands and
they do have proofs but for the Israel

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:42.170
they do have proofs but for the Israel
 

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:44.079
they do have proofs but for the Israel

00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:46.569
is it's a completely it's a it's a very
complex issue but when it comes to

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:46.579
complex issue but when it comes to
 

00:56:46.579 --> 00:56:48.370
complex issue but when it comes to
historic centers we don't have any of

00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:48.380
historic centers we don't have any of
 

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:50.020
historic centers we don't have any of
those problems of course we have a

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:50.030
those problems of course we have a
 

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:53.349
those problems of course we have a
problem of divided ownership because the

00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359
problem of divided ownership because the

California or in Chile or in South so we

00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:08.329
California or in Chile or in South so we
 

00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:11.289
California or in Chile or in South so we
do have a problem with ownership but

00:57:11.289 --> 00:57:11.299
do have a problem with ownership but
 

00:57:11.299 --> 00:57:14.440
do have a problem with ownership but
that's double effect on the one hand

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:14.450
that's double effect on the one hand
 

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:16.870
that's double effect on the one hand
it's good because it means that people

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880
it's good because it means that people
 

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.170

00:57:22.089 --> 00:57:22.099
something public that's why it's very
 

00:57:22.099 --> 00:57:24.400
something public that's why it's very
easy for someone to agree to give us

difficult sometimes that the ownership

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:31.730
difficult sometimes that the ownership
 

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:34.510
difficult sometimes that the ownership
is quite divided and not easy to solve

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520
is quite divided and not easy to solve
 

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:44.099
is quite divided and not easy to solve
but it has its implication on our work

00:57:44.099 --> 00:57:44.109
 

00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:47.290
planning that's more at the city scale

building I mean you mentioned zoning but
you also do interventions in the urban

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:53.510
you also do interventions in the urban

those but yes as I said we started with

00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319
those but yes as I said we started with
 

00:58:03.319 --> 00:58:05.530
those but yes as I said we started with
single buildings then then we moved into

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:05.540
single buildings then then we moved into
 

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:07.930
single buildings then then we moved into
the revitalization of a whole town and

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:07.940
the revitalization of a whole town and
 

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:11.109
the revitalization of a whole town and
what we do y ou will these are the

00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119
what we do y ou will these are the
 

00:58:11.119 --> 00:58:13.420
what we do y ou will these are the
following steps that we do first we do

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:13.430
following steps that we do first we do
 

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:15.940
following steps that we do first we do
as I mentioned before a study we have to

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:15.950
as I mentioned before a study we have to
 

00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:18.609
as I mentioned before a study we have to
understand the situation there so we do

00:58:18.609 --> 00:58:18.619
understand the situation there so we do
 

00:58:18.619 --> 00:58:20.800
understand the situation there so we do
have social economic architectural

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:20.810
have social economic architectural
 

00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:22.630
have social economic architectural
environmental and all the studies that

environmental and all the studies that
 

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.880
environmental and all the studies that
you can think of that we need to

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:24.890
you can think of that we need to
 

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:27.010
you can think of that we need to
understand and collect the information

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:27.020
understand and collect the information
 

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.559
understand and collect the information
we do have the also the architectural

00:58:29.559 --> 00:58:29.569
we do have the also the architectural
 

00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:33.089
we do have the also the architectural
National Register that I mentioned now

00:58:33.089 --> 00:58:33.099
National Register that I mentioned now
 

00:58:33.099 --> 00:58:36.670
National Register that I mentioned now
next we do the infrastructure it's very

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.680
next we do the infrastructure it's very
 

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.160
next we do the infrastructure it's very
important for us we find out that

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:39.170
important for us we find out that
 

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:41.589

improving the infrastructure in those

00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599
improving the infrastructure in those
 

00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:43.930

so infrastructure is one of the things

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920
so infrastructure is one of the things
 

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:51.160
so infrastructure is one of the things
that we start with so we do all the

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:51.170
that we start with so we do all the
 

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:53.230
that we start with so we do all the
electrical mechanical all the electrical

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240
electrical mechanical all the electrical
 

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:56.160
electrical mechanical all the electrical
and telephone and what have you lines

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:56.170

furniture as you saw in some of these
now then we do two three things at the

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:06.710
now then we do two three things at the
 

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:09.640
now then we do two three things at the
same time one is what we call a catalyst

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:09.650
same time one is what we call a catalyst
 

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:12.880
same time one is what we call a catalyst
buildings instead of renovating because

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:12.890
buildings instead of renovating because
 

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:14.950
buildings instead of renovating because
renovating every single building really

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960
renovating every single building really
 

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.870
renovating every single building really
costs a lot of money the average of one

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880
costs a lot of money the average of one
 

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.609
costs a lot of money the average of one
hundred thousand dollars for each one of

00:59:18.609 --> 00:59:18.619
hundred thousand dollars for each one of
 

00:59:18.619 --> 00:59:20.109
hundred thousand dollars for each one of
those buildings so we don't have this

00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:20.119
those buildings so we don't have this
 

00:59:20.119 --> 00:59:23.800
those buildings so we don't have this
kind of money so what we do we do what

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:23.810
kind of money so what we do we do what
 

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:27.339
kind of money so what we do we do what
we call catalyst or Nord projects in the

00:59:27.339 --> 00:59:27.349
we call catalyst or Nord projects in the
 

00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:28.960
we call catalyst or Nord projects in the
different neighborhood so we will have

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:28.970
different neighborhood so we will have
 

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:31.599
different neighborhood so we will have
one two three buildings one could be a

00:59:31.599 --> 00:59:31.609
one two three buildings one could be a
 

00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:33.309
one two three buildings one could be a
cultural center one is for the

00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319
cultural center one is for the

for example we think very strong what

00:59:38.859 --> 00:59:38.869
for example we think very strong what
 

00:59:38.869 --> 00:59:41.829
for example we think very strong what
will bring people in if we make it a

00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839
will bring people in if we make it a
 

00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:44.740
will bring people in if we make it a
post office if we make it a clinic so

00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:44.750
post office if we make it a clinic so
 

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:47.380
post office if we make it a clinic so
many times bringing people into the

00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:47.390
many times bringing people into the
 

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:49.540
many times bringing people into the
neighborhood is very important but these

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:49.550
neighborhood is very important but these
 

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:51.500
neighborhood is very important but these
are mostly decided as I

much earlier in the 20s and 30s but it
 

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:58.080
much earlier in the 20s and 30s but it
reflected itself in the architecture

reflected itself in the architecture
 

01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:03.340
reflected itself in the architecture
sometime in the mid 40s and now as we

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:03.750
of the water and we consume ten percent
of the water of our own wonders so it is

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760
of the water of our own wonders so it is
 

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.450
of the water of our own wonders so it is
quite a bit of a of a problem and

01:20:06.450 --> 01:20:06.460
quite a bit of a of a problem and
 

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:08.129
quite a bit of a of a problem and
actually you start feeling it on

01:20:08.129 --> 01:20:08.139
actually you start feeling it on
 

01:20:08.139 --> 01:20:10.620
actually you start feeling it on
everyday level well you don't have water

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:10.630
everyday level well you don't have water
 

01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:12.750
everyday level well you don't have water
every day in many of the Palestinian

01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:12.760
every day in many of the Palestinian
 

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:17.170
every day in many of the Palestinian
towns and villages so it is quite a

01:20:17.170 --> 01:20:17.180
towns and villages so it is quite a
 

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.780
towns and villages so it is quite a
a problem and that's why I think the

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:19.790
a problem and that's why I think the
 

01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:22.900
a problem and that's why I think the
whole issue of having water wells should

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:22.910
whole issue of having water wells should
 

01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:25.630
whole issue of having water wells should
come back because traditionally every

01:20:25.630 --> 01:20:25.640
come back because traditionally every
 

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.640
come back because traditionally every
single house used to have a water heater

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:27.650
single house used to have a water heater
 

01:20:27.650 --> 01:20:30.790
single house used to have a water heater
well and if I were the mayor I would

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800
well and if I were the mayor I would
 

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.800
well and if I were the mayor I would
make that obligatory they haven't done

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:32.810
make that obligatory they haven't done
 

01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:39.060
make that obligatory they haven't done
that done that yet the issue of of

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:39.070
that done that yet the issue of of
 

01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:43.510
that done that yet the issue of of
sewage is a big problem in Palestine the

01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520
sewage is a big problem in Palestine the
 

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.210
sewage is a big problem in Palestine the
reason for that again is whenever you

01:20:46.210 --> 01:20:46.220
reason for that again is whenever you
 

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:49.990
reason for that again is whenever you
want to have a treatment plant for a

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000
want to have a treatment plant for a
 

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.080
want to have a treatment plant for a
city like Ramallah or beer together you

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:53.090
city like Ramallah or beer together you
 

01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:55.360
city like Ramallah or beer together you
need a sewage plant how do you call the

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:55.370
need a sewage plant how do you call the
 

01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:58.780
need a sewage plant how do you call the
treatment plant and it has to be in the

01:20:58.780 --> 01:20:58.790
treatment plant and it has to be in the
 

01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:02.290
treatment plant and it has to be in the
area and the Israelis will not give us a

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:02.300
area and the Israelis will not give us a
 

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.930
area and the Israelis will not give us a
permit until unless we agree that this

01:21:04.930 --> 01:21:04.940
permit until unless we agree that this
 

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:07.240
permit until unless we agree that this
sat there will be peace between the

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:07.250
sat there will be peace between the
 

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:09.310
sat there will be peace between the
settlers that our sewage and the

01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320
settlers that our sewage and the
 

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:13.600
settlers that our sewage and the
subtlest sewage will be together that's

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:13.610
subtlest sewage will be together that's
 

01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:15.070
subtlest sewage will be together that's
