“This episode of DNews is brought to you
by Audible.”

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.819
They just talk, talk, talk all the time. It's
maddening, I'm trying to watch TV and they

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:13.819
just start gabbing and chattering. Does this
sound familiar? Welp, it's your fault.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:21.469
Hey ladies and gentlemen, Trace here for DNews
with more interesting science. Listening to

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.130
that introduction, did you think I was talking
about a woman? Or a man? To be honest, the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.310
answer doesn't REALLY matter, but the stereotype
is real -- the stereotype is that women talk

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.440
more. They're Chatty Cathys, Gossip Girls
and Miss Chatterboxes, but science says this

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.440
stereotype is NOT TRUE! And yet, when researchers
found the answer, it kind of makes you go…

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.140
Oh. That makes sense.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.280
Who talks more has been studied for years
by scientists, and from various angles. Scientists

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.190
have looked at the number of words used per
day, time spent talking, who takes more turns

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.290
talking and even whether one group is BETTER
at language than the other. Dozens of different

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.750
studies have tried to answer this silly stereotype
-- who talks more, and why… And it turns

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.890
out by most measures -- men and women talk
the same amount.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.120
In 2004[a]: the American Psychological Association
took the results of 73 different studies of

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.900
children, and found that boys and girls talk
about the same -- though girl's language skills

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.000
tended to develop more quickly.
In 2007[b]: The University of Texas at Austin

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.550
found both men and women in the US and Mexico
use an average of about 16,000 words per day.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.950
While another study from University of California[c]
found men talked a little bit more.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.870
And in 2008[d]: A study in Neuropsychologia
found that YES, the brains of girls process

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.100
words better than the brains of boys -- and
now a 2014 study took the research to a new

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.880
level. They added the element of CONTEXT.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.960
Boom. Mind blown, right? Of COURSE where you
are is going to change what you talk about,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.920
and how much you have to say. Right now, at
this moment, I'm probably talking more than

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.440
you -- but that doesn't mean I'm more chatty
overall!

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.510
The study, published in Scientific Reports,
gave two groups of people "sociometers," which

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.940
are wearable, cellphone-sized devices that
can measure real-time social interaction data.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.590
One group was male and female master's students,
the other were workers at a call center. The

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.400
group of master's students were asked to grade
a project in 12 hours, and they talked A LOT.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.010
While the group at the call center were in
a lunch-room on break -- and thus talked only

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.810
a little.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.069
For the masters students women tended to have
longer conversations with other women, but

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.310
overall, communication was similar. And in
the lunchroom it was virtually equal in all

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.819
respects.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.810
And, you can break this down even further.
In groups of less than six people, the female

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.430
master's students talked more, but in groups
of MORE than six the males talked more, but

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.790
when there were no groups built by the participants,
there was, Quote, "No detectable difference

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.810
in talkativeness between men and women. Perhaps
this indicates some kind of bias in the way

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.640
we structure our group communication? More
research is needed there, but can we PLEASE

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.900
put to rest the "women talk all the time"
crap. It's simply not true.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.930
Now, if you're mad because your friend is
talking during the Big Game, or The New Girl

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.099
or Orange is the New Black -- that's different.
That's just your friend and you having to

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.590
deal wit some things.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.319
So who does most of the gabbing in your social
group, the guys or the ladies?

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.680
Why do you think people talk while you're
watching something? (&lt;-- dumb)
