00:00:05.206 --> 00:00:06.346
&gt;&gt;Adam: Couple of little brief things.

00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:07.756
We have the agenda over there.

00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:10.816
Some things we wanted to bring
up, and we only got half-an-hour,

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:13.176
so do our best to use
our time efficiently.

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:17.006
&gt;&gt;Brent: When teachers talk to each
other, teachers learn from each other.

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:23.496
There's so many great ideas that our
teachers come up with that engage kids,

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:27.506
get kids to think outside of
the box that I'm just amazed

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:28.966
at what we can accomplish
when we work together.

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:37.886
&gt;&gt;Brent: Individuals create great ideas,
but really to move schools forward,

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:42.076
I believe that everyone needs
to be together and in dialoguing

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:45.466
with each other, and
creating a conversation

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.616
about how to best serve students.

00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:51.036
&gt;&gt;Adam: I feel really fortunate that at
our school, we have grade level prep,

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:54.486
which means that every day all of
the sixth grade teachers are able

00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:58.436
to discuss various topics whether
that be student concerns we have,

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:00.246
or how to better integrate curriculum.

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:04.216
&gt;&gt;Adam: Here is what is--
remains of the weather balloon.

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:04.686
We're really excited.

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:06.976
This actually pretty much
everything, minus the balloon itself.

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:08.976
&gt;&gt;Teachers: Oh!

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:10.046
[laughter]

00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:10.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That looks good.

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:12.086
&gt;&gt;Adam: Last year, an
engineering teacher

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:14.666
and myself thought it'd be
really great to have a sort

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.176
of science-engineering crossover project

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.176
where we launched a high-altitude
weather balloon way

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:23.476
up into the stratosphere, with the
intention of getting some unique data

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.976
to help reinforce sixth grade topics
of watershed studies and whatnot.

00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:28.336
&gt;&gt;Students: Three, two, one, blast!

00:01:28.836 --> 00:01:37.006
[cheering]

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:41.166
&gt;&gt;Adam: And here is the tree it
landed on somewhere in the Klickitat.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:41.233
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:44.026
&gt;&gt;Adam: It went somewhere in-between.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:46.616
And that's what we're
going to try to show...

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:47.133
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.136
&gt;&gt;Adam: ...to everyone using this data

00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:49.976
that everyone's pawing
through right now.

00:01:51.306 --> 00:01:54.906
&gt;&gt;Adam: I definitely had a pretty
clear idea in mind of what I wanted

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:58.116
to do upon retrieving our
weather balloon, and it was great

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:02.106
to bring the topic to the rest of the
team to find out how we could connect it

00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:04.376
to language arts and
other content areas.

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:07.746
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yesterday, we were able to
make a crossover connection to math.

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:10.466
I was having students actually
looking through the data.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:14.636
And I was trying to rack my brain about
how we might make more of a robust

00:02:15.146 --> 00:02:16.596
like language arts connection.

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:17.676
That's not my strength.

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:18.976
I was wondering if you
guys had any ideas.

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:21.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You could also do a
really cool imagination piece

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:23.016
with the travel of that, too.

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.606
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I agree the
picture was traced on top

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:25.866
of it would tell the story.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:29.006
&gt;&gt;Teacher: But I think it's a great way
to bring in the scientific writing, too.

00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:29.966
I mean, you could do both.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.056
You could take them both at this time.

00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:32.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You could do the same
type of writing for both of them.

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:34.816
One would be scientific writing.

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:37.316
And one would be creative writing,
and basically we're inspired

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:40.566
by one single experience, and how could
you look at it from both perspectives?

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:40.976
&gt;&gt;Adam: That'd be cool!

00:02:42.046 --> 00:02:43.116
&gt;&gt;Brent: You have to
provide the structure

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:44.926
for collaboration; that's essential.

00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:49.866
You can't have collaboration if teachers
don't have time to collaborate and so

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:54.686
by tweaking a Master Schedule, you can
provide opportunities for collaboration.

00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:57.956
That collaboration leads
to great things.

00:02:57.956 --> 00:03:01.516
&gt;&gt;Anne Marie: Because of that common
prep time, it allows every team

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:05.316
to plan field trips that
allow them to figure out,

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:08.546
"How do we related the curriculum
within the different subject areas?"

00:03:08.716 --> 00:03:11.326
&gt;&gt;Anne Marie: So we remember
we went on a field trip.

00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:15.286
That was gathering data for helping
the kids understand science based

00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:18.146
on where we live, and our
unique geology in The Gorge.

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:21.086
&gt;&gt;Angie: When the science teachers
decided to do this geology unit

00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:24.726
on land formations, we saw the
opportunity as language arts teachers

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:28.836
to bring the idea of the legends
that explain these into reading

00:03:28.836 --> 00:03:31.806
and language arts so they could
write a legend and then perform it.

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:34.986
&gt;&gt;Angie: And they could choose to work
alone or in partners, or in a group.

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:38.786
And they've done skits an
storybooks, and comic strips,

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:39.976
and puppet shows, and iMovies.

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:43.816
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Awesome, are
those recorded somewhere

00:03:43.816 --> 00:03:44.976
that we could watch, or are they...?

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:47.596
&gt;&gt;Diesel: We took a trip, and
it was meant to be for science,

00:03:47.986 --> 00:03:51.046
and then in this class, we're writing
like legends about Beacon Rock

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:53.906
and Wahclella Falls, and like
how Hood River Gorge came to be.

00:03:53.906 --> 00:03:57.816
&gt;&gt;Anne Marie: The effect for the
kids is they hear common messages.

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:03.446
Rather than it being discreet classrooms
and subjects and teachers and classes.

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:05.566
They see it all relating together.

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:08.896
&gt;&gt;Adam: It is incredibly
important to allow teachers

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:10.386
to collaborate and work together.

00:04:10.486 --> 00:04:13.246
Not only to enrich the
learning of all their students,

00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:14.896
but ourselves as professionals.
