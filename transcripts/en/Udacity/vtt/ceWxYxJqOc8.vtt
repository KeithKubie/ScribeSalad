00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.202
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It looks like two numbers convey a lot of information. In algebra we use a

00:00:04.202 --> 00:00:08.791
similar system to identify locations. This is system is called the coordinate

00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:13.320
plane or the Cartesian plane. The system uses two lines known as the x axis and

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.129
the y axis. The x axis is the horizontal line and the y axis is the vertical

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:22.937
line that runs through plane. By drawing this graph we can create an infinite

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:27.467
world of numbers and intersections. Where the x axis and y axis intersect is

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:32.351
called the origin, the center. Just like we labelled streets and avenues on our

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:36.847
maps, we can label our axes with numbers, 0, 1, 2, and so on. We can do this in

00:00:36.847 --> 00:00:41.676
the horizontal direction and in the vertical direction. To indicate a point on

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:45.738
this Cartesian system, how many numbers would we need to specify? This can be

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:49.710
tricky, so think back to our map. How many numbers would we need to specify a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.647
point like this? I'm not asking you for the location, I'm asking you for the

00:00:53.647 --> 00:00:56.113
number of points. Put your answer in this box.
