00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.730
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.760
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.610
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.450
Our guest today is Amartya Sen,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.836
who is the Lamont professor of economics

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:47.383
and philosophy at Harvard,
a university professor,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.040
the 1998 Nobel Laureate in economics,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.370
A fellow at Trinity College in England,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.920
and he is visiting the Berkeley campus

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.660
as the 2005 Hitchcock lecturer.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.176
Professor Sen, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:06.325
- Thank you very much.

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:07.161
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:10.233
- Well I was born in Bengal,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.833
what was then undivided India,

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:18.170
about 100 miles off Calcutta
in a place called Santiniketan,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.750
which is an academic establishment

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.140
where Rabindranath Tagore, the poet,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.630
had established a school,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.154
and then later it became an
institute for higher education,

00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:31.670
where I also studied.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.740
But my family comes from Dhaka,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.912
which is now the capital of Bangladesh.

00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:38.944
But I was born in the maternal parents',

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:43.944
maternal grandparents' home,
which was in Santiniketan,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.823
and went back to Dhaka when I
was extremely tiny, I guess.

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:52.351
- Looking back, how did your parents

00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:53.993
shape your thinking about the world?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.226
- Well, I mean the family
was rather academic.

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:04.070
My father was professor of chemistry,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.440
my grandfather was professor of Sanskrit.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.034
So, you know, there was a lot of academic

00:02:10.034 --> 00:02:14.030
prejudice within the family, as it were,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.140
regarding that was a natural form of life.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.682
I was born in the campus
in Santiniketan, in fact,

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:24.480
and spent most of my life
in one campus or another.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.580
And my parents have too,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.580
so in a sense, that was one
of the things of association.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.880
But my father was, of course,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.650
a scientist, he was a chemist who did

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.916
first physics and maths
and then did chemistry.

00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:44.454
So there was a kind of interest
in science, which I had.

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:49.287
But my maternal grandfather
being a Sanskritist,

00:02:49.287 --> 00:02:53.630
I had a lot of interest also in history,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.030
in culture, and classics.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.529
I did Sanskrit before I did English.

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:03.529
So I think there was a
kind of general interest

00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:08.554
in academic matters, both
on the scientific side

00:03:08.743 --> 00:03:11.090
as well as literary and cultural side.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.090
My mother, actually, who
still is alive, 92 now,

00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:20.907
she is somewhat reduced by age,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.210
but still edits a
magazine, and in her youth

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.023
was an incredible dancer actually.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.343
But that was many many many years ago.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.623
- In your biography for
the Nobel Prize committee,

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:48.623
you emphasized the high
quality and distinctiveness

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.400
of your pre-collegiate education in India,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.550
a place where you really
developed a curiosity

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.910
and came to understand
the importance of thinking

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.193
as opposed to making grades.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.430
- Yeah, high quality,
one has to qualify that,

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.314
that is in terms of
being an exacting school

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:15.777
where you did everything, you know,

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:20.777
in as extended a form as possible.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.890
Just in that standard,

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.743
Santiniketan was a high quality place.

00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:31.970
In fact, things were very relaxed.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.260
There was very little pressure
on you to do anything.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.080
If you didn't want to do
much, you didn't do much.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.920
So it was high quality in having

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.640
a rather different
philosophy of education,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.720
which involved a lot more freedom,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.720
a lot more choice, a lot more
interest in the whole world.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.239
You know, not just India,
not just Imperial Britain,

00:04:55.239 --> 00:05:00.210
but also China and Japan and Malaysia

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.660
and Indonesia and Thailand on one side,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.407
and similarly, the Middle East and Africa

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:09.563
and the other European
cultures also quite a bit.

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:11.930
And a fair amount of interest
in the United States.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.570
So we had a kind of internationalism.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.333
The institution is called Visva Bharti.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.850
Visva is world, bharti is knowledge,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.150
so the motto of it, indeed the name of it,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.500
indicates they were trying to

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.410
capture knowledge across the world.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.110
So there was the internationalism.

00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:31.070
There was a great deal

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.240
of emphasis on thinking independently.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.850
And in these respects, yes,
it was a distinguished school.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.371
On the other hand, I think
a lot of my classmates

00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:45.810
in the same year in
Calcutta, or even Dhaka,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.051
would have had known much more

00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:54.051
in terms of the standard
school curriculum than we did,

00:05:55.332 --> 00:05:57.100
because the focus wasn't on that.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.710
- Given this background,
was it inevitable,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.100
do you think, that the
focus of your life's work

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.913
would be ideas and the
importance of ideas?

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.830
- I don't know that anything is inevitable

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.830
in that sense in life, but
it probably did influence me.

00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:16.503
Certainly.

00:06:17.357 --> 00:06:21.050
But you know, we were, I've been,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.332
even though I truly love hearing

00:06:24.332 --> 00:06:26.937
and reading about great ideas,

00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:29.210
my life has also been somewhat

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.893
involved with action, of course.

00:06:31.893 --> 00:06:35.030
I was interested in politics

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.968
and I was interested in
activities of various kinds.

00:06:39.968 --> 00:06:42.470
Including, the Nobel gave me a chance

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.520
to start two trusts, one in
India and one in Bangladesh,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.270
dealing particularly with
elementary education,

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.663
elementary healthcare and gender equity.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.650
And I've been very active in that research

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.950
in that area too, and intervention.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.067
And also since I was, for three years,

00:07:00.067 --> 00:07:02.852
honorary president of Oxfam,

00:07:02.852 --> 00:07:06.056
that, as you know, is not a,

00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:09.070
I mean it has a high ideology,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.960
but it's also an institution of action,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.160
and it's an NGO which is present

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.387
nearly everywhere in the world.

00:07:18.387 --> 00:07:23.387
I was very privileged to
be associated with Oxfam,

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:26.396
which I still am, I'm no
longer honorary president,

00:07:26.396 --> 00:07:27.743
I'm honorary advisor of them.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.656
So I think, yes ideas, but
quite a lot of the ideas

00:07:31.656 --> 00:07:34.966
have been concerned with
actions of various kinds.

00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:38.240
You know, across the globe.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.870
A lot of it in India and Bangladesh,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.000
but quite a lot of it outside too.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.470
- It sounds like there was a movement

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.550
toward a political philosophy

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.020
and economics as, there
were many opportunities,

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.770
from what you're describing,
of fields you might enter.

00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:58.893
What pointed you in that direction?

00:08:00.242 --> 00:08:04.190
- Well I think, I mean it
wasn't an easy decision.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:09.060
I mean I was, since my,
since I went to school

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.350
at a place where my maternal grandfather

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.200
was a Sanskrit teacher, was teaching,

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:18.790
I was really very involved
in classical education

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.841
right from the beginning.

00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:22.923
I started doing Sanskrit
when I was three, really.

00:08:25.154 --> 00:08:27.786
So I had a lot of interest in classics,

00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:29.763
but I also liked maths a lot.

00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:33.718
And initially, in that battle,

00:08:33.718 --> 00:08:36.140
thought that I might end up being

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.780
a mathematician and a physicist.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.640
Which is how I began the end of my

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.193
school years and early college,

00:08:43.076 --> 00:08:44.880
but then switched it to economics.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.393
And actually political philosophy too,

00:08:48.742 --> 00:08:50.660
but that came somewhat more slowly later.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.661
I think I was involved
in student politics,

00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:54.903
which played a part in that.

00:08:56.021 --> 00:08:58.177
I was concerned with kind
of academic propensity

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.765
to generalize about ideas
and not particularize

00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:05.993
about the action that I was involved in.

00:09:07.654 --> 00:09:09.349
I think that naturally leads,

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:12.100
in a sense, to political philosophy.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.673
That happened rather slowly,

00:09:15.698 --> 00:09:18.090
and I think the development of
political philosophy interest

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.910
was not in the first days of college

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.120
which I had in Calcutta
in Presidency College,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.609
where I was doing mainly
economics, economics and maths.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:30.303
Having moved from maths and physics

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:31.740
I was doing maths and economics.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.960
But then later on, when I went
to Trinity College Cambridge

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.432
and continued to do economics,

00:09:37.432 --> 00:09:40.260
economics didn't seem very exacting

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.710
in Cambridge at that time,

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.270
and I had a fair amount of spare time

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.080
and I got involved with
doing philosophy generally.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.080
Initially also philosophy
of science and epistemology.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.170
But ultimately got very settled

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.540
on political and moral philosophy.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.110
- How do you compare doing
theorizing in economics

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.720
versus doing it in political philosophy?

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.870
At one time, that universe was combined

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.870
in the world of ideas, at
least in the United States.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.240
In the West there is a
more marked division,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.640
although some people cross over.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.070
Are there differences in the way

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.911
you think as you do these two disciplines?

00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:28.575
- I think probably there is.

00:10:28.575 --> 00:10:29.880
I would say a couple of things.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.847
First of all, there is a much greater,

00:10:32.847 --> 00:10:36.580
depending on whether you're
friendly or unfriendly,

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.360
you would describe it as a commitment to

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.400
or an obsession with, depending
on where you like it or not,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.243
with quantification and with making

00:10:46.243 --> 00:10:49.373
a very precise statement in economics

00:10:49.373 --> 00:10:51.780
than you have in political philosophy.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.280
I think most political
philosophers would tend

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.620
to say that the great ideas in the world

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.980
are not ones where precision
is the most important thing.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.579
I think liberty, equality, and fraternity

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:06.370
are not bursting with precision,

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.140
but they're certainly
bursting with relevance

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.080
in the way they impact our lives.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.050
So I think there is a
certain amount of division

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.053
about what makes something rigorous.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.520
I think political philosophers would tend

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.060
to think that their type of rigor

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.550
is very different in the subject.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.010
It's a point that
Aristotle makes very early,

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.680
that every subject has its
own level of precision.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.140
And I think there there is a difference

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.310
between the standard way
the economists tend to think

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.680
and the standard way the
philosophers tend to think.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.280
I think the other thing is that

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.630
possibly it's right to say

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.802
that economists have been rather

00:11:43.802 --> 00:11:47.267
dominated by schools of thought,

00:11:47.267 --> 00:11:49.840
so that if there is a line of reasoning

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.410
that becomes well-established,

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.410
whether it be general equilibrium
theory as it's called,

00:11:57.345 --> 00:11:59.370
a kind of market-based thing,

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.070
thinking of everything in
terms of analogy with market,

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.240
or anything else,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.074
and you know, people
quite often are making

00:12:06.074 --> 00:12:09.046
the assumption that
people are self-interested

00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:11.960
and trying to fit everything
in the world into it,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.700
I think there's a presumptive difference

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.486
in the sense that economists often incline

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:20.430
to assume that, if there is a departure,

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.130
their first thought is

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.200
can I somehow accommodate it

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.780
by making the model a
bit more complicated?

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.620
And I think often political philosophers

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.970
won't go in that direction.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.690
There I'm not sure that I entirely

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.610
agree with the mainstream
economics approach,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.550
because I think trying to fit things in

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.490
and taking, as it were,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.250
your established understanding
as the default program

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.960
to which you return if you cannot resolve,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.470
not always the best way of understanding

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.680
not only political problems
but even economic ones.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.800
Now since I have sort of run around

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.990
between these disciplines
a certain amount,

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.813
I think I owe a considerable gratitude

00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:11.470
to the concern that economics has

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.550
with analytical and rigorous reasoning.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.037
And yet, I think there is something

00:13:16.037 --> 00:13:19.730
that political philosophers teach us

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.150
which may be of relevance
to economics too.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.450
Mainly not to be too hung
up on precise statement.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.424
After all, there's a whole maths

00:13:27.424 --> 00:13:30.735
of incomplete orderings, partial orders,

00:13:30.735 --> 00:13:35.735
precisely defined
ambiguities of measurement,

00:13:36.075 --> 00:13:38.730
in which I think economics perhaps

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.600
ought to take more interest.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.810
Political philosophers, of course,

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.940
typically don't go in the
direction of mathematizing it,

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.180
but insofar as the economists

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.180
are concerned with mathematizing it,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.410
there's a whole area of mathematics

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.063
which can find bigger use in economics

00:13:53.063 --> 00:13:56.567
than in fact it tends to get.

00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:58.839
So I think in many ways

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:02.769
my own work and focus has ended up

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:06.750
being a little off center from economics.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.600
And yet I think it's, I hope it's

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.983
strongly influenced by the
economic modes of thinking

00:14:14.983 --> 00:14:18.420
as well as insight that has
come from political philosophy.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.570
I hope so anyway.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.590
- For a layman, myself,
a reader of your work,

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.550
there seems to be a very nice synergy,

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.206
in the sense that one has the sense that,

00:14:28.206 --> 00:14:33.206
in what I've read, that you've
used political philosophy

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.850
to broaden the perspective of economics

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.760
when dealing with a particular problem.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.110
That's a gross simplification,

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.170
but one definitely sees the energy

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.100
that comes from the interaction

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.633
between the two in your work.

00:14:51.052 --> 00:14:52.350
- I don't now if it's
a gross simplification,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.815
but it may be a little simplified.

00:14:54.815 --> 00:14:59.100
But you know, as you
mentioned a few minutes ago,

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.050
that, at one stage, economics

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.530
and political philosophy was once closer.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.414
After all, the founder,

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:08.780
or the person who had the greatest claim

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.280
to be regarded as the
founder of modern economics,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.943
Adam Smith, was professor
of moral philosophy

00:15:14.943 --> 00:15:19.943
rather than professor of economics.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.700
And I think that connection
is still quite strong.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.451
So I don't, I have not
had a sense of really

00:15:27.451 --> 00:15:32.096
going outside the boundaries
of my subject, as it were.

00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:36.329
I mean, I'm very keen on
interdisciplinary research,

00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:40.140
but what is sometimes
described as interdisciplinary

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.060
is in fact just a broader
view of the discipline

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:48.060
rather than seriously getting
out of your, you know, field.

00:15:48.499 --> 00:15:51.710
I mean, when you're doing, I don't know,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.370
using evolutionary biology in order

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.964
to understand economic problems,

00:15:56.964 --> 00:15:58.659
I think that is clearly interdisciplinary.

00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:00.419
But when you're bringing in

00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:02.970
a broader conception of human being

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.590
who is concerned not only
with his or her own life

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.770
but also with the lives of others,

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.941
commitment to them, concern
about them, and so on,

00:16:11.941 --> 00:16:15.730
that doesn't strike me as quintessentially

00:16:17.072 --> 00:16:20.223
outside of economics, that's
what economics is also about,

00:16:21.332 --> 00:16:24.896
even if some models of economics
may not recognize that.

00:16:24.896 --> 00:16:27.430
And classically, if you
think about the subjects,

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:32.036
the traditions, Adam Smith,
John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx,

00:16:32.036 --> 00:16:35.520
Francis Edgeworth, I
think they have all had

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.760
very considerable interest in these

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.410
broader ways of characterizing

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.520
human behavior, human
understanding, and human commitment.

00:16:45.524 --> 00:16:47.224
- You speak often in your writings

00:16:48.229 --> 00:16:50.040
about broadening the base of information,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.090
which has been very important

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:57.090
in your discussion of, for
example, choice and freedom,

00:17:00.225 --> 00:17:03.420
development and freedom, that we have to

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.430
broaden how we see the
phenomena under question

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.860
to get new sources of information

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.371
to then explain and understand behavior.

00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:14.480
- I think there are two issues here.

00:17:15.446 --> 00:17:17.930
One is sometimes the information on which

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.360
the existing tradition
has tended to concentrate

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.300
and has got used to concentrating

00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:26.910
may leave out something quite important

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.160
which are relevant and which

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.800
a different line of
inquiry might bring out.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.330
For example, when I was working
on, say, famines and so on,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.180
it became quite clear
that a food-centered view

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.620
did not give anything like

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.350
an adequate understanding of famines.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.940
You really have to see it
as a much broader problem

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.697
with strong economic dimensions.

00:17:48.697 --> 00:17:52.060
The markets of all kinds of
commodities are important,

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.710
not just food, because after all,

00:17:54.651 --> 00:17:56.136
you have to earn your income

00:17:56.136 --> 00:17:57.240
by selling whatever it
is that you have to sell,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.353
maybe just labor.

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:00.815
But whatever it is you have to sell,

00:18:00.815 --> 00:18:02.376
you're interested in the labor market,

00:18:02.376 --> 00:18:04.370
you're interested in
those artisan products

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.370
which you sell on the basis
of which you will buy food.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.316
So there's that kind of issue

00:18:09.316 --> 00:18:11.640
as well as a political dimension.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.430
Namely, some famines are
very easy to prevent.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.380
A democratic society makes it obligatory

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.359
for a government to go in that direction,

00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:25.260
because, you know, elections
are not easy to win

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.220
after a famine and it's
not easy to withstand

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.257
criticism of opposition
parties, newspapers, and so on

00:18:32.257 --> 00:18:34.520
if you have a democratic system.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.500
So it turns out, not a surprise,

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.617
that there has never been a
famine in a democratic society.

00:18:40.617 --> 00:18:42.800
But this is not a statement about food,

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.133
it's a statement about the connection

00:18:45.133 --> 00:18:46.460
between a democracy and famine.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.150
So in all kinds of ways,
there are these information

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.380
which are relevant for studying a problem

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.370
which might have been left out

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:55.990
for those who took a rather

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.830
narrow understanding of,
in this case, famine,

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.140
just concentrating on food supply

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.340
and food availability
and food distribution.

00:19:04.886 --> 00:19:07.542
The other thing is that
sometimes there are

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:12.542
real barriers to broadening
our understanding

00:19:13.197 --> 00:19:15.260
because of high theory.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.117
And this applies very
much to philosophy too.

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:22.577
A very good example would
be, say, utilitarianism,

00:19:22.577 --> 00:19:24.704
which has been perhaps the most

00:19:24.704 --> 00:19:28.222
dominant mode of thinking
for the contemporary world,

00:19:28.222 --> 00:19:30.990
beginning with Jeremy Bentham.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.250
You can trace roots earlier,

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.619
but Jeremy Bentham is probably

00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:36.660
the big point of departure there.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.340
But you see, there you
not only take into account

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.440
people's happiness and pleasure and pain

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.020
and desires and desire satisfaction,

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.100
but you tend to judge the importance

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.010
of absolutely everything in terms of

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.510
the intensity of desire,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.770
the intensity of pleasure or happiness.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.730
And that actually leaves
out a whole lot of things.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.040
For example, if you're living in societies

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.430
where people are systematically deprived

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.570
and have relatively
little hope of redemption,

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.100
you know, kind of hopelessly precarious

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.190
landless laborers
looking for a little job,

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.140
overworked domestics servants,

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.140
women in a sexist society in which

00:20:19.374 --> 00:20:21.890
women have very little freedom.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.645
I think one of the things
that I did find observing

00:20:25.645 --> 00:20:30.645
is that the underdogs come to
terms with their deprivation.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.280
So if you're looking at
what their desires are,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.300
by the time they've cut
their desire to shape,

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.880
it doesn't look as if their
desires are being unfulfilled,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.700
it's just that their
desires have got adapted.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.300
And similarly, people learn to take

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.420
pleasure in small mercies.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.010
It's always nice to see, you know,

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.380
how in a terrible state of deprivation,

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.230
even in famine, people take tremendous joy

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.510
when they get a little relief,

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.308
a little food, a little security.

00:21:01.308 --> 00:21:06.100
And in order to judge
how deprived they are,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.322
if you went by the utilitarian calculus

00:21:09.322 --> 00:21:12.760
of happiness and whether your desires,

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.820
whatever they are, happen to be fulfilled,

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.990
you would not recognize how deprived

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.690
the lives of these people are.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.220
You need something a bit
more objective than that,

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.280
a bit more concerned with the actual

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.020
way their lives are going,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.850
what freedoms they actually have.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.155
And the fact that it's the lack of freedom

00:21:31.155 --> 00:21:34.969
that might make them cut
their desires to shape

00:21:34.969 --> 00:21:39.969
and train them to take
joy in little relief

00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:45.140
in an otherwise terrible situation

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.770
has to be brought in.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.370
But I think there you have to broaden

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.810
the information on this altogether.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.625
The utilitarian base is utterly hopeless

00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:55.440
in trying to get enough of an insight

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.940
about the nature of
deprivation in the world.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:02.784
- You've spoken of poverty
as deprivation of capability,

00:22:02.784 --> 00:22:06.730
as it would apply to the exact
situation you're describing.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.563
- That's right.

00:22:07.563 --> 00:22:11.750
Yeah, I think capability is
kind of a class of freedom,

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.425
namely what you can actually,
what you're able to do.

00:22:15.425 --> 00:22:18.758
Are you free to lead a hunger-free life?

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.640
It differs from actually
leading a hunger-free life,

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.317
because sometimes, of course,

00:22:25.317 --> 00:22:28.545
you may actually court hunger,

00:22:28.545 --> 00:22:30.160
if, for example, you're fasting

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.740
for religious reasons or
for political reasons.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.090
Mahatma Gandhi fasting,

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.870
you wouldn't describe the political fast

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.370
of Mahatma Gandhi against the British Raj

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.690
as indication that his life is deprived.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.680
No, that's a part of his action.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.550
So it's not so much whether
you're actually hungry,

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.629
but whether your freedom to
avoid hunger if you chose to.

00:22:50.629 --> 00:22:54.210
Most cases you will choose
to, but there are exceptions.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.270
So similarly, whether you have freedom

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:01.270
to lead a life with reasonable
clothing, reasonable shelter,

00:23:05.524 --> 00:23:08.660
whether you have the freedom to get

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.649
medical attention when you're ill,

00:23:11.649 --> 00:23:14.894
whether you have the basis of avoiding

00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:19.894
premature mortality or
escapable morbidity,

00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:22.590
all these come into it.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.270
Or, for that matter, whether you have

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.390
the freedom to take part in
the life of the community,

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.640
kind of social capabilities.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.210
So all these are actions

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.920
or functionings, as we
sometimes call them,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.920
which are important for human life

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.030
and which we have reason to value,

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.250
the relative values of which
are for us to determine,

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.570
but if we don't have the
freedom to pursue them,

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.260
our lives are deprived in some way.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.488
Now, poverty defined as lowness of income

00:23:51.488 --> 00:23:54.450
is a very narrow perspective on that.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.990
Certainly lowness of income tends to,

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.463
given other things, make us more prone

00:23:59.463 --> 00:24:02.150
to deprivation of capabilities,

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.500
but we're not lamenting the
lack of income for its own sake.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.340
We're really concerned with
what income allows us to do.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.023
But income is not the only
factor which affects it.

00:24:14.023 --> 00:24:15.890
There are so many other
things to be looked at.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:20.630
If you're living in an
epidemiologically nasty region

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.520
with lots of epidemics of malaria,

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.210
cholera, whatever it is,

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.710
even with the same level of income,

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.270
your life might be more deprived,

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.403
you may be less free to avoid
these illnesses and so on.

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:33.980
So I think you have to
take a broader focus

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.780
and look at those things which are

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.240
really valuable for human beings,

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.230
namely the kind of life they can lead

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.540
and the freedom to lead that kind of life,

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.313
rather than something
mechanical like, say, income.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.440
- Is it fair to suggest, then,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.027
that one of the failures,
sometimes, of theory

00:24:55.027 --> 00:24:58.823
is to simplify and to categorize

00:24:58.823 --> 00:25:03.823
in such as way as to narrow the focus,

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:07.990
which then denies one
a richer understanding

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.123
of the phenomena in question?

00:25:10.123 --> 00:25:13.700
- Something like that, but
I won't say exactly that,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.620
because ultimately I
think we have to simplify

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.601
in order to have a comprehension.

00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:23.130
I think, as T.S. Eliot said,

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.768
"Mankind cannot bear too much reality."

00:25:25.768 --> 00:25:27.850
I think he's probably right.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:30.749
But I think it really,

00:25:30.749 --> 00:25:34.039
it's really a choice of simplifications.

00:25:34.039 --> 00:25:37.452
Because it's the kind of simplification

00:25:37.452 --> 00:25:41.030
which doesn't give us much understanding

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.860
compared with the kind of simplification

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.077
which will give us a lot of understanding.

00:25:45.077 --> 00:25:47.240
That's what we are looking at, really.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.190
So quite often it ended up,

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.950
and if you look at the
process of critique,

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:56.130
you get a model which
is, by necessity perhaps,

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.440
a simplified representation of the world.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.620
You criticize it by saying
you're neglecting this,

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.510
this is very important,
you're leaving that out.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.820
And then it looks as if you're

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.660
criticizing the simplification,

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.280
which, in a sense, you
are, at that moment.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.213
But then, when you have really
broadened your understanding,

00:26:12.213 --> 00:26:16.130
then you have a different type of theory.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.080
And then, of course, in that theory,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.880
you're trying to simplify again,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.919
so that the bigger
understanding is comprehensible.

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:25.980
And in doing that you're looking for

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.660
a different type of simplification.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.220
So ultimately, what begins with
a critique of simplification

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.910
replaces one type of
simplification by another.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.260
I think that's my little understanding,

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.774
maybe very imperfect, of
the process of critique

00:26:39.774 --> 00:26:44.774
and the emergence of an alternative

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.710
way of understanding the phenomenon.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:51.190
So ultimately, simplification
isn't an enemy,

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.220
but we have to really be concerned

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.030
whether the simplification
is of the right kind,

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.245
you know, that would allow us to rest

00:27:00.245 --> 00:27:05.245
rather than remain dissatisfied
and keep hitting at it.

00:27:06.372 --> 00:27:11.372
- In the battle for redefinition,
for resimplification,

00:27:12.378 --> 00:27:17.223
what are the wellsprings of creativity?

00:27:20.385 --> 00:27:22.535
What are the roots,
and there must be many,

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.120
of the search for rethinking a problem?

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.520
You mentioned that you
were a political activist.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.513
I assume that protest sometimes is,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.170
in the general environment,

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.590
not necessarily on the
part of the theorist,

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.436
is something that changes our thinking

00:27:43.436 --> 00:27:47.080
in this evolution of ideas.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.339
For example, the case of the
women's movement in the '60s,

00:27:51.339 --> 00:27:55.299
called our attention to many of,

00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:59.637
many phenomena that had been ignored.

00:27:59.637 --> 00:28:02.796
- I think that's absolutely right.

00:28:02.796 --> 00:28:07.759
I think protest is very important.

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:10.870
I'm a great believer in the power

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.660
and reach of public reasoning,

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.395
and protest is one way of
engaging in public reasoning.

00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:20.260
It's not the only way.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.040
You could also have a debate,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.990
which is not a protest but an argument.

00:28:26.532 --> 00:28:28.420
So one would not like to confine oneself

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.450
to the sphere of protesting only.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.170
On the other hand, protestation could be

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.040
both important in terms of what it's

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.860
immediately trying to achieve,

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.700
as well as the kind of
broadening of vision

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.680
that it may bring about.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.820
Now just to take two examples,

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.020
you mentioned the feminist movement.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.425
And certainly the feminist movement

00:28:50.425 --> 00:28:53.730
has been one of the more creative things

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.580
happening across the world,

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.898
and quite a lot of it in this country.

00:28:57.898 --> 00:29:00.883
The, I think what it was doing

00:29:00.883 --> 00:29:05.883
was to question quite a lot
of the standard presumptions

00:29:07.318 --> 00:29:10.232
about the nature of society that existed,

00:29:10.232 --> 00:29:12.420
beginning with the family.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.400
And family is an arrangement

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:21.400
where the divisions of the
fruits of living together

00:29:21.573 --> 00:29:26.507
are determined by certain
established customs.

00:29:26.507 --> 00:29:30.550
And, you know, that the
woman tends to cook,

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.780
can take a job if she can combine it

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.670
with the household work
as well, and so on,

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.070
which is the standard thing.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.843
And this has become so,
had become so standard

00:29:41.843 --> 00:29:44.550
and had gone on for such a long time

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.000
that people may not recognize

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.050
that there was anything special about it.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.262
So I think you need some kind of a,

00:29:51.262 --> 00:29:55.613
a kind of intervention of a sort,

00:29:55.613 --> 00:30:00.613
which is not just a kind of
confirmation of what's going on,

00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:06.849
which says why should it be
the case that this is so?

00:30:08.184 --> 00:30:11.060
Similarly, whether the feminist cause

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.770
is just one where the women could pursue,

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.020
or the feminist cause us something

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.980
which is a broader perspective

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.960
which takes on an approach
to underdogs in general.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.080
I was one of the founding members

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.560
of the association of feminist economists,

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.151
although I'm indubitably a man.

00:30:31.151 --> 00:30:34.270
But I didn't see any
contradiction in that,

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.735
because it seemed to be a cause
that's of great importance.

00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:39.600
To take another example,

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.870
I was in some ways lucky in being

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:44.510
in this campus where I'm now sitting down

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.620
with you today, namely at Berkeley,

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.090
in '64-'65, which was a year of,

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.140
you might recollect, free speech movement

00:30:53.131 --> 00:30:54.626
and lots of things happened.

00:30:54.626 --> 00:30:57.360
And I found it both a very
exciting thing to watch,

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.980
I was a very young faculty
member at that time,

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.892
but I was also, I think, learned a lot,

00:31:03.892 --> 00:31:06.690
both from the way the organization

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.120
of the student movement went,

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.000
which was very different from
anything I was involved in

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.810
in, say, Calcutta, where my own

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.760
political teeth had been
cut in Presidency College

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.440
where I did take part in
student political activities.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.561
But also, there was, I think, a kind of

00:31:23.561 --> 00:31:27.010
transformation of
understanding in this form.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.850
I mean, for example, before
I came to Berkeley in '64,

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.373
I would have thought that there were these

00:31:32.373 --> 00:31:34.960
different trends,
different things going on.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.110
There was the movement
about racial justice,

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.420
African-Americans, and that issue.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.580
Hispanics too, but
African-Americans mostly.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.090
Then there was also the issue
of the rich and the poor.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:52.700
And then there was an issue
of the organizationally,

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.407
you know, the corporate
society versus the individual.

00:31:56.407 --> 00:31:58.840
- The bureaucratization of the university.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.038
- The bureaucratization of the world.

00:32:01.038 --> 00:32:02.048
- Right.

00:32:02.048 --> 00:32:03.390
- And I thought of them
as separate things.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.041
And one of the more remarkable things

00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:07.540
about the free speech movement,

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.824
and I think to a great extent

00:32:08.824 --> 00:32:10.970
it's the vision of the student leadership,

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:14.340
is to be able to draw on
all these simultaneously,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.530
which did not seem to
me to be very possible.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.200
I mean certainly standard
left-wing politics

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.026
of the kind that Europe and Asia knows

00:32:24.026 --> 00:32:28.760
seemed unlikely to get very
far in the United States,

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.030
given the political
territory in this country,

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:36.942
and the morbid fear of
communism and so on,

00:32:36.942 --> 00:32:40.250
which dominated American
thinking at that time.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.980
And that seemed to restrain things.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.088
Now of course, at that time,

00:32:44.088 --> 00:32:45.820
the fact that the Soviet Union itself

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.687
was going through great turmoil

00:32:47.687 --> 00:32:51.620
really helped to broaden the perspective,

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.770
to say that, really, that's
not what the debate is about,

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.927
the debate is about
equity, about attention,

00:32:57.927 --> 00:33:01.140
about the importance of
the persons in society

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.020
and not just of corporations
and institutions.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.193
And in some ways the mixing of these,

00:33:08.193 --> 00:33:10.220
well mixing is probably
not the right word,

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.510
the integration of these concerns

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:16.630
came to me as quite an
insight, a social insight,

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.590
which I think directly emanated

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.110
not from my reading of books

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.640
but from my observing of what was going on

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.250
in these rather unruly days in the campus.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.690
It was certainly unruly,
there's no question.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:31.220
A lot of classes were lost,

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.570
and for a teacher that's
always somewhat sad.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.774
But what I was learning, of course,

00:33:36.774 --> 00:33:38.410
was dramatically important.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.900
So I think you're absolutely right,

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.720
that protests could be a
way of opening up the mind

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.240
and which could really broaden

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.333
one's understanding in a very big way.

00:33:49.347 --> 00:33:52.086
- Another theme that I find

00:33:52.086 --> 00:33:55.257
in my limited reading of your work

00:33:55.257 --> 00:34:00.257
is the openness to diversity
and alternative experiences

00:34:02.823 --> 00:34:07.165
as another source, a wellspring

00:34:07.165 --> 00:34:12.165
of new ways of examining theories

00:34:12.567 --> 00:34:17.567
and launching them on this path of

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.490
resimplification, rethought, and so on.

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.738
Talk a little about that, 'cause I know,

00:34:22.738 --> 00:34:25.070
in a number of pieces that you wrote

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.130
in the New York Review book which read,

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.650
that this theme comes up.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:32.840
Oh no, there was democracy in India,

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.020
or, you know, in China,
in very early periods.

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.085
So this, in a way, goes along with

00:34:39.085 --> 00:34:42.670
a commitment to an existing theory

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.980
that's inadequate, basically,

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.264
because of its point of reference.

00:34:47.264 --> 00:34:52.040
- It's very kind of you
to say what you're saying.

00:34:54.497 --> 00:34:55.800
It's certainly been my
ambition to bring in

00:34:57.765 --> 00:35:00.433
a broader perspective in many cases.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.280
I think what happens
is that we tend to get

00:35:08.047 --> 00:35:11.463
structured into thinking in certain ways.

00:35:11.463 --> 00:35:14.930
And when they work very
well, to some extent,

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.930
it's like what you see in

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:19.040
the Agatha Christie detective stories.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.760
If you find that a style of
doing crime works very well,

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.870
then you go on repeating it.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:28.330
That's how you're easy to identify.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.370
But that applies not only to crime

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.660
but also to creative work that,

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.010
once it works well, then
we like repeating it.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.580
The person who was very good, for me,

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.180
was a shaft of light, true
shaft of light, is Adam Smith.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:46.280
And this is, in a different
context, in a moral context,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.753
but the same thing applies
to the pursuit of knowledge.

00:35:49.753 --> 00:35:53.409
You know he had this notion
of the impartial spectator.

00:35:53.409 --> 00:35:57.183
And he talks about why the
understanding of justice

00:35:57.183 --> 00:36:01.084
requires you to bring
people from distant visions,

00:36:01.084 --> 00:36:04.210
you have to imagine
what it would look like

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.087
to people who are far away.

00:36:06.087 --> 00:36:08.100
And he gives us an example

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.580
that even the very
clever, very humane people

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.570
had tended to accept certain things

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:16.142
which would be hard for them to accept,

00:36:16.142 --> 00:36:18.940
excepting that it had become

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.640
so standard in the society
in which they lived

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.830
that they don't question it.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:26.110
One of his example is Aristotle and Plato,

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:30.572
along with all other ancient
Greeks and Athenians,

00:36:30.572 --> 00:36:33.136
actually thought there was nothing

00:36:33.136 --> 00:36:35.090
particularly wrong with infanticide.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:38.750
Now, that may seem abnormal to us.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.870
On the other hand, they lived in a society

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.554
in which that was standard practice.

00:36:43.554 --> 00:36:47.590
And given that, given the fact that you

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.590
come to accept standard practice,

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.140
they did not apply their critical mind,

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.660
which they were applying
for almost everything else,

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.850
to this issue.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.650
And the way to ask it, Adam Smith taught,

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.920
would have been for them to ask

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.360
does every society have it,

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.170
and if other societies
exist that don't, why not?

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.320
And in some ways, as you put it,

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.850
you need a vision from a
distance to look at that.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.000
This is something that's
becoming important

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.488
right now in the United States,

00:37:15.488 --> 00:37:17.940
given the divided judgment
in the Supreme Court

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.730
about juvenile capital punishment.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.630
One of the points of disagreement

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.700
seems to have been, I mean I think

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.500
the primary debate, of course,

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.500
is about whether executing people

00:37:33.137 --> 00:37:35.715
for having committed a murder

00:37:35.715 --> 00:37:38.898
when they were a juvenile would

00:37:38.898 --> 00:37:42.670
be cruel and unusual punishment.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.290
Now I think the division isn't between

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.740
the two sides that they think

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.529
that you have to bring
in foreign perspectives.

00:37:48.529 --> 00:37:51.077
I think the claim of the majority is that,

00:37:51.077 --> 00:37:55.030
in fact, even in a domestic
perspective it appears wrong.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.090
But in trying to understand

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.179
how the domestic examination would go,

00:38:00.179 --> 00:38:02.980
there is considerable interest

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.600
on part of the five who voted on one side,

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.061
of whom actually I know only one

00:38:09.061 --> 00:38:11.690
reasonably well, that's Justice Breyer.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.610
There is a great deal of interest

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:17.780
in the way the world thinks about it.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.080
It's not so much, as I
think Justice Scalia said,

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.690
in trying to do what others want us to do.

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:29.204
It's trying to, as it were,
broaden your own understanding

00:38:29.204 --> 00:38:32.890
by seeing what things look like

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.270
from the perspective of others.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.200
And then come back to ask the question,

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.750
what we as Americans ought to do now.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.750
I think Smith was saying
something like that.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:43.260
He was criticizing Plato and Aristotle

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.304
for not doing for here, but
doing it for other subjects.

00:38:47.304 --> 00:38:49.200
So I think, to some extent,

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.530
the same thing applies in academia too,

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.210
that you get used to a, you know,

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.055
a certain economic model is successful,

00:38:56.055 --> 00:38:58.833
we can explain market behavior

00:38:58.833 --> 00:39:00.840
and a lot of other things that way,

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.380
and then we stick to it,

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.110
and then the question might be

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.226
do we have to do it like that?

00:39:06.226 --> 00:39:09.537
Now if, in this case
it's not another country,

00:39:09.537 --> 00:39:13.299
but if in another discipline,
they don't think that way,

00:39:13.299 --> 00:39:16.280
then you may say, well, might there

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.330
be something to learn from that?

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.920
So it's that view from distance that is,

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.240
you know, you have to place yourself

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.030
at a certain distance to do it,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.562
is I think the phrase that Smith uses.

00:39:29.562 --> 00:39:31.630
I think that's quite important,

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.040
not just for morality and politics,

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.995
but also for epistemology and science.

00:39:36.995 --> 00:39:41.250
And I think, to some extent,

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:46.250
that has been, you know, I
felt at least enthused by,

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.900
whether or not I've been
successful in doing it.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.340
You referred particularly
to the issue of democracy.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.800
I think it's quite standard
now in political philosophy

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.270
to understand democracy to be

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.130
not just voting, but public reasoning.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.410
Government by discussion, I
think John Stuart Mill said.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.320
That is very standard.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.820
Now, then if you're looking
at the history of democracy,

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:08.900
you look not only at the
history of balloting,

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.990
you also look at the history
of public discussion.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.630
And that you find all over the place,

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.760
from India, Japan, you know.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:19.240
I quote Mandela from his native
village in Africa and so on.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.950
So you have to look at the history

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.410
in a different light to understand

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.890
democracy and asking such questions

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.750
as to whether democracy can be,

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.760
quote unquote, imposed on other societies,

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.793
as if these societies never had

00:40:33.793 --> 00:40:35.570
a tradition of public discussion,

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.402
which is just not true,

00:40:37.402 --> 00:40:38.273
it's not true of the Middle East.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.640
After all, there were very considerable

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.020
public discussion on these matters

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.893
in Iraq, in Egypt, in Turkey,

00:40:49.893 --> 00:40:54.893
in Ninth Century Muslim
Cordoba in Spain, or in India.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.540
When Akbar, the Mughal emperor,

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.327
was lecturing on need for tolerance

00:41:02.327 --> 00:41:05.600
and for dialogue between
different religious,

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.950
members of different religions,

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.820
he was giving these
lectures at the same time

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.820
when Giordano Bruno was being
hanged in Rome for heresy.

00:41:15.796 --> 00:41:19.878
And so, if one were to
look at it at that moment,

00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:22.665
there's much more tolerance in Agra

00:41:22.665 --> 00:41:25.180
than there is in Rome at that moment.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.190
And it's not the picture

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.400
that the West has a kind of,

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.240
the monopoly of having taught

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.290
in a tolerant liberal
way and the East has not.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:38.313
So I think that requires a
really big deliberation, I think.

00:41:38.313 --> 00:41:41.450
- You're touching on a
very interesting subject,

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.632
which is the relation of
theory an truth to power,

00:41:45.632 --> 00:41:49.359
because it would seem that power,

00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:53.193
as it moved toward illegitimacy,

00:41:54.216 --> 00:41:57.323
narrows the base of information.

00:41:58.991 --> 00:42:03.810
Just as a response,
after reading your work,

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.064
that you touched on this notion of,

00:42:07.064 --> 00:42:09.243
we've touched on freedom

00:42:09.243 --> 00:42:11.801
and the notion of democracy,

00:42:11.801 --> 00:42:16.801
which are now reputed to be major goals,

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:19.340
for example, of U.S. foreign policy,

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.025
but in fact the definition

00:42:21.025 --> 00:42:26.025
of freedom and democracy
are very narrow ones

00:42:26.301 --> 00:42:29.780
that limit the information about

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:34.780
different ways of thinking
about the concept.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.702
So does this tell us anything about

00:42:37.702 --> 00:42:42.463
the relation of theory and truth to power?

00:42:42.463 --> 00:42:45.992
What can lead power to incorporate

00:42:45.992 --> 00:42:50.180
new visions and not to limit information?

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.833
That must happen sometimes.

00:42:53.225 --> 00:42:56.960
- I think the connection
between power and understanding

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.150
is quite important, I agree.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.575
I think it is also a danger

00:43:02.575 --> 00:43:07.575
in making into a theory something

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.923
which claims much more than is true.

00:43:15.824 --> 00:43:18.274
So I think one has to
watch the rhetorical power.

00:43:19.169 --> 00:43:20.517
As you know, rhetorical power has been

00:43:20.517 --> 00:43:22.580
widely used in the social sciences

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.980
and sociology in particular.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.900
Now, I think it's certainly true

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.740
that power, and knowledge is power too,

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.410
is extremely important.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.490
And yet, it may generate the sense

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.360
that if you don't have power,

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.190
you cannot have any impact,

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.410
which I think would be quite wrong.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.330
And even what we were
discussion about protest.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.416
Is protesting about the
inequality of power?

00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:50.293
And if you end up making an impact,

00:43:50.293 --> 00:43:51.881
well you are making an impact

00:43:51.881 --> 00:43:55.170
because you went against power.

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:56.550
Now then you might say somebody

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.220
might square the circle by saying,

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.430
of course, you had your power of protest.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.770
But that way, I don't think
we are learning very much,

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.430
we are just putting everything
in the jargon of power.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.890
But if by power we mean established power,

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.067
I think that to see
how important they are,

00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:12.460
and your example about the American

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.050
role in foreign policy would
be a good example of that,

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.220
and at the same time how
it can be also challenged

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.433
to take the view that
since they have power

00:44:20.433 --> 00:44:22.690
there's not a lot we can do.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.393
I think it would be a great mistake.

00:44:24.393 --> 00:44:27.230
And I think, in the context of this

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.652
particular thing are
mentioning about democracy,

00:44:29.652 --> 00:44:34.090
I like the rhetoric of the administration,

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.860
the fact that they're
committed to democracy,

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.860
which wasn't the case earlier on.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.172
After all, this country has quite a lot

00:44:40.172 --> 00:44:42.750
of history of supporting
anti-democratic movements.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.730
Military governments overthrowing

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.430
legitimate democratic governments,

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.320
whether in Africa or Latin America,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.710
have often had support
from the U.S. government.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.721
The fact that democracy is accepted

00:44:52.721 --> 00:44:55.415
as an important, as least through

00:44:55.415 --> 00:44:59.320
part of the rhetoric
of the administration,

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.610
in my judgment, is positive.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.749
But then there's the question

00:45:03.749 --> 00:45:05.260
as to how we should understand democracy.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.030
And I think here there are three things.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.760
One is that to see
democracy just as balloting

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.760
would be a great mistake.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.750
That's not what the subject is about.

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:15.220
I don't think political philosophers

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.760
anymore think that that's
all that is involved.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.113
And if you take, for example, Iraq,

00:45:20.113 --> 00:45:23.150
it's not just a question of
organizing the balloting,

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:25.770
but also how much public
discussion there could be,

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:27.120
whether you can have the balloting

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.250
without banning Al Jazeera
from reporting in Iraq,

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:33.609
and whether the different
political parties

00:45:33.609 --> 00:45:36.858
can express their views without putting it

00:45:36.858 --> 00:45:39.945
in some kind of religious vocabulary,

00:45:39.945 --> 00:45:42.540
of being a Shiite or a Sunni.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.681
Can they raise the kind
of broader question

00:45:44.681 --> 00:45:47.390
that the rest of the
world often brings up?

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.080
So there's that issue.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.777
There's also the issue about

00:45:50.777 --> 00:45:55.777
to what extent the organization
of political discussion

00:45:56.943 --> 00:46:01.943
can be done without the kind
of militaristic atmosphere

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.610
in which Iraq inescapably is now involved,

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.720
given the way the thing went.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.720
I mean, the error about the
weapons of mass destruction,

00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:19.079
we can go on arguing about
how dreadful that error was,

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.431
but the fact of the matter is

00:46:21.431 --> 00:46:22.810
that we are now in a situation

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:24.220
where you can't think of Iraq

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.850
except in a kind of form
where the military presence

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:30.270
and violence all around is very big.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.510
And the third thing is
not to think of the world

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:33.970
only in terms of Iraq.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:36.633
There's a whole lot of things
about democracy in the world

00:46:36.633 --> 00:46:38.330
that one has to think about.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:39.840
And one would need more commitment,

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.380
not just in the Middle
East, like Saudi Arabia,

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.630
but also in Africa, the commitment.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:46.730
After all, during the Cold War years,

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:48.941
both the Soviet Union
and the United States

00:46:48.941 --> 00:46:51.257
supported a lot of military dictatorships,

00:46:51.257 --> 00:46:54.410
and the inheritance of that could

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.363
be seen in Africa even today.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.002
The Soviet Union is gone and Russia

00:47:00.002 --> 00:47:02.650
is a kind of pale successor to that,

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:04.552
but what is the United States going to do

00:47:04.552 --> 00:47:09.445
in order to undo the
mischief of the Cold War

00:47:09.445 --> 00:47:11.840
which visited Africa in a big way?

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.250
I think these are the kind
of issues to be faced.

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.840
Now I think, if we're being dominated

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.310
by one line of thinking
in the administration,

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:21.640
that reflects what you were saying

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.270
about the importance of power.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:27.120
But on the other side, to
say therefore we have had it,

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.180
I think it's a great mistake.

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.850
I think if we have a different
view we ought to express it.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:32.790
If Europeans think differently,

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:34.640
they ought to express
what their views are.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.580
If others, Japanese, Indians,
others think differently,

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.893
we ought to express our view
and have a public discussion.

00:47:39.893 --> 00:47:42.550
After all, public discussion has had

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:46.095
a considerable effect even on U.S. policy,

00:47:46.095 --> 00:47:49.130
in making the administration decide

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:50.470
what is it that they can do

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.390
and what is it that they cannot do,

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:53.760
even though they are immensely

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.280
more powerful than any
other country in the world.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.170
So that there is the danger
in the rhetorical power

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:04.170
of being too fatalistic and too accepting

00:48:04.506 --> 00:48:09.506
of the, you know, going
too gently into the debate.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.050
I think we have to vigorously engage

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:19.296
in these debates whenever we disagree.

00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:23.290
- And you make the point, I
noticed in one piece that I read

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:27.940
comparing China and
India, of the importance

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.630
that a broader definition of democracy,

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.120
a reasoned discussion, can be

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.880
to the process of development, actually.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.708
I recall that you make a point about that.

00:48:42.708 --> 00:48:44.832
- I do discuss that.

00:48:44.832 --> 00:48:46.516
You know, China has been, of course,

00:48:46.516 --> 00:48:48.214
immensely successful as an economy,

00:48:48.214 --> 00:48:49.793
and India is learning a lot from China.

00:48:50.719 --> 00:48:52.330
China has been visionary
in two different ways.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.487
I think, and both of these
happened without democracy.

00:48:55.487 --> 00:48:57.470
In the government.

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:01.675
But the Chinese Revolution brought in

00:49:01.675 --> 00:49:04.820
what was after all a popular movement,

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.340
namely the Communist movement,

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:10.920
and the Chinese, one must give
them credit where it's due,

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.610
went in for expansion of basic
education, basic healthcare

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:20.120
in a way that India didn't do at all.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:24.053
And it's not altogether
independent of democracy.

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.113
It seems peculiar to think

00:49:26.113 --> 00:49:28.890
that the Communist movement
is a product of democracy,

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:31.440
but after all the Communist
movement was a popular movement,

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:36.440
and they were replacing a
less popular government.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.565
But then, that commitment
did produce a lot of results.

00:49:40.565 --> 00:49:44.698
And in some ways the
Chinese were doing well

00:49:44.698 --> 00:49:48.560
on the basis of this, much more
than the Indians were doing,

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.240
despite the fact the
Chinese also had a famine,

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.640
'59-'61, in which 30 million people died,

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.260
which India did not have.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.160
But in terms of, you look
at trend of progress,

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:03.000
education and healthcare led
to all kinds of improvements.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.650
By the time the economic
reforms came in China in '79,

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:09.100
the Chinese had a life
expectancy advantage

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.880
over India of 14 years.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.350
The Chinese life expectancy
was 68, India's was 54.

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:16.200
And they were doing very much better.

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:19.320
Then came the economic reforms,

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:23.020
and it cured one of the
big problems of China,

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.370
namely an utterly
counterproductive economic system.

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.002
And then the Chinese economy started

00:50:29.002 --> 00:50:30.553
growing very well, very fast,

00:50:31.974 --> 00:50:34.400
and faster than almost
anywhere in the world.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.710
But one of the interesting things

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:39.367
is that despite that, in this period,

00:50:39.367 --> 00:50:41.354
even though the Chinese,

00:50:41.354 --> 00:50:45.500
the gap between the Chinese
and Indian income had grown,

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.440
India was growing fast too,
like six, seven percent,

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.947
but the Chinese, nine, 10 percent,

00:50:49.947 --> 00:50:52.473
had actually taken it much further ahead.

00:50:53.576 --> 00:50:55.560
The gap between China and India has grown

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.040
down to per capita income.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.360
But in the space of life
expectancy, it's halved.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:02.690
In fact, life expectancy has grown

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:05.620
three times as fast in India as in China.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:09.254
And also the gap in
infant mortality reduced,

00:51:09.254 --> 00:51:11.460
if you take some parts of India,

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:16.000
which combines democracy with the Chinese

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.940
type of commitment to the poor,

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:22.200
which put China ahead of
India in the first place.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.270
Like Kerala.

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:26.590
You see that Kerala's
achievement of life expectancy

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:29.370
is dramatically higher than that of China.

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:30.470
Similarly infant mortality.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.380
At the time of economic reform,

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.677
Chinese and Kerala both had infant

00:51:36.677 --> 00:51:40.280
mortality rate of 37 per thousand.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.390
Now the Chinese have
come down from 37 to 30,

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:45.630
while Kerala has gone from 37 to 10.

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:47.930
And one has to ask what is it

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:49.913
that the Indians are doing right,

00:51:50.935 --> 00:51:52.762
because it should go around.

00:51:52.762 --> 00:51:53.595
And I have written on that.

00:51:54.562 --> 00:51:56.641
There are dreadful things
happening in India.

00:51:56.641 --> 00:51:58.770
Why is it that still it's going like that.

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:01.366
It would seem to appear that something

00:52:01.366 --> 00:52:02.540
more dreadful is happening in China

00:52:03.404 --> 00:52:04.237
for this gap to be reduced in this way.

00:52:04.237 --> 00:52:06.110
And I think what's happening is I think

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:09.350
China is paying a heavy price
for not having democracy.

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:12.380
Because in order to have
constantly good health care,

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.610
you need public criticism,

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:17.783
such as baby hospital services criticized.

00:52:17.783 --> 00:52:19.460
You can't have a situation

00:52:20.672 --> 00:52:22.520
where a SARS epidemic
could surface in November

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.090
and be kept under a lid following April.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.970
I think you need openness,
which a democracy provides.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:29.790
But the other big thing is that

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.010
when China had economic reform in '79,

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.107
one of the first things they did,

00:52:33.107 --> 00:52:34.940
and being a non-democratic country

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.484
it could do it in a drop of a hat,

00:52:37.484 --> 00:52:42.484
is to abolish public health insurance,

00:52:43.141 --> 00:52:46.880
so that you have to buy your
private health insurance.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.500
China is one of the few
countries in the world today

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.919
where you actually have
to buy your vaccines.

00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:55.320
And it's a situation
where you can't imagine

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.620
a democratic country where
the public health insurance

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:03.210
is accepted and agreed and
going on, it's suddenly dropped.

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:07.433
It can only happen in a country
with one party politics.

00:53:08.962 --> 00:53:10.810
And I think China has
paid a very heavy price.

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:12.770
The Chinese life expectancy growth

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.713
has dramatically slowed down.

00:53:15.713 --> 00:53:17.910
Infant mortality rates have stagnated.

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:19.602
It's to a great extent concern

00:53:19.602 --> 00:53:24.120
with the absence of democracy in China,

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.700
which both allowed public health insurance

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:29.130
to be abolished and eliminated,

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.470
as well as, does not subject

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:35.280
the health service to constant criticism.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.940
We know how dreadful the
Indian health service is,

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.090
but the saving grace is
exactly that we do know it.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:42.550
There's a lot of public discussion,

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:44.310
there is constantly questions,

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:45.930
why shouldn't the government resign,

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:47.630
why shouldn't they do something.

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:49.513
I think that's very important,

00:53:49.513 --> 00:53:53.450
not just in preventing
famines and big disasters,

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.040
on which I had written earlier,

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.118
but also in continuing progress

00:53:57.118 --> 00:54:00.193
of healthcare, longevity,
and quality of life.

00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:04.917
- One final question related to

00:54:04.917 --> 00:54:07.970
looking at your life
in a broad perspective

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:10.480
and the richness and depth

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.340
of the ideas that you've grappled with.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.240
And this is only an hour conversation,

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.540
we can't do justice to
the body of your work

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.250
and the beautiful clarity with which

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:24.318
your writings come to us.

00:54:24.318 --> 00:54:26.953
What advice would you give students

00:54:26.953 --> 00:54:30.270
who are planning for their future

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:33.380
about the kind of preparation

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:38.380
that should go into their education

00:54:38.422 --> 00:54:43.150
if they wanna train for the kind of

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:44.950
theorizing we've been talking about,

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:47.850
which is really both, you know,

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.859
interdisciplinary, but
also questioning categories

00:54:51.859 --> 00:54:55.510
and reshaping them and redefining them.

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:58.560
Any thoughts of advice for students?

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.060
- Well I'm not a great one to give advice

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.070
at a general level, I think.

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:05.710
I get very engaged in advising students.

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:07.230
I'm very proud of the fact that

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.360
I've had some really brilliant students

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:13.750
over the 120 or so people
who have done PhD with me.

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:16.492
And you know, some of them have done

00:55:16.492 --> 00:55:17.570
much more brilliant work than I have.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:20.140
But the, I take it you're really

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.939
thinking about the social
sciences, humanities,

00:55:22.939 --> 00:55:25.516
because the natural
sciences I wouldn't even

00:55:25.516 --> 00:55:28.180
pretend to have any advice to give.

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:33.180
I think this need to
question is a big one.

00:55:35.472 --> 00:55:38.366
I mean that's so trite that
I hesitate to mention it.

00:55:38.366 --> 00:55:41.780
But you see, I think the reason
why it's worth mentioning

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:46.031
is that sometimes the
discipline of the subject

00:55:46.031 --> 00:55:51.031
as well as the academia
tend to discourage that.

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:53.540
It's much easier to publish papers,

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.980
for example, on a well-known subject.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.870
If you look at economics,

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:00.160
you will find that the contributions

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.600
kind of come in clusters.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.675
There was a decade when
everyone seemed to be

00:56:05.675 --> 00:56:07.230
discussing about what the optimal size

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:09.460
and shape of cities would be.

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:10.910
Eventually I don't think it left

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:13.732
much impact on city planning.

00:56:13.732 --> 00:56:15.694
If you talk with a city planner,

00:56:15.694 --> 00:56:16.990
I don't think you typically get the idea

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:18.970
that they got a tremendous
amount from these

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:22.960
modeling of optimal cities
that were done in economics.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.380
But one reason why it happened

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:28.391
is that, you know, while
something is going on

00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:30.648
and one of the famous
names has written on it,

00:56:30.648 --> 00:56:32.360
it's very easy to get a paper published,

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:37.360
criticizing a little,
changing a little, et cetera.

00:56:37.823 --> 00:56:41.167
I think to resist that may be quite useful

00:56:41.167 --> 00:56:44.240
from a long run point of view.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.083
I mean there have been
such great thinkers,

00:56:47.959 --> 00:56:49.896
you know, who have done that.

00:56:49.896 --> 00:56:51.617
I mean, that has been the tradition.

00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:54.117
That applies to all the big
names I was talking about.

00:56:54.117 --> 00:56:55.950
But even among contemporaries,

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:59.470
if I talk, for example, of
my friend George Akerlof,

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:00.970
he's an economist who is here,

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:04.130
I think one of the reasons
why he has been so productive

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.450
is because he's always questioned things.

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:07.700
Right form the beginning.

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:09.860
You know, you say that this is

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.573
the standard way things happen,

00:57:12.799 --> 00:57:14.945
doesn't seem to me so, why not this.

00:57:14.945 --> 00:57:17.762
And then he tried to go
into the second phase

00:57:17.762 --> 00:57:19.085
which we were discussing,

00:57:19.085 --> 00:57:21.258
questioning one kind of simplification

00:57:21.258 --> 00:57:22.490
but then trying to get a structure,

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:24.860
system, and analytical rigor,

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:26.870
which allows you to understand,

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:29.898
communicate, appreciate, fathom

00:57:29.898 --> 00:57:32.766
in a simple way an alternative model.

00:57:32.766 --> 00:57:35.390
So I think that kind of

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:39.941
willingness to question is important.

00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:43.963
It's trite, but given the fact that,

00:57:43.963 --> 00:57:47.220
quite often, academia
will encourage people

00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:52.220
to go in the direction
of the easy success,

00:57:52.706 --> 00:57:55.860
which is quick publication
on some established subject

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:59.100
using established methodology,
just completing the story.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.530
You have done the north,
south, and west corner,

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:05.140
let me do the east, and
that's one more paper.

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.960
And that goes and it
adds to your curriculum

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:11.173
and you might actually
move forward quite rapidly

00:58:11.173 --> 00:58:14.010
early in life, and that's
not to be scoffed at.

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:17.965
But I think the need to be skeptical,

00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:20.446
even of the pressure of the academia

00:58:20.446 --> 00:58:23.000
and of the pressure of
the department heads,

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.370
and I might say, even though I've had

00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:27.730
good students and given them advice,

00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:31.020
to be skeptical sometimes of the advice

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.460
that you get from your advisor like me,

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:36.198
I think, is very important, including

00:58:36.198 --> 00:58:38.348
this very advice that
I'm giving right now.

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:41.410
- Professor Sen, thank you very much

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:45.060
for taking the time to be with us today.

00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:47.518
It's been a real honor to talk a little

00:58:47.518 --> 00:58:51.303
about your intellectual
odyssey, thank you.

00:58:51.303 --> 00:58:53.618
- I really enjoyed it,
thank you very much.

00:58:53.618 --> 00:58:54.870
- Thank you, and thank you very much

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:58.003
for joining us for this
conversation with history.
