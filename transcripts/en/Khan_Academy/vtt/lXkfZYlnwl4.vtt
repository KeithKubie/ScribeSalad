00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.038
- [Instructor] Let's talk a little bit

00:00:02.038 --> 00:00:04.769
about arteries and veins
and the roles they play

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:07.091
in the circulatory system.

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:08.647
So I want you to pause this video

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:09.784
and first think to yourself,

00:00:09.784 --> 00:00:12.977
Do you have a sense of what
arteries and veins are?

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:16.449
Well one idea behind arteries and veins

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.432
are that well, in most of these drawings,

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:21.313
arteries are drawn in red,

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:24.320
and I even made the
artery word here in red.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.433
And veins are drawn in blue.

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:29.522
And so maybe that represents
how much oxygen they have.

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.610
And so one possible explanation is that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.219
arteries carry oxygenated blood,

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.636
oxygenated, oxygenated blood,

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:43.792
while veins carry deoxygenated blood.

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.700
So blood that has less oxygen now.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.286
Now this is actually incorrect.

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:53.508
It is, many times, the case that arteries

00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:55.732
are the ones carrying oxygenated blood

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:58.323
and veins are carrying
the deoxygenated blood.

00:00:58.323 --> 00:01:01.158
But as we will see, this
is not always the case.

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:03.666
And since we're already
talking about oxygenated blood

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.256
and deoxygenated blood and
the colors red and blue,

00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:08.926
it's worth addressing
another misconception.

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:13.651
Many times it is said that
deoxygenated blood looks blue,

00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:15.540
and the reason why people believe that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.144
is if you look at your
wrist and you're able to see

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.719
some of the vessels in there,

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.465
you will see some blue vessels.

00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:23.411
And those, or at least they look blue

00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:25.303
when you're looking from
the outside of your skin.

00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:27.427
And those, indeed, are veins.

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:29.972
And so that's where the
misconception has come from,

00:01:29.972 --> 00:01:32.355
that veins, which, in your arm,

00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:34.096
are carrying deoxygenated blood.

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:36.451
That that deoxygenated blood is blue.

00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:38.102
It turns out that it is not blue.

00:01:38.102 --> 00:01:40.131
It is just a deeper red.

00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:41.863
And the reason why the veins look blue

00:01:41.863 --> 00:01:45.904
is because of the optics of
light going through your skin

00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:48.003
and then seeing the outside of the veins

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:49.619
and then reflecting back.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.716
That is not the color of the actual blood.

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:54.434
So so far I have not given
you a clear definition

00:01:54.434 --> 00:01:56.548
of what arteries versus veins are.

00:01:56.548 --> 00:01:59.603
A better definition, so
let me cross these two out,

00:01:59.603 --> 00:02:03.317
are that arteries carry
blood away from the heart.

00:02:03.317 --> 00:02:04.984
Away from the heart.

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:11.365
And veins carry blood towards the heart.

00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:14.095
Towards the heart.

00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:19.120
And I can get a zoomed in
image of the heart right here

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.603
and that will make it
a little bit clearer.

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:23.912
And you can also see,
or we're about to see,

00:02:23.912 --> 00:02:26.608
why this first definition,
or this first distinction

00:02:26.608 --> 00:02:29.522
between arteries and veins
does not always hold.

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:32.274
So let's just imagine
some blood that is being

00:02:32.274 --> 00:02:34.869
pumped away from the heart.

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.331
So right when it gets
pumped away from the heart,

00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:38.643
it'll be right over here.

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:40.529
It gets pumped through the aorta,

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:41.940
and you can see the aorta branches,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.622
so some blood can go up towards your head,

00:02:45.622 --> 00:02:48.516
and if it didn't, you
would pass out and die.

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:50.489
And then a lot of the blood goes down

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.774
towards the rest of your body.

00:02:52.774 --> 00:02:56.836
And that, indeed, is the
most oxygenated blood.

00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:59.429
And so it'll flow through your body.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:03.224
And these arteries will
keep branching and branching

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.139
into smaller vessels,

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.416
all the way until they form
these very small branches.

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.819
And it's that place, especially,

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.839
where they will lose a lot of their oxygen

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.521
to the fluid and the cells around them.

00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.035
And then the blood is less oxygenated.

00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:20.978
And then even though
deoxygenated blood is not blue,

00:03:20.978 --> 00:03:23.656
it often gets depicted as
blue in a lot of diagrams.

00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:25.908
So I will do the same.

00:03:25.908 --> 00:03:29.991
And these vessels start
building into your veins.

00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:34.755
And these really small
vessels that really bridge

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:36.384
between arteries and veins,

00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:39.124
where a lot of the gas and
nutrient exchange occurs,

00:03:39.124 --> 00:03:41.910
these are called capillaries.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.138
And so after going
through the capillaries,

00:03:45.138 --> 00:03:48.387
the blood will then come back to the heart

00:03:48.387 --> 00:03:51.892
and now it's coming towards
the heart through the veins.

00:03:51.892 --> 00:03:54.740
It comes into the right atrium,
then the right ventricle.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.921
Then that gets pumped towards the lungs.

00:03:57.921 --> 00:04:00.463
And this is the exception
to the first incorrect

00:04:00.463 --> 00:04:03.654
definition of arteries and
veins that we looked at.

00:04:03.654 --> 00:04:06.117
This right over here, is an artery.

00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:08.414
Even though it's carrying less oxygenated

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.158
or deoxygenated blood,

00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:12.193
it's an artery because it's carrying blood

00:04:12.193 --> 00:04:13.746
away from the heart.

00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:16.001
But in this case, it's not carrying it to

00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:17.331
the rest of the body,

00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:19.345
it is carrying it to the lungs.

00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:23.178
That is why it is called
the pulmonary artery,

00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:28.467
even though it's carrying
less oxygenated blood.

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:30.978
So that it goes to the lungs and then,

00:04:30.978 --> 00:04:35.030
in the lungs, there's more
gas exchange that occurs.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.068
The blood gets oxygenated
and then it comes back

00:04:38.068 --> 00:04:39.715
to the heart.

00:04:39.715 --> 00:04:43.395
And so it comes back to
the heart in these vessels

00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:45.294
right over here,

00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:47.522
and that even though these are carrying

00:04:47.522 --> 00:04:49.182
highly oxygenated blood,

00:04:49.182 --> 00:04:51.524
these are considered veins
because they're carrying blood

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:53.253
towards the heart.

00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:55.670
So these are pulmonary veins.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.386
And then the cycle starts again.

00:05:00.386 --> 00:05:02.819
The pulmonary veins bring
the oxygenated blood

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.886
into the left atrium
and the left ventricle,

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:07.779
and then that pumps it
to the rest of the body

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.381
to the aorta, for your
systemic circulation.

00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:12.948
You have your pulmonary circulation,

00:05:12.948 --> 00:05:17.209
which circulates the blood to,
through and from the lungs.

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:18.656
And you have your systemic circulation,

00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:23.104
which takes the blood to and
from the rest of the body.

00:05:23.104 --> 00:05:25.533
So now that we have this main distinction

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.193
between arteries and veins,

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:28.923
what are some other interesting things

00:05:28.923 --> 00:05:30.653
that we know about it?

00:05:30.653 --> 00:05:32.960
Well one thing to keep in mind is that

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.060
since arteries are being
pumped directly by the heart

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.405
towards the rest of the body,
they have high pressure.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:42.014
I'll write that in caps.

00:05:42.014 --> 00:05:43.181
High pressure.

00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:47.325
And so if you were to have
an accident of some type,

00:05:47.325 --> 00:05:48.985
which you do not want to have,

00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:50.936
and you were to
accidentally cut an artery,

00:05:50.936 --> 00:05:52.747
because of that high pressure,

00:05:52.747 --> 00:05:55.742
it would actually spurt blood,

00:05:55.742 --> 00:05:57.705
a lot more than if you were to cut a vein.

00:05:57.705 --> 00:05:59.341
And most of the times where you get a cut,

00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:01.581
you're really just cutting capillaries.

00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:03.533
Like if you were to prick your finger,

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:05.577
it's usually a series of
capillaries that get cut,

00:06:05.577 --> 00:06:08.381
and that's why the blood would
come out very very slowly.

00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:11.853
Now if arteries are high
pressure, veins are low pressure.

00:06:11.853 --> 00:06:13.353
Low, low pressure.

00:06:16.416 --> 00:06:17.915
And one way to think about it is

00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:20.155
the arteries, the blood
is being pumped directly

00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:21.280
by the heart.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.939
But then once it goes
through the capillaries

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:24.508
and comes back through the veins,

00:06:24.508 --> 00:06:28.027
it's kind of sluggishly making
its way back to the heart.

00:06:28.027 --> 00:06:30.188
It's not being directly pumped.

00:06:30.188 --> 00:06:32.891
And that's why in veins,
because you don't have that

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:35.309
high pressure to bring
everything back to the heart,

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:38.443
you have these valves that make
sure that for the most part,

00:06:38.443 --> 00:06:41.644
the blood is going in one direction.

00:06:41.644 --> 00:06:44.284
I'm going to draw the
blood in red in the veins,

00:06:44.284 --> 00:06:46.838
just so we don't keep going
with that misconception,

00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:50.363
that blood in the veins is blue somehow.

00:06:50.363 --> 00:06:52.202
Now related to the fact that
the blood in the arteries

00:06:52.202 --> 00:06:54.535
is under higher pressure,

00:06:54.535 --> 00:06:57.113
in order to transport
a fixed volume of blood

00:06:57.113 --> 00:06:59.211
in a certain amount of
time, you need less volume.

00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.711
And so that's why arteries are low volume.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.428
And on the other hand,
veins are high volume.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.459
And to appreciate the difference,

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:13.419
the blood volume in arteries
are only approximately

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.059
15% of the entire blood
volume in your body,

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:21.226
while the blood volume in
veins are closer to 65%,

00:07:22.782 --> 00:07:25.418
approximately 65%.

00:07:25.418 --> 00:07:27.241
And if you're wondering where
the rest of the blood is,

00:07:27.241 --> 00:07:29.419
about five percent is in capillaries,

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.729
five percent is in your heart,

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:33.928
and about 10% is in your lungs.

00:07:33.928 --> 00:07:35.913
So I will leave you there.

00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:38.092
The big take away:
arteries are the vessels

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:40.824
that take blood away from the heart.

00:07:40.824 --> 00:07:43.559
Veins are the vessels that
take blood towards the heart.
