the reason we need to travel to Mars and

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
the reason we need to travel to Mars and
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.079
the reason we need to travel to Mars and
to establish a civilization on Mars is

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089
to establish a civilization on Mars is
 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.410
to establish a civilization on Mars is
to protect the long-term survival of the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420
to protect the long-term survival of the
 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.499
to protect the long-term survival of the
human species we need to become a

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
human species we need to become a
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.709
human species we need to become a
spacefaring Society and eventually we

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
spacefaring Society and eventually we
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.260
spacefaring Society and eventually we
need to move far beyond Mars not only

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
need to move far beyond Mars not only
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.779
need to move far beyond Mars not only
from our own solar system but in to

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
from our own solar system but in to
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.820
from our own solar system but in to
other solar systems within this galaxy

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
other solar systems within this galaxy
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.429
other solar systems within this galaxy
and other solar systems in other

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
and other solar systems in other
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.640
and other solar systems in other
galaxies we are making wonderful

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
galaxies we are making wonderful
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.040
galaxies we are making wonderful
progress finding other earth-like

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
progress finding other earth-like
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410
progress finding other earth-like
planets and we will continue to find

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
planets and we will continue to find
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.680
planets and we will continue to find
many of those in the future eventually

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
many of those in the future eventually
 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.869
many of those in the future eventually
the human species is going to disappear

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
the human species is going to disappear
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.630
the human species is going to disappear
that means everyone who's a human being

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
that means everyone who's a human being
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.220
that means everyone who's a human being
will die eventually and this species

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
will die eventually and this species
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.250
will die eventually and this species
will die out and go extinct and there

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
will die out and go extinct and there
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020
will die out and go extinct and there
are a number of reasons how that could

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
are a number of reasons how that could
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.220
are a number of reasons how that could
happen and why that could happen

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
happen and why that could happen
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.600
happen and why that could happen
including a large asteroid hits earth

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610
including a large asteroid hits earth
 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.160
including a large asteroid hits earth
and destroys everything larger than a

rabbit has happened in the age of the
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.369
rabbit has happened in the age of the
dinosaurs 65 million years ago or

eventually our Sun begins to die and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
eventually our Sun begins to die and
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.670
eventually our Sun begins to die and
that that is a 100% probability our Sun

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
that that is a 100% probability our Sun
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039
that that is a 100% probability our Sun
will begin to die in about two billion

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
will begin to die in about two billion
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.660
will begin to die in about two billion
years and one of two things will happen

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
years and one of two things will happen
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.450
years and one of two things will happen
either we will earth will be thrown

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
either we will earth will be thrown
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.429
either we will earth will be thrown
completely out of its orbit and goes

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439
completely out of its orbit and goes
 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.320
completely out of its orbit and goes
spinning off into space and everyone

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
spinning off into space and everyone
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.910
spinning off into space and everyone
will die very quickly or the Sun will

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
will die very quickly or the Sun will
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.980
will die very quickly or the Sun will
essentially irradiate earth as it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
essentially irradiate earth as it
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.719
essentially irradiate earth as it
expands because what happens with a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
expands because what happens with a
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.050
expands because what happens with a
dying Sun is it gets very large and so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
dying Sun is it gets very large and so
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.140
dying Sun is it gets very large and so
in order to survive as a species we have

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
in order to survive as a species we have
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.010
in order to survive as a species we have
to become a spacefaring species we have

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
to become a spacefaring species we have
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.520
to become a spacefaring species we have
to get off this planet eventually and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530
to get off this planet eventually and
 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.020
to get off this planet eventually and
that is the long term hope for Humanity

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030
that is the long term hope for Humanity
 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.980
that is the long term hope for Humanity
Mars is the most habitable place in our

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
Mars is the most habitable place in our
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.789
Mars is the most habitable place in our
solar system by far and even though it's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
solar system by far and even though it's
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.679
solar system by far and even though it's
an incredibly hostile environment we've

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
an incredibly hostile environment we've
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.389
an incredibly hostile environment we've
developed the technology over the last

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
developed the technology over the last
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.940
developed the technology over the last
50 years to survive on Mars and to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
50 years to survive on Mars and to
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.370
50 years to survive on Mars and to
survive quite readily so Mars is a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
survive quite readily so Mars is a
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.740
survive quite readily so Mars is a
wonderful first step it's where we go to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
wonderful first step it's where we go to
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.850
wonderful first step it's where we go to
learn how to go farther Elon Musk says

he will land on Mars in 2025

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
he will land on Mars in 2025
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.170
he will land on Mars in 2025
we've had he and I have had a number of

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180
we've had he and I have had a number of
 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.830
we've had he and I have had a number of
several conversations about this

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840
several conversations about this
 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.010
several conversations about this
he's more optimistic than I am in the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020
he's more optimistic than I am in the
 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.140
he's more optimistic than I am in the
discussion with him about a time frame

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
discussion with him about a time frame
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.440
discussion with him about a time frame
and when a SpaceX rocket or two might

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
and when a SpaceX rocket or two might
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.320
and when a SpaceX rocket or two might
land on Mars we kind of came to the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330
land on Mars we kind of came to the
 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.990
land on Mars we kind of came to the
conclusion that maybe we should say 2027

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000
conclusion that maybe we should say 2027
 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.730
conclusion that maybe we should say 2027
in other words giving him a two-year

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740
in other words giving him a two-year
 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.030
in other words giving him a two-year
fallback but he specifically says and I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040
fallback but he specifically says and I
 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.460
fallback but he specifically says and I
quote him on this in the book he will be

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470
quote him on this in the book he will be
 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.100
quote him on this in the book he will be
extremely disappointed if a SpaceX

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
extremely disappointed if a SpaceX
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.440
extremely disappointed if a SpaceX
rocket has not landed on Mars by 2030

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
rocket has not landed on Mars by 2030
 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.770
rocket has not landed on Mars by 2030
and I think that's quite reasonable

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
and I think that's quite reasonable
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.740
and I think that's quite reasonable
I'd give 90 percent odds to a betting

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
I'd give 90 percent odds to a betting
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.979
I'd give 90 percent odds to a betting
person that a SpaceX rocket will land on

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989
person that a SpaceX rocket will land on
 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.310
person that a SpaceX rocket will land on
Mars before 2030
