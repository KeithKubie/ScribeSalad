00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.936
It's been a rough couple of days
for Donald Trump,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.539
the inspiration for the hit
viral video "Annoying Orange,"

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.841
which I didn't know a lot of
people know, but there it is.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.644
-(laughter) -A <i>New York Times</i>
investigation suggested

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.780
that he may not have paid taxes
since 1995,

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:16.049
when he lost almost
a billion dollars, with a "B."

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.051
It was also revealed
that he made an appearance

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.721
in a soft-core porn movie
right there. Uh...

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.856
(laughter and groaning)

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.858
The New York Attorney General
banned The Trump Foundation

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:27.694
from doing any fund-raising
in the state.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:30.264
And in a late night tweet-storm,
he encouraged America

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:33.400
to watch a Miss Universe
winner's nonexistent sex tape.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.968
Although-- I don't know--

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.570
I guess the phrase
"check out sex tape"

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.005
could be
an unrelated endorsement

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.707
for the 2014 Cameron Diaz,
Jason Segel romp, <i>Sex Tape.</i>

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.143
I don't know
why he was doing that otherwise.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:46.013
Some analysts are calling it the
worst week in campaign history.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.948
Worse even than when
William Howard Taft admitted

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.350
he had an adult baby fetish.
You guys remember that?

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.020
-You probably remember that,
right? -(laughter, groaning)

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:56.190
-Wow.
-Wow.

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.992
-"I've soiled my diapy."
(mutters) -(laughter)

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.994
But if there's one thing I know

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:02.996
about this jaundiced walrus
wrapped in cellophane,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.933
it's that he never stops
topping himself.

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.267
So, comedians,

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:10.871
what is Trump gonna do this week
to make it even worse?

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:15.142
-Steve Agee. -Milk his tits
on live TV and try...

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.211
(laughter)

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.746
-And there's more.
-(laughter)

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.482
And try to sell it
as "stamina sauce."

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:24.751
-HARDWICK: All right. Yeah.
Points. -(laughter and groaning)

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.387
-I'll give you points for that.
Aw. -(applause)

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.856
Uh, Doug Benson.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.858
I heard he's gonna
endorse himself.

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:32.860
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: All right.

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:34.561
Points. He might. Brendon.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.563
He's going to reveal

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:36.663
that stop-and-frisk
is how he met Melania.
