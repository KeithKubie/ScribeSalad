over the last decade what we've been
 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.849

example maybe we could understand the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
example maybe we could understand the
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.609

technology that we've developed is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
technology that we've developed is
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.830

called optogenetics but not to genetics

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
called optogenetics but not to genetics
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.530
called optogenetics but not to genetics
we install a gene that encodes for a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
we install a gene that encodes for a
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.170
we install a gene that encodes for a
light-sensitive protein and a cell or

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180
light-sensitive protein and a cell or
 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.389
light-sensitive protein and a cell or
set of cells in the brain and then we

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
set of cells in the brain and then we
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.250
set of cells in the brain and then we
can aim white at those cells down an

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
can aim white at those cells down an
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.869

some groups have done some pretty

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
some groups have done some pretty
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.619

so for example a group at Caltech has

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
so for example a group at Caltech has
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.479
so for example a group at Caltech has
activated certain clusters of cells deep

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
activated certain clusters of cells deep
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.000
activated certain clusters of cells deep
deep in the brains of mice and if it's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
deep in the brains of mice and if it's
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.260
deep in the brains of mice and if it's
the right cluster you can actually

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
the right cluster you can actually
 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.990
the right cluster you can actually
trigger a mouse to become aggressive or

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
trigger a mouse to become aggressive or
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090
trigger a mouse to become aggressive or
violent they'll attack whatever is next

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.100
to them even if it's like a rubber glove
right you can also study diseases you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
right you can also study diseases you
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.499

can for example turn off overactive

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
can for example turn off overactive
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690
can for example turn off overactive
cells in a seizure and you can actually

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
cells in a seizure and you can actually
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300
cells in a seizure and you can actually
shut down seizures in animal models of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
shut down seizures in animal models of
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.160

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.960
performing an action it's not a very
good metaphor but imagine of the brain

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970
good metaphor but imagine of the brain
 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.729
good metaphor but imagine of the brain
you're trying to solve the brain in the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739
you're trying to solve the brain in the
 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.110
you're trying to solve the brain in the
same way that you might solve a computer

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120
same way that you might solve a computer
 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.509
same way that you might solve a computer
you need to control the computer that's

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519
you need to control the computer that's
 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.240
you need to control the computer that's
the keyboard we use off the genetics you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250
the keyboard we use off the genetics you
 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.159
the keyboard we use off the genetics you
need a map of the computer the wiring

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169
need a map of the computer the wiring
 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.170
need a map of the computer the wiring
that's what we're using expansion across

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
that's what we're using expansion across
 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.210
that's what we're using expansion across
before and you need to watch the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220
before and you need to watch the
 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.640
before and you need to watch the
computer in action the monitor and we're

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
computer in action the monitor and we're
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.839
computer in action the monitor and we're
still working on those technologies

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849
still working on those technologies
 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.490
still working on those technologies
currently I hope we'll have that solved

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500
currently I hope we'll have that solved
 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.250
currently I hope we'll have that solved
in the next couple of years but if you

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260
in the next couple of years but if you
 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.379
in the next couple of years but if you
can put those three things together the

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389
can put those three things together the
 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.289
can put those three things together the
wiring the watching and the control you

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299
wiring the watching and the control you
 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.500
wiring the watching and the control you
can do a lot of interrogation of how

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510
can do a lot of interrogation of how
 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.770
can do a lot of interrogation of how
computational circuits work

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780
computational circuits work
 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:18.290
computational circuits work
