1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,520
There's a, um, a new documentary
by the guy wrote Copay,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,210

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,060

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,220
Some water. Anyway, Billy has a new
documentary are called screen a screwball.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:21,550
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,550
It's all about Alex Rodriguez and the
steroids scandal and a w one of the guys

8
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:30,970
in it as a fake doctor who would
wear a stethoscope around his neck.

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,021
Like he got his,

10
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:37,021
he got his degree in some Janky overseas
university and wasn't legal to practice

11
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,370
medicine in the United States,

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,760
but he would call himself a doctor and
he had like the stethoscope that you'd

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,110
wear. Well, and his office, he'd walk
around with a stethoscope around his neck,

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,010
like hanging around his neck.

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,930
I just think he's going to
check your heart meatball.

16
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:53,860
All he's doing is prescribing
steroids cause it was amazing.

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,440
This kid that was walking around,

18
00:00:56,441 --> 00:01:00,910
he posed as a doctor and had multiple
patients and got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:04,330
I remember this is in Florida,
the same play I guess in Florida too.

20
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,910
It must be pretty easy. Of course
it's in Florida. Is this name?

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,110
Does his name say Malakai?
Uh, yeah, like a creepy name.

22
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:13,880
That's like children of the corn

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,420
Malika Malakai. Yeah, that's, that
is ballsy. Do W wait a minute.

24
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:23,050
That's not his real name. Mary
Malakai Love Robinson. Why not?

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,210
That sounds like a character from

26
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:32,070

34
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:57,251
basis,

35
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,930
treatment on physiological functions
and abnormal conditions on natural laws

36
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:06,570
governing the human body. That doesn't
even, that's a run on sentence.

37
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,570
You missed it. Hold on a
second. Docs would love.

38
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:15,210
Robinson utilizes physiological,
electrical and mechanical
methods such as air,

39
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:19,230
water, light, heat, earth, photo therapy,

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,290
food and herbs, therapy,
psychotherapy, electro therapy,

00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,250
physio therapy,
mechano therapy,

42
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:30,900
natural path corrections and manipulation
and natural methods or modalities

43
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,090
together with natural medicines,

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,820
natural process foods and herbs
and nature's remedies. Cool. Oh,

45
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,190
what you just said? The only thing that
was true about that was manipulation.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,980
Well, how is this guy like who, who
read that and went, all right. Yeah,

47
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,830
we're in. Yeah. Who read that was
like, I need to make an appointment.

48
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,780
Immediately found the real doctor.

49
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,750
All this other bullshit doctors
that don't use manipulation.

50
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,500
One doctor goes like this in a photo.
All of them.

51
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:04,080
Now imagine that became the new thing.
I would not go to that doctor. Huh?

52
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,740
Get offices. So someone had to like rent
him the spot. So they believed them too.

53
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,570
Not just the patient or he
at least had an off a office,

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,680
like an office guy whose dad could have
a bullshitter that pretends to be a

55
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,460
doctor, actually gets patients. It's
got a stethoscope. Got a website.

56
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,643
Isn't that good?

57
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,700
It's good enough that he's got
patients like it actually worked.

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,720
Like imagine being so crazy that
you tell everybody you're a doctor.

59
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,010
You don't know shit about biomedical
medical practices. You know,

60
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:38,830
you read his little bio there and you
get offices and then you get patients,

61
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,880
you treating patients.
