00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.290
SAL KHAN: I'm here
with Dr. Mahadevan,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.059
who's an ER physician
at Stanford.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.649
And what are we looking at here?

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:07.190
DR. MAHADEVAN: Well,
what we're going

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.160
to do is look at
some radiographs

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.450
of the cervical
spine or of your neck

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.215
and try to determine whether
they're adequate or not.

00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:16.554
SAL KHAN: And what does
it mean to be adequate?

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:18.470
DR. MAHADEVAN: When you
have an adequate view,

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.480
you can see from
the first vertebra

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.000
all way down to the junction of
the seventh cervical vertebra

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.340
and the first thoracic vertebra.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.024
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:27.440
And we call it
adequate because it

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.106
means it's adequate
to make a diagnosis.

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:30.190
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.560
You want to be able to see
the entire cervical spine,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.810
so you can make sure that
there's not an injury there.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.954
SAL KHAN: Cool, cool.

00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:37.620
And so what are we
looking at over here?

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.953
What are we directly staring at?

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:42.690
DR. MAHADEVAN: So what we're
looking at is the lateral,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.740
which shows essentially
part of the cervical spine,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.150
shows cervical vertebra
one through five.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.950
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.370
So just to make myself clear.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.527
So these are both
lateral x-rays.

00:00:54.527 --> 00:00:55.360
And we say, lateral.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.560
It is actually from
the side of the person.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.590
And this shows how
well I know my anatomy.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.890
This person, on this x-ray,
they're facing this way?

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.519
DR. MAHADEVAN: They're
actually facing the other way.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.260
SAL KHAN: See, look at that.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.470
I can see, there's a little jaw.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.970
OK.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.720
No, I was just testing you.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.430
Good job.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.930
All right.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.780
So the person is
facing that way.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.280
This way is the front.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.790
And you were just
showing-- you were

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.407
kind of counting
the different bones.

00:01:18.407 --> 00:01:19.365
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:20.920
SAL KHAN: And you were
saying, this is one.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.810
DR. MAHADEVAN: That's one.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.280
SAL KHAN: Two.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.071
DR. MAHADEVAN: Two.

00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:24.914
SAL KHAN: Three,
four, five, and that's

00:01:24.914 --> 00:01:27.330
why you hear people, sometimes,
with back injuries saying,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.121
I have a problem in--
what do they call it?

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.400
DR. MAHADEVAN: L5 is one.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.210
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.850
That's what they're
talking about, like that.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.420
OK, so sorry.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.820
DR. MAHADEVAN: And actually,
we count even further forward

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.682
from there.

00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:39.890
And we look exactly at those
things that kind of look

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.300
like squares.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.536
Those are the actual vertebra,
exactly, right there.

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:45.160
SAL KHAN: This.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.285
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:49.100
And although we're interested
in the entire the spine, when

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.600
we count.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.391
We kind of go down.

00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.010
And as you can see, if you
look at the fifth square

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.980
there, below that it's
really hard to see

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.137
the squares of six and seven.

00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:01.220
SAL KHAN: Right, we can't
see anything below that.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.560
And looks like what is
this person's shoulder

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.310
is blocking it.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.140
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.931
You can see that that
big white thing there

00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.799
is the shoulder that's
gotten in the way.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.090
And it's making it hard to see.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.590
SAL KHAN: They shouldn't have
worn those lead shoulder pads.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.465
DR. MAHADEVAN: [LAUGHING]
And it's making it

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:16.840
hard to see whether there's
something going on down there

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.260
right now.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.010
So it's really a
mystery, as you've shown.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.247
SAL KHAN: So how do
you solve this problem?

00:02:21.247 --> 00:02:23.330
DR. MAHADEVAN: If you look
over at the other film,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.300
it's what we call
a swimmer's view.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.440
And what we've asked
the patient to do

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.540
is raise one arm up
and lower the other.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.000
And in doing so, you kind of
clear that lower cervical spine

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.584
and allow better visualization
of the entire spine.

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:39.250
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.927
And you're taking it from the
direction of the raised arm,

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.010
on the side of raised arm.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.350
DR. MAHADEVAN: You
take it from the side.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.140
And you can see.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.000
SAL KHAN: This is the
raised arm right over here.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.916
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly,
that's the raised arm.

00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:49.890
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.995
And the other arm on the further
side of the patient is down.

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:55.620
And that's what allows us to get
to the shoulder in a position,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.475
so it doesn't block like
it does in this left view.

00:02:57.475 --> 00:02:58.395
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly, exactly.

00:02:58.395 --> 00:02:59.160
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.280
And over here, it
is much clearer

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.740
that this person is also
facing in this direction.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.300
And OK.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.050
So let me see.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.230
So we can count.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.750
This is number
one right up here.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.900
DR. MAHADEVAN: That's one.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.424
SAL KHAN: One, two, three,
four, five, six-- yeah,

00:03:14.424 --> 00:03:15.340
we already got to six.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.844
We didn't see six over here.

00:03:16.844 --> 00:03:17.760
And then we got seven.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.718
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:03:18.718 --> 00:03:19.279
SAL KHAN: OK.

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.820
And so you would call this is
an adequate view for what we're

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.160
trying-- of the neck, because
now we can look at all the way

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.670
through seven.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.190
DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.740
We can get all the
way down to seven.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.921
And ideally, you want to
see the top of one, which

00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:30.670
comes-- actually, in
this counting system,

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.880
we go one through seven.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.380
And then we start
back at one again,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.130
because we're starting with
the thoracic vertebrae.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.282
SAL KHAN: Oh, look at that.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:38.740
It's like with those streets,
where they restart numbering.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.060
And you can't find it.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.560
All right.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.632
So it becomes one again.

00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:42.590
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.020
SAL KHAN: Did I
number that right?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.978
DR. MAHADEVAN: You did.

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:47.740
And again, we're looking
more to the front.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.370
You've got your
numbers perfectly

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.100
on every spinous process, the
little bump that you can feel,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.190
if you press on the
back of your neck.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.780
But what we're really
interested is the alignment

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.780
of the front of the
vertebral bodies.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.884
SAL KHAN: So this is one.

00:03:59.884 --> 00:04:03.153
This is two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:05.570
You want to look
at the top of one.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.935
Where's the top of one?

00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:09.370
DR. MAHADEVAN: If you just
continue down right there.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.945
And it sometimes is
difficult to see.

00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:13.070
But exactly, you want to
see that there's alignment

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.029
right in front of--

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:14.570
SAL KHAN: OK.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.194
I'll assume that
there's something here

00:04:16.194 --> 00:04:17.365
that I can't really see.

00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:18.240
But you're an expert.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.000
So maybe you see
things that I don't.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.942
All right.

00:04:20.942 --> 00:04:22.400
OK, so now what do
we do with this?

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.020
DR. MAHADEVAN: Now,
we've shown you

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.510
that you can get
a swimmer's view.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.640
And it can show you all
the way down to C7, T1.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.930
But on the original
view, as you've shown,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.780
we can't see that.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.540
So what we did for this patient
was get a swimmer's view.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.570
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.830
So this is adequate.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.500
And we have this other
slide right over here.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.200
We have this other
one right over here.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.325
And why is this one interesting?

00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:48.170
DR. MAHADEVAN: This
is the same patient.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.991
And now we've taken
that same view

00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:51.990
that we talked about
before, the swimmer's view,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.430
where you've got--

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.160
SAL KHAN: This is
the same patient

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.005
as this patient right over
here, not this patient over here

00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:56.110
on the right.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.780
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.020
SAL KHAN: Because that one
looked overall pretty healthy.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.290
DR. MAHADEVAN: That was
a normal swimmer's view.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.019
But here is an abnormal
swimmer's view.

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:03.310
SAL KHAN: It's the same person?

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.440
DR. MAHADEVAN: Same person--

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.950
SAL KHAN: As this one, not
the other swimmer's view.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.240
DR. MAHADEVAN: Facing
in the same direction,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.656
in case you want
to test me again.

00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:09.540
SAL KHAN: OK, good.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.830
DR. MAHADEVAN: And
if you count again,

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.370
starting with the
first vertebra.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.215
So we go one--

00:05:15.215 --> 00:05:17.332
SAL KHAN: Two-- this
is three right here?

00:05:17.332 --> 00:05:19.165
DR. MAHADEVAN: Three
is this one right here.

00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:22.227
SAL KHAN: Three, oh, it's
a kind of a-- oh, I see.

00:05:22.227 --> 00:05:23.310
This whole thing is three?

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.893
DR. MAHADEVAN: That whole thing
is three right there, exactly.

00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:30.730
SAL KHAN: Four, five,
six, and then seven,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.552
it looks like
right around there,

00:05:32.552 --> 00:05:34.385
if I'm reading that,
if I see that properly.

00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:35.520
It's a little darker there.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.770
DR. MAHADEVAN: And the key
important finding there

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.890
is, that as you draw a
line along the anterior

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.000
or the front of all
those vertebral bodies,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.410
if you were to connect
them just like that.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.904
SAL KHAN: I'll
draw a dotted line.

00:05:49.904 --> 00:05:50.945
DR. MAHADEVAN: Fantastic.

00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:53.182
SAL KHAN: It looks
pretty all right.

00:05:53.182 --> 00:05:54.640
DR. MAHADEVAN: And
as you go down--

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.310
SAL KHAN: Oh, look
at that, at seven,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.280
looks like a little
disruption there.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.840
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly,
and it's pushed back.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.360
And the problem is,
right behind those bones

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.810
is your spinal cord.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.160
And so in any kind of an
injury like this, potentially,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.705
could injure your spinal cord
and lead to permanent paralysis

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:11.250
or weakness.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.990
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.780
So this is the main thing.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.397
I guess, there's
two big takeaways,

00:06:14.397 --> 00:06:16.730
at least from this little
short segment, that we've set.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.271
One is, you've got to make sure
that you have the information

00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:20.390
to make a diagnosis on.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.040
So for example, this
right over here,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.180
you couldn't even
do something useful,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.930
because you're not able to
see the number six and number

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.400
seven.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.900
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly, we
would call it inadequate.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.631
And we would say, we can't draw
any firm conclusions from that

00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:30.130
actually.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.726
SAL KHAN: And
that's why you want

00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:31.760
them to get in that
swimmer's position,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.190
raise the arm from the direction
that you're looking at.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.940
DR. MAHADEVAN: Correct.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.690
SAL KHAN: And they'll
lower the other arm.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.520
And then you can see
something like this.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.600
And this right over here
is cause for trouble,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.410
because now you can go
all the way down to seven.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.020
And you can actually see
that they're not aligned.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.600
DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.850
And so this is
someone you wouldn't

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.516
let get out of your
emergency department

00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:49.830
without seeing a specialist,
a spine specialist.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.050
Whereas if you didn't
have that view,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.060
you might be falsely reassured
that everything was OK,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.600
when in fact, there's a
serious problem there.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.980
SAL KHAN: Very cool, very cool.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.730
Thanks a bunch.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.690
DR. MAHADEVAN: Thank you.
