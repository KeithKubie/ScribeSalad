00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.490
We have the inequality 2/3
is greater than negative

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.380
4y minus 8 and 1/3.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.410
Now, the first thing I want to
do here, just because mixed

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.770
numbers bother me-- they're
actually hard to deal with

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.470
mathematically.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.950
They're easy to think about--
oh, it's a little

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.079
bit more than 8.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.910
Let's convert this to an
improper fraction.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.910
So 8 and 1/3 is equal to-- the
denominator's going to be 3.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.080
3 times 8 is 24, plus 1 is 25.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.920
So this thing over here is the
same thing as 25 over 3.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.240
Let me just rewrite
the whole thing.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:42.340
So it's 2/3 is greater than
negative 4y minus 25 over 3.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.730
Now, the next thing I want to
do, just because dealing with

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.260
fractions are a bit of a pain,
is multiply both sides of this

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.430
inequality by some
quantity that'll

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.550
eliminate the fractions.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.610
And the easiest one I can think
of is multiply both

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.480
sides by 3.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.870
That'll get rid of the 3's
in the denominator.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.430
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 3.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.850
That's the left-hand side.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.520
And then I'm going to multiply
the right-hand side.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.750
3, I'll put it in parentheses
like that.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.870
Well, one point that I want to
point out is that I did not

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.160
have to swap the inequality
sign, because I multiplied

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.300
both sides by a positive
number.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.600
If the 3 was a negative number,
if I multiplied both

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.650
sides by negative 3, or negative
1, or negative

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.920
whatever, I would have had to
swap the inequality sign.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.290
Anyway, let's simplify this.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.040
So the left-hand side, we have
3 times 2/3, which is just 2.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.660
2 is greater than.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.050
And then we can distribute
this 3.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.580
3 times negative 4y
is negative 12y.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.880
And then 3 times negative 25
over 3 is just negative 25.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.450
Now, we want to get all of our
constant terms on one side of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.830
the inequality and all of our
variable terms-- the only

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.660
variable here is y on the other
side-- the y is already

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.070
sitting here, so let's just get
this 25 on the other side

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.820
of the inequality.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.490
And we can do that by
adding 25 to both

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.310
sides of this equation.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.755
So let's add 25 to both sides
of this equation.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.642
And with the left-hand side, 2
plus 25 five is 27 and we're

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:16.070
going to get 27 is
greater than.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.030
The right-hand side of the
inequality is negative 12y.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.930
And then negative 25 plus 25,
those cancel out, that was the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.300
whole point, so we're left
with 27 is greater than

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.190
negative 12y.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.970
Now, to isolate the y, you can
either multiply both sides by

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.710
negative 1/12 or you could say
let's just divide both sides

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.180
by negative 12.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.630
Now, because I'm multiplying
or dividing by a negative

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.950
number here, I'm going to need
to swap the inequality.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.030
So let me write this.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.690
If I divide both sides of this
equation by negative 12, then

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.055
it becomes 27 over negative 12
is less than-- I'm swapping

00:02:57.055 --> 00:02:59.900
the inequality, let me do this
in a different color-- is less

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.190
than negative 12y over
negative 12.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.280
Notice, when I divide both sides
of the inequality by a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.150
negative number, I swap the
inequality, the greater than

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.950
becomes a less than.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.620
When it was positive, I didn't
have to swap it.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.280
So 27 divided by negative
12, well, they're both

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.520
divisible by 3.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.850
So we're going to get, if we
divide the numerator and the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.960
denominator by 3, we get
negative 9 over 4 is less

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.580
than-- these cancel out-- y.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.260
So y is greater than negative
9/4, or negative 9/4

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.220
is less than y.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.740
And if you wanted to write
that-- just let me write

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.110
this-- our answer is y is
greater than negative 9/4.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.660
I just swapped the order, you
could say negative 9/4

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.870
is less than y.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.590
Or if you want to visualize that
a little bit better, 9/4

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.140
is 2 and 1/4, so we could also
say y is greater than negative

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.300
2 and 1/4 if we want to put
it as a mixed number.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.410
And if we wanted to graph it
on the number line-- let me

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.620
draw a number line right here,
a real simple one.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.820
Maybe this is 0.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.870
Negative 2 is right over, let's
say negative 1, negative

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.450
2, then say negative
3 is right there.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.610
Negative 2 and 1/4 is going
to be right here, and it's

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.930
greater than, so we're not going
to include that in the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.170
solution set.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.700
So we're going to make an
open circle right there.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.560
And everything larger than that
is a valid y, is a y that

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.450
will satisfy the inequality.
