00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 . 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
 I think we have a prior knowledge of how muscles contract 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.520
 At the molecular level. 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.080
 Let's go back and focus on the muscles 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.720
 At least syntactically, or how they interact with 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.375
 Things we usually associate with muscles. 

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:16.140
 So let me draw a flexible biceps muscle here. 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.890
 . 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.940
 Here is the annex and let's say 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.540
 Here is a specific hand. 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.435
 If this is the flexible biceps muscle biceps. 

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:28.130
 . 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.890
 I think we all saw graphs of muscle shape, 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.820
 At least at the macro level and are connected 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.010
 Bones in the limbs. 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.090
 Let me draw the bones. 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060
 I will not elaborate on its place - if it is connected 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.060
 Bone in one of the limbs across the tendons. 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.610
 Here is a part of the bones. 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.910
 Here is exactly another greatness that is related to it. 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.330
 Here are the tendons, which bind bones 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.580
 Muscle. 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.620
 . 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.560
 We have knowledge - that it is connected to two bones, when 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.310
 When you contract, you move a part of our skeleton. 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.025
 If we focus on structural muscle. 

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:12.780
 . 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.660
 Other types are smooth muscles and heart muscles. 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.280
 The muscles of the heart, as you imagine, are the muscles that are in the heart. 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.000
 The smooth muscles are involuntary muscles, the muscles move slowly, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.610
 And things like the gut. 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.740
 I will explain a video about this in the future, but most 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.330
 Time, when people mention muscles, we associate them 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.545
 Skeletal skeletal muscle, 

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:38.720
 Which makes us run, we carry things, we speak, we do some things. 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.940
 That's what we usually associate - let's get deeper 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.960
 A little here. 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.670
 If you take a cross-section of this biceps muscle here - 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.130
 If you take a cross section of this muscle 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.285
 Here - I will enlarge it. 

00:01:52.285 --> 00:02:06.760
 . 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.400
 It would be so. 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.020
 This muscle is inside. 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.960
 And back to us, this is the chord. 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.400
 . 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.880
 And then there is a cover; there is no line 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.100
 Determining or separating between the tendon and 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.100
 Cover around this muscle, but this cover is called 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.060
 Sheath muscle, which is really just connective tissue 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.450
 It covers the muscle, protects it somewhat, and reduces friction 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.120
 Between the muscle and the surrounding bone 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.620
 Other fabric tissues that may be in the arm of the person here. 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.960
 And then in this muscle, there is connective tissue 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.980
 Inside. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.570
 Let me draw it in a different color. 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.820
 I'll paint it in orange. 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:17.600
 . 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.460
 These are called musculoskeletal sheath, and these too 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.860
 Just connective tissue within the same muscle. 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.980
 . 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.780
 And each of these things is done 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.700
 Sheathed the muscle fiber by dividing it - if we take one of these things 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.410
 We let her go a bit further - 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.870
 If we take this - what is the sheath of muscular fibrosis 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.800
 Divide it - if we pull it - let me 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.260
 I do this here. 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.600
 If we pull this out of here like this - you'll find 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.050
 That the sheath of myocardium surrounds them, right? 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.840
 All of this is the musculoskeletal sheath, which is an upscale word meaning 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.630
 Connective tissue. 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.600
 There are other things here. 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.940
 There may be nerves and you may find bristles, 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.920
 Many things are different, because you must get blood and 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.150
 Nerve signals for the entrances of the muscles 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.680
 Not just connective tissue. 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.800
 These are other things you should be able to enter into 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.950
 Muscle cells. 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.320
 So each of these - I think its name is a subsidiary fiber, 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.220
 But these sub-fibers of the muscle are rather large. 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.470
 This package is called. 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:35.650
 . 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.600
 The connective tissue that is inside the bundle 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.850
 It is called the musculoskeletal sheath. 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.320
 . 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.680
 If again, other muscle tissues, be out 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.650
 Bristles, and also nerves, and all the things that must be 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.370
 Connected to muscle cells. 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.015
 We are now in one muscle. 

00:05:00.015 --> 00:05:04.850
 . 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.320
 All of these connective tissues are the musculoskeletal sheath. 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.740
 . 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.220
 Each of these things is in the musculoskeletal sheath 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.240
 They are the same muscle cell. 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.150
 This is the actual muscle cell. 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.320
 I will write it in violet color. 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.700
 This thing is here - I can pull it out a bit. 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.380
 . 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:37.110
 If you pull this out a bit, this is the actual muscle cell. 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.990
 This is what we wanted to reach, but we are 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.610
 We will dig deeper into the muscle cell to see, and understand how 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.920
 The meosin and actin threads are in the muscle cell. 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.595
 Here we find the muscle cell or muscle fiber. 

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:51.440
 . 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.970
 The two who you see when you deal 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.010
 With muscle - are two previous intramuscular, these refer to 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.710
 Muscle. 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.990
 You will also see the word sarcoma meaning muscle, such as 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.930
 Musculoskeletal sheath, or musculoskeletal network. 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.970
 You will also see the word sarcoma ie muscle as a precedent and here it means 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.980
 The body - like a naos - or you can think of other things 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.900
 Start with a little / sacro. 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.850
 So the sakro is muscular tissue. 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.760
 Muscle is muscular tissue and this prefix is ​​the muscle. 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.220
 This is the muscle fiber. 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.650
 This is a real muscle cell, and we'll zoom in 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.320
 The image on the muscle. 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.490
 I will draw it much more here. 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.570
 The muscle cell is called a muscle fiber. 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.760
 It is named Lev because it is longer than its width 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.380
 Come in different forms - let me draw 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.880
 Muscular fibrosis. 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.600
 . 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.200
 I will also have a cross section of the muscle cell. 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.620
 . 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.110
 These will be short compared to - place hundreds of micrometers - 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.520
 Or may be somewhat long - at least 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.500
 Long as measured by cells. 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.340
 We mean long here a few centimeters. 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.160
 Think of it as a cell. 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.330
 This is a fairly long cell. 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.760
 And because it is too long, the 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.770
 With many intentions. 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.280
 I will draw the cores, I will 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.470
 Better muscle. 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.510
 I will make small lumps outside the membranes 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.740
 Where the nuclei can relate to this muscle fiber. 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.330
 Remember that this is just one of the individual muscle cells 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.760
 It is so long that it has more than one core. 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.600
 Let me take a cross section of it because we will enter 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.800
 Inside the muscle cell itself. 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.210
 I have said it is multi-core. 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.340
 If we imagine that its membrane is transparent, 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.930
 There will be one nucleus here, and another nucleus 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.200
 Here is the nucleus, 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.170
 And another nucleus there. 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.630
 And the cause of it being cores 

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.830
 At spaced distances, you do not need to wait for the protein to come 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.980
 Of this kernel 

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.090
 To this part of the muscle cell. 

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.020
 You can get DNA information 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.680
 Closest to health. 

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.850
 If they are multiple cores. 

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.735
 I have read one - I think it had 30 nuclei per millimeter 

00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:10.700
 Of muscle spasm, and this is the ratio. 

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.680
 I do not know if this is the actual situation, however 

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.370
 The nuclei are almost sub-membrane 

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.610
 Muscle cell - and certainly remember what this is called 

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.010
 From the previous video 

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.040
 The cell membrane is 

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:31.380
 Musculoskeletal sheath. 

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.630
 These are cores. 

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.770
 . 

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:43.690
 If I take a cross section of this, you find 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.070
 There are tubes inside the pancakes. 

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:53.300
 Here you find a set of pipes inside 

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.210
 The cell itself. 

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.380
 Let me get one of them out. 

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.050
 If you have removed one of these tubes. 

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.300
 This is the muscle fiber. 

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.390
 . 

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.360
 Although I looked at these via a microscope light, 

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.380
 You will find that it has some scratches. 

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.190
 The shape of the scratches will be similar to this, 

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.560
 Like this, like this, scratches will be a bit thin 

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.110
 Such and such. 

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:24.200
 Within these muscle fibers we will find myosin 

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.260
 And actin filaments. 

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.170
 Let us zoom in here on this muscle fiber. 

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.910
 We will continue to zoom until we reach the molecular level. 

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.300
 If these muscle fibers, they are, remember that they are inside 

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.220
 Muscular cell, and intraocular fibrosis. 

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.090
 Muscular fibroblasts are muscle cells. 

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.640
 The lyfia of muscle is - you can imagine it as a tube inside 

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.580
 Muscular cell. 

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.390
 These are the things that cause 

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.600
 Constriction. 

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.270
 If you zoom in on the muscle fiber, 

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.830
 Its shape will be similar to this and will have these 

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.020
 The straps are here. 

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.040
 The shape of the straps will be like this. 

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.445
 You will find these small strips resemble these shapes. 

00:10:05.445 --> 00:10:09.710
 . 

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.170
 You'll find bars wider like this, 

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.020
 Such a gloomy - I am trying hard to draw them close to the truth 

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.410
 This line may be here. 

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.670
 The same is repeated here. 

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.100
 So each of these units 

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.030
 Repetition is called a musculoskeletal. 

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:37.050
 . 

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.550
 These repeating units go from - this is called G to another line. 

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.490
 Line G to another g line. 

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.060
 These words came when he looked 

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.430
 People under the microscope and saw these lines, 

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.070
 They began to write names for them. 

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.450
 And to understand other word stories - I will now talk about 

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.060
 How this is associated with myosin and actin. 

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.330
 Here in particular there is a group A. 

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.720
 . 

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.410
 And then this distance here or these parts here 

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.850
 These groups are called I. 

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.380
 We will talk in minutes about how this relates 

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.610
 The mechanisms of action or units that we talked about - or 

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.300
 The molecules that we talked about in the previous section. 

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.710
 If we enlarge the picture here, if we enter into this 

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.440
 If you take a cross section, 

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.060
 Of these muscle fibers, we will find - if we cut them 

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.960
 Or perhaps dissecting it - if you divide it in parallel 

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.190
 For the screen you're looking at, 

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.660
 You will find something similar to this. 

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.390
 This will be the Z. 

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:41.110
 . 

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.540
 This is the next Z group. 

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.160
 I will enlarge the muscle mass now. 

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.560
 This is another Z group. 

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.290
 Then find the actin filaments. 

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.920
 We are now approaching the molecular level 

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.170
 Which he talked about. 

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:17.000
 . 

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.250
 And then between the actin filaments, you find 

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.910
 Mucine yarns. 

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:27.700
 . 

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.540
 Remember that the meosin strings had these two heads on them. 

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:36.670
 All of them have two heads on it, this one 

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.390
 Along the actin filaments. 

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.260
 I will draw only some of them and then 

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.810
 You find them stuck in the middle like this. 

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.680
 We will now talk about what happens when 

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.650
 The muscle contractes. 

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.070
 I can draw it here again. 

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.060
 . 

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.440
 So, they have far more heads than I draw, 

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.070
 But that gives us an idea of ​​what's going on. 

00:12:55.070 --> 00:13:00.010
 . 

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.320
 These are myosin, I think, proteins 

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.660
 All of them are intertwined like what we saw in the previous section 

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.460
 And then there will be another one here. 

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.950
 There is no need to draw it in detail 

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.890
 You can see directly that Group A fits in with 

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.032
 Where is the meosin? 

00:13:15.032 --> 00:13:17.260
 So this group A is here. 

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.100
 . 

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.680
 There is a tangle. 

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.780
 They are intertwined with each other, even in a relaxed state, however 

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.070
 Group I is where you find it 

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.740
 Only actin filaments, without meosin. 

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.070
 . 

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.410
 And then find the meosin filaments stuck in place across the Titan, 

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.460
 Which you can imagine as flexible. 

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.186
 I would like to paint it differently. 

00:13:46.186 --> 00:13:52.020
 . 

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.520
 The meosin is then fixed in place by the titan. 

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.310
 . 

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.790
 It is connected to the Z group across the Titan. 

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.760
 So what happened? 

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:07.340
 We all have this - when a neuron is raised - let me 

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.600
 I draw the end point of a neuron here, this is an end point 

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.470
 The axis of the neuron is here. 

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.280
 It is a motor neuron. 

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.960
 And gives orders to the person to contract. 

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.670
 You have a latent verb. 

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.460
 The latent action passes through the membrane, 

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.580
 In all directions. 

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.860
 Of course, if we look at it from here, 

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.690
 You'll find that it has a small cross-sectional muscle or T-shaped tube. 

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:35.860
 They enter the cell to spread 

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.140
 The latent action. 

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.980
 This network stimulates musculoskeletality to secrete calcium. 

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.580
 Calcium associated with traptonin, which in turn is linked 

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.340
 With actin filaments that move the tropominozine (muscle protein) outside 

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.290
 Path, and then the end occurs. 

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.130
 The meosin begins by using the adenosine triphosphate triglyceride 

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.060
 Through these actin filaments. 

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:03.210
 You can imagine, when you complete, the power step 

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.050
 Pay - you can see it either 

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.130
 As actin strings this way or you can say that the meosin 

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.490
 It can move in that direction, but you 

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.440
 You pull a rope from both sides, right? 

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.040
 If the meosin remains in one place, the 

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.715
 The actin threads will combine with each other. 

00:15:19.715 --> 00:15:22.610
 . 

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.740
 This is exactly how muscles contract. 

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.830
 We hope to have a video in this video 

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.230
 The whole idea started from the elastic muscle in this path 

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.920
 To what happens at the molecular level specifically 

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.000
 Which we've learned in previous videos. 

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.500
 And you can imagine when this happens to all 

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.850
 Myocardial infarctions, true, 

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.550
 Because the musculoskeletal network excretes calcium 

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.690
 In general in the filling of the - and called myocardial muscle, 

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.110
 Because we deal with muscle cells - filling 

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.370
 This muscle cell. 

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.210
 Calcium is soaked in all these muscle fibers. 

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.910
 They are able to contact the troponin - or at least 

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:05.305
 Plenty of trapponin over these actin filaments and then 

00:16:05.305 --> 00:16:07.000
 The entire muscle contractes. 

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.340
 When this happens, each muscle fiber, 

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.030
 Or every muscle cell will not be 

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.350
 It has the power of contraction. 

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.930
 But when she doubled it all up with her - 

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.040
 The only one you have worked for, or some of them 

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.240
 There will be muscle strain. 

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.710
 But if they all cling to each other, 

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.270
 This will create power 

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.420
 That enables you to do a job, or that will combine your bones with each other, 

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:28.920
 Or bearing weights. 

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.980
 We hope you have benefited from this section.
