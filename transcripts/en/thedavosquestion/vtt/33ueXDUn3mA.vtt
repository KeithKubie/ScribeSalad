00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.669
&gt;&gt; Hi, good evening, this is Ambuj Chaturvedi.
To answer the question whether India can become

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:10.410
a superpower or not,
the obvious answer is yes, because eventually

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.710
we will arrive at that
spot.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.880
We -- the transformation process is starting,
has begun since '91, so

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.910
India is not looking back.
Now the second part of the question would

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.859
be what does it take to be a
superpower and when can become a superpower?

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.250
So what is the definition of a superpower?
Nuclear weapons, good roads, good railways,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.390
good infrastructure, good
power, good power facilities, zero power cuts,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.550
women's education, equal
rights.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.329
India will arrive at all those -- India will
arrive at all those

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.970
avenues, all those milestones will be achieved.
But, the difficult -- the difficult question

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.030
will be how quickly?
Because you have a billion people.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.859
You have a billion people and the biggest
problem is just what today's

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.330
last session was, when the mars problems come
in the last five years,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.440
these problems are going to be the crucial
ones if you need to watch

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.800
out for.
Because a change, a change is slow.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.150
We're not like China, we're not dictator,
we're not dictator.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.000
So change will be slow.
What our biggest concern is to watch out for

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.820
Mars emergency problems
just come up.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.080
Who knows what other problems will come up
because of the amount of

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.510
inequality which is there in the country.
So we need to see how quickly we can, we can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.670
eliminate inequality in
the country.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.930
That needs to be the key question.
Can India become a superpower?

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.902
Yes, it can.
That's where I would like to end.
