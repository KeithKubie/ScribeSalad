1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,310
What does that thing you say when
you clink glasses instead of sure.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,660
It's like the Irish, you
know, salute or, or you know,

3
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:13,560
now stroll Vi's just the Irish
version of Sloucher. [inaudible] yeah,

4
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:16,440
like slash l. H. I. N. T.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,710
E I believe his house about
Nate [inaudible]. Ooh,

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,610
I never knew that you said it before and
always just let it slide cause I didn't

7
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,650
want to seem like a Dork. Yeah, I know.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,140
That's one of the things you probably
seen it real book. I mean like, you know,

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,730
Gaelic is some real harsh. Yeah. Like uh,

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,920
vowels and Haley, it's a crazy,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,330
like I've seen Gaelic names that like
were spelled insane and it was, oh,

12
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:43,140
that's pronounced Shawn.
Like some crazy shit.

13
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:46,350
Like that wild ancient language,
right? Yeah. For real though.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,110
I love Irish people, men, I just,

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,100
I'm fucking fascinated by
the wildness of that culture.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,080
That's what God made whiskey,
you know? So the Irish would put,

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,870
so the Irish would never rule the world.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,260
When you see it got like
a guy like Conor McGregor,

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,190
that part of what is him is Irish.

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,350
He's like a pure like brilliant Irish.
You know what I'm talking for sure.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,590
Bowls fall the way motherfucker
knows how to take a loss,

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,540
knows how to take a loss. Takes a loss
like a man and still talk shit. You know,

23
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,860
come right back to him. It's like
that, you know that that guy that you,

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,341
your fight,

25
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:26,850
but he loses but you know you're going
to have to fight him tomorrow. Yes.

26
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,930
Or as soon as his shit is healed
up into busted up, this is gone.

27
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,590
It's kind of like a hundred million
dollars in the bank and he still wants to

28
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:39,520
fight people still smacking people
at bars. Yeah, that's, that's, it's

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,200
hard. It's hard to be like,
don't do that. Nah, not that.

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,270
Oh, who knows what the
fuck the guy said to him,

31
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,180
but it looked like the
guy was old as fuck.

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,650
Someone said he was only 50 that the guy
was only 50 do didn't fold up though.

33
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:58,890
He just kind of sat at the bar counter.
Didn't really, yeah, he smacked him.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,060
He gave him this smack in the back and
then like a couple of fingers he touched

35
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:06,050
you do what we call mushed him.
He pushed him. He like, yes,

36
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,190
you can kind of be interpreted as
hitting, but it really ain't quite a hit.

37
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,160
You know when you're a guy like that,

38
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:15,390
you're basically walking around agreeing
not to fuck people up because you have

39
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,880
to kind of agree to not fuck
people up. The money's got,

40
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:21,150
there should be like five guys around
him that makes sure that never happens,

41
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,710
but they can't listen to him.

42
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,110
Like if you have a guy like him,
he's going to do whatever he wants.

43
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,150
Even if there's a bunch of
people around him stopping him,

44
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,190
you're not going to stop
him from doing checks.

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,520
When he threw that guy's phone down
the ground, stomped it in Miami,

46
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,130
there was all the body guards there.
He just did it. He just did it.

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,250
He's Kinda McGregor.
He's fucking, look you.

48
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,570
He's living like you're supposed to live.
If you Conor McGregor the dances, dog,

49
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:47,760
go to jail. Dude. Don't get locked down.

50
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,160
The whole structure of the way things
are now as far as like entertainment,

51
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,110
it's like, yeah, it's all about eyeballs.

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,100
While he fucking figured it
out, man, pulling out figs, you

53
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,770
know what I mean? He figured it out, man,

54
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,290
like in the most crazy way possible.

55
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,000
He figured out how to just blow up
the whole system. When you're in,

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,060
you're a guy who has
been fighting. I mean,

57
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:17,860
I contacted him on Twitter
in like 2013 right?

58
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:21,860
By 2018 he's worth $100 million quick

59
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,250
and he calls it all the way and
he calls it all the way. It's,

60
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,940
that's the craziest part is
he called it all the way like,

61
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,120
I'm going to be a billionaire
or a multimillionaire.

62
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,210
You know what Dana White said to
me once about him that's dead on.

63
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,500
He said he eats pressure. He said, that
guy eats pressure. He just eats it.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,100
He goes, he just, he just goes in there
and the more pressure experiences,

65
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,170
the better he can perform. It's true.

66
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,840
It's like you look at the Aldo fight
picture, perfect left-hand knockout.

67
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,240
I mean it doesn't get any prettier.
The timing, the setup, the patients,

68
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:58,450
the movement that the setting it up,
looking for them to leap in and buying,

69
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,030
catching the money's coming in.
Pretty sure he said exactly those.

70
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,760
That's exactly what he said he was
gonna do right before the fight too. Oh,

71
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:04,990
that's me tweeting him.

72
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,950
January of 2013 I saw his fight in,

73
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:12,640
I think it was cage warriors.
I think that's the promotion.

74
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,040
Cage wars or cage warriors. I think
it's, why am I fucking that up?

75
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,260
Cage wars. Is there two different
ones? There probably is.

76
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,340
It's probably a bunch of
cage stuff, but either way,

77
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,200
he was a fucking people up overseas
and I was like, this kid is for real.

78
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,950
He just sees something. Sometimes
he sees like, I'll watch a video,

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,090
I'll see how a guy moves. I'm like,
Jesus, some guys just have something.

80
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:44,440
And he had just ridiculous
timing. So relaxed in there.

81
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,980
Those were fun. Frakes man,
his early days of MMA is like,

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,580
you can go back and watch him and you
go, oh, this guy's gonna be special.

83
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,030
He's gotta like a weird sense
of timing. You know? He's like,

84
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:58,270
he's just very good at understanding
where you're at and knowing how to put it

85
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,780
into his head. Me winning, you know the
Irish, the whole Irish thing. That's it.

86
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,730
Oh for sure. Man. Persian. Love it.

87
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,340
I love it. Yeah. When he was
like, we all fight together,

88
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,400
like do when he's in the room,

89
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,830
like if he wins a fight and there's,

90
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,550
you know the crowds filled with like
7,000 Irish people. Do you feel it?

91
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,010
Like you feel like goosebumps. It's crazy.

92
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,710
Like you do everything you can to stop
it just to keep yourself from crying at

93
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,690
the beauty of it.

94
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,980
This guy standing there in
front of thousands of people
that have flown overseas

95
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:33,160
to see us. Finally people fly
over for, Ooh, it's crazy.

96
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:37,950
They take over the fucking Vegas hotels
take off her like where you have seas.

97
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,540
Then they shut down like
seventh avenue in front of,

98
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,600
in front of the Madison Square.

99
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,420
There's not a fucking fan on earth
like Irish fans. They're different.

100
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,930
I used to think Brazilian fans were
crazy until I saw the Irish fans.

101
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,080
They take over the whole Mandalay
bay was taken over by people singing.

102
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,130
It was all, I was fair amount

103
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,460
of drinking. Oh, fair. More than fair.

104
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,460
But just the fact that they could do that,

105
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,630
that they can gang get together
and sing the same song,

106
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,210
like thousands of them
together singing the same song.

107
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,930
I remember the first time, uh,

108
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,280
when we went to Ireland
as house of pain and, uh,

109
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,320
in between songs, they broke into the
whole, you know, the soccer chance stuff.

110
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,530
And we were just like, whoa,
this is crazy. You know,

111
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,200
we never experienced anything
like that. They don't, they had,

112
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,740
you didn't do that at the sports events
at home back then? Not back then at all.

113
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,410
So that was amazing. Culturally,
it's, it's, it's, it's,

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,620
it's that soccer.

115
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,650
They have to have real Conor fight in
Ireland once he's got a fight in Dublin,

116
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,420
in a soccer stadium.
Fuck yet. Right. Why not?

117
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,020
Why not? If he's ever gonna fight
again, that's what it's trying to do it,

118
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,360
I don't, you know, the, I think the, I,

119
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:57,230
the idea was that it's like more money
in paper view. If you fight in Vegas,

120
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,570
you know Vegas is worth a lot of money.

121
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,960
Doesn't the time have a lot to do
with it too? When the European thing,

122
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:06,170
they gotta do the whole weird time thing
over there so they can accommodate the

123
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,510
pay per view here. Yeah,
it'd be real weird.

124
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,920
They'd be fighting like
four in the morning.

125
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,580
It's always real weird to me when I
wake up and there's like a a a South

126
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,250
American fight that happened
at noon and I'm like, Oh God,

127
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,110
missed or Japan like rise in if you
trying to watch rise and they have it in

128
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,120
Japanese time. That's
how pride used to be.

129
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,620
We would get up at like we would have
guys come over my house and we would watch

130
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,630
pride at like three
o'clock in the morning.

131
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,850
Like sometimes they would have
them live for some reason,

132
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,080
if I'm remembering it correctly.

133
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,380
Sometimes they would have them live and
sometimes they'd have the fights and you

134
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:40,580
knew what happened but you didn't get
to see it for like a couple of weeks.

135
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,840
They would delay it in North America
for some strange reason. They didn't,

136
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,850
didn't, didn't totally do it live.

137
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,110
I was hip to that MMA share
thing a long time ago.

138
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:55,460
They always had the bootleg videos and
I tell anybody that's like Voldemort.

139
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,880
Don't say that. I don't did I
did. I just mess up. I don't know.

140
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,750
You can get mad. It was gone.
Anyways. That was 10 years ago. Dude.

141
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,100
Illegal street dude,

142
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,340
UFC is gangsters with that.

143
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:13,740
Like it used to be you could watch
those and then I over time you was like,

144
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,780
cause like in Europe before,

145
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:16,820
like there was things like
fight pass and thing like that.

146
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,910
You couldn't find a paper view if you
were stuck over there four in the morning,

147
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:21,140
in the middle of somewhere.

148
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,670
So you would lean on whatever you could
as a fan and, but the, they start,

149
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,660
you started seeing them shutting them
down. Like it doesn't, they're gangsters.

150
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,210
The UFC or gangsters. Yeah.
So it's a big money business.

151
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,110
People fucking be oppressive
is what it is. It's impressive.

152
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:43,070
It's like there's like a, there's a army
of motherfucker somewhere going and go.

153
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,500
Yeah. Some of it must get through, right.

154
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,700
Just every at the internet just
has stuff that gets, I don't know.

155
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,880
I got the fight pass now
so I everywhere I go.

156
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,720
So I got the fight pass and the
little you have that little um,

157
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,940
static IP address though. Like when
you are out the country you can,

158
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,670
it's perfect. That's perfectly
normal. You know what's weird?

159
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,360
Why aren't they showing why?
Like I need to ask the UFC this.

160
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,960
Why don't they show like the height,

161
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,550
like the knockouts on
their Instagram page.

162
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,340
They show when the knockouts
over and you notice that? Yeah,

163
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,600
I do not understand. I don't understand
it because once everybody knows,

164
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:19,440
they know, everybody knows. They know
it's not hurting anybody to watch it.

165
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,580
I get it. It'll just hype up the
replay business. A lot of business.

166
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:27,120
I wonder what the replay buys are like
the cats who just missed it and bought

167
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:30,000
the replay. Maybe that
factors, I'm sure they cry.

168
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,970
Make a nice second round of
money on that replay. Right?

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,990
Like so how long do you think they should
hold off for like a week or two maybe?

170
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:41,490
Yeah, a week. A week. And then put the
highlights on. Sure. Do they do that?

171
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,510
Did they ever show,

172
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,400
I get this weird impression that they
only show like right after the finish on

173
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:50,640
the Instagram now know they have, they'll
show entire fights on Instagram now,

174
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,770
but old fights like all the fights. Yeah,

175
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,300
so like pretty sure they showed
steep bay just pulling off of DC.

176
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,050
Was that the case? That was a crazy,

177
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,380
I got my whole phone got blown up cause
apparently I'm right in the background

178
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,120
when that happens. Like
going, I don't know,

179
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:11,070
I haven't seen it but my phone blew
up right there. That fight was chaos.

180
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,440
That would fight was Kay. I was fun.
I had an amazing time. That car,

181
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,410
I should say the car fight card was chaos.

182
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,320
That was a wild one man and a Anaheim.

183
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,270
It was hard watching TC get hit
with those fucking body shots.

184
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,810
That was dude. As soon as he started
pigging in it was like, oh wow,

185
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:31,830
something's happening dude. Steve Bay's
nasty. He wanted that belt by shots.

186
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,390
He took incredible know.

187
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,170
We were talking about Yo the shots Steve
Bay took and just walked through him

188
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,080
like wow.

189
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,970
It was crazy because DC managed to put
him away with one punch the first time

190
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,490
and say you didn't see coming,
you didn't see it coming.

191
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,570
Everything you got hit with was hard
as hell. But he saw it all coming. Yup.

192
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,470
And he let them get in that little right
in his chest area wet cause that's what

193
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,610
he got that short one
on him that last time.

194
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,700
And that's exactly what
happens if you're not prepared.

195
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,130
If you don't think you're going to get
punched and you relax for a minute and

196
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:01,920
then you get punched by something you
don't see coming, you can get fucked up.

197
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,120
And um,

198
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,650
when you're in a fight with a Greco
Roman wrestler of the caliber of DC knows

199
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:08,640
how to manipulate you.

200
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:12,240
And he just had been manipulated
in perfectly into that right hand.

201
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,860
And it was a beautiful work of art,

202
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,340
but he was never able to hit him
like that in the second fight,

203
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,920
like as cleanly and have
that kind of an effect.

204
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,420
The shots he hit him with were
pretty good shots. But Steve,

205
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,860
I ate them and then you realize, oh,
Steve Bay could take a fucking shot.

206
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:29,370
He just got clipped. He just got
caught. He could take a fucking shot.

207
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,210
And he was there in the fourth
round, which is really impressive.

208
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:36,330
Like in the fourth round, he was
looking good. He recognizes him.

209
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,380
As soon as he touched that in
that liver shot that it was wow.

210
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,880
Something happened there and it hit him.

211
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,490
He dug in like four or
five straight times.

212
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:47,910
Man cannot let a guy like that punch
you in the lever that many times.

213
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:51,530
I'm sure DC obviously didn't want him to
do that, but that's how good Steve is.

214
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,080
It was like the DC though. Yeah.
Respect to DC. I love that guy. Agrees.

215
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,670
He's one of my favorite people to do
commentary with. Man for sure. He's,

216
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,140
he's the best. He's so fun.
He's hilarious. Like when
thought when Rose Naama,

217
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,800
Eunice, uh, knocked out a
Yani and j check and he's like

218
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,870
[inaudible] that like, that
is what I love. Like he's,

219
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,340
those are forever moments where, you know,

220
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:18,040
he's so free that in the
middle of like this car,

221
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,340
we're calling a world
title fight. He's just DC.

222
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:25,030
He could be himself and it's a,
he's got a great personality man,

223
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,540
and he's in a hell of a fighter and
he was dominating in the first round.

224
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,390
She think he's gone. He
go, he gone go fight again.

225
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:35,140
Probably he's going to want to fight
steep again if I guess, if I really guess.

226
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,300
I mean if he wants to do it again,
he's going to want to fight.

227
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,590
[inaudible] cause he's gonna want to
what? I think the way he described it as,

228
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:45,760
right that wrong that he did.
He just didn't fight well,

229
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,690
he didn't listen to his corner. Um,
I think that's what he thinks. Um,

230
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,010
it's like he fought really well in the
first round and then Bob Cook was yelling

231
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:57,190
at him in the second round, keep
your damn hands up, you know?

232
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:59,200
And he was like walking him down,

233
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,600
like almost like disdainfully
like walking him down.

234
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,290
And I don't know if that
was part of strategy to
psychologically put up a lot of

235
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,310
pressure on Steve Bay, you know, to
try to establish that's DBAs done that.

236
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,010
He's the champ now, but it
was almost like disdainful.

237
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,240
But Steve Bay survived so and he just
was there and he was in there and really

238
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:18,100
good shape and rounds
three in rounds, four.

239
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:21,310
That was what was really
impressive about it. I was amazed,

240
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,940
especially after getting fucked up quite
a bit in that first round. I mean I,

241
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,930
there was a couple of times where I
thought he was going to be fit. Like,

242
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:29,930
like dude, what's going to get him?

243
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,010
DC was all over him in that
first round and when he,

244
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,750
when he picked him up and
dumped him, you're like,

245
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:38,620
Jesus Christ [inaudible] Jesus Christ.
He's good. He just didn't maintain it.

246
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,910
That's exactly what it was. And then
Steve Bay made the adjustment and um,

247
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,880
you know, who the fuck knows?
He might decide, you know what,

248
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,160
my body doesn't want to
do this anymore. I'm done.

249
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,700
I know he made a ton of money and I know
he's really good as a commentator and

250
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,710
he'll, he'll do that forever for sure.

251
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,870
Or he might don't want
to do it one more time,

252
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,530
but then there's always John Jones,
Roy lurking, man, John, John,

253
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,620
you haven't felt like everybody knows
like that's the biggest rivalry in MMA,

254
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,330
isn't it? Isn't it? Yeah. I
mean the only thing you got,

255
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,200
like if you're going to talk
about accolades of of Cormey A's,

256
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,210
he has everything, all those champions,
but there's the little asterisk on the,

257
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:23,240
on the light heavyweight belt that he
never really got it from Ryan John,

258
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,810
but that's the weird part about it,
right? It's like when you're a champion,

259
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:29,080
but to champion who's the real champion
didn't lose it and then they have an

260
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,670
interim champ. Like
what are we doing here?

261
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,490
What has happened is he got an accurate,

262
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,520
John never come back and shown
that he's still him like,

263
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:40,470
and hopefully God willing for him keeping
all this stuff together and there's,

264
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,593
yeah,

265
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,260
it would have been different if he just
kind of fade into the distance then.

266
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,670
Then it changes that narrative.
But he came back and he,

267
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,690
his original thing was like, you
that guy. I'm that guy still. Yeah.

268
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,510
It was crazy. I mean, dude, that's
how crazy good John is. Really?

269
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,180
That's how crazy good John is.
I'd love to see that though.

270
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,910
And the way DC was able to beat
rumble twice rumbled to me,

271
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,950
it was always that smart too, Scott.
That's my dude. That's my dude.

272
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,690
He's so ferocious. His punching.
It's so fucking explosive, man.

273
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,400
He's just got so much power.

274
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:17,540
When he knocked out Glover to share
it with one punch, I was like, God.

275
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,970
Like who though? When I
first met him, he was,

276
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,600
he was a much smaller dude
when he's 2170 yeah. Yeah.

277
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,630
He used to work out with some friends
of mine that we used to work out in this

278
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,690
little MMHG and it was off
Melrose and, and Labrea,

279
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,170
I think it was called l a m m a at the
time or something like that. And He,

280
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,260
before he wound up in Colorado,
I think, you know. But you know,

281
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,080
I've known him through the
wild man. He's a good dude,

282
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:41,180
meticulously powerful and
he's a really nice guy. Yeah,

283
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:44,430
it's good to his fucking powers.
Preposterous though. Like,

284
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,960
but it was him and then when I seen him
come back in to two oh five that's what

285
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,060
I was, yeah, just mine. I was like,

286
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,870
what the people at two oh five but
it was interesting man. It's his,

287
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,030
his retirement was like one of
the most honest and like a f.

288
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,820
It was like, he was like happy
with it cause he was like, man,

289
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:05,390
I'm not a fighter. I'm my athlete. I
just, I'm just good at this. I was like,

290
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,770
wow, that's really, that's,
that's interesting. Interesting.

291
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,210
Waitrose weed now and raises dogs
and like spreads fringe bulldogs.

292
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,400
She just had it grappling competition
against this Guy Craig Jones, who's this?

293
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:22,760
A Brazilian Jujitsu guy from
Australia that's a murderer,

294
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,550
is a leg lock specialist to
an economy in a leg lock.

295
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,660
It's crazy to see how big he is.
Rumbles like fucking, I don't know,

296
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:33,440
he's gotta be like 260 pounds.
Like No. Bullshit was huge.

297
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,210
I seen him. We sat next to a fight.

298
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,470
If life not the last fight I went to
whatever the one last week before that in

299
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:43,100
Vegas probably. He looks like a
fucking super heavyweight. He's so big.

300
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,750
It's ridiculous. Yeah.

301
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,540
He just not even thinking about
losing weight for fighting anymore.

302
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,470
I would wonder what would happen if you
decided to come back as a heavyweight,

303
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,150
like no bullshit as a
heavyweight. If that guy, I mean,

304
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,420
you know crazy would be if that guy
wound up winning the heavyweight title,

305
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,190
like you're thinking of the rumble career.

306
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:05,960
He wins the ultimate fighter as a one
70 gets all the way up to one 85 can't

307
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:09,830
make one 85 misses weight. Right.
Misses it for the veto of Belfort fight,

308
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:10,970
I believe. A big fight.

309
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,290
Then he goes up the light heavyweight
even goes up to heavyweight foot beat

310
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,330
Andre or Lawsky in,

311
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,080
I think it was the PFL and I
think it really beat him badly.

312
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,380
If I remember correctly, it
got broke. He broke his jaw so,

313
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:28,610
and then that was at heavyweight.
That was at heavyweight in the PFL.

314
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,190
It wasn't in the UFC and then
it comes back to the UFC.

315
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,800
It comes back to the UFC as
a light heavyweight and just

316
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:40,340
line and people see him hit people.
They just go, Whoa, that guy. Scary.

317
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,550
Tiny too. Excellent timing. You know he,

318
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:48,551
it was just power rumble Johnson UFC
return could be on cards if the price is

319
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,960
right. Yeah. That was when [inaudible].

320
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,720
This is from recently? Yeah, after
his grappling matching thing. Yeah,

321
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,660
July two months ago. Two months
ago. It's so big right now.

322
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,030
I would think you'd fight
heavyweight heavyweight.

323
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,210
Him and I mean I really
think he's Harriman's tpa.

324
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:08,330
He was torturing his body for so long
to make one 70 I never saw anybody lose.

325
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,960
When you got two 78

326
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,360
that's a hundred pounds
over where he fought.

327
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,490
It is a 100 pound gain that is so crazy.

328
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,450
A hundred pounds more than what he weighed
in when he won the ultimate fighter.

329
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,370
That's insane. That's
insane. God bless. Oh God.

330
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,960
Two 78

331
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,450
oh my God. 170 on my God.

332
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,960
He was 170 170 pound champion
becomes a 278 pound heavyweight.

333
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,150
And it tells us like, where did he,
how did you do that? Where is it?

334
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,600
It's crazy. That guy's power is
fucking undeniably preposterous.

335
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,070
What do you make of Brock? Uh, try
to pick a fight with John Ball. Oh,

336
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:56,110
that's so silly. That's
not, let's just talk.

337
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,860
What else can I say about a rumble?
Is that even though rumble was that,

338
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,480
that good and that scary DC
handled that man DCAD a hard shot.

339
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,890
Got Him to the ground. That was rumbold
he's one seventies very thin now he's,

340
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,600
he know her most,

341
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,410
but d c was the guy who managed to handle
that and that d c is seemingly easily

342
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,440
say pawn. He was the only
one that can handle him.

343
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,920
I didn't think that was going to go
that way. Like I said, that was my dude.

344
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:26,040
So I was rooting heavy for him. Wow. D's.

345
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,280
He's a special guy when it
comes to wrestling. He's
especially talented and um,

346
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,260
I think wrestlers, they know where
they stand in the wrestling food chain.

347
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,130
And when you get gripped by a
dude like DC, like, oh Jesus,

348
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,930
this is a Olympic caliber
wrestling, that's beast mode.

349
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,170
He just started smashing and he was able
to run his way through the heavyweight

350
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:49,540
division. You've got to realize
before he lost his steep a fight,

351
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,440
he'd only lost one round ever at
heavyweight. Really? Arguably.

352
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,610
And that was to Josh Barnett.

353
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,490
I think that was like one round
that he lost on the cards.

354
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,400
And Josh Barnett is a, you know, a legend,

355
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,440
a fucking the youngest ever [inaudible]
the youngest ever UFC heavyweight

356
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:09,220
champion. Josh Barnett,
brilliant guy to do.

357
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:13,570
You know Josh got personally no
fucking brilliant guy, brilliant guy.

358
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,490
So that's the last round
the DC had ever lied,

359
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,240
lost like one round as a heavyweight.

360
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:22,330
He was just dominating people with
his wrestling and his hand speed.

361
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,110
He was just fucking people up. But it
just, that's how good Steve Bay is, man.

362
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,690
People slept on steep bay. You know,

363
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:30,520
people thought the DC was
going to run him over again.

364
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,670
Like you've ran him over the
first time. And, uh, you know,

365
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:38,050
I think DC prepared for a long and arduous
fight, but Steve pays a big, big man,

366
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,560
big giant heavyweight man. He's a long,

367
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:45,100
tall dude along frame and DC weighed
more than him during the fight.

368
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:47,650
I think he weighed like six pounds
more than them, something like that.

369
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,720
But it's just built, it's a
just, just very different way.

370
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,110
Come in like 20 or 30 pounds. Last
and last time he came in less. Yeah.

371
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,330
I don't know if it was 20
pounds, but I think it was,

372
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,920
he was like two 30 in this fight. I
think DC was two 36. So DC came in,

373
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:05,440
light two came in lighter
than their first fight.

374
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,920
But I think uh, you know, Steve,

375
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,630
Pete came in after like a whole
year of waiting for this rematch.

376
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,400
Like trying to figure it out
if it's ever going to happen.

377
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,760
Is DC gonna Fight Brock
Lesnar and Jesus, you know,

378
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:23,170
it's like he was always waiting and then
finally they gave him the chance to see

379
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:27,520
him. I hate to see DC lose. I
hate it. It's hard to watch, man.

380
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:30,250
He's such a nice guy. It's, it's hard.

381
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,430
As much as I liked that guy
to see him get hit, it's hard.

382
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,570
But you take all that stuff out and
just look at it as two athletes.

383
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,890
And what Steve Bay did was just brilliant
that the whipping of that left hook to

384
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:45,420
the body was just textbook
man tax book. Do you see,

385
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,410
was fighting an amazing fight up until
that, until that he gassed a little bit.

386
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:54,070
It looked like to me and the liver shots
started happening. You know, it's also,

387
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,750
you got to appreciate the technique the
way Steve Bay through that left Hook was

388
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,260
perfect. I mean it was just,
these are brilliant shots.

389
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,450
There's no wasted movement. The technique
was pinpoint. I mean he just wack.

390
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,340
He just ripped some in there and he caught
DC standing there and he just hit him

391
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:17,020
with a hard left to the body. And then
once he realized he could do that more,

392
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,950
he just continued what they were doing
and then he would go do it again and he

393
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:24,700
got in again and then now dcs in a little
bit of trouble and now he's got to,

394
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,320
he was going to try to do, take him down.

395
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:30,190
Like he's in this spot where it's kind
of still standing with him and he's not

396
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:33,010
down but he's hurting and
so it's how much is he hurt?

397
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,470
He mean he got hit with
hard body shots by the way.

398
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,460
Definitely letting it be known.

399
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,150
Those are brutal and then boom,

400
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:46,390
he starts hitting him up to
the head and drops them. Wow.

401
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,630
That was super impressive. Like
when you're calling a fight,

402
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,440
how often are you looking here and how
often do you like depends on what I can

403
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:57,410
see. I mean what you're saying is a
monitor. Yeah, it depends on how often.

404
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,890
Like I want to see it. If I
could just see. Absolutely.

405
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:01,690
That's why I'm just curious
like you're in PR. I'm not even,

406
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:03,970
I'm just saying a percentage wise.
If you were to guess what is,

407
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:07,180
what about a third of the time here
looking at this and the rest of time you

408
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:11,560
probably up here? Yeah, maybe
less than a third on the monitors.

409
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:16,540
I try to stay off the monitors, the
monitors, all I want to see, you know,

410
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,270
I want to see what's happening, but
they're like, if they're off to the side,

411
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,740
like pressed up against the cage,

412
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:23,460
then I kind of have to go to the
monitors because I need to see like I'm

413
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,070
comparing it to like an experiences
like ringside experience where I'm like,

414
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,070
how often I'm like about a third of the
time I feel like I'm looking at watching

415
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:32,410
the screen and the screens, you know
what I mean? Just because I want to,

416
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,970
there are there on the ground and I
want to see what's going on with her,

417
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:38,320
with the arm that I can't see. You know
what I mean? That kind of thing. Yeah.

418
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,450
Yeah. It's a wild fucking sport, man.

419
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,730
So while I was trying to
figure it out the other day,

420
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:45,860
I think I've been the like maybe 60

421
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,600
UFC. He's, man, Jeez,

422
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,150
surprise. I think so dude.

423
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:54,151
If I think back to the years and when I
met Dana and chuck and like ever since

424
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:57,740
that day, it's like anyone, I called up
and you know, I'm, I'm blessed and that,

425
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,110
you know, I get to go. And when I was
single dude, I, you know, when I was,

426
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:04,690
when it was those days, it
was a whole different game.

427
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:07,660
I'd be at almost every one cause
a lot, most of them were in Vegas.

428
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,680
So it would be, uh, it would
be easy to get there. Yeah.

429
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,650
Those are fun experiences, man.

430
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,990
Trying to figure out how to pull up
on Abu Dhabi, man. Are you really,

431
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:20,920
I'm trying and I'm trying to figure out
do I just buy a ticket and go or do I

432
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:22,110
figure out how so yo,

433
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,000
any promoter out there that
wants to Mudd jump around action,

434
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,390
Holler at me. You know what I mean?

435
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:31,070
I'm just trying to pull up on the
Abu Dhabi fight and have that,

436
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,410
I'm going to be watching
that one from here.

437
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,850
We're going to probably do
a fight companion for that
and one day I want to be

438
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,790
invited to one of those. You got to come
to one of those. Those are ridiculous.

439
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,340
Yeah. No that's their foreign trust. Try
not to get into conspiracies. No, no,

440
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,890
I'm, I'm well aware. Try to keep
anywhere from the Illuminati. Right.

441
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,730
This is the only way it goes south. But
even that it's fun. It's always fun.

442
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,120
It's like the best thing in the world is
like watching fights with friends and,

443
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,450
and laughing. No, I've watched it.
Good combination of things. Yeah.

444
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,270
It's a fun thing. My most
favorite way to watch fights,

445
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,290
turn the fan down at the
house. Y'all up. You man,

446
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,320
you could say things you
just can't say. You know,

447
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:18,330
you could talk about things you
absolutely never otherwise talk about it.

448
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,280
And you could describe
things with language, like
the whole, all the language.

449
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,210
You could use all the language. You know
like when I'm doing the UFC for shit,

450
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,660
like little kids are listening to
this, which is kind of weird, right?

451
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,270
Like if you say fuck, that's bad.
But if they watch someone get beat,

452
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,530
the fighter can say it though.
I mean, you know what I mean?

453
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:38,090
The fighter could say it. Yeah.

454
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,770
I think our think appropriately
and intelligently placed.

455
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,360
It wouldn't be out of line, but you
couldn't overdo it or overuse it.

456
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,060
It would have to be like, you'd
have to like pick that. Perfect.

457
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,160
The problem is it,

458
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,290
it gets in the way of
uh, doing the commentary,

459
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,370
right. You're just,

460
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,320
any decision that you would make to use
that kind of language would get in the

461
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:07,850
way. The commentary because
it, it would be like,

462
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,750
it would be less effective. Like
they would go, ah, this guy.

463
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,470
Like why do you have to
use it? They're true.

464
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,380
And they'd be like judgment of like,
when do you use it, why you use it? It's,

465
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,600
and then they would like think less of
what you have to say or be upset by what

466
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:23,450
you have to say. And that
would be the number one thing.

467
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,590
If you're trying to do commentary,

468
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:26,840
the number one thing you're trying
to do is take yourself out of it.

469
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,950
Like I'm trying to do that.

470
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,070
I'm just trying to like use the best
language possible to express my excitement

471
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:36,830
for what we're about to see. Like
this is what's important to me.

472
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:39,440
Like I just wanna I'm fucked.
This is how fucking pumped I am.

473
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:43,250
These guys are murderers. This is going
to be fascinating to see. Yo Romero.

474
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,010
Paulo Kosta,

475
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,640
what the fuck? That's exactly what we
were talking in the car on the way down.

476
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,500
I was watching that fight like
this, like this. This is me.

477
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:54,750
Like Jason's like it's like one of
those fights we just waiting for some

478
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,680
Creighton did, did the beatings. They
were giving each other. It was crazy man.

479
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,660
Fucking too chiseled.

480
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,960
Granted looking motherfucker
in a Gucci model.

481
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,920
Going to be in a Gucci
model ad next week for sure.

482
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,940
And she doesn't put pick him up
there. Crazy. The guy's beautiful.

483
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,680
They're both giant beautiful men with
the incredible bodies. It was a man.

484
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:21,180
The fight was fucking fantastic and it
was so highly skilled that Paula Kosta

485
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,600
guy is for real man. He's for
real. If he can do that too.

486
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:29,070
Yo l if he could stay on top of Yo
l like that Yo else explodes on.

487
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:33,450
Everyone explodes on everyone.
But that dude weathered the storm.

488
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,910
He weathered the storm and
he landed some great shots.

489
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,410
It was a very close fight though,

490
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,150
cause EOL hit him with some big shit too
and EOL took him down twice. You know,

491
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,320
we were, we were, you know,

492
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:47,910
it was my 50th sat Sunday so we were
out Saturdays and Sundays already again.

493
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,190
Oh, slideshow. [inaudible] yes sir.
It's lunch. Yeah. So like, you know,

494
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,380
we were going Yo old guy rep, you know
what I mean? You know, for the rep,

495
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:58,710
for the old guys, you know. And so
we were going hard for yo out bro.

496
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,740
He wins best body at
42 all over the world.

497
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,950
The guy's a monster. I mean who,

498
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:10,370
who has more like athletic length
of their elite career than UL?

499
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:16,050
Because at 42 he still moves like he
moved 10 years ago. Is he 42 two is it,

500
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:18,270
you know what I'm saying?

501
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,890
Cuban birth certificate
fee like 48 you know what,

502
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:24,870
that's what they say about
that. Louis or t's guy,

503
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,910
you know that elite
heavyweight boxer from Cuba.

504
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,180
[inaudible] trouble from all my
friends, Cuban friends for that.

505
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,750
[inaudible] my ball Cypress guy.

506
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,960
I had him on the podcast
with Joey Diaz translating.

507
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,190
It was amazing man to hear
him tell his stories in Cuban.

508
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:44,610
I just wish I spoke Spanish. I could
understand it like coming from his mouth,

509
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,700
but having Joey translate it and talk
about all the shit that he had to deal

510
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:50,830
with coming up through the Cuban
amateur sisters in your pocket.

511
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,160
Look at that dude. I gotta
Watch it cause I don't,

512
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,490
I don't want that one got bought
and built. That is preposterous.

513
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,530
That is one of them sculpted things
you buys at toys r us, right?

514
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,320
[inaudible] that's an action figure
for sure. Look like a real live human.

515
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:08,720
He's so bad, man.

516
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,570
That is so freakishly athletic
and so powerful. And you know,

517
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,510
it's that Cuban wrestler
system and he, he just,

518
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:21,380
the way he described it as like
[inaudible] new and doing my chain,

519
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,300
you just become a fucking machine. And
that's what he is with competition.

520
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:30,870
He's just a machine man. Yeah, he was
clowning too in the second two rounds.

521
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:33,000
Like that's why I was like,
Kinda felt like, you know,

522
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,550
we was trying to get that guy to
be emotional and make a mistake.

523
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,130
You don't for sure. But it was like
he again, he finished, he got here.

524
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:42,100
I mean he got the best of him
in those two rounds in my book.

525
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,610
I thought he wanted close, close. Not
Bad enough to be like bitching about it,

526
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:48,610
but like I would've flipped
the 29, 28 personally. Well,

527
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:53,260
the audience agreed with you when
they, uh, they were crazy. Yeah.

528
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,800
Which is unfortunate because Paula Kosta
just fought and amazing fight and he

529
00:29:56,801 --> 00:30:01,060
has to feel like shit during the, the
post [inaudible] it sucks. I don't,

530
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:03,360
I don't condone bullying any
of that stuff that doesn't,

531
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:05,410
that most of the people that would
be, would never get in that ring.

532
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:07,510
I would never get in that
ring. You ain't got no money.

533
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:09,640
I got and I've made a lot
of money and I'd kind of,

534
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:14,080
McGregor hasn't gotten enough
money from your kid. Okay.

535
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:18,880
You got the a hundred billion. Yeah,
man. I'm like my consciousness, you know,

536
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:21,100
I'm not getting in with Mike
Tyson for any money, you know,

537
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,760
cause the problem is there's a lot of
recipients on the wrong side of things.

538
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,950
For sure. The problem is they're blowing
the decision. It wasn't his decision.

539
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:34,660
It was thought as hard out and it
wasn't that ridiculous as my point too.

540
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:37,420
Like it was like I would have
flipped it, but hey, okay. No, it's,

541
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,910
I can see how that could be seen 100%.

542
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,680
And you're a guy who has been
live to 60 fucking you. Fcs. Yeah.

543
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,613
Let's just, um,

544
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,610
I don't know what the woo thing is that's
happened in the last couple of years.

545
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,300
Woo. Like it's just like the whole
crowd starts, it's just like,

546
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,570
I just get excited. That's new. That's
like, I wasn't around a long time ago.

547
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,200
Anyway, some soccer thing, they probably
stole it from soccer spoon. It's like,

548
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:06,370
it's like animals answering each other and

549
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,990
communicating by with the wounds.
Dude, I never even thought of that.

550
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,720
That's so true. The Woo. That's
a new thing. Yeah. I mean, no,

551
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,900
that's five or six. Yeah. Right. What
was that like? It started when it,

552
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,780
you know what?

553
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,980
When's the first time it popped up
down south like a Kentucky or a North

554
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,990
Carolina? That's when I feel
like I heard it first like,

555
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,400
you know that might be Rick
flair. That might be a wreck.

556
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,750
It might be a ric flair. Is that
what that is? Oh yeah man. Dude,

557
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:34,690
that would make a lot now you fucking
solved the mystery for me that I'd make.

558
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:38,050
That would make sense if we can get
some confirmation on that. Somehow.

559
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,110
Someone asked this question
on Reddit. Someone says,

560
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:43,600
you've been talking about Rick Flair
so much that they might've picked it up

561
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,434
from you.

562
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,530
I don't know if this is some bizarro
moment where it all connected like,

563
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,390
oh shit. I started that. Listen, guys
like that are important to America.

564
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,950
That guy's such, he's such a
character in his prime with his suits.

565
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,950
Jet Flying Alligator,
wherein I was a WCW guy, man,

566
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:09,520
and Rick flare was the
man dude. He was a like,

567
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,230
he's a character that made his way
into what a thousand rap songs.

568
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,050
How many rap songs have Rick do?
There's a whole like, like, um,

569
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,930
hip hop subculture involved
with wrestling. Like, I mean,

570
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,930
I, I was like these cats that I'm,
we're actually fans of Westside,

571
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:30,280
Gunn and Conway and this kid penny, they
got this record label called Grizelda,

572
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,070
but the,

573
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,070
the west side gun kid is like
a fucking wrestling fanatic.

574
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,470
Like is more like, he's like involved.
I think he's involved with like the

575
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,210
WWE like doing merge and stuff like that.

576
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,370
Cause I see him putting shit together
that's like definitely gotta be licensed.

577
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,760
So Yo, it's,

578
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,220
there's this whole subculture of
like this of wrestling and, and,

579
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,750
and hip hop going on right now.

580
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:57,140
So it's definitely made its way into
standup to now, you know, they have this,

581
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,220
uh, podcast, the store horseman where
they all just talk about pro wrestling,

582
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:03,480
a bunch of comics, Tony Hinchcliffe
and these comments. Who,

583
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,250
who's on that store? Horsemen. Jeremiah
walk-ins, right? Who else? No, he's not.

584
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,200
I'm giving out false fake news.
Fake News. That's fake news. Um,

585
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,260
but it's not fake news and this
delicious, by the way. It's very good.

586
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:20,150
It's delicious. Buffalo Trace. I
ain't mad at companies from 1773 son.

587
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,850
They started in 1773 did you really
tell sold whiskey during prohibition for

588
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,070
additional medicinal purposes? I didn't
know that. Well, I didn't, but I would,

589
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,080
I'm not shocked at this company.

590
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,700
Kept making whiskey all through the
prohibition. Legally or illegally.

591
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:42,590
Yeah. From medicine. So people that, you
know, I'm gonna need a little medicine.

592
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,940
I just got a slew of new
whiskeys. Here it is birthday.

593
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,590
It's a Tony Hinchcliffe, Johnny
[inaudible], Curtis, Matt Edgar,

594
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,490
Josh Martin. That's right. I hope
I said it's Curtis's last name.

595
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,710
Ryan does that. Right? So I say that
sounds like it. Yeah. Anyway. Um,

596
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,090
so comics are really into pro wrestling
too. They even go live. These dorks,

597
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,110
they fly out to like Wrestlemania and
they go in the audience name live. Same,

598
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:12,980
same, same, same. Yeah. It's
become like a, not like a,

599
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,220
it's become a thing
that people like to do,

600
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,690
like to go to these big wrestling
events and groups of people,

601
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,780
whether it's musicians or
rappers, hip hop or stand ups.

602
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,010
They're going like for sure.
Experiencing it. Yeah, exactly.

603
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:29,390
It's like the concert experience.

604
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,630
Why are rappers rappers so
obsessed with Rick Flair?

605
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,190
Because he's got like 40 rolodexes

606
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:42,620
that one famous rant that
he went on limousine riding.

607
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:46,150
Jet Flying. Exactly. You
know that kind of sure.

608
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,890
All eight when that
happened and they saw, yes,

609
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,930
that's everything I want
and in the universe it's
insane. Yeah. You see him now.

610
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:57,830
I mean the guy still gets love
everywhere. He goes, you know,

611
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,710
like I did in my special where I said,

612
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,980
you know Rick Flair and then I put
the microphone out to the audience.

613
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:08,540
The audience goes, Woo, Julie's,
you started that shit then dude,

614
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:12,110
you started the wounds.
I don't think I did.

615
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,400
I think it was already going on. I
think everybody appreciates this guy.

616
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:18,980
It's like as you get up, we can't
play this right. We get in trouble,

617
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,830
but this is the, as you, you
know, you get older, you,

618
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,250
you see things like this,

619
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:28,070
you appreciate them for what they are
like you could think they're cheesy when

620
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:31,460
you're young, but then as you get older
you go, damn, that's fucking awesome.

621
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,010
The fact that that guy is this task
as earth. Amazing, beautiful golden

622
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,180
mullet when those crazy sunglasses saying
this all saying all this nutty show,

623
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:46,620
pinky ring dude man, that's an
artist. That guy's an artist.

624
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,920
Look at us. That's the male soap opera
forever. Since back when children, man,

625
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,030
you know what I mean?

626
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,830
When I was a kid it was Bob Backlund and
Jimmy superfly snuck a and iron chic.

627
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,480
I don't know if you could have really
grown up in America as a little boy and

628
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:07,810
not had a phase at some point where
you interacted with one of these rounds

629
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:13,010
where your organization's WCW or WWF when
I was growing up and if you were like

630
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:17,770
one of those kids is really into like
all music and indie groups, you know you,

631
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:22,680
you would go for some like fucking
killer Kowalski Shit. You talk to taker,

632
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,730
you would go, you would try to find some
people that were off the beaten path.

633
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,920
Like do you know about this
wrestling organization?

634
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,860
Cause there's a bunch of like
weird little tiny dude when I was,

635
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:36,180
when the house of pain like was like
early on. Like, you know, but you know,

636
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:38,700
we were already experiencing
pretty good success.

637
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:43,680
Like ECW had formed a crazy
extreme championship wrestling.

638
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:46,530
I think that's what it stood for out of
Philadelphia and they invited us to a

639
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,420
bunch and it was the
first time I ever really,

640
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,010
and I know it had happened before,

641
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,780
but their whole show was
about cats cutting their
faces open and bleeding during

642
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:57,450
matches and shit. It was insanity man.

643
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,240
And they had packed houses. I mean,

644
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:03,510
I think dude bought it up like Vince
McMahon bought it up and the guy who owned

645
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:07,380
it or ran it became one of the like
characters within it that I believe I've,

646
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,210
it's been a long time. I'm old now.

647
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:13,920
I'm 50 do you see what Ronda Rousey did
to her finger? I saw that yesterday.

648
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,820
How about that man? They glue that thing
together and she went back to work.

649
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,660
How about if I read it
right? She finished the tape.

650
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:27,060
She finished the take and ignored it
until it was over and they overshadows how

651
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:29,460
bad it was. Guys. She
goes to the hospital,

652
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,320
they put it back together again and then
she goes back and finishes gangster.

653
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:38,640
Dude. That's dedication. Not a
lot of humans. It's also like,

654
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,500
I don't want to fight anymore. I'm
going to go finish this movie. You know,

655
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,100
nobody wants to cut the weight
once they're done, went on.

656
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,430
I don't want to come back to that shit.

657
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,040
That's just the mindset of an
elite combat sports for short.

658
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,180
She just had that mindset.

659
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:54,210
There's not a whole lot of humans
that would dealt with that that way.

660
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,880
That's crazy. The ladies
made out of bullets.

661
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,840
I'm going on my workman's comp from
my sad gaff co-insurance and yeah,

662
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,350
you're shutting down production son.
We ain't finishing no scenes. What?

663
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,410
Chopped off a superstars
finger. Yeah, Jesus Christ.

664
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:13,350
What if she lost her finger? What if
it was like, I mean, how far? I mean,

665
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:16,800
it wasn't fall. I mean, yeah,
that's a fuck without the,

666
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:20,220
the super expert surgeons that's gone.

667
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,390
Speaking of which do last
last, I think it happened.

668
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:26,860
I don't know if we talked about it and
it might've been after the last time it

669
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:27,570
was on. Dude.

670
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:31,680
So I'm on a trip and I'm coming home
literally about to get on the plane and I

671
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:35,010
get this text from my
wife. Like I'm, I'm at the,

672
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:41,410
I got a, I chopped off my finger
and I'm like, in my head I'm like,

673
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,560
she didn't chop off her
finger meds. I cut her,

674
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,470
probably got pretty rowdy but stitches.
I was like, okay, it's pretty bad.

675
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:50,080
I was, I right. I'm about it. It was like
about a three hour flight home. Sorry.

676
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,640
I know I'll be there as soon as I can.

677
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,720
So I get there and I pick her up from
the hospital and she's got the big thing

678
00:38:55,721 --> 00:39:00,010
on and I get the story of, she was getting
in the shower and we have, you know,

679
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,230
big glass swinging shower
door and she fucking like,

680
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,490
she was like getting
in and like, you know,

681
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,810
holding onto like edge real quick as
the door slam shut on it and just locked

682
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:12,910
off the fucking whole like to the knuckle

683
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,250
basically. They put that shit
back on, fixed it up a little bit.

684
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,460
It looks pretty fucking good
now. But that was crazy.

685
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:25,020
Now you just reminded me of it with
the whole Ron arousing years or so.

686
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,880
It's amazing that they
don't break more often.

687
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,360
They're so gentle much it would
be over like if that part of my,

688
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:36,390
this finger like this is the
guitar on the fret hand like that.

689
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:39,160
If I lost that part of
that finger, um, I got,

690
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:42,550
it's going to take me four or five years
to learn how to play with just these,

691
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:47,850
at least my friend Paul was closing a
window and it shattered and cut his finger

692
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,850
and cut through the
tendons and his fingers,

693
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:55,630
like permanently curled and he had a bunch
of operations to try to straighten it

694
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:58,510
out, but then eventually just gave up.
They could never straighten it out.

695
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,890
It never gained like full
range of motion from a window.

696
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:07,310
Like it's so delicate. All this
stuff is so delicate and you know,

697
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,400
that's why it's great.
That's got flight on mine,

698
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:13,840
so ridiculous us a glass
door, not sharp really.

699
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:17,290
I went home and looked at it and like
it was pretty beveled on the edges,

700
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:21,610
but the weight of it just lopped
off the fucking thing or like crazy.

701
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,000
She was pretty gangster though. I
have to say she was pretty gangster.

702
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,890
What do you think of that scene or
putting his hand in that fucking pulling

703
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,080
thing actually posted. I
don't, I don't, I think she,

704
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,850
I don't think it's on her Instagram.

705
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:38,830
She posted the tip of her finger in
the plastic bag as she took it to the,

706
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,660
Oh my God. Oh, you're in God's
little dude. Chip ice in the bag.

707
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,170
Oh Jesus Christ. They couldn't reattach,
but they, it was like they, uh,

708
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,650
were able to like extend
it somehow and like,

709
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,620
and that luckily the dude out right there,

710
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,100
there's a dude who was an expert
at hand plastic surgery and wow.

711
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,630
Hooked her shit up. Like it looks like
relative, this looks pretty normal.

712
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:06,070
Something happens to your skin. Like if
your finger gets chopped off at the end,

713
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:09,880
there's a way to make it grow back,
right. Isn't there, am I making this up?

714
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,380
It seems like, I remember there was,

715
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,220
there's a way where if something happens
to your tip of your finger, oh yeah.

716
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:18,170
If you don't get the bulk and
it, yeah, I've heard that.

717
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:19,330
I think they said something like that,

718
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:21,930
but I get got hurt pink hot
piece of her bone just wow.

719
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,600
That's why I'm saying it's so shocking
at how it just locked it up clean like a,

720
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:32,200
it's like a angle like whip and wow.
You like that sound effect. Yeah. Whip.

721
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,400
I keep thinking that one day they're
going to come up with a artificial Luke

722
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,610
Skywalker type hands and that people
are gonna want them instead of regular

723
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:41,960
hands. That's what I'm worried about.

724
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,683
Wow.

725
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,370
If they came up with an arm, it would
sound like metal or metal. Unless you,

726
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:53,120
if you had the skin like simulation.
I can play guitar with that.

727
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:56,360
Maybe I'm talking about
self. I do some wild shit.

728
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,980
I'm talking about self healing.
Bulletproof spider silk,

729
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,540
hybrid skin like that. The
government's working on [inaudible].

730
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,390
They're working on that right now.
They're working on some sort of odd,

731
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,170
don't doubt it, man. I, I, I wanna
you want to hear a wild one? Alright,

732
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,950
I went on, you know, one night fucking
smoking. I went on a little youtube,

733
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,650
uh,

734
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,750
warm whole situation and somehow,

735
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,120
I don't even know if it's a
youtube video or someone else,

736
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:24,070
but I wound up on this
video that was like,

737
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:29,071
world's smartest kid thinks that
cern blew the world up in 2008.

738
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,890
All right. And I'm like, what the fuck?

739
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,570
So I go on this video and I'm watching
this video dude, and it's this young kid,

740
00:42:37,571 --> 00:42:40,360
he's like 12 in a month, fuck is
talking, you know, half the, your,

741
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,430
you got to invest like 20 minutes into
this kid's talking about things that are

742
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,550
super smart and it's Kinda like
to show you he's super smart.

743
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,250
You know what I mean? This kid and his
dad is doing the recording I believe,

744
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:51,941
or a relative,

745
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:56,320
somebody very close to them and he goes
into this whole theory of how he thinks

746
00:42:56,321 --> 00:43:01,060
when they collided the
electrons I believe at in the,

747
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:03,490
in the, in the supercollider sorry,

748
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,760
that they cause some crazy chain
reaction that blew up the universe.

749
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,330
But they also weighed,

750
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,380
they created an Adam that
weighed too much and he has,

751
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,520
oh the first 20 minutes is also
explaining infinite parallel universes.

752
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,200
So what the kid winds up with this,

753
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:25,201
this theory of like one Adam weighing
too much and way and is that being just

754
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:30,571
enough to shift our universe
into a parallel universe
yet this is it right here.

755
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,650
So this guy had, this kid had me
fucked up because after I watched this,

756
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:40,080
everything I saw for months was talking
about like it would be news guy on the,

757
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,390
on the news like I don't know what
universe I'm in anymore or ah,

758
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,960
Spiderman into the spider
verse. Like all these,

759
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,130
everything I saw for like four or five
months after watching this video was like

760
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:56,110
multi-verse shit like shit about multi
versus, and it's got me fucked up.

761
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,580
Joel, I hear you. I'm fucked up man.

762
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,680
Read this kid, look into it.
Says there, he claims it.

763
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:08,680
Cern destroyed the universe doing recent
experiments which has resulted in us

764
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:13,230
living in a nearby parallel
universe instead. Your welcome ETI.

765
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,770
There's a lot of people online.

766
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,260
This is an explanation for all the Mandela
effect finding goes into stuff about

767
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:21,580
the Mandela effect. How that, you know,

768
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:23,590
there's apparently a bunch
of people who think Mel,

769
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,850
Odette Mandela died in prison. And like
there's, you know, and as far as I know,

770
00:44:27,851 --> 00:44:30,520
he was released, became president
in South America, you know,

771
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,840
and that's the universe. I

772
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,960
just personally, you know,
but it's crazy dude. What?

773
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,740
Cause it's not just this video,

774
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,940
it's like you watch it and that Youtube
Algorithm starts sending you down a

775
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:45,150
whole bunch of other, you know what I
mean? You start here and it's like, it's,

776
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,013
and then again,

777
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,620
everything that came out there was all
these shows I would see or movies or

778
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:54,000
news, things about Multa multi-verse all
of a sudden was everywhere around me.

779
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:57,180
It was fucking Nettie Dude. So I'm
fucked up about that shit right now.

780
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,580
If there was something, everything do,

781
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,850
if there was something that they could
do that might open up a door to a

782
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:06,810
parallel universe, you don't think
they would do stranger things you mean?

783
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,360
Yeah, I'd say that's because stranger
things, I mean, things are strange,

784
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,140
right? Stranger things. Bizarro world.
You know, what's the weirdest one is the,

785
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:20,940
the like the people that
dismiss climate change.

786
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,970
That is the weirdest one to
me because I'm like, what is,

787
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,020
I'm trying to figure out what's the
benefit of dismissing climate change other

788
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:32,970
than if you work for like the oil industry
or something just lost the glacier.

789
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:33,870
Yeah,

790
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:37,800
like they just posted a whole thing of
10 years or 80 like something in the 80s

791
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,290
a glacier picture of it and
just now, and it's gone.

792
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,590
But I'm not even saying
like blaming anybody for it.

793
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,900
I'm saying dismissing it
as an issue. I'm like,

794
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:49,140
let's pretend that people have
nothing to do with it. Let's just,

795
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:53,520
I wish people had nothing to do
with it because then we can go,

796
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:56,370
holy fuck, it's getting
hot. Like how hot is it?

797
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,500
Gonna get like we could
just figure it out.

798
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:00,630
Like if it was just occurred at
this point where it's two degrees,

799
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:04,140
the oceans are hotter than they've been
and she never had people do that where

800
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:05,880
they try to say like,
this is a natural cycle.

801
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,790
This is something some people
still say. Right. Okay.

802
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:10,800
Even if it was just a natural cycle,

803
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:14,700
I wish humans weren't in the equation
at all. So there was no argument.

804
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,450
I wish it would just be like, hey
guys, it's getting really hot.

805
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,780
What the fuck do we do? As if we
had no control over whatsoever.

806
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,380
Not saying that we shouldn't take steps
to fix it and we definitely should,

807
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,240
but I'm saying that if it was impossible
for people to have created it and it

808
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:33,510
was happening around us, maybe we
would be forced to do something.

809
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,560
Maybe we'd be forced to like go to
higher ground, get the fuck out of that.

810
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:41,910
The really hot spots, you know,
make your way towards Canada.

811
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:46,230
Like, I mean maybe that would w what
we would do if there was no other way,

812
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:50,970
but we know that at least part
of what the problem is is people,

813
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,530
at least part of the problem.

814
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,950
But so many people would start th th they
want to start arguments about that and

815
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:58,020
fight that. And to me it's so strange.

816
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:03,000
It's like what's the benefit of
arguing against that? It's happening.

817
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:06,210
I don't understand like it's
happening. You see it getting warmer.

818
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,970
You see the statistics. You see
everybody freaked out though.

819
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:13,020
The Amazon's on fire. If you seen
this. No, it's fucking horrifying.

820
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:17,250
Those photos from self harm, they're
just, and I believe it's purposeful.

821
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,970
I have heard that that is the,

822
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:23,850
that some people are being burned
away on purposes. What I'm, if I,

823
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,090
some of the things I've read or
understood, I won't swear their truth.

824
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,160
Cause again, that's one of the
things what you're saying is,

825
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,200
is you've got to question everything.
Now truth has been compromised man.

826
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,820
You know what I mean? No matter what side
of whatever you are on truth has been,

827
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,770
has been seriously compromised because
there's a counter opinion to everything

828
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:50,070
and if you're not adept enough to
really get involved and find factual

829
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:55,020
information, you can literally
counter any argument there is with,

830
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,540
with something. Oh I said, well I
read this while I read this. Okay,

831
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,490
well that doesn't mean either
one of those things are true.

832
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:02,220
Let's go find the truth.
You know what I mean?

833
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,590
That doesn't exist anymore because
people just want to Google that shit,

834
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,980
get on and move on with
their day, you know, and,

835
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:11,260
and it's laziness on our part and
a lot of people don't want them.

836
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,520
It's like fucking this thing
that everybody's posting
with the Goddamn fucking

837
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:20,510
Instagram. I don't give
you permission. Use Ebay.

838
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,920
I read a whole other thing
that says the average American,

839
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:28,510
I believe signs one or two legal
documents a day without reading them.

840
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:31,000
And just by logging
into shit on your phone,

841
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:34,750
Amazon or Instagram or whatever
you, every time you do that you,

842
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,430
you subscribe and, and, and, and
adhere to their terms and conditions.

843
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,970
And some you think a picture of a
copied and pasted Instagram thing over

844
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:49,780
something that was from Facebook fucking
12 years ago. It's, it's bananas,

845
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,080
bananas. People get roped
into things. You know,

846
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:57,310
one person see smart people posting
in the sand. Better safe than sorry.

847
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:01,690
Like I've seen that too. What argument
is that? They don't know how to Internet.

848
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,310
They don't know how to Internet.

849
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,220
I'm just saying even if just like
you suspect it's wrong, but you know,

850
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:10,960
fuck it anyways. It's like, wait, wait.
That's, if you suspect it's wrong,

851
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,020
take the extra time or
just don't do it at all.

852
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,910
Like what do you mean? I'm just
using that as an example of how,

853
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:21,460
why we're with the state of
things are as they are. Yeah.

854
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:25,810
It's a sneaky little loophole. That's a
sneaky little thing that happens to you.

855
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:29,830
You have to, everybody's posting something
stupid. Did you send it to me? Oh,

856
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:33,460
Everlast sent it to me. It must be legit.
Just post it. You know what I mean?

857
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:35,920
How many times have you done
that? I've done that all the time.

858
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:39,670
I was some clown in it and then
immediately after it Dana came up.

859
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,140
It was him posting the exec they name
with the whole like better safe than sorry

860
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:48,160
thing. Christ, you know
they gone mad. Oh dude,

861
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,200
they got everybody though. They got
that fucking grade Perry guy. Everybody.

862
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,720
Everybody isn't big Perry's
job like fucking protect
the nukes or something like

863
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,730
governor or something posted
to Rick. What did Rick Perry,

864
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,850
they said Rick Perry pub, but, but he
has a specific job in a government.

865
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:09,970
It's like the energy, the energy
secretary. He's like in control. The News,

866
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:14,230
right? Is that what it is? Energy
Secretary? Yeah, you are. I don't know.

867
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,440
Whatever the fuck he is. He's
got a big job and he fell for it.

868
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:24,760
Oh, it's bizarro world when bizarro
world. Maybe that fucking kid is right.

869
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,340
I'm telling you, dude, you're
Yo, you're going to be calling

870
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,090
me in a couple nights like, fuck you
dude. Why did you even tell me about that?

871
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,190
I've really about, I've bounced the
idea of multiple universes many times.

872
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:41,270
We all have, but this kid watch
it. Just you're going to invest it,

873
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:45,920
give it 20 minutes or 1518 minutes,
whatever it is, and then you'll be like,

874
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:50,150
oh wow. It's, it's not that. It's
Oh fact. It's, but it's like, wow,

875
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:54,680
that's super possible. It's super, super
possible. The way he breaks it down.

876
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:59,360
What about this? What if every time
you went to sleep and you woke up,

877
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:02,600
you passed into a nearby,

878
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:06,950
very similar universe,
but not quite the same.

879
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,170
And depending upon your choices
and how you live your life,

880
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,670
it's how you wake up and what new
one you pop into and the other side.

881
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:19,100
And everyone's just a
little bit different.

882
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,910
The whole world changes just a little
bit. Each time you make a decision,

883
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:26,180
one way or another, everything
changes. When you wake up,

884
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,560
you think the world is static because
it is when you're awake and you have no

885
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:34,250
fucking idea what's happening while
you're asleep. And when you wake up again,

886
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,200
you have this foggy recollection of the
past and that's what you're going by.

887
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,090
You're going by every morning, waking up
with a foggy recollection of the past.

888
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,810
That's what you're doing and you're,

889
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:49,280
you're assuming that nothing's
changed and everything static.

890
00:51:49,281 --> 00:51:52,610
And while you were asleep for eight
hours, nothing weird happened.

891
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,640
You know the fuck you're talking about.
You have no idea. You're dreaming.

892
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:57,260
You're crazy fantasies.

893
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,600
It shit weird stuff has happened
and you're fucking mermaids.

894
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:02,920
You're flying through the air on a, uh,
on a helicopter, you know, you don't,

895
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,750
you weird things happen when you're
dreaming. What is all that about?

896
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,350
We don't even know. We have no idea what
that is. That soup of possibilities.

897
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,440
It's fucking swirling around in between
your ears while you're snoring up a

898
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:14,630
storm and then boom, you wake up.

899
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,660
Are you sure those memories are real?

900
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,580
Are you sure that this is in a whole
completely new university you're living in

901
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:26,600
today or simulation or simulation?

902
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,870
There was some ice simulations

903
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:34,520
out on that one right there.
There was some fucking,

904
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,740
another genius super wizard kid
who was talking about that, that,

905
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,060
that something about
simulations. I forget what,

906
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,930
I was high at the house with mom, with
the guy who runs my studio divine and,

907
00:52:44,931 --> 00:52:49,280
and, and, and we were just fucking
laughing, talking shit one day hire like,

908
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:54,170
like what if like I may have heard
this could have been on your show,

909
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,920
I could have read this. So I'm not
claiming like ownership of the thought,

910
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,730
but it was like, what if like we
just come from a universe like this.

911
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:06,170
So perfect and shit and it's boring as
fuck and we just plug in to have all

912
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:08,180
these fucked up like weird problems.

913
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:12,050
And that's why everything's getting
fucking weird or in crazier because like

914
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:14,750
that's kind of why we're here.
That's part of the ride, you know?

915
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:15,980
That could be it.

916
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,570
It could be the only way you
appreciate love is to no hate.

917
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,550
They'll really appreciate it.

918
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,120
And it could be the only way we would
appreciate all the good that we have is to

919
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,370
balance it out with all
the bad that we have.

920
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,070
And when they start to overwhelm
each other one way or the other,

921
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:35,670
there's an imbalance that takes place
and leads to all of our fucking problems

922
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:36,600
as a society.

923
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:42,410
And when you think about how long you're
going to be alive and what it is that

924
00:53:43,741 --> 00:53:45,810
you're doing here and why you're doing it,

925
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,530
you know all those weird questions and
answers that go on inside your head.

926
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,530
It's all you're distributing energy,
right? You're trying to figure out,

927
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:55,260
am I distributing my energy right? My, uh,

928
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,270
am I living my life in a way that is
like the best I can do with what I've got

929
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:03,990
right now. That's it.

930
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,540
All these mind fucks. That's
all you gotta do though.

931
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,640
I mean as even no matter
what we're saying,

932
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:11,430
if you woke up every day and
that was your objective. Yeah.

933
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,440
You couldn't really go or do
much wrong. No, no you can't.

934
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:21,450
And what if every day when you did that
woke up in the nearby universe that was

935
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:25,080
just to live a bit different because
of what you thought and dead dude,

936
00:54:25,081 --> 00:54:27,820
that's like, you know, that's
a movie magic type Shit.

937
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,650
Everlast some movie magic type Shit.

938
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:36,450
I just was like, I tried to be a
not such a glutton. There we go.

939
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,940
Salute Silo DJ Melody over there. I
just wanted to cheers. How bout cheers.

940
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:45,380
Let's go. American guys
sent pictures. Cheers. GJ

941
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,650
Yeah, you gotta you gotta
DJ Bro. The only guy ever.

942
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,270
I didn't see the shooting. I
believe besides myself as honey,

943
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:58,000
honey man. No. [inaudible] I
think they're the only one.

944
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,680
We're the ones that have done music
on the shore. Not totally true.

945
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,740
Is that true? You might be right.
You were definitely the first.

946
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,540
And then Gary Clark brought
his guitar, but we just chill.

947
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,050
I'm a huge fan of that. I think will
brought his guitar the first time.

948
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:16,720
He might not even brought his guitar first
time. Joe Simpson Sturgeon. Yeah. No,

949
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,610
I hung out with him once.
[inaudible] sneaker shop on Melrose.

950
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,750
They have a new song that
he just released. His new
album is fucking incredible.

951
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,350
I got a chance to listen to it in advance
before it's released and they just

952
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,120
released something on youtube.

953
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,890
It's like this Japanese
Anamae with a, what is the,

954
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:38,580
what's the name of the actual video
so people could find it on day two,

955
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,640
sing along, sing along.
It's fucking amazing song.

956
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:46,020
But the video was coolest shit
man. It's all this Japanese anime.

957
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:49,460
So he did all of this, uh,

958
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,760
the did like all these
crazy animations. He's,

959
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,540
that's like a film that takes place
while the album plays. Oh Shit. Yeah.

960
00:55:57,541 --> 00:56:01,590
So it's all coordinated
to the songs. I mean,

961
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,870
he's been working on this shit for ever.

962
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:06,900
He's been flying back and
forth to Japan and La.

963
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:11,940
I mean this is a labor of love.
No, it's like to style. Incredible.

964
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,630
I met him, like I said, my buddy owns
a sneaker shop on mill road and he was,

965
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:20,490
I guess a bit of a sneakerhead himself.
Oh really? Politics. Sturdy Shit.

966
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,840
He's one of my favorite people.

967
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:26,050
I like the stuff to the music that
the country kind of outlawish like,

968
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:29,110
but like big band dish. Yeah. You
know what I love about that guy?

969
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,730
He didn't even try to go for it as a
professional musician until he was like 36

970
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:37,570
his wife talked him into it.
His wife was like, you know,

971
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,410
you don't suck. That's like

972
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:44,110
what? She said, that's, that's
great. That's high praise.

973
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,290
And she's like, you're fucking

974
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,940
good. And he's, and he went for it
for somebody who wakes up with Aaron,

975
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,340
goes to bed with you so you don't suck.
I mean, that's what I praise, you know.

976
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,630
But he had like crazy jobs, like
railroad worker, shit like that.

977
00:56:55,631 --> 00:57:00,460
Like did a bunch of like regular jobs
and just was writing music and singing

978
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:05,050
music. And then she convinced
him to go for it. Yeah.

979
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:07,300
He's an unusual character,
man. This stuff, this,

980
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:11,470
all this new stuff is different.
I, it's like he used to be,

981
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,990
you would think of him as
country, like you can even,

982
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:17,230
you don't even know what to say now
with his new stuff is not country.

983
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:21,650
It's wild though. It's really good.
Check it out. Yeah. It's like it's a,

984
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,990
this kind of hybrid rock thing he's doing,

985
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,760
but it's pretty fucking bad ass.

986
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:31,950
This is Waylon.

987
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:35,340
Waylon had sex with Queens of the
Stone Age while the black keys watched

988
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,500
first comment on the video. Who
said that? Who's named that guy?

989
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:42,000
Top comment shall be Riley.

990
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:46,300
Shelby. Riley, congrats. Congrats. You
won. You won the Internet for the day.

991
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,600
That is exactly what it sounds like. It's
really good stuff. He's a sing along.

992
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:55,130
You said that was good. Yeah. I'm
checking out now. It's doing weird shit.

993
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:59,600
That's the only thing that's doing it,
man. It's, you know, and I, you know,

994
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:03,230
weird shit in the sense of like, Yo shit
that excites you since you said like,

995
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:05,810
you know, you know, don't worry. I'm not,

996
00:58:05,811 --> 00:58:08,300
I've never tried to make the
same thing twice, you know,

997
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:10,760
cause it's like I want to be
excited. I want to be scared to fail.

998
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:12,710
You know what I mean? Yeah. I want
to, I want to be like, you know,

999
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:17,990
oh that didn't work next
time. Yeah. Well you,

1000
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,520
you've always switched shit up.

1001
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:21,950
That's one of the more interesting
things about you. It's like when,

1002
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:27,010
when you were doing what it's like and
when you switched up to like Whitey Ford

1003
00:58:27,981 --> 00:58:31,280
sings the blues, everybody was like, Whoa,

1004
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,120
what is this? Is this is, this is the
jump around. God is the house of pain guy.

1005
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,650
But it it, it was a,

1006
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,760
it felt so easy to digest for most people
because this is before I knew you and

1007
00:58:44,581 --> 00:58:46,920
I was like, it's so easy
because it's so authentic.

1008
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,880
I gets very obvious that this was the
kind of music that you were writing was

1009
00:58:50,881 --> 00:58:55,140
like music that like came from your
feelings and your soul. It was like, wow,

1010
00:58:55,141 --> 00:58:58,310
this is real shit. And
I was 2020 years ago,

1011
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,680
what it's like was a classic.

1012
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:05,490
That was a classic. That was
one of those songs was like,

1013
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,450
that's a heartfelt song.
That's how soul filled song,

1014
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:14,130
you know, that's like a universal
song. Yeah. I went to, uh,

1015
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,161
New York.

1016
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:20,161
I left house of pain and went to New
York with a buddy of mine and was kind of

1017
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,160
sleeping on his couch

1018
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,600
and he had a guitar there.

1019
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:28,190
I started streaming it one night and
singing these little words and he came

1020
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:31,790
Barston out at his room in the
back like, what the fuck is that?

1021
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,590
And kind of was like, we're recording.
That's why we were making a rap record.

1022
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:41,000
I was like there to like just kind of
further the rap career and nobody really

1023
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:44,510
knew I played guitar and stuff like that
a little bit. So, but it was his, his,

1024
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,060
his encouragement. It definitely
came back. Like when he was like,

1025
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:50,630
I think he was with it broad back there
and he just heard the song and jumped

1026
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:54,200
out like, wow, what the fuck
is that? You know what I mean?

1027
00:59:54,201 --> 00:59:55,810
And so the next day he,

1028
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,300
they basically forced me to record
it so I had to finish. Right.

1029
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,180
I had wrote it like that night I
had, I think I had the first part,

1030
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,490
the whole liquor store guy
at the liquor store thing,

1031
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:09,050
but I didn't really have anything else.
But he heard that part and was like, Yo,

1032
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:12,800
we need to finish that. When you get
those ideas, when they come to you,

1033
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:14,390
what does that feel
like? Does it feel like,

1034
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:18,950
like a gift comes out of the universe?
The mouth, the really good ones? Yeah.

1035
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:23,630
You know what I mean? I
mean, what blows my mind,

1036
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:26,220
and I'm gonna flip it on you
real quick, is, is the, the,

1037
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:32,170
the comic art arc of you get to work this
thing out for a whole long time and if

1038
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:36,320
you're really successful
on your level type thing,

1039
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,790
then you shoot a special and
that joke kind of goes away.

1040
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:43,370
You can't, you know, really
get to tell that anymore.

1041
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,450
And that blows my mind because like my
whole thing is like work this thing out

1042
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:50,360
and build this thing that I can go out
and play every night for the rest of my

1043
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:53,630
life. So like you're, you
know what I mean? Like,

1044
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:58,160
so all the Kudos being thrown back and
forth when I look at you or any amazing

1045
01:00:58,161 --> 01:01:02,840
comedian that just turns it around and
every year or two years is belting out

1046
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:07,730
these fucking funny ass specials and then
like you can't do that anymore. Like,

1047
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:08,571
you know,

1048
01:01:08,571 --> 01:01:12,590
unless you're Andrew dice clay with the
little fucking Hickory dickory dock,

1049
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:15,440
you know, and you got the little
later. You don't only guy ever that.

1050
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:18,140
You want to hear the old stuff over
and over and over again like Oh,

1051
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:21,340
I don't know. See a whole set of
just rhymes or even like, I'm like,

1052
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,303
and now there's like,

1053
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:25,470
you've familiar with this with
little Duvall comedian like you know,

1054
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:27,890
and hit the whole singing. Like,
I mean he's like turning it into,

1055
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:32,891
he's flipping this whole script on what
comedy and music and entertainment is

1056
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:35,500
right now. He's kind of doing some
really fucking interesting shit.

1057
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,940
Also got a bunch of crazy
shit going on. His Instagram.

1058
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:40,220
Is Instagram hilarious too.
He's got something I need them.

1059
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:44,750
Favorite follows him. He started like,

1060
01:01:44,751 --> 01:01:48,270
he starts cultural
phenomenon. US. Yes. Here,

1061
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:50,870
you know like he set shit off.

1062
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:55,871
Like I've watched him say some shit on
his Instagram and will it into existence

1063
01:01:56,031 --> 01:01:59,570
and it becomes like a trend or a
[inaudible]. The songs he's written,

1064
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:04,310
it's just like, it's amazing. It's like
really like, no, it's a, it's a really,

1065
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:07,520
it's one of my favorite follows,
honestly. Yeah. He's something special.

1066
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,410
Andrew Schultz really made me take
a, I'm an, I, I knew about that song.

1067
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:17,411
Smile Bitch actually found out about that
song because style bender style bender

1068
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,280
would come out to with smile

1069
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,260
bitch. And he came out to fight when
they talked about it, he goes, ah,

1070
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,100
I love bill Duvall. I'm like, Oh,
let me check out little Duvall.

1071
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:29,280
And I was like, God damn, this guy's
good. And then Andrew Schultz says, Yo,

1072
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:30,870
he's a comedian. And he goes,

1073
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:33,660
he's one of the most insightful
and brilliant people I've ever met.

1074
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:37,960
And just like, almost like a naturally
curious guy. Get him on. Yeah, always.

1075
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:41,430
We're working on it. Yeah. We're going
to make it happen. But Schultz is,

1076
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,670
it's going to be, Schultz is a wizard.
Schultz tells me that someone's good,

1077
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:49,380
I'll buy it. Yeah. And it's like,
and he was early Internet like dude,

1078
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:53,490
like he's been working these like Internet
angles kind of lay you got in really

1079
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:57,090
early, saw some he liked and he's
got his own thing going on with the,

1080
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,780
he's got his own thing going on with
that whole city boys country boys thing.

1081
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,410
But that's all in relation to the
song. I know, I know, I know, I know.

1082
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:07,210
But it's hilarious how people like
each other. It's like a daily thing.

1083
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:13,530
You don't follow him. Go. Yeah go go.
He's one of the best falls little Duvall.

1084
01:03:13,531 --> 01:03:15,600
Just shoot me some tickets
to your next show in La.

1085

Follow him to make sure that he's
not really shadow band anymore.

1088

That shit's crazy. I got a friend
who going through that right now.

1089
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,880
Like we're like they just disappear. I
felt like shit when you search for him,

1090
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,970
[inaudible] is up there
now they're ghosting you.

1091
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:38,880
I feel like it's always how you
can find them. Okay, good. Yeah,

1092
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:42,330
they are telling you, man, you couldn't
find them for awhile. There you go,

1093
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:43,350
Andrew. It was tricky.

1094
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,860
It was very tricky. Very
tricky back in the day.

1095
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,980
Yeah. Awesome.

1096

It's a new one. Yeah, just
east. Um, yeah, it is.

1144
01:08:53,611 --> 01:08:54,960
You know what happened
was right. We didn't,

1145
01:08:54,961 --> 01:08:57,060
even when I came in last time we did,

1146
01:08:57,090 --> 01:09:00,750
I think we agreed to just
fucking not talk about

1147
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:06,330
our Sushi Shit. Like we were both like
kind of a little traumatized. That's me.

1148
01:09:06,331 --> 01:09:09,720
Right. And um, cause what happened
was I put this record out last,

1149
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:14,550
what do I think? October, right.
Hit the road and you know,

1150
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:19,140
maybe two weeks in and get a
picture of my house on fire.

1151
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,560
I had to fly home. So
yeah, this records out.

1152
01:09:22,561 --> 01:09:25,790
But we're right now in the cloud where
right now I just shot a video for the,

1153
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:29,460
for a new song and where we releasing,
cause I own everything. It's my label.

1154
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,930
We're just going to rerelease you
know, O g Everlast on all the whatever,

1155
01:09:33,931 --> 01:09:36,690
whatever's, you know,
formats you could find me.

1156
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,470
Do you feel like when you get through
something like a fire with your family

1157
01:09:40,471 --> 01:09:43,770
that like for some inexplicable reason
you feel like a little bit closer?

1158
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:46,560
Oh yeah. Cause, I mean,

1159
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:51,110
my wife and children were in the house
when it was caught fire, you know,

1160
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:55,570
I mean, so yeah, I'm not
literally, here's how it went down.

1161
01:09:56,630 --> 01:10:00,990
Let's tell the story, right? Uh,
basically I said I was in New York.

1162
01:10:00,991 --> 01:10:03,700
I get a call from the wife, the
fire's right across the hill,

1163
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:06,420
like I live literally like Simi
Valley, then the mountains, Bang.

1164
01:10:06,421 --> 01:10:10,950
I'm kind of the first line right there
once you come over those mountains. Um,

1165
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:13,530
so I get a picture like from her,

1166
01:10:13,531 --> 01:10:16,890
like the across the street
from either of the hills,

1167
01:10:16,891 --> 01:10:19,600
just like it looks like hell
landscape. You know what I mean?

1168
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:21,180
As fucking just on fire.

1169
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:26,460
And I'm so they're packing up and they're
getting ready to get out and there's a

1170
01:10:26,461 --> 01:10:28,620
fire truck in the
neighborhood. Thank goodness.

1171
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,800
And as my wife's putting the
final like stuff in the car,

1172
01:10:31,801 --> 01:10:35,130
like the kids are running, they're
just putting all the dogs and you know,

1173
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:37,680
whatever the net, the medicines
and stuff we need for Layla.

1174
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:43,010
And she turns around and sees
like on the corner of the garage,

1175
01:10:43,261 --> 01:10:47,700
like an orange kind of glow. And the
thing about this is like, you know,

1176
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,850
people think the fire comes in his
street and then Johnson Burns all these

1177
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:53,460
houses. That's not what happens.
If you ever noticed in the middle,

1178
01:10:53,461 --> 01:10:54,540
if you're watching the news shit,

1179
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:58,410
it's like one random house in the
neighborhood bar is trees as having a tree

1180
01:10:58,411 --> 01:10:59,790
right on your house,
just touching your house.

1181
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:01,860
Well I happened to have a tree right
there that was touching the corner of my

1182
01:11:01,861 --> 01:11:03,000
garage. The tree went up,

1183
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:07,260
that thing caught garage went
about a third of the house went,

1184
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:10,320
you know what I mean? Um, you know
where everybody was out already.

1185
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:14,010
My wife was able to, the only reason a
third of the house and whole like my wife

1186
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,010
saved our whole block honestly
because there's trees between every,

1187
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:19,710
all of our houses like
for privacy, you know,

1188
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:21,540
cause everybody has a pool
and everybody wants, you know,

1189
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,760
nobody wants to be in two
story houses, all that shit.

1190
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:28,050
So everyone just has these big, huge,
like those just spiny looking trees,

1191
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:31,270
you know what I mean? Like go head cover,
turning to a wall basically. Right.

1192
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,850
All the whole, the whole
block would have went up,

1193
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:36,300
has she not been there and
had the wherewithal to run
down a block and get the

1194
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,780
firemen that had just drove by and say
come back and fucking put this out.

1195
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:44,190
She actually ran, she ran down the
block and got it done. She's a gangster.

1196
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,510
She's a gangster out here was so it's
so hard for people to understand what it

1197
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:50,400
was late. It was frightening.
It was like a war.

1198
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:53,280
It was phrased like we were
at war with a natural force.

1199
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:57,390
It was very strange man is that
everybody was holed up together. Um,

1200
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:01,290
me and my family, we get a hotel in
town with a bunch of our friends.

1201
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:05,340
We were texting, we were texting back
and forth and Tommy and his wife,

1202
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:06,863
Thomas Gert and his wife,

1203
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,290
they came over to and we were all in the
same place and it was like we were all

1204
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:13,770
like refugees for like a
small, tiny period of time.

1205
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:17,880
It makes you realize how fortunate we
really are to be here in this, you know,

1206
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,980
this place like where we're at
right now where we can just,

1207
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:22,980
we don't have to deal with most of the
bullshit that people are dealing with all

1208
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:27,660
over the world. Man. You know, we just
one day of fire, one week of fire,

1209
01:12:27,661 --> 01:12:30,210
whatever it was that freaked everybody
out and scare the shit and a lot of

1210
01:12:30,211 --> 01:12:32,610
people lost their lives or houses rather.

1211
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,940
A lot of people also lives in northern
California. Right. I know that was,

1212
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,990
that's why it's like even worse than
down. Couldn't even it was, yeah.

1213
01:12:38,991 --> 01:12:43,590
You couldn't even like really get a
perspective like for your own shit.

1214
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,030
Cause the minute you
wanted to like do that,

1215
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:48,390
you saw an entire town
flattened in like an hour.

1216
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:51,570
They lost him on the highway and people
were trying to get out on the highway

1217
01:12:51,571 --> 01:12:54,780
and they get caught in their cars and
they caught fire. Man, it's horrible.

1218
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:59,610
And there's um, you know,
for the people that survived,

1219
01:12:59,611 --> 01:13:02,670
like for us, it sounds ridiculous
to call yourself a survivor.

1220
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:03,630
It's not like it was a war,

1221
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,250
but it's something that
you really understand when
you get through that you're

1222
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:12,720
like, wow, like we are barely in
control of our own environment. Barely.

1223
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,690
And all it takes is one good strong wind.

1224
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:20,690
One good fucking hot day on one good
Gusta fire and next thing you know

1225
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:24,360
everything's on fire. I mean
that was nuts. The kids,

1226
01:13:24,361 --> 01:13:26,550
the kids are still
dealing with it. You know,

1227
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:31,380
I'm trying to explain that thing to the
kids of like that universal unsurity

1228
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:35,700
like there's just not really, honey,
I'm going to keep you safe as I can,

1229
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:38,490
but if you really want the absolute truth,

1230
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:42,570
I can only tell you that some
shit happens. And you know,

1231
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:47,730
it was actually another big fire
somewhere. Oh is oddly enough,

1232
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:51,180
when Notre Dame caught fire, it was
all in the news and my daughter,

1233
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:55,940
my oldest was like, oh that caught
fire. You know, cause she always me,

1234
01:13:56,010 --> 01:14:00,210
I proposed my wife in, in Paris. So
like we talk about Paris a lot so she,

1235
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,010
you know, looks forward to
all that she wanted to see.

1236
01:14:02,011 --> 01:14:04,650
She was really interested in Notre
Dame when thing burnt. But then,

1237
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:08,670
but something about that burning and
when it did and she saw it, she was like,

1238
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,100
oh it can happen anywhere. And
it Kinda, and it kind of dawned

1239
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,170
on her like, okay, it's
not just there that plea.

1240
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,570
Cause for a long time I couldn't
even drive by the house with her,

1241
01:14:16,571 --> 01:14:18,230
like to go check on it or something.

1242
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,930
But if she was in the
car and my wife either,

1243
01:14:19,931 --> 01:14:21,730
cause she just didn't want
to be over there. Right.

1244
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,180
And then after that it kinda changed and
she kind of realized like, well it's,

1245
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:29,110
I guess it's Kinda can happen anywhere
you have it can happen to note it.

1246
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:32,200
Which was a crazy thing to witness
happen in a human like person,

1247
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:35,470
like come to that
understanding of like, wow,

1248
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:39,640
shit's just not guaranteed.
Like in a weird way, you know,

1249
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:42,850
but isn't there kind of a,
there's a magic of that. Yeah.

1250
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:45,610
If you can get through, if you serve,

1251
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,920
if you're one of the
survivors is a magic in that,

1252
01:14:47,921 --> 01:14:51,790
that doesn't exist without the possibility
of that. I have people asking me,

1253
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,310
what are you going to do? And I'm
like, what do you mean? They're like,

1254
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,320
you're going to build a house in
the same spot. I'm like fucking God.

1255
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,850
Damn right. You know
what mean? Absolutely.

1256
01:14:57,851 --> 01:15:00,670
I don't live in like some
crazy bizarro like place.

1257
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:02,650
I'm going to build my
house right where I was.

1258
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:05,470
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do with the
House on top of a hill that's put the

1259
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:08,230
sprinklers on your house like
that. People have the sprinklers.

1260
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,990
There was a neighbor there was catched
that whole neighborhoods burned down and

1261
01:15:10,991 --> 01:15:14,050
then the one house I had the
sprinklers, that couch was pristine.

1262
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:18,010
The problem with that is you
do get survivor syndrome.

1263
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,620
You feel you feel weird.

1264
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:25,300
You see get survivor guilt of the first
three houses in front of me right in

1265
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:26,080
front of my house.

1266
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,650
You know what three houses gone
that I could understand that if, if,

1267
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:34,710
if you were like the guy who kind of
futuristically predicted a fire and put

1268
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:37,980
that on and where but after now it's
like, Yo, if you didn't put shit on that,

1269
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,670
everybody knows about that shit. Now,

1270
01:15:39,671 --> 01:15:41,400
so put this shit in
your house or you know,

1271
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:44,230
if you're going to live in one of these
areas, we're basically in California,

1272
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:47,980
they're telling us now this might
be a new norm, you know what I mean?

1273
01:15:47,981 --> 01:15:50,200
These kind of fires, you know,

1274
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:54,490
so cause there hadn't been one
in the area, you know the air,

1275
01:15:54,491 --> 01:15:57,940
those areas I go go red hills and Simi
Valley and there hadn't been one for

1276
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,980
many, many, many, like a couple decades.

1277
01:15:59,981 --> 01:16:04,690
I believe climate change is not
real. No, it's fake. It's fake news.

1278
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:11,570
It's something that something's clearly
happening. Right. This is not normal.

1279
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:14,690
Right. If you had to guess my 36 years,

1280
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,120
so it seems like there's
had been an adjustment.

1281
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:18,630
I've been the same Irish,

1282
01:16:18,631 --> 01:16:22,140
white motherfucker all my life and I
didn't burn like this when I was young.

1283
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:25,470
When did you move to la? Oh, I've
been hearing most of my life.

1284
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:28,700
Like I was born in New York and
whatever and probably did a, a um,

1285
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:31,590
kindergarten part of first grade
out there. And then for the,

1286
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:34,050
like my dad was a construction
dude, like during the 70s,

1287
01:16:34,051 --> 01:16:37,320
boom of like Simi Valley and
all that shit and being built.

1288
01:16:37,321 --> 01:16:41,670
He came out during that era, nobody
talked about crazy fires back then.

1289
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,450
Did they? They didn't, not really

1290
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,830
the first I got evacuated for the first
time while we were filming fear factor.

1291
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,180
And I remember I was driving home
and it started, there was a fire,

1292
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:56,840
it seemed like it was a little bit out
of control but like wow this is crazy and

1293
01:16:56,841 --> 01:17:01,841
I'm driving to work and then we filmed
the day and then as we're driving home

1294
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:05,580
people are letting us know, hey man
this is bad. This has gotten really bad.

1295
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:09,770
And uh, as we were driving
home, a guy got hit a car

1296
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,260
and he got killed and uh,

1297
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:17,290
I didn't see his body but I saw a shoe
and really like passing by or like all

1298
01:17:18,531 --> 01:17:21,590
these people were freaking out because
the guy apparently just tried to run into

1299
01:17:21,591 --> 01:17:24,740
the highway and some guy hit him
cause he was panicking cause he was,

1300
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:26,840
there was a bunch of shit
going on. There was fire,

1301
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:28,940
I don't know if he was panicking,
but something happened.

1302
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,270
The guy got hit by a car, so has
this ominous feeling of, whoa,

1303
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:37,271
somebody just died and we're driving down
this highway and the whole right side

1304
01:17:38,151 --> 01:17:42,950
is on fire. I mean the whole right
side of the highway for an hour,

1305
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:48,140
like a lord of the rings
movie more door dude was like,

1306
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:52,910
flakes of ash are falling from
the sky like a, like a light snow.

1307
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,820
It's fucking strange.

1308
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,140
You just waiting for demons to come riding
on fucking horses over the top of the

1309
01:18:00,141 --> 01:18:03,740
hills. It's that bad. And
uh, by the time I got back,

1310
01:18:03,741 --> 01:18:06,950
we had to evacuate from our community
and we'd just get the fuck out of dodge.

1311
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:10,750
That was the first time that had
ever happened ever for me. Uh,

1312
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:15,830
living out here since 94 and
that was in like 2000, two,

1313
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:19,850
three, something like that. And
then it's happened twice since then.

1314
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:23,480
It's a creepy feeling, man.
It's creepy. It's like,

1315
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:26,390
you know that no one can do
anything if everything goes wrong.

1316
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:29,780
If everything goes wrong and the wind
gets too strong. And it gets too wide.

1317
01:18:29,781 --> 01:18:33,620
He goes left and it goes
right and everything starts
swirling around and ashes

1318
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,200
fly through the air and they
land on other people's houses.

1319
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:38,510
Like you gotta get the fuck out of there,

1320
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:41,390
just get out of there as a storm of fire.

1321
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:45,380
Well, but it's like, all
right, so the, I get a picture,

1322
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,870
the last thing before I get on a plane
is a picture of my garage engulfed in

1323
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:53,180
flames. Right. So I get on this plane,

1324
01:18:53,181 --> 01:18:56,210
I gotta take like three planes cause it's
like last minute booking and it's all

1325
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:58,640
coach. I'm pissed. You know what I
mean? I'm like, I'm like, I'm not,

1326
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,370
I'm just like tucked in corners
on the walls. Like everything.

1327
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:05,250
I just fly like of to
Dallas than to Vegas.

1328
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,870
And just to get there the quickest
and it was like three flights.

1329
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,770
So I get there. I think the
whole way there, I'm like,

1330
01:19:12,771 --> 01:19:15,100
my house is burned to the ground.
You know what I mean? That's, I've,

1331
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,450
I'm accepted. I'm dealing
with those whatever,

1332
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:22,451
five stages of grief and like I'm getting
to acceptance and then I get home and

1333
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:28,100
I a not even at home. I had my wife
and kids were at my studio and like,

1334
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:30,060
you know, that's where we're,
we're laid up from, you know,

1335
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:31,400
just trying to figure out
what the fuck's going on.

1336
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:35,870
I can't get to the house because the
whole one-on-one shut down that way I have

1337
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:40,640
to literally drive up to paying a hit
the one 18 take that out all the way out

1338
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:45,170
to like the 20 whatever it is, the three
23 or 27 I don't know. It's one of the,

1339
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:48,860
I know it's the 23 it's like out there
and you come back down and come around

1340
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:52,190
the other way. And I was able to get
to the house, I got to the house,

1341
01:19:52,191 --> 01:19:57,140
I got in my house, literally had
20 fucking cop cars roll in. Like,

1342
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,950
cause looting was fucking out of
control dude. And they're like,

1343
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:05,540
oh Gora and Calabasas areas park. It
was oak park. Yeah. Well that's, that's,

1344
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,350
I don't, I think that is a Gora and,
and the same thing. Yeah. But yeah,

1345
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:14,040
the whole over there was fucking like
off the chain with fucking looting.

1346
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,750
So like I had monk pull up on me.

1347
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:20,010
I literally knew like I sh I brought
my lease and my father and I, my, my,

1348
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,680
my mortgage and my electric bill
and I brought my, I, you know,

1349
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:24,480
I had all my shit so
they doesn't miles and I,

1350
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:29,890
and they were cool but it was like I
pulled up and like saw most of the house

1351
01:20:30,181 --> 01:20:34,350
standing and like broke down cause I'm a,

1352
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,370
I'm a big art collector and August.
So I was like, I had already liked,

1353
01:20:37,371 --> 01:20:41,940
just assumed it was all gone, you
know. And you know, it was crazy.

1354
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:43,980
It was a crazy experience
to like pull up in Nice,

1355
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:48,150
see like two thirds of it
there and you're like, oh wow.

1356
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:52,470
Like maybe there's salvage like in the
salvage shit. Like they was like, oh,

1357
01:20:52,471 --> 01:20:54,240
crazy experience man.

1358
01:20:55,390 --> 01:21:00,390
I'm grateful that my family is safe
and all that and all the rest of it is

1359
01:21:01,201 --> 01:21:05,250
replaceable stuff. But I got
extremely lucky. Yeah, no the most,

1360
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:09,520
I mean it's like such a cliche thing to
say that your health and your happiness

1361
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:11,740
and your family is the most
important thing. You know,

1362
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:15,370
that everybody knows that we are even
us. Fucking psychopath knows that.

1363
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:16,750
But to feel it,

1364
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:21,760
to feel it like in the presence of a
natural fury like fires, like wildfires.

1365
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:26,790
It's humbling and in the strangest of
ways it makes you love each other more,

1366
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,830
makes you nicer to people.
All my refugee friends

1367
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:35,140
in her, when we're at the
hotel that night, you know,

1368
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:38,070
the refugees from the fire,
we're all like closer.

1369
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,560
We're like happy for sure. You
know, in a weird way, you know,

1370
01:21:41,561 --> 01:21:45,660
we're having drinks together, we're
toasting, we're hugging, you know,

1371
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:51,020
we're in a hotel hiding from a
natural fury and you realize like,

1372
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:54,550
oh, OK we, we, we have, we have,

1373
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:57,400
we get soft when we hit a soft spot.

1374
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:59,650
And that's not necessarily
good for anybody.

1375
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:04,860
And occasionally these are horrific things
that happen are good for us overall.

1376
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:09,520
Cause they let us appreciate like there's
consequences to his consequences to

1377
01:22:09,521 --> 01:22:10,354
live in here.

1378
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:14,740
There's consequences to everything
being so hot and dry and never fucking

1379
01:22:14,741 --> 01:22:18,970
raining. And the fact that it may or
may not be getting a little [inaudible],

1380
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:22,900
a little warmer, maybe no, maybe
who gives a fuck if people have

1381
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,970
do with it, who cares? Let's
pretend that's not even a factor.

1382
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:29,170
Something's happening.
Something's happened.

1383
01:22:29,171 --> 01:22:33,200
And we got firestorms like every
few years. The God damn firestorm,

1384
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:34,963
you know,

1385
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:38,410
craziness man. Well, we
survived your brother. Yeah.

1386
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:42,190
This salon HSA Salon, there's
only so much you can think about.

1387
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:49,240
Like you, uh, you know,

1388
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,580
you haven't gone through that man.

1389
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:56,740
If you written shit that has a,
like the, the touch of that honor.

1390
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:00,030
Um, like in, in like a,

1391
01:23:00,031 --> 01:23:04,300
a very kind of creative state like
state at the moment. Like, so we're,

1392
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:07,930
I don't what's there's, there's,

1393
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:11,950
I'm sure there's elements of it and what
I'm like starting to play with right

1394
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:15,770
now. Do you sit down and write like on a
piece of paper or do you write why you,

1395
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:21,550
yeah. For me, writing is
a visual process. Visual,

1396
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:26,560
yes. And I can't, if I write it
down, it becomes two dimensional.

1397
01:23:26,561 --> 01:23:27,570
And I've never, I've,

1398
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:30,850
I've written lyrics that I thought were
genius and actually committed them to

1399
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:32,830
paper and saw them and they beat and they,

1400
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,490
it's like they dissolve from this
three dimensional beauty to like, oh,

1401
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:39,640
it's two dimensional garbage.
It's fucking bizarre.

1402
01:23:39,641 --> 01:23:44,530
I know it's not always like reasonable,
but it's my process at this point.

1403
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:49,240
How's it visual? It's if you really listen
to my songs, they're like photograph.

1404
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:51,910
Like it's like flipping through
a photographic album almost.

1405
01:23:51,911 --> 01:23:55,120
If you really listened to like what
I'm doing, that's like very visual.

1406
01:23:55,450 --> 01:24:00,070
I see the pictures, I equate it to like,
did you ever watch the show Oz? Sure.

1407
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:01,910
I remember the poet guy who, who,

1408
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:06,580
who was illiterate but he drew pictures
and that's how he recited his poems from

1409
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:11,290
pictures. It's similar. It's like, but
it's kind of reverse. It's in my brain.

1410
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:12,610
It's, it's there.

1411
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:16,630
So you're seeing your visual in terms of
like the stories that you're painting,

1412
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:20,440
like the guy outside the liquor store
or the imagery? Yes. Or like, you know,

1413
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:25,630
a song like black Jesus where it's like
just kind of cultural like fucking pop

1414
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:30,160
culture reference after reference leading
down a path of just like a stream of

1415
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:32,680
consciousness, pop culture
references, you know what I mean?

1416
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:34,390
I'll go on tangents, you know what I mean?

1417
01:24:34,391 --> 01:24:38,740
But it'll be all within an energy in the
inside the brain, you know what I mean?

1418
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,830
Like once I commit them, I
even like after the fact,

1419
01:24:41,831 --> 01:24:46,330
like when you turn in like music to like
entities that have shows or whatever,

1420
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:50,170
they want to know the lyrics so they
can know if they should put it on air or

1421
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:52,260
this, you know, it depends on
whatever, if it's public now.

1422
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:55,140
But even when it comes
to that, I have to have,

1423
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:59,770
I have to like recite it to somebody
and have them type it, I can't, it'll,

1424
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:02,550
it'll just kind of taint it to me. Wow.

1425
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:07,660
See it written down in my hand, you
know what I mean? And in another hand,

1426
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:11,160
it doesn't bother me, but like for
me to come to do it, it, it, it,

1427
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:15,580
it like it breaks a barrier of
some sort and then everything.

1428
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:18,940
Vaporizes so do you, uh,

1429
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,940
how do you capture the various beats?

1430
01:25:21,941 --> 01:25:24,910
Do you record it as you're
coming up with it? There's a,

1431
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:27,250
there's a few different ways of
Hams from me. Like, you know,

1432
01:25:27,251 --> 01:25:31,540
if I'm doing like a hip hop ish
or hip pure hip hop project, I'll,

1433
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,640
there'll be a beat involved
always first. You know,

1434
01:25:33,641 --> 01:25:35,380
I mean there'll be somebody who
have a track and we'll be like, oh,

1435
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:38,500
that's the track we're going to commit
to this and we'll write lyrics to it and

1436
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:39,750
it'll be just kinda like I said, I'll,

1437
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:45,050
I'll drive around a lot with rap stuff
and just let it bump and see what word

1438
01:25:45,051 --> 01:25:48,280
starts popping up. I like word
play and pouncing word play,

1439
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:50,520
but I'd know it can't just be
worth played for the sake of it.

1440
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:54,250
It has to like tie into
some sort of like idea. Um,

1441
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,630
when it comes to a song,

1442
01:25:55,631 --> 01:26:00,631
it's usually I string together
some simple chord progression and,

1443
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:04,040
and start and, and see and, and if I,

1444
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,040
once I've see something I really
like, it'll just, like I said,

1445
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:11,360
pictures will start coming up and you
kinda just try to describe the picture a

1446
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:13,450
little bit. And sometimes you,

1447
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,490
you come across poetry when you're
describing the picture and you'd be like,

1448
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,770
that's good. Yeah.

1449
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,440
I mean there's a lot of like not
that's not good and that's not good.

1450
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:22,730
There's a lot of that.
There's a lot of that.

1451
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:27,170
It seems like a mere process to stand
up comedy. It's a mirror process,

1452
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:31,520
except I get to hold onto mine. Even
if they record it and make a special,

1453
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:34,340
I still can play mine. And that's,
that's what I was with. I, man,

1454
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:36,890
comedians are just, that's a little bit,

1455
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:40,100
it's a different commitment because like
you're, you're bringing, you're like,

1456
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:45,140
it's almost like a chow you're raising
that you have to watch the life of it

1457
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:48,230
finish in a weird way. I'm not, you
know what I mean? We both have children.

1458
01:26:48,231 --> 01:26:52,070
That's extreme, but I know what
you're saying, but like you're,

1459
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:56,000
you're taking this idea from kind
of garbage idea that, you know,

1460
01:26:56,001 --> 01:27:00,800
there's a premise there and then like
over a fucking series of fucking shells or

1461
01:27:00,801 --> 01:27:04,370
nights or fucking maybe months.
You, you find it, you know,

1462
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:08,540
with different audiences and then you got
it and yet you get to rocket for maybe

1463
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:10,340
six months good.

1464
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,580
And all these places and then you go
and record it and make that special.

1465
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:16,420
If you're lucky enough to
be on that level, you know,

1466
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:19,680
it's almost like I almost
envy the [inaudible].

1467
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:22,410
I wonder if you guys ever
envy the comic who quite,

1468
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,690
it doesn't quite have that yet. So
he can like he has this, you know,

1469
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:28,970
bevy of material that he hasn't had
to trash yet. You know what I mean?

1470
01:27:28,971 --> 01:27:29,750
As they talk to the

1471
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,470
Roy would about that. It was
just on right before you hit.

1472
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:34,910
That's one of the things that he said
that you shouldn't do TV for like 10

1473
01:27:34,911 --> 01:27:38,600
years. Like don't do,
it's like catalog man.

1474
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:40,580
It'll come up with that.

1475
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,880
I'll get it like the first time you do
anything that people get to see like be

1476
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:48,410
hardened, like be Polished
Samurai of stand up, you know?

1477
01:27:48,411 --> 01:27:53,150
But I disagree. I say let them see
everything. Let them see all the bullshit,

1478
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:57,680
all this stuff that sucks.
All the terrible jokes.
Who Cares? Just keep going.

1479
01:27:57,681 --> 01:28:00,560
Especially if the progressions there.
Then it's like, Oh, you see what?

1480
01:28:00,561 --> 01:28:03,110
Just keep going and it's
good for everybody to see.

1481
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,020
People don't want to think you just
like someone who just figured it out

1482
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:09,860
instantly. No, it's good to see these
sucked. It's good for everybody.

1483
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,590
It might be bad for your
ego, but it's good for you.

1484
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:15,920
When your ego get takes a hit.
It's always good. It's always good.

1485
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:18,470
It puts everything in
perspective. You know?

1486
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:20,360
Don't you think like as an artist too,

1487
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:23,420
like the thing that gets in your way
more than anything, it's your ego, right?

1488
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:26,060
The thing that gets in the
way more than anything,

1489
01:28:26,061 --> 01:28:29,510
it's for sure the way you view
yourself. You want people to view you.

1490
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,550
I wouldn't produce my own records until
like maybe two albums ago because I felt

1491
01:28:34,551 --> 01:28:39,551
like if I'd made it through an album
without being like seriously challenged,

1492
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:41,870
I didn't make the best record I could.

1493
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:46,610
And then just being involved with a
bunch of really seriously good producers,

1494
01:28:46,611 --> 01:28:48,890
I learned to challenge myself and,

1495
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:52,100
and even the records
I've produced for myself,

1496
01:28:52,101 --> 01:28:54,590
there's other guys involved
producing with me that are,

1497
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:59,330
that I know are going to be the ones,
if that's something, hey that sucked.

1498
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:01,980
But you know what I mean? You're going
eat dad guy around the, or even a

1499
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,000
guy just to challenge you how
committed you are to certain ideas,

1500
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:06,610
you know what I mean?

1501
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:10,420
How much time do you spend going over?

1502
01:29:10,421 --> 01:29:14,170
Like when you have a song and you're
like, I think, I think this song is solid.

1503
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:17,560
Do you, do you it outside
of singing the song?

1504
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:22,740
Do you ever go over the song and ponder
like what you're saying or how you're

1505
01:29:22,751 --> 01:29:25,840
saying it? Like, how do you,
because your stuff is so,

1506
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:28,090
it's so interesting
because you're, you're,

1507
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:32,470
you're telling these stories of your
experiences in these songs and in a lot of

1508
01:29:32,471 --> 01:29:36,220
them and you're also having fun
and you're also talking shit,

1509
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:40,870
you're having a good time with them
as well. But when you decide, okay,

1510
01:29:40,871 --> 01:29:45,460
this one is going to be recorded like
this, how do you make that conclusion?

1511
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:50,020
For me, it's, uh, again,
if there's not like,

1512
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:53,740
cause I can also, even if I'm not
doing necessarily a straight rap song,

1513
01:29:53,741 --> 01:29:57,130
there's times when I get atrack from a
producer that I just love the track and

1514
01:29:57,131 --> 01:29:59,890
I'll build something around
that. Other than that,

1515
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:04,450
it'll again start with a
guitar and I'll either,

1516
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,880
um, create a, a very, uh,

1517
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:12,480
rudimentary drum beat and lay down the
guitar and maybe a vocal and I have a

1518
01:30:13,721 --> 01:30:15,250
very unique voice. You know,

1519
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:20,251
it's not like it's there between the
guitar and the voice tone start appearing

1520
01:30:20,471 --> 01:30:22,630
that like resemble
other instruments to me.

1521
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:26,230
Like it almost starts telling you what
to do. Oh, that's not, that sounds,

1522
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:29,320
I could hear her Rhodes in there or I,
you know, the baseline, I should do that.

1523
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:30,370
You know, you can hear that.

1524
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:35,380
And the guys I surround myself with are
beasts that hear the same, you know,

1525
01:30:35,381 --> 01:30:37,650
they know, oh yeah, this, I hear
that, let's do it. You know,

1526
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:40,990
you can start a song, we'll tell
you what to do with it. You know,

1527
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:45,520
if you really listened to it. I
believe that. Cause I, I kinda, uh,

1528
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,010
you know, one of the things
Santana told me, you know,

1529
01:30:48,011 --> 01:30:51,040
that I always held onto was
like, you know, because,

1530
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:54,670
and I've experienced this once or twice
where I've written very similar songs to

1531
01:30:54,671 --> 01:30:59,440
friends of mine or people I know that
was like, Whoa, I maybe not sounding,

1532
01:30:59,441 --> 01:31:03,250
but like the idea of wow,
I wrote something that was
exactly. And he said like,

1533
01:31:03,251 --> 01:31:03,461
you know,

1534
01:31:03,461 --> 01:31:08,140
we're all just saying antenna that are
like catching energies and shit and like

1535
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,580
bringing them in and we're, you know,
bringing Megan some out of that energies.

1536
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:16,030
And sometimes people catch
that same energy and similar
things happen, you know?

1537
01:31:16,031 --> 01:31:18,340
And so I always look at a dad. I,

1538
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:22,570
I look at my ideas like this also
because I don't write them down.

1539
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:24,460
I equate it to like my children like this.

1540
01:31:24,461 --> 01:31:29,461
Like my ideas are like little
animals that are wild and I,

1541
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:33,790
I see them and I think they're
amazing and I want to, and so I, I,

1542
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,460
I'll play a song until I know it so well.

1543
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:41,760
It has to stick around if I train it to
stay and if it stays the next morning,

1544
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:47,410
that's, this kind of answers your
question. The next day. If I arrive,

1545
01:31:47,411 --> 01:31:51,760
I'm on to some and I write a
song, I'll sing it 200 times.

1546
01:31:51,761 --> 01:31:54,400
If I get it close to done
and then I'll go to bed.

1547
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:58,810
And then if it's there in the
morning in the, in the same,

1548
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:02,740
I'm recording. If it's gone, I didn't,

1549
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:07,960
it wasn't mine and has happened
a lot too. Brave move. Yeah.

1550
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:11,770
I have the opposite cowards
approach. If I get an idea,

1551
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:15,640
I'll run away from everybody, my, my
fingers in my ears and write it down,

1552
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:20,020
you know, hear what I said. I'll sing
it 200 times. You know what I mean?

1553
01:32:20,021 --> 01:32:23,680
So if I've done it 200 times
and I don't wake up and know it,

1554
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:28,480
it's fucking trash. I write everything.
It's not supposed to happen.

1555
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:31,450
I have the total opposite approach
in terms of writing comedy. I write,

1556
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:32,890
how many specials have
you made in your life?

1557
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:39,760
I never counted rough guess.
It's like eight or nine.

1558
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:43,460
Alright. That's how many albums
I've done in almost 30 years. Yeah.

1559
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:47,350
You know what I mean? So it's like
I'm not turning them out like that.

1560
01:32:47,351 --> 01:32:50,500
I thought, you know, and I
don't, again, because of that,

1561
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:54,850
there's not like this crazy archive of
garbage that's going to be released when

1562
01:32:54,851 --> 01:32:58,450
I'm dead. It's not gonna happen. It's
not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen.

1563
01:32:58,451 --> 01:33:00,670
Cause I even saw as I started to record,

1564
01:33:00,671 --> 01:33:03,310
if I get halfway through it and I'm
like not even satisfied with it,

1565
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,330
it gets erased. You
know what I mean? There,

1566
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:08,070
there's a few things
out there that, that I,

1567
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:09,430
that I probably wouldn't have released,

1568
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:12,700
but they're not there like from house
of pain days and they're not bad.

1569
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:16,270
I've just like, they weren't
for, they didn't have a purpose.

1570
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:20,170
I think it's good for people to
see bad shit from great artists.

1571
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:25,840
I do. I think it's good. It's good. It's
good for everybody. I have no problem.

1572
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:26,860
I mean, I'm the guy that fuck,

1573
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:30,310
I'll fuck up live and talk about it for
five minutes of the show and be like,

1574
01:33:30,311 --> 01:33:33,190
Yo, at least you know it's not on
fucking tape. Right. And I'll be like,

1575
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:36,070
that's real shit. You know, and
I'll, I'll, you know, I'm with that.

1576
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:40,600
I'm just like, it's my process. It's
like, just the way I do, like again, also,

1577
01:33:40,601 --> 01:33:41,261
I think it has to do with,

1578
01:33:41,261 --> 01:33:45,700
I had some really hard core producers
like DJ Muggs and my man, Dante Ross,

1579
01:33:45,701 --> 01:33:49,120
these were dudes that would be like,
that fucking was garbage do it again.

1580
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:51,840
It's for so long that that's, I'm a re,

1581
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:54,730
the first time now is going to
be decent. You know what I mean?

1582
01:33:54,731 --> 01:33:57,520
So it's like I gotta push myself
to, for it to be better than decent.

1583
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:03,340
Otherwise I just clip it. Yeah. Well,

1584
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:07,250
that's the only way you could be as
productive as you are. Like you've a,

1585
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:11,140
you have a well oiled approach, you know,

1586
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:12,940
but I don't put out a lot of music,

1587
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,860
but when I know for a fact when you put
something out, you're happy about it.

1588
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:21,490
Oh yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm content.
That's when you put it out,

1589
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,520
you're in a great position, man,

1590
01:34:24,521 --> 01:34:27,760
that you can kind of of decide
what to do and when to do it.

1591
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:32,790
Writing Three of the biggest songs in
the 90s with what is like jump around and

1592
01:34:33,491 --> 01:34:37,720
put your lights on. Well that was 2000
I think so, but that little period,

1593
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:42,040
I know and I, I wrote those
songs, jump around with mugs,

1594
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:46,000
what it's like and put your
lights on totally on my own. That,

1595
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:51,160
that provided me with
something that I cherish.

1596
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,320
Like some people cherish
private jet rides,

1597
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:58,321
which is I can do whatever the fuck
I want and still live pretty decent.

1598
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,480
Not Super Rich Guy or anything,
but like better than average. Oh,

1599
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:06,230
you got a good life.
Take care of my family.

1600
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:10,850
But creatively I could do whatever the
fuck I want and it's a beautiful thing,

1601
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:15,470
man. As I, the older I get like I'm on
my whole new shit. My slogan is, fuck it.

1602
01:35:15,471 --> 01:35:19,700
I'm 50 man. That's my new
shit dog. I'm on. Like,

1603
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:24,380
I know you ain't gonna Rattle me, man.
I'm 50 I don't even care. How's that?

1604
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:28,490
If you're, there you go.
I'll just try to have fun.

1605
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:32,230
Live my life. Go home. Hug My kids. Yes.

1606
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:35,030
And fucking know that nobody
fucked with them in school.

1607
01:35:35,031 --> 01:35:39,200
And then they had a gray day and there
my universe is complete. Yes. Yeah.

1608
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:43,790
Fucking them 50 fuck it.
I'm 50 yeah. Beautiful.

1609
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,650
We need more people to think like
that, man. I'm in time doing.

1610
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:50,390
I had a heart valve
replacement at 28 dude,

1611
01:35:50,391 --> 01:35:54,290
I didn't think I was gonna make
35 you know what I mean? Yeah.

1612
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:59,810
So fifties put that microphone in the
chest we ever done in the west. So here,

1613
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:04,010
anybody who don't know this is, this
is a heartbeat. It's not a watch.

1614
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:05,270
It's my heartbeat.

1615
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,390
It's like a Goddamn metronome.

1616
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:16,913
Wow.

1617
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,340
Well, it's a titanium man.
Wrap your head around that? No,

1618
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:26,520
I got alien technology in my
chest. My to stay together.

1619
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:31,560
Hold the doors, don't fly off that
thing. Click, click, click. That's crazy.

1620
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,630
Yeah. It's basically a very simple thing.

1621
01:36:33,631 --> 01:36:38,580
It's like a ring that goes in the valve
and it's like a spring kind of activated

1622
01:36:38,581 --> 01:36:42,900
flap that is totally self propelled
by the heart's pumping up the blood.

1623
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:46,650
It pumps the blood out of the flap and
then the flap kind of snaps back and

1624
01:36:46,651 --> 01:36:50,310
that's what you're hearing is the tic
has just the spring of that and it's all,

1625
01:36:50,311 --> 01:36:53,010
I mean, I can take my pulse without
w it would just sit in here.

1626
01:36:53,011 --> 01:36:56,730
Do you know what I mean? I can take my
pulse without even thinking about it.

1627
01:36:56,820 --> 01:37:00,210
Modern technology is
so amazing. St Jude's,

1628
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:04,560
Val shout out that the St Jude's
people, whoever invented that shit,

1629
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:07,230
bleep up from the motherfucker.

1630
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:13,200
Vega stars is doing whatever they can
figure out a way to make your heart work

1631
01:37:13,201 --> 01:37:16,350
again with a fake valve.
Click, click, click.

1632
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:21,690
It's wild and that's why you're
here. That's why I'm still here, man.

1633
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:26,660
It's amazing. I've been wondering
afterwards like why, why did it, why it,

1634
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,920
what killed John Ritter?

1635
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,680
What killed him was exactly
kind of what happened to me,

1636
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:35,520
but I was able to get to the hospital
faster. Did you ever meet that guy? No,

1637
01:37:35,730 --> 01:37:38,940
but I know that like when it happened
though, like people pointed it out. Like,

1638
01:37:38,941 --> 01:37:40,890
isn't that what happened to you?
I was like, oh yeah, that one.

1639
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:44,130
It was a special dude. He was
on a, an episode of News Radio.

1640
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:48,150
Everybody loved him, man. Like so
nice. I like wandering around the set,

1641
01:37:48,151 --> 01:37:51,680
like friendly to everybody, like in
a weird way, like a, like a, just a,

1642
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,920
he's a genuinely really nice guy
who just making sitcoms and um,

1643
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:01,470
when he died I was like, oh
yeah, that's one of them.

1644
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:05,010
Things was just so nice when you
find out that someone that's like,

1645
01:38:05,011 --> 01:38:08,340
you feel like us and nothing's going
to happen to him. He's so nice.

1646
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:14,520
And then one day the
clutch, the plush of death.

1647
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:19,110
I was told by the people at the hospital
when I went back to visit once that,

1648
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:20,270
um,

1649
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:23,670
a while after they had
brought me in because it took
them a minute to figure out

1650
01:38:23,671 --> 01:38:24,151
what's wrong with me.

1651
01:38:24,151 --> 01:38:27,270
The only reason they figured out what
is wrong with me is because my actual

1652
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:30,210
doctor who's is this guy in Beverly Hills,

1653
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:34,710
I'm not gonna say anything cause I don't
know if he wants that. But uh, he, uh,

1654
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:37,110
it was a member on the
board of Cedar Sinai.

1655
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:38,280
So when they brought me in the hospital,

1656
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:40,950
all his records are
computer accessible to them.

1657
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:44,670
So they found out about my history of
like being born with this heart defect and

1658
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:48,060
cause up until then they heard rock
dude, he's a musician. They were like,

1659
01:38:48,061 --> 01:38:51,420
all right, how many, how much cocaine did
you do? And all my friends were trans.

1660
01:38:51,421 --> 01:38:54,390
I mean, he doesn't do cocaine, you know,
he's not that in there, like going out,

1661
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:57,840
if we give them the wrong drugs, we
can kill him. And then all of a sudden,

1662
01:38:57,841 --> 01:39:01,140
like the records came through.
And that's what saved my ass.

1663
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:03,930
That along with the like, uh,
the head of surgery there,

1664
01:39:03,931 --> 01:39:07,930
like the guy who like did a double
eight 99 hour surgery came off of one,

1665
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:10,890
told the guys they couldn't do my
surgery because it was too complex.

1666
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,470
It's got Dr. William Trento,
he's an amazing person.

1667
01:39:13,471 --> 01:39:16,900
He will not mind me shouting him
out. He like goes to South American,

1668
01:39:16,930 --> 01:39:21,290
does all these free operations on kids'
hearts. He's a fucking saint. This guys,

1669
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:25,020
I'll tell you off fucking
show some other shitty did.

1670
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:29,730
That'll blow your fucking mind. Like
wow, that's who does that. But he's,

1671
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:34,560
he saved my life and you know,
I've just been, like I said,

1672
01:39:34,561 --> 01:39:37,560
I didn't expect to be here.
50. Fuck it. I'm 50 man.

1673
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,290
I got two little girls I've
got, it's like a whole,

1674
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:44,130
my whole thing right now is I want to
take my girls like in the next like week

1675
01:39:44,131 --> 01:39:47,310
or two over to see him,
just to be like, Yo dude,

1676
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:51,030
these people wouldn't even
exist if it wasn't for you dude.

1677
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:53,830
Like I think I blew his mind
a little bit. Fuck yeah. Wow.

1678
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:59,550
Shout out to all the people who fix
hearts, all those people fix anything,

1679
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:04,170
fix all things. You know, if you
fix shit, fucking salute. Right.

1680
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:06,310
That's a positive thing. Yeah. Fixed.

1681
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:11,280
Don't care if it's a sink or a heart
or you fix it all. Anything in between,

1682
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:15,510
Dude. Yeah. And that
weird fixing shit is good.

1683
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:18,600
Fixing hearts though. That's
like particularly good.

1684
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:22,170
Like when that guy sees
you on TV and shit,

1685
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:25,860
he's probably fixed that in a
minute. But yeah, he probably

1686
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:32,220
thinks that I fixed it up.
Nice. Fixed it up. Nice.

1687
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:35,940
She enjoys music. Thank you.
They enjoy my work. Fuck it.

1688
01:40:35,941 --> 01:40:38,940
I'm going to tell this story. I'm
gonna tell it. Here's the story. Okay.

1689
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:42,390
A few years after my heart surgery,
like when I had my heart surgery,

1690
01:40:42,391 --> 01:40:44,970
I didn't have, I didn't have medical
insurance. I was young and dumb. Didn't,

1691
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,670
you know what I mean? Just
didn't have it. And uh,

1692
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:50,370
so it fucking caused a real fucking,

1693
01:40:50,371 --> 01:40:53,650
and it was like half a million dollar
fucking hit. You know what, I, but I,

1694
01:40:53,651 --> 01:40:56,050
you know, I didn't declare
bankruptcy. I paid it all.

1695
01:40:56,410 --> 01:40:58,390
And I think this dude heard
about that and they are,

1696
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:03,280
I think guys like this must somehow invest
in you when they know they saved your

1697
01:41:03,281 --> 01:41:06,170
fucking life. There's something, there's
a connection after that. Like, oh,

1698
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:10,750
that's one of my guy, that's one of my
guys right there. So a few years later,

1699
01:41:10,751 --> 01:41:13,060
my mom, when I was young, had a,

1700
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:16,030
I believe Hodgkin's disease of what it
was and she had radiation treatment and

1701
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:16,870
she beat it and all that.

1702
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:20,550
But 20 years later that shit wears
on your heart valves and shit.

1703
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,380
She had to have a triple my pass.
Like it was Kinda like, oh shit.

1704
01:41:23,381 --> 01:41:26,710
Like I was out on tour, I had to
come home, put her, I was like,

1705
01:41:26,711 --> 01:41:30,490
I want that guy to do the surgery just
because I'd, he'd already done mine.

1706
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:36,130
So he does my mom's surgery
and this guy fucking,

1707
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:39,850
I get all the bills, you know, and then
now I'm doing all right. So it was cool.

1708
01:41:39,851 --> 01:41:43,550
I could, I get a bill from
the fucking anesthesiologists.

1709
01:41:43,551 --> 01:41:46,750
I get a bill from the fucking operating
room and get a bill from the hospital

1710
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:50,380
and get a bill from this. I never got a
bill from this man for my mom's surgery

1711
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:56,590
to just was like, Nah, that
was on me. Wow. Fucking crazy.

1712
01:41:56,591 --> 01:42:01,510
Who gets a surgery done on them? Right?
That's an amazing guy. Who's crazy dude.

1713
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:02,950
That's amazing. No, this dude goes,

1714
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:05,950
and then I like started looking into who
he was and this guy goes and does like

1715
01:42:05,951 --> 01:42:10,630
fucking tons and tons of like sergeant
surgeries on kids down in South America

1716
01:42:10,631 --> 01:42:14,980
and he's just one of them dudes,
man. Your mom on the house.

1717
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:21,300
What? That guy saved
your mom. All that guys.

1718
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:22,390
God bless her.

1719
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:26,570
God bless him. God bless
him. Yeah, man. It's um,

1720
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:29,720
there's nice people out there
that really are, you know,

1721
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:34,040
we were fed this false narrative that
everybody sucks because so many people do

1722
01:42:34,041 --> 01:42:37,700
suck. But there's so many people,
it's just a perspective issue.

1723
01:42:37,701 --> 01:42:39,680
It's the same reason why
people think the world is flat.

1724
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:42,290
They don't understand
perspective, their perspective.

1725
01:42:42,291 --> 01:42:46,820
When you talking about human
beings and 7 billion people,

1726
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,820
we're just overflowing with
people. There's so many of us.

1727
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:52,040
There's so many stories
that people sucking,

1728
01:42:52,430 --> 01:42:57,170
but it's all perspective issue because
there's so many goddamn people and most

1729
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:00,620
of them are cool and most of them want
to be cool and they would be more cool if

1730
01:43:00,621 --> 01:43:04,730
they knew you were going to be
cool. We all agree to be cool.

1731
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:07,790
We can be cool. We can
have a better time here.

1732
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:12,340
We're wasting time with nonsense
and arguments at all and and,

1733
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:13,550
and conflict.

1734
01:43:13,551 --> 01:43:16,900
That all could have been disrupted
from the very beginning by everybody.

1735
01:43:17,070 --> 01:43:22,070
This is why we need the alien invasion
alien because a lot of people are

1736
01:43:22,171 --> 01:43:25,960
invested in our law and a lot of
shit that's meaningless. You know,

1737
01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:28,460
we won't even go into it.
We can all infer what they,

1738
01:43:28,461 --> 01:43:32,730
what those things are between us
and the audience can do the same.

1739
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:34,320
But what I'm saying is like,

1740
01:43:34,321 --> 01:43:38,880
there's just too much fucking bullshit
about dumb shit that we need some kind of

1741
01:43:38,881 --> 01:43:40,800
outside fucking focus

1742
01:43:43,530 --> 01:43:48,530
that will take us from outside ourselves
and make us focus on something else or

1743
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:50,790
legalize my showroom, which might be

1744
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,680
global warming, but that's,
that's not real right now.

1745
01:43:54,681 --> 01:43:58,080
Legalize mushrooms moved to Greenland.
Trump's on it. Is there a trick?

1746
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:02,363
[inaudible]

1747
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:08,780
canceled his fucking trip to Denmark
because they said they're not gonna sell

1748
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,440
him. Greenland is stuck in Chet now.
He knows what he's doing. Listen,

1749
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:16,930
Trump's going to get his green land
when you I, that fucking thing is like,

1750
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:21,590
I believe you said what? And
then it's like, oh man, I can't.

1751
01:44:21,591 --> 01:44:26,270
It's bizarro world. That's all. That's
all people go to Greenland to bow hand,

1752
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:30,950
Dubbo Hunt. I think they bow hunt that,
that gigantic fucking furry thing.

1753
01:44:30,951 --> 01:44:35,630
What is that thing called?
The muskox? Google.

1754
01:44:35,631 --> 01:44:38,570
Greenland. Muskox you ever see a
mouse? Cox? You want to sell it? What?

1755
01:44:38,571 --> 01:44:41,540
I want to see one and now I also want
to know when I'm getting invited for an

1756
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:44,880
elk barbecue. Dude, come
on. I mean I'm gonna,

1757
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:48,650
I'm going to put a kitchen in here,
in this place. I have, I have plans.

1758
01:44:48,651 --> 01:44:53,120
I'll tell you I'll come play it at
this. Let me show you a mustache.

1759
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:58,150
100% success rate on bowhunting and green
land on a muskox cause he just walked

1760
01:44:58,581 --> 01:45:01,260
right up to him. Oh, you know what
it is because they, they have a,

1761
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:03,380
an instinct protect
themselves against wolves.

1762
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:05,480
So they all huddled together when threats.

1763
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:09,260
So you could just catch them all
in a group. Lympho Huh? Yeah,

1764
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:11,390
but look what they look like
Bro. They didn't even look real.

1765
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:14,060
They look like something metal star
wars. Those are kind of interesting.

1766
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:18,440
But look, go to the side Jamie. Some of
those other images when you see, yeah,

1767
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,960
they're like that. Perfect. Like you
see that walking around, you'd be like,

1768
01:45:20,961 --> 01:45:24,540
what the fuck is that? And he
was like a Tauntaun. That's it.

1769
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:29,510
Same Lion fucked a elephant.

1770
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:33,410
Fucked a mammoth. What is
that? A buffalo. What is that?

1771
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:38,060
The fuck is that thing. It
was crazy as horns. Wild Mix.

1772
01:45:38,061 --> 01:45:43,061
I go buffalo with a Tina Turner wig and
duty can be 150 million degrees below

1773
01:45:43,101 --> 01:45:44,600
zero. Those things just chill.

1774
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:47,780
They're just out there eating frozen
grass and kids come from like their

1775
01:45:47,781 --> 01:45:52,280
cheekbones to the crazy looking barely
looks like a real thing. Barely.

1776
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:56,030
They're beautiful and apparently
he's good there apparently.

1777
01:45:56,031 --> 01:45:58,160
It's fucking fantastic. Yeah,

1778
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:04,370
that's awesome. My friend
Brendan Burns shot one and um,

1779
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:09,670
I think he said he got his either in an
Antarctica you can go to like really,

1780
01:46:09,831 --> 01:46:12,170
really cold climates and
get, I think it's like,

1781
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,670
is it north northern Canada or somewhere
in northern Canada where you hunt them

1782
01:46:16,671 --> 01:46:19,270
where it's crazy. Like you just get on a,

1783
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:25,060
you get to get pulled by g by snowmobiles
or you get pulled by dogs and you go

1784
01:46:26,061 --> 01:46:29,840
like way, way, way the fuck out.

1785
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:33,950
Where if you break down, if
your snowmobile breaks down
or if your dogs all die,

1786
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:38,690
you are fucked. I mean,
you are so, so, so, so,

1787
01:46:38,691 --> 01:46:41,930
so fucked because there's
nothing man, there's nothing.

1788
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:46,250
There's the occasional polar bear and
these fucking Muskox and they were up

1789
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:48,980
there and they're, they don't
even look like real things.

1790
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:53,280
And you're stumbling across like imagine
going through a white out snow storm to

1791
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:58,110
stumble a cost across
this 2000 pound, enormous,

1792
01:46:58,410 --> 01:46:59,580
gigantic,

1793
01:46:59,581 --> 01:47:04,320
hairy prehistoric beast that you could
just walk up to and shoot with a bow and

1794
01:47:04,321 --> 01:47:07,710
Arrow and eat. That's, that's
what's up there right now.

1795
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:10,050
They're like a remnant of the past,

1796
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:13,170
like to the saber to see
what they like with this.

1797
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:17,220
If the fight with those things, that'd
be crazy. Use it to fuck up other males.

1798
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:19,470
That's what most of those animals,

1799
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:21,480
they're not fighting off
predators with that shit.

1800
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:24,780
[inaudible] related to breeding
and all that. For sure.

1801
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:27,300
They think some of it
is like in some animals,

1802
01:47:27,301 --> 01:47:31,260
depending upon how much pressure
they get, um, from, uh, predators,

1803
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:33,900
like elk keep their antlers very late.

1804
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:38,220
They keep their antlers like into
march and April. Uh, because, uh,

1805
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:43,020
a lot of them live around wolves and the
idea is that they need those antlers to

1806
01:47:43,021 --> 01:47:46,110
protect themselves from wolves. So
they hold onto them longer than deer do

1807
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:52,140
biology. It's real crazy. Yeah,

1808
01:47:53,130 --> 01:47:56,310
dude, we're so lucky. We're so lucky.

1809
01:47:56,311 --> 01:47:59,550
We're out here out the
food chain. Oh my God.

1810
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:01,320
Not only out the few chain.

1811
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:05,790
You had to go right down the street
and get a fat stink tenor friend.

1812
01:48:06,510 --> 01:48:07,740
He just said on the agenda,

1813
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:12,560
I cannot the seed now and I would like
to do it soon. You know our spot? Yeah.

1814
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:16,860
I'm sparking this man. Oh, you're crazy.
Now, where does he live? On the edge.

1815
01:48:16,970 --> 01:48:21,530
Do you have to lie? Oh, I won't do
it. You don't use a lighter? Yeah.

1816
01:48:21,690 --> 01:48:23,280
I'm saying, oh, it's right here. Oh, okay.

1817
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,020
I thought maybe you were one of those.

1818
01:48:25,021 --> 01:48:28,710
I only use a mask and it will play into
the next tune. We're going to do that.

1819
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:32,010
Come off the top. Yeah, they
come off the top. Sorry,

1820
01:48:32,011 --> 01:48:35,490
I wasn't even thinking that way. Oh,
it's like a helmet. He kind of thing.

1821
01:48:35,491 --> 01:48:37,950
I see. I think they fucked
things up with that.

1822
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:42,000
That bony part in the front above their
eyebrows. They keep those for life too.

1823
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:45,930
It's not like a deer, you know? Good deer
loses their antlers every year. These,

1824
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,130
these motherfuckers fucked up here. Do

1825
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:54,420
they? Does this show beautiful
though? They're so beautiful.

1826
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:58,350
Like that one right there, Jamie.
Clickable hair for church right there.

1827
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:02,070
Like above. Above about right there.
Right there. Right there. Click on that.

1828
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:04,980
That's a beautiful creature. I mean,

1829
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:09,900
it's so amazing that nature
can make fish. It can make,

1830
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:13,980
it's a title Buffalo. You can make
that like buffalo or I don't know man.

1831
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:18,960
What is it? Bison related. Ox Ox.
Muskox aren't they all related?

1832
01:49:18,961 --> 01:49:19,794
Bison and all that.

1833
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:25,100
I wish I knew the kids. Kids. Facts,

1834
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:26,540
kids. Facts.

1835
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:33,310
Does it say it's cattle often compared
to cattle cow with a big coat.

1836
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:38,720
Yeah. That's a northern cow to
herbivore. Yeah. There you go. Wow.

1837
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:42,800
Furry island cow. Part of
the vote. Bovie day family.

1838
01:49:42,801 --> 01:49:45,890
All the species is family
of two towed hooves,

1839
01:49:46,190 --> 01:49:48,400
four chambered stomachs
and our herbivores.

1840
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:53,470
So it's like kind of a cow
type thing. Fuck. It's amazing.

1841
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:56,340
[inaudible] mutate them. Nope. Those,

1842
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:58,390
that's what we're supposed
to be right now. Well,

1843
01:49:58,391 --> 01:49:59,280
we're supposed to be right now.

1844
01:49:59,310 --> 01:50:03,550
Some sort of stupid fucking hairy dumb
ass is run around getting eaten by Shit

1845
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:05,410
with the aliens came
down and said, listen,

1846
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:09,130
let's just plant some of our stuff and
these monkeys and see what we can do.

1847
01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:11,800
I'm man, dude, when they coming back
from happened mass, what I'm saying,

1848
01:50:11,801 --> 01:50:14,730
when they coming back, probably
pretty soon it gotta be due.

1849
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,290
It's been brought up more and more in
the narrative and every time we go to

1850
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:21,640
sleep we wake up in a new universe
and I think along those lines that a,

1851
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:25,480
they're coming, they're on the way right
now. We're just not quite ready yet.

1852
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:29,560
Everlast maybe you are, but some
people are not. Some people,

1853
01:50:29,561 --> 01:50:33,020
if the aliens were hovering over
universal studios right now,

1854
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:38,280
guys lose their minds moving down to one
oh one over the Hollywood bowl saying,

1855
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:42,430
well we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,
we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,

1856
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:46,540
and those little fucking times is
the end or the beginning or whatever.

1857
01:50:46,541 --> 01:50:48,550
It would be amazing. It
would be very interesting.

1858
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:50,470
The whole thing would go
down, you know what I mean?

1859
01:50:50,471 --> 01:50:55,020
If it was the end of all the cool.
Yeah. Let's, I mean I'm not incur,

1860
01:50:55,070 --> 01:50:58,030
I'm not saying hey, break it off, but
I'm saying if that's what it is it is,

1861
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:02,020
or if it's the next stage of like
enlightenment and fucking, you know,

1862
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,340
all that goodness.

1863
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:07,480
What do you think people do if one of
them like hovered over every major city?

1864
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:10,031
You know what?

1865
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:15,031
I think what we're talking about is what
would the majorly religious do because

1866
01:51:15,431 --> 01:51:19,900
I think that would affect religious
thought the most. Right off top.

1867
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:23,230
You know what I mean? Besides
the fear of like what are they?

1868
01:51:23,231 --> 01:51:26,740
What are they here for? Right.
The first thing was like, Whoa,

1869
01:51:26,741 --> 01:51:29,980
a whole bunch of ideology goes
out the fucking window right now.

1870
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:32,410
You know?

1871
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:37,120
So that would cause a lot of panic and
anxiety right there alone. You know,

1872
01:51:37,121 --> 01:51:40,240
you tell them your, your, your
whatever story of whatever religion.

1873
01:51:40,241 --> 01:51:43,200
I'm not going. Yeah, we didn't
even go there. We were like that.

1874
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:46,000
I like that thing. Let's
look blanket it. Yeah.

1875
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:50,380
It's going to upset a lot of fo. You
know what I mean? Right away. Just like,

1876
01:51:50,381 --> 01:51:54,790
oh my God, that's not what we thought
existed. We're the center of everything.

1877
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:56,110
You know, I think it would happen.

1878
01:51:56,260 --> 01:52:00,790
I think people would just start fucking
flat earthers go out the window right

1879
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:02,470
away. That's is over.

1880
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:05,990
Maybe like the aliens travel
here from another dimension,

1881
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:07,420
they have a new explanation for it.

1882
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:11,380
[inaudible] the thing about like being
a flat earth or the thing about any kind

1883
01:52:11,381 --> 01:52:16,381
of like thing that you could decide was
already proven is that it doesn't matter

1884
01:52:16,601 --> 01:52:19,780
what the facts are anymore. What
matters is what people agree to.

1885
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:21,580
That's what's interesting about it.

1886
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,760
Like you realize that there's like a
certain number of people you need to have

1887
01:52:24,761 --> 01:52:27,310
to start a community and it
doesn't have to make sense.

1888
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,440
You just have to have enough
people that agree to it.

1889
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:33,880
If enough people agree to it,
you can, uh, you can push,

1890
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:38,200
you can push some pretty preposterous
ideas through and a bunch of people hop on

1891
01:52:38,201 --> 01:52:41,560
board and they're happy to be on your
group. That's the problem of groups.

1892
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:44,320
The problem with groups is
people would just join groups.

1893
01:52:44,350 --> 01:52:46,190
Isn't that the big lie? The big lie

1894
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:50,810
there? They're being lie thing. Their
whole mind comp. Yup. Big Lie theory.

1895
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:52,690
I believe that's theory. Oh Dyke where I'm

1896
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:56,710
quoting that from. But I mean even
if you think about a country, right?

1897
01:52:56,711 --> 01:52:58,660
You think about a country
and you think about America,

1898
01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:01,210
which we both love and live in. Yes sir.

1899
01:53:01,830 --> 01:53:06,070
W It's what is it? You
know, it's an idea, right?

1900
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:07,353
It's an idea.

1901
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:10,840
It's an idea that everybody who's
in this thing is cool to each other.

1902
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:15,280
Everybody's in this thing as part
of a team. That's really what it is.

1903
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,580
Bring us your broken mass and all
that stuff from them in front of the,

1904
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:21,320
from the Statue of Liberty.
Some more. I've been thinking,

1905
01:53:21,321 --> 01:53:25,010
I think about this thing, your huddled
masses is that that am I getting it?

1906
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:28,250
It's been a while and I know
I'm 50. You know what I mean?

1907
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:33,310
You're saying it's um, like whatever.

1908
01:53:33,311 --> 01:53:37,990
We are like B, we are what we
agree we are. We are all, we agree.

1909
01:53:37,991 --> 01:53:39,610
We are like we don't,

1910
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:43,960
it's most of what we're in
conflict about is fucking stupid.

1911
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:46,850
And as a country like
we're supposed to be a,

1912
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:48,880
we're supposed to agree that
we're all in this together.

1913
01:53:48,881 --> 01:53:51,040
So if we're all in this together,
it should be good for everybody.

1914
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:56,200
We could do that. We could do that
better than we think we can. Way better,

1915
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:00,640
way better after. The problem is the
conflict. Some of it's unnecessary, man,

1916
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:02,613
boom.

1917
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:06,420
That's a good sound effect
for that month. Perfect.

1918
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:11,500
It's, you know, some of it is just
unnecessary in these these moments, man.

1919
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:14,590
It's moments when we have fun
moments, when we get together,

1920
01:54:14,591 --> 01:54:17,800
moments when we hug moments when
we'll have a drink together, homeless,

1921
01:54:17,801 --> 01:54:21,980
we'll listen to some music moms when
we're all leaving a concert together,

1922
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,930
a movie together that we realize like
Raul in this together, we're all right.

1923
01:54:26,290 --> 01:54:28,840
It's just like, can we just got to
navigate it better? That's all it is.

1924
01:54:28,841 --> 01:54:29,980
We're crashing into each other.

1925
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:35,030
I honestly, he goes, he moments we
mourn together. I mean honestly, I mean,

1926
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:38,440
I hate to say this but you know,
I've see a lot of my older friends,

1927
01:54:38,441 --> 01:54:43,090
more funerals lately than other events
and, but they turned into celebrations,

1928
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:47,830
if you know what I mean. Cause we all
understand like, all right man, well, Hey,

1929
01:54:47,831 --> 01:54:51,760
I'm glad I am seeing you right
now. Let's fucking, yeah, you know,

1930
01:54:51,761 --> 01:54:55,450
and whoever it was that we're
celebrating definitely doesn't want that.

1931
01:54:55,451 --> 01:54:57,520
They want this for sure.

1932
01:54:57,521 --> 01:55:02,200
I know when I go party the fuck up
party fuck up and say like, yeah,

1933
01:55:02,201 --> 01:55:06,390
God did. I did. I, he did. Was
a pretty good dad ever. You,

1934
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:10,600
I've made a few bucks, made a
few bucks. That's Dana Man. Dana,

1935
01:55:10,601 --> 01:55:14,410
just play that song no matter what I man
got love. I gotta get my 25 sets, man.

1936
01:55:14,411 --> 01:55:17,650
I gotta get my 20 slap sets
every episode, dog. Man, come on.

1937
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:20,270
You begrudge me my 25 cents. I love it.

1938
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:25,840
I was walking out of the Octagon, I
forget who, uh, who I was interviewing.

1939
01:55:25,841 --> 01:55:28,180
My favorite is this, every once in awhile,

1940
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:31,790
like there's a few people who choose
that song. Like, uh, Cynthia Cub.

1941
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:35,230
Kavio well, let's get out. Shout out
to the first. Marcus Davis. Yeah.

1942
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:36,570
Marcus Degas. He did.

1943
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:40,360
He did the first day and then
he went into the Trump around.

1944
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:42,370
But some people every once
in a while, I don't know,

1945
01:55:42,371 --> 01:55:45,600
maybe if they a bad song or something
like out of nowhere, out of nowhere.

1946
01:55:45,601 --> 01:55:50,520
One time like Leo Machida came out to
jump around and I'm like, I texted dean,

1947
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:52,950
I was like, who the fuck
picked daddy? He's like, I did.

1948
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:56,010
And he said [inaudible] he didn't
go any further. And I was like,

1949
01:55:56,011 --> 01:56:00,390
oh he must've picked the song. Dana
hated her so well. Some of these cats,

1950
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:04,800
they'll choose music and Jan, it was
like, Nah. And I think the Goto Jam,

1951
01:56:04,801 --> 01:56:06,660
if you fucking picks
it up, he doesn't like

1952
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:14,690
cause I'll be like, that was
random man. I was like, how did,

1953
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,680
how did that happen? It's funny.

1954
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:18,960
It's funny when there's a
song that plays all the time,

1955
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,130
it connects you to one of your friends.

1956
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:23,360
It's like as I'm walking out
of the octagon, it's like, eh.

1957
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:32,090
There was a period of about six
years where anywhere Dana was,

1958
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:36,480
it could be, I could be, he could be
on this side of world. I'm sleeping,

1959
01:56:36,710 --> 01:56:41,160
so I'd get a phone call and it'd
just be a phone in the air at a club.

1960
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:45,360
People play. I feel like, dude, come on.

1961
01:56:45,450 --> 01:56:48,150
You guys nailed that song so hard.

1962
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:53,080
There's like moments in space time
that get nailed. Just like you, you,

1963
01:56:53,090 --> 01:56:57,870
you just hit something that
resonates with people. I uh,

1964
01:56:57,930 --> 01:57:02,520
I, uh, I, I still, uh, Danny's
quote Danny Boy's quote of, uh,

1965
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:07,260
it's the Louie Louie of the 90s.
It's the way little, it's just there.

1966
01:57:07,261 --> 01:57:10,530
It's part of the like, it's,
it's almost not mine anymore.

1967
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:15,450
It's like belongs to the universe.
It's weird. Every ball game I go to,

1968
01:57:15,451 --> 01:57:18,180
any event I go to, it gets played.

1969
01:57:18,770 --> 01:57:22,560
And it's not even like a big deal about,
it's like some places it's a big deal.

1970
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,820
Like you get these football games,

1971
01:57:23,821 --> 01:57:27,300
college shit like Wisconsin's and stuff
where it's like part of a tradition.

1972
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:28,140
What I'm saying,

1973
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:33,140
any event or an angels game or dodger
game or Yankees game or Laker game or

1974
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:37,440
football game, it's, it pops
up somewhere along the line.

1975
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:41,670
You're right up there with queen.
It's crazy. It's wild. I mean,

1976
01:57:41,671 --> 01:57:46,050
as you're talking about songs like
individual songs and their imprint on

1977
01:57:46,051 --> 01:57:50,640
something, it's bananas. It's, it's,
it's something to like, I can't,

1978
01:57:50,641 --> 01:57:53,880
you can't almost invest your thought
in it because it can get like, whoa,

1979
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:58,470
it's really kind of a part
of, of of pop culture.

1980
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,790
It's ingrained on a,
uh, on, on an America.

1981
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:04,410
It's an American
phenomenon. And worldwide.

1982
01:58:04,411 --> 01:58:07,080
I mean like worldwide.
I mean, where did you,

1983
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:11,710
can you go where they probably never
heard jump around. It's weird. I mean,

1984
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:14,580
to think about it on that level is crazy.

1985
01:58:14,610 --> 01:58:17,400
Maybe like one of them places
where Trump's trying to
buy maybe up in Greenland.

1986
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:21,840
No, no, they heard it. They heard it.

1987
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:26,930
Queen had, we are the
champions and, and, and uh,

1988
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:28,470
it also had, we will rock you.

1989
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,290
Those are two of the greatest
sports anthems of all time.

1990
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:35,100
Queen nailed two of them. Like one
of the fucking Panas do of them.

1991
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:39,300
We will rock you and we are the
champions. It's actually the same song.

1992
01:58:39,570 --> 01:58:41,740
Two is the same song, isn't it?

1993
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:45,420
Yeah. They blend into each other.
Different songs. They kind of, they're,

1994
01:58:45,421 --> 01:58:48,580
they're technically connected.
He had to buy them on iTunes.

1995
01:58:48,581 --> 01:58:51,360
You have to buy two songs I think.
Is it a slash in there? Is it?

1996
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:54,100
Or we will rock you. We are the champions.
They come together on the record.

1997
01:58:54,101 --> 01:58:56,640
When the record came out, they went
right back to back. Yeah, it doesn't,

1998
01:58:56,650 --> 01:59:01,060
there's no space three or
was it recognized as one
individual song? The label,

1999
01:59:01,061 --> 01:59:04,480
it was listed as two different titles.
Two different titles. You're not,

2000
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:08,530
you're not miked up, people can't hear
you. So I'm trying to, oh sorry. Yeah,

2001
01:59:08,610 --> 01:59:12,460
here you go. Here we go. Sorry DJ man.

2002
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:15,100
So that was actually one of the
first albums I got when I was a kid.

2003
01:59:15,101 --> 01:59:19,090
But on the actual label, which
has like the titles of the songs,

2004
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:22,390
they were listed as two different
titles. But on the actual vinyl,

2005
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:24,430
the surface of the
record, it was one groove.

2006
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:27,000
So the songs just went
right into each other. So,

2007
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:30,580
so if you were in a diner and you put
like those quarters in that thing and you

2008
01:59:30,581 --> 01:59:33,760
played that right, give you one
song or would he give you no,

2009
01:59:33,761 --> 01:59:38,410
it usually gives you both. It
gives you both. Good question man.

2010
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:43,210
For Man, diner music. I
was listening to my memory.

2011
01:59:43,211 --> 01:59:45,490
That microphone. I feel like
my memory, I'll share with you.

2012
01:59:45,491 --> 01:59:47,080
We share where I feel like my memory,

2013
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:52,081
I see like a we will rock you slash we
are the champions thing like going on and

2014
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:54,011
[inaudible] it's like,

2015
01:59:54,011 --> 01:59:56,920
I feel like you would've got both
songs cause they don't remember.

2016
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:59,860
There is no stop. There's not even
a clean place to edit it really.

2017
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:02,620
If I'm right. It's crazy
that it's two songs.

2018
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:05,660
Do you remember those wheels of the diners
in the east coast and when they roll

2019
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:10,990
it's kind of where the
champion, oh so it's two songs,

2020
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:16,750
one song, two songs, but it's one. So I
was just driving a year 45 it only has,

2021
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:18,310
we will rock you on one side. That's,

2022
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:24,790
I was driving a u haul truck last
weekend. I'm in the process of moving.

2023
02:00:24,791 --> 02:00:27,460
So all you had while
we had was amfm radio.

2024
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:31,750
So I was listening to k Earth one-on-one
and we will rock you came on and right

2025
02:00:31,751 --> 02:00:35,790
away came we are the champions.
So I played it as one song now.

2026
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:39,860
Well they go together, you
know, perfectly percent.

2027
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:44,520
It seems like it's almost, but it is
clearly two different jams. Right?

2028
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:45,423
It's great.

2029
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:51,310
Similar themes like goddamn wizard
wacky. We are the champions.

2030
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:52,600
That band they were,

2031
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:57,760
they were really sorcerers know he
was amazing. Freddy Mercury was wow.

2032
02:00:57,761 --> 02:01:02,020
He was amazed. He was crazy.
He was on your vocal on stage.

2033
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:07,840
Just a masterpiece of Bohemian rhapsody
alone. It's just crazy. I know, right?

2034
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:12,010
Like can you think of like rock albums
and you think of songs and you think of

2035
02:01:12,011 --> 02:01:13,180
that one. You're like, why?

2036
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:17,770
Like I write these little three chord
songs with a nice story over and shit and

2037
02:01:18,090 --> 02:01:22,960
this month this dude was
doing like fucking 16 part
harmonies of bis mill long.

2038
02:01:22,961 --> 02:01:26,620
No, we will not let you go.
Like wrote like a rock opera,

2039
02:01:26,621 --> 02:01:30,490
like within four or five
minutes. It was fucking bananas.

2040
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:34,970
How genius that Shit is. It's great to
listen to like it's super entertaining.

2041
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:39,290
It's captivating. He was a damn

2042
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:45,020
God damn hero. Yeah,
for sure. Right Freddy?

2043
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:47,750
Yeah. This isn't, I
haven't seen the movie.

2044
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,580
I wouldn't to say I haven't
seen the movie though.

2045
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:53,360
After they stopped having fucking
[inaudible] do it. I'm like, I'm out.

2046
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:58,580
We're see. Cause I like, I liked the
show. That guy's on that Mr. Robot.

2047
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,380
I'm sure I'd like him to,

2048
02:02:00,381 --> 02:02:05,240
but it doesn't matter that you tease
me with Allie g and then you pull them

2049
02:02:05,241 --> 02:02:08,900
away. I don't know. I mean
that's not why I didn't see it.

2050
02:02:08,901 --> 02:02:10,010
I just haven't had the chance.

2051
02:02:10,011 --> 02:02:15,010
But I heard that bore out wanting to
do a lot of like a crazy dre. He was,

2052
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:19,280
yeah, he probably wanted to do all the,
you wonder, have dongs flapping around.

2053
02:02:19,281 --> 02:02:21,770
You know what I mean? He wanted all
that. He wanted to go the other,

2054
02:02:21,771 --> 02:02:24,380
he wanted to go the dark side of
Freddy who wanted to be buck wild.

2055
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:25,940
I'm sure the guy who
did it did a great job.

2056
02:02:25,941 --> 02:02:28,850
The problem is whenever someone gets
attached to the idea of someone else doing

2057
02:02:28,851 --> 02:02:31,490
it and then the new guy comes
in, he's forever tainted,

2058
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:35,900
but if you haven't and you ever
go on t v Little Show binges,

2059
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:40,250
that guy's show, Mr. Robot is really
good. It's pretty fucking good.

2060
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,900
Pretty fucking good. I've heard it's
really fun. It's fucking like bizarre,

2061
02:02:44,901 --> 02:02:48,820
like futuristic hacker weirdness.
It's fucking, it's pretty dope too.

2062
02:02:48,850 --> 02:02:51,770
This is the best time ever. If
you want to just sit and watch TV,

2063
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:55,850
like is there a better time that's
ever existed? Dude, get smoke weed.

2064
02:02:56,190 --> 02:02:59,570
It's legal. Just sit. Watch
42 episodes of a show.

2065
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,580
I don't curse too much this behavior,

2066
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:05,420
but occasionally I think it's important
and probably even therapeutical,

2067
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:08,660
but if you could just sit down
and watch something on TV,

2068
02:03:08,661 --> 02:03:12,290
there's more shit to watch today than
the human race has ever seen, ever.

2069
02:03:12,291 --> 02:03:13,124
That's a fact.

2070
02:03:13,350 --> 02:03:16,670
Then make a new TV shows every goddamn
minute they're happening right now.

2071
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:19,250
They're putting them out on Hulu.
They're putting them out on Amazon.

2072
02:03:19,251 --> 02:03:20,360
They're putting them out on Netflix.

2073
02:03:20,361 --> 02:03:25,361
They don't even stagger them now they
drop an entire season tickets out,

2074
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:30,180
watch it, deal with it, deal with it.
Bitch. You watched stranger things? Yes,

2075
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:34,400
I'm an episode five. Don't tell me Shit
of what the most reasons seasoning.

2076
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:38,630
Everybody's skish. It's good.
It's good. I enjoy it. I enjoy it.

2077
02:03:38,730 --> 02:03:42,290
I can't tell you I enjoy it. No, I
ain't going to tell you anything else.

2078
02:03:42,291 --> 02:03:44,780
A little bit better than good. I'll
tell you a couple of good ones.

2079
02:03:44,781 --> 02:03:49,310
I enjoy a couple of good ones. I
enjoy you. Fuck with Ozark. Oh Dude,

2080
02:03:49,311 --> 02:03:53,690
do I fuck. Okay. There we go. There's
Ozar, man. What did I give up one?

2081
02:03:53,691 --> 02:03:55,490
It wouldn't be Ozar. They canceled it,

2082
02:03:55,491 --> 02:03:58,100
but the seasons that exist
are fucking hilarious.

2083
02:03:58,101 --> 02:04:01,340
You have you watched this
Santa Clarita Diet? No,

2084
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:05,000
it's with Drew Barrymore and
I'm the guy from Timothy.

2085
02:04:05,001 --> 02:04:09,860
Timothy Ola fan from like
a deadwood. That Guy Yo.

2086
02:04:10,130 --> 02:04:13,010
It's like I w I'm not even
gonna say anything else but yo,

2087
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:15,800
y'all can come thank me
later. Go check that shit out.

2088
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:18,380
It's like two seasons of it and
they canceled it for some reason.

2089
02:04:18,381 --> 02:04:20,630
Hopefully they'll bring it back
if a lot of enough people like it.

2090
02:04:20,631 --> 02:04:22,340
But I'm telling you,
it's fucking hilarious.

2091
02:04:22,341 --> 02:04:24,380
It's like if you like
Zombie kind of weirdness,

2092
02:04:24,710 --> 02:04:27,710
but it ain't really scary and it's
fucking hilarious is what it is.

2093
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:31,670
It's craziness. Beautiful. If you ever
watched the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,

2094
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:36,380
I have not got to watch that. Check it
out. That is a god damn a Larry Show.

2095
02:04:36,530 --> 02:04:39,000
That's a good to sit down with
your wife because you'll laugh.

2096
02:04:39,001 --> 02:04:42,540
Your ass always look shells. She'll
love it. Listen, it's hilarious.

2097
02:04:42,541 --> 02:04:43,760
It's about a lady who, uh,

2098
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:47,970
was in a call and she got locked up in a
basement for like 13 years and then she

2099
02:04:47,971 --> 02:04:49,950
got out. She doesn't know
what the fuck anything is,

2100
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:54,090
but she's hilariously optimistic.
It's really [inaudible] on this one.

2101
02:04:54,090 --> 02:04:54,691
It's not that,

2102
02:04:54,691 --> 02:04:58,290
but it's like this lady like chick comic
and I don't remember her name and I

2103
02:04:58,450 --> 02:05:00,330
don't know them. They show right
now, but it's fucking hilarious.

2104
02:05:00,331 --> 02:05:04,170
And she's like a Larry. David is
chick. Like she's Larry. David ask,

2105
02:05:04,171 --> 02:05:05,910
I should say like the show is like,

2106
02:05:06,090 --> 02:05:09,210
she's always like the fucking mom who's
like fucking doing some crazy shit.

2107
02:05:09,211 --> 02:05:12,120
There's like an episode of like where
there's a mom amongst the crew that's like

2108
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:15,180
done porno and so all the moms
are talking about, but like,

2109
02:05:15,210 --> 02:05:18,690
the fucking show's hilarious. I
gotta. Oh man, I can't remember.

2110
02:05:19,330 --> 02:05:22,020
You know what that is, Jim? I've got
to think of the show. Who's in it?

2111
02:05:22,210 --> 02:05:24,360
What are the actors? I don't
know. That's what I'm saying.

2112
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:28,710
I've watched it with my wife sometimes
and I'm just gonna get the name of it

2113
02:05:28,711 --> 02:05:33,480
real quick while we're here.
No, no, it's definitely,

2114
02:05:34,370 --> 02:05:38,620
definitely uh, uh,

2115
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:42,840
it's some like no apologies or a pot.
Something about apology. Sorry. Not,

2116
02:05:42,841 --> 02:05:45,810
sorry. Okay. Fucking
shit is hilarious, dude.

2117
02:05:45,811 --> 02:05:50,040
That lady is fucking hilarious. Was
that, I don't know her name. I'm sorry,

2118
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:53,860
but savage. There you go. She's sound
savvy. She's fucking funny duty.

2119
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:55,650
This savage to show is
pretty sad, but it's like,

2120
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:59,760
it's like some dirty Larry David
kind of fives. Kind of a burden.

2121
02:05:59,761 --> 02:06:02,160
Do you have with a name like
savage, like you had to produce.

2122
02:06:02,670 --> 02:06:05,340
You can't run around and be lazy
with it and you can't, you can't.

2123
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:07,320
You gotta bring it. Bob Savage,

2124
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:13,260
savage sitting there
smelling his own farts. What?

2125
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:18,300
Jamie's got a panic. I googled that.
I just googled that. Sorry. Not Sorry.

2126
02:06:18,301 --> 02:06:20,880
With the man of savage now,
like nothing came up then. Oh,

2127
02:06:20,910 --> 02:06:23,730
that's what your article up there. That's
definitely it because I've known my,

2128
02:06:24,020 --> 02:06:26,310
I was why I was saying apologies
or something. Sorry. No, sorry.

2129
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:31,140
Article I had there she goes, that's
her. Oh, she's fucking hilarious. On her.

2130
02:06:31,170 --> 02:06:33,780
Unapologetic new comedy
could find, I'm sorry.

2131
02:06:33,781 --> 02:06:37,080
I'm sorry that the show is called.
I'm sorry. The arms are titled, sorry,

2132
02:06:37,081 --> 02:06:41,280
not sorry. There you go. I knew it was
an apology or something like that. God,

2133
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:45,720
it's fucking hilarious. We're doing this
research that has this kind of reach,

2134
02:06:47,580 --> 02:06:50,310
but you guys are winging it. It's kind
of what a lot of ways, dude, like,

2135
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:52,890
I mean, it's kind of beautiful.
It's the beauty of the show though.

2136
02:06:52,891 --> 02:06:57,690
A little bit the same as 100% winged. He
goes with us. I'm sitting a little bit,

2137
02:06:57,691 --> 02:06:58,524
but yeah,

2138
02:07:04,230 --> 02:07:07,620
don't be scared of homie.com shout
out to Nate Diaz. Victorious.

2139
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:13,110
Shout out to Anthony Pettis. Gladiator
the good fight. It was great fun.

2140
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:17,920
I totally agree with the outcome.
Yes. Oh definitely. Definitely Nate.

2141
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:20,190
Nate won that fight for sure. I was,

2142
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:23,940
I was complimented when I walked into
Dana's green room and was told I smelled

2143
02:07:23,941 --> 02:07:26,010
like I just came from
needy. It's his camp.

2144
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:33,180
It was amazing. I have it. I love
that. Thank God for that guy.

2145
02:07:33,181 --> 02:07:36,310
Fucks given his like at an all time. No,

2146
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:40,100
all time low. Thank God for that guy.
He's so important. Just be you. Yeah.

2147
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:42,320
Love that car. That's what he's doing.

2148
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:46,490
I mean he and he's fighting for the
baddest motherfucker at one 70 right? Yes,

2149
02:07:46,670 --> 02:07:49,280
yes. Yeah. Fuck. Cutting
weight. His need to cut weight.

2150
02:07:49,730 --> 02:07:52,790
But I love what he's talking
about fighting for the
baddest motherfucker in the

2151
02:07:52,791 --> 02:07:53,624
game.

2152
02:07:55,090 --> 02:07:58,460
Oh my goodness. So that's the belt he's
referring to. Okay. Cause I was like,

2153
02:07:58,461 --> 02:08:01,130
this was for a belt and there's only
three rounds. I was like, wait a minute.

2154
02:08:01,131 --> 02:08:03,830
I'm just so confused
thinking about. I was so,

2155
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:05,300
I was a little high and drunk myself

2156
02:08:05,880 --> 02:08:08,230
thinking about trying to get them to
explain that to people, but I was like,

2157
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:09,670
I'm gonna just let him go. I don't,

2158
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:10,840
I don't even want to get
in the way of [inaudible].

2159
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:13,200
I'm glad I know now what
belt he's talking about.

2160
02:08:13,201 --> 02:08:16,160
He's talked about it multiple
times. That's a great
fight. He called down, said,

2161
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:18,270
dad, he said, defend this
belt. And I was like, yeah,

2162
02:08:18,430 --> 02:08:20,770
okay. He's talking about the baddest
motherfucker in the game belt.

2163
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:23,460
I thought he was going to say it, but I,

2164
02:08:23,461 --> 02:08:25,390
I probably should have
asked him what belt it was.

2165
02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:29,390
No, it's more beautiful like that.
There's like this. No, it's perfect.

2166
02:08:29,391 --> 02:08:33,050
It's like an Easter egg.
[inaudible] what a great name.

2167
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:35,660
The baddest motherfucker in the game belt.

2168
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:41,570
We should be so happy.
That guy's a real thing.

2169
02:08:41,930 --> 02:08:44,660
We should be so happy in that
fight. It would be amazing.

2170
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:49,030
Yeah, man. That would be incredible.
Mazda dolls, a straight up murderer.

2171
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:52,270
He's a straight up murderer.
Toes Nate. That'd be chaos.

2172
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:54,940
That'd be chaos if then
those two guys want to do it.

2173
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:59,620
Those are two mean just
wild dogs going at it.

2174
02:08:59,650 --> 02:09:02,590
Those guys are both like
to the core. They're there.

2175
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:06,580
They're fighters to the core. There's
no quit in either one of those guys.

2176
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:12,670
I mean that's a wild fight, man.
Especially right now, like financially,

2177
02:09:12,671 --> 02:09:14,200
that's an amazing fight right now.

2178
02:09:14,201 --> 02:09:16,660
People would pay a lot of
money to see that fight.

2179
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:18,890
Mazda Dal and Nate Diaz there.

2180
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:24,180
Those are two guys that are like the most
exciting and most talked about guys in

2181
02:09:24,311 --> 02:09:29,190
the sport right now. If those guys
decided to fucking smash horns, Woo.

2182
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:34,840
Good. It looked like they were more
than willing. Yeah, I hope to make that.

2183
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:38,020
That would be, that would be an amazing
fight. Hope to make that happen.

2184
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:41,290
That'd be God Damn Bananas and maybe
one of us will come out to turn around

2185
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:46,900
if they pick something shitty enough. No,

2186
02:09:47,090 --> 02:09:47,691
at their level.

2187
02:09:47,691 --> 02:09:50,600
I think they get to pick their own
music as long as they don't have,

2188
02:09:50,601 --> 02:09:54,140
like we were talking about,
wait, wait. But Leo, Leo Machida,

2189
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:56,360
I want to know the story behind that.

2190
02:09:56,361 --> 02:09:58,690
One day I'm going to corner day and
everyone were like, you know, when this,

2191
02:09:58,730 --> 02:10:03,320
when he's not the fucking busiest dude
on earth and, and be like, what the fuck?

2192
02:10:03,490 --> 02:10:06,640
What happened? What Song did
he pick? And you were mad,

2193
02:10:06,641 --> 02:10:09,950
which the auto fight was that? I don't
know man. I'm sure somebody knows.

2194
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:14,330
I wonder if he won cause that will be
interesting. I think fuck was vibe.

2195
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:15,500
I'm not sure.

2196
02:10:15,590 --> 02:10:19,850
I think he did because I keep track
of shit like that cause it's fucking,

2197
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:24,070
I hate it almost when somebody, because
one of my favorite guys, um, uh,

2198
02:10:24,870 --> 02:10:29,420
oh my God, uh, the beard, uh,

2199
02:10:29,870 --> 02:10:33,620
super duper friends with
Tate. Uh, thank you.

2200
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:38,960
Mean the dean of mean, do you know KCI
Giardia? He came out to my version of,

2201
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:40,190
of fucking, uh,

2202
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:44,570
Folsom prison and I was so jacked about
it and he lost that fight and I felt

2203
02:10:44,571 --> 02:10:49,100
like it made me feel horrible.
Like, Oh man, my, Oh,

2204
02:10:49,101 --> 02:10:53,210
this is Chris Weidman when he fought
Liotta cheat. Oh, that's what it was.

2205
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:57,890
That's when the auto c you put the
Kabash on Liotta. Oh, so he, yeah, he,

2206
02:10:58,060 --> 02:10:59,990
let's see. See I took was, look man,

2207
02:10:59,991 --> 02:11:03,830
I didn't ask for that
fucking ass for that dude.

2208
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:09,350
I don't need that pressure. That wasn't
going to say come pick my shit song.

2209
02:11:09,351 --> 02:11:12,290
Wasn't gonna save him. You know what I
mean? That's one of those weird ones.

2210
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:13,010
It's like, what is,

2211
02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:16,580
how bad is the song that you won't
let a person pick their own songs?

2212
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:20,480
That's what I want to know. It's not
that much time. I mean, it's only like a,

2213
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:24,380
the walk to the ox guys, not a full song.
It's not like three minutes, but it,

2214
02:11:24,381 --> 02:11:28,430
all those Brazilian guys always come
out today, eh, eh. You know what I mean?

2215
02:11:28,431 --> 02:11:32,360
Like fucking a, they can come
up to the fucking loudest music.

2216
02:11:32,361 --> 02:11:33,230
Some of those dudes,

2217
02:11:33,770 --> 02:11:38,770
not dax murderer used to come out to
some real questionable fucking like touch

2218
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:39,980
disco house.

2219
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:49,190
He came out to like rock tech. You
crazy. Oh my God. Yeah, that's right.

2220
02:11:49,550 --> 02:11:51,740
Dutch does Swedish house Mafia.

2221
02:11:55,730 --> 02:11:59,000
Oh my God, you're so right. Crazy.

2222
02:12:00,710 --> 02:12:04,540
That's exactly what he's coming
out to though. [inaudible] like

2223
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:09,050
overtly like over the top two. Number one.

2224
02:12:09,051 --> 02:12:10,970
Worst dorm number one worst walkout song.

2225
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:21,950
My favorite was when Randy coture
came out to Ted Nugent stranglehold.

2226
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:26,830
I was like, if there is ever a
song that's like design like that,

2227
02:12:26,831 --> 02:12:29,660
that seems like a fun fight playing song.

2228
02:12:30,110 --> 02:12:31,670
You know like you're
about to have a fight.

2229
02:12:32,070 --> 02:12:36,110
That's the song you want plant
stranglehold. Michael Kia sees that too.

2230
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:41,540
A couple of guys he just trying to hold
now that's a song like stranglehold and

2231
02:12:42,230 --> 02:12:45,690
it's one of those songs.
Anything by AC DC. Oh yeah.

2232
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:50,390
Thunderstruck come out to a fight.
Cool. Yeah, just that good Angus.

2233
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:54,890
His tone on the guitar, it's
over. You got anger, right?

2234
02:12:55,250 --> 02:12:56,270
Got some nice

2235
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:03,230
rich Franklin used to come out the
thunderstruck when he was the middleweight

2236
02:13:03,231 --> 02:13:04,064
champion

2237
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:16,040
does that. This came up to, I know he
definitely came out to an ACDC song.

2238
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:18,470
Now I think shit is, it feels like right.

2239
02:13:18,471 --> 02:13:21,960
Questioning that was big
like right then to, yeah,

2240
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:26,600
AC DC is like one of those bands where
you hear like three or four chords.

2241
02:13:26,601 --> 02:13:30,800
You're like ac DC like instantly,
like for Angus young again,

2242
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:35,010
this guitar tone just as what's
called for those about to rock. Oh,

2243
02:13:35,011 --> 02:13:39,480
he came up to ask for those ABAP
to come out to a fender struck too.

2244
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:42,360
I think when he fought Anderson
Silva, you're about to find this.

2245
02:13:42,650 --> 02:13:46,440
Guess he won 26 he did the for
those about which a fight was that?

2246
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,353
Who was he fighting?

2247
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:51,750
I think for sure he came out the
thunderstruck cause school is your friend.

2248
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:55,620
He was a, he was an DC dude. Oh,
well he fought for his girlfriend.

2249
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:57,060
He was at ac DC. Dude,

2250
02:14:00,090 --> 02:14:03,620
you think about w walk out music as
big as it was. It's a nice someone.

2251
02:14:03,770 --> 02:14:07,320
Their walkout music was that chuck
Liddell, he beat with a broken arm,

2252
02:14:07,321 --> 02:14:10,800
like Chaz kicked him in the arm broken.
I think. I feel like I was there,

2253
02:14:10,801 --> 02:14:14,430
but I might not, I might just even seen
it on TV. He caught his on where it was.

2254
02:14:14,431 --> 02:14:18,090
I don't know. Chuck broke his arm
in the first round and then he, um,

2255
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:20,070
he clipped him with a
punch with his other hand,

2256
02:14:20,130 --> 02:14:24,050
like when everybody should with a broken
arm. That was crazy. Yeah, same song,

2257
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:29,220
UFC 72. Okay. Maybe that was the
song for those about to rock. Hmm.

2258
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:32,970
Great Song. Either way. Like
I, I, when everybody hit me,

2259
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:37,140
I apparently when Steve pay
knocked out DC, like there's a,

2260
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:42,060
that angle where I was like, Oh, you saw
me? And then like recently I saw the,

2261
02:14:42,061 --> 02:14:45,510
did you ever see the meme with Khabib
where he's like staring at counter?

2262
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:47,790
Like after knocking out fucking,

2263
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:51,390
I think it's a Josie and like it's me,

2264
02:14:51,391 --> 02:14:54,230
like I'm like talking
to like fucking cubby,

2265
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:58,440
but he's just staring like this and like
there's a meme that just like focuses

2266
02:14:58,441 --> 02:15:01,520
in on him. Like it's fucking crazy
side. Like it's got me thinking like,

2267
02:15:01,521 --> 02:15:02,580
I wonder how I'd be, like I said,

2268
02:15:02,581 --> 02:15:06,080
I've been to so many of these fucking
fights that I don't even, you know,

2269
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:09,180
I was like trying to remember and it's
like, I can't even remember. Yeah.

2270
02:15:09,181 --> 02:15:13,740
You've been coming to him almost as long
as I've been working for the UFC. Yeah,

2271
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:18,480
basically close to it. Not as,
but Clo in the neighborhood.

2272
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:21,780
Know what I mean? A couple
of years behind. Yeah. Yeah,

2273
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:24,750
but like you know the first guy ever
smoked pot indoors with in Vegas.

2274
02:15:26,350 --> 02:15:28,140
We just smoke pot here.
I was like a little kid.

2275
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:32,520
I think when I say where did they
going to go? What are they going to go?

2276
02:15:32,810 --> 02:15:37,310
He's like, go, hey, where are you
going to do a club? And I was like,

2277
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:39,230
all right dude.

2278
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:44,060
[inaudible]

2279
02:15:44,060 --> 02:15:48,510
somebody had made a meme that says
something about even his concentration and

2280
02:15:48,570 --> 02:15:52,530
he, I started focusing in on him like
this. It was hilarious. Make that bigger.

2281
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,590
Does it make it bigger? Is it
possible to make it bigger?

2282
02:15:56,100 --> 02:15:59,400
Let me tell you something.
Listen, look at Khabib's face.

2283
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:03,600
Is there a harder man that's ever lived?
Look at that and be tell you though.

2284
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:08,260
He came out like two fights before
that fight and he was the nicest guy to

2285
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:10,770
everybody that came up to
him. Oh, he's like, he,

2286
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:13,050
everybody came to me engage
with them, talk to them.

2287
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:15,900
Soon as the Conor fight
was about to happen.

2288
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:18,960
That was it for the whole,

2289
02:16:18,961 --> 02:16:22,230
he just was watching Connor
the whole time and, and like,

2290
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:25,110
and like we were talking like he
like in the whole time, like I said,

2291
02:16:25,111 --> 02:16:27,990
we were engaged in what I'm saying to
him right there. I was like, Oh shit,

2292
02:16:27,991 --> 02:16:30,300
y'all probably fighting kind of thing.

2293
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:32,830
Cause he was like, I want
to fucking fight that guy.

2294
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:35,740
And they got into it
backstage at that shit.

2295
02:16:37,380 --> 02:16:38,213
Wow.

2296
02:16:38,250 --> 02:16:40,620
But I was just made me laugh and it
made me start thinking like, hey,

2297
02:16:40,621 --> 02:16:44,910
I wonder how much shit I want to, how
much shit I Mike in the background of,

2298
02:16:44,970 --> 02:16:45,930
you know what I mean?

2299
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:50,610
A ton of them. One of the best
ones ever is Aryan Dunkin kissing.

2300
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:54,240
And when they planned it, they
planned it. So these guys,

2301
02:16:54,241 --> 02:16:56,910
pat the camera passed in front of him
and they grab each other and started

2302
02:16:56,911 --> 02:17:00,570
making out just so they could be
on camera. Watch this, they'll get,

2303
02:17:00,810 --> 02:17:03,300
watch this right here.
The camera pans to them.

2304
02:17:08,270 --> 02:17:11,870
Oh Shit. Oh my God.

2305
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:15,320
And Dana. Dana texted me
afterwards. Did your friends fuck

2306
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:24,303
[inaudible] [inaudible]

2307
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:29,820
oh man. Oh Shit. What's
up? What's up Jamie?

2308
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:35,100
I thought I was with them at that fight
and it might've been on a substance

2309
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:37,260
psychedelic. Oh, they
probably were wavy. Yeah,

2310
02:17:37,261 --> 02:17:41,430
they probably were that that was common
practice. Common practice in the day.

2311
02:17:41,970 --> 02:17:46,730
One of Bang. One more on this.
Do it. Let's do it. Let's do a,

2312
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:51,000
I'm smoking and drinking. So
that seems appropriate. Yes,

2313
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:52,973
sure.

2314
02:17:53,250 --> 02:17:57,740
All right, DJ Melody. Uh, and,

2315
02:17:57,741 --> 02:17:59,820

a little shout out it,

school in Glendale, California.

2317

2318

Beautiful beat junkies.

2320
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:18,320
By the way. This is real
people just listening

2321

of a sudden find [inaudible] soap.

02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:04,430
[inaudible]

2339
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:08,660
the boots have dab in there. So go
ahead, grab it. I'm a chrome plated man.

2340
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:23,140
[inaudible] all have friends.

2341
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:32,490
[inaudible] and drank
it two ways there that

2342
02:21:57,390 --> 02:22:01,860
[inaudible] Shh,

2343
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,920
whoa.

2344
02:22:10,150 --> 02:22:11,700
That's a great fucking song.

2345
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:18,300
Whitey Ford sings a Whitey Ford's
house of pain is the latest album.

2346
02:22:18,301 --> 02:22:22,400
Let me do all the things my manager
will slap me later for if I don't, uh,

2347
02:22:22,410 --> 02:22:25,650
o g Everlast you can find me on Instagram
and that's the only I really do.

2348
02:22:25,651 --> 02:22:28,320
But I'm on the Facebook and all
that with all detours and all that.

2349
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:30,900
But if you want to see what
I talk about or what I do,

2350
02:22:30,901 --> 02:22:35,850
it's Oji ever last on Instagram.
Um, I got Joe started on Instagram,

2351
02:22:35,851 --> 02:22:39,930
by the way. That's 100% and he's
kicking my ass out over there.

2352
02:22:39,931 --> 02:22:43,230
He's got like 18 million
followers. I got like a 98,000

2353
02:22:46,180 --> 02:22:48,630
I always, dude, no,
always. That's another,

2354
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:52,520
you're people always come and are
always beautiful folks. That's still,

2355
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:56,260
that's 100% because of
the room. But uh, but the,

2356
02:22:56,261 --> 02:23:01,110
the folks that always come after a
podcast are always like, find folks and,

2357
02:23:01,111 --> 02:23:04,140
and, and are enthusiastic.
It's awesome to hear.

2358
02:23:04,141 --> 02:23:08,220
I think we tapped into a river of cool
people. I think they're out there.

2359
02:23:08,380 --> 02:23:12,390
I think you put it out there and people
respond in turn and they realize that a

2360
02:23:12,391 --> 02:23:13,224
lot of,

2361
02:23:13,310 --> 02:23:16,110
a lot of the shittiest behavior that
we all exhibit is because we're around

2362
02:23:16,111 --> 02:23:19,110
shitty behavior for making
agreement to be nice to each other.

2363
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:22,650
We can change everything. I'm
working on it. We are, I'm a dead

2364
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:28,280
Jack. You're a man and
you're Irish. I'm a dick.

2365
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:33,660
I'm looking for a quick excuse to
be one. If you want to be an ass,

2366
02:23:33,720 --> 02:23:36,940
you know what I mean? He'd be, but you
know, and all the years now, no, you,

2367
02:23:36,941 --> 02:23:41,310
you're a very, very introspective
guy, man. You look at yourself,

2368
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:44,610
you know when people make mistakes and
they look at themselves like you're, uh,

2369
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:47,550
you're a guy who looks at everything,
man. You look at yourself,

2370
02:23:47,551 --> 02:23:48,540
you look at other people.

2371
02:23:49,060 --> 02:23:52,620
It's nice to be afforded the time
and luxuries to do such things too.

2372
02:23:52,650 --> 02:23:55,470
Let's acknowledge it. Some people,
hey man, motherfuckers still got,

2373
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:57,420
some people can barely
look up from the grind man.

2374
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:01,950
It's a blessing to be able to like
have that, those moments of like, hey,

2375
02:24:01,951 --> 02:24:06,870
whatever it is, Joe Rogan in the fucking
brush, you know, stalking and elk,

2376
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,560
that's where he gets his moment. Or
you know, or whatever. Me, you know,

2377
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:13,320
driving fucking Pacific coast
highway, listen to in a beat,

2378
02:24:13,321 --> 02:24:16,680
trying to fucking come with an idea.
You know what I mean? That's a luxury.

2379
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:18,150
You know what I mean? Even
though it's hard work,

2380
02:24:18,330 --> 02:24:20,890
you might be thinking of a joke out
there while you're fucking [inaudible].

2381
02:24:21,030 --> 02:24:24,570
You know what I mean? Now we're lucky.
Super Lucky for sure. Well said.

2382
02:24:24,630 --> 02:24:26,840
That's so important to acknowledge,
you know, for everybody and,

2383
02:24:26,990 --> 02:24:29,980
and we didn't use to be, and
that's, that's the grind, you know?

2384
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:31,380
And we're all okay. We're all okay.

2385
02:24:31,381 --> 02:24:34,050
We just got to figure out way
through our own individual Mays.

2386
02:24:34,290 --> 02:24:38,150
The problem isn't comparison. Right.
That's a big part of the problem. I,

2387
02:24:38,270 --> 02:24:40,140
I'm totally paraphrasing,

2388
02:24:40,141 --> 02:24:42,300
but there's like definitely a
famous phrase where it's like,

2389
02:24:42,301 --> 02:24:45,900
comparison is the death of joy and I
think we've even talked about it on,

2390
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:47,070
they might, I'm having Deja Vu,

2391
02:24:47,071 --> 02:24:50,220
so they might've been on here that we
talked about that I'm a repetitive fuck.

2392
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:52,440
Yeah. And I say a lot of the
same shit over and over again.

2393
02:24:52,470 --> 02:24:56,340
That's a Thomas Jefferson quote.
Correct? Comparison is the thief of joy.

2394
02:24:56,370 --> 02:24:59,360
Thief of joy. I think we
have talked about it my days.

2395
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:01,020
Who is in high gear right now?

2396
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:03,960
It's one of my favorite quotes because
it just makes you realize like this is

2397
02:25:03,961 --> 02:25:06,570
something you can't even control,
like you're, you're concentrating on,

2398
02:25:06,571 --> 02:25:09,240
she also can control, I feel
like it's like there's this,

2399
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:14,490
everybody's not entitled to the luxury
that we're talking about. So it's like,

2400
02:25:14,491 --> 02:25:14,611
it's,

2401
02:25:14,611 --> 02:25:19,611
you gotta be thankful for it on an extra
high level because it seems like we're

2402
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:24,250
in this twisted thought age where it's
like everybody thinks they that and I

2403
02:25:24,251 --> 02:25:27,910
don't even feel like I deserve it. I'm,
I'm lucky I'm a fortunate fucking man.

2404
02:25:27,911 --> 02:25:31,660
You know what I mean? I, I sing songs,
I always compare it to like this. Like,

2405
02:25:31,661 --> 02:25:32,890
you know, when you talk, you know,

2406
02:25:32,891 --> 02:25:35,320
when like people are talking about
the old new music, whatever, whatever,

2407
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:38,440
I'm like, whatever happens, if the
lights go out and all the power goes out,

2408
02:25:38,441 --> 02:25:41,860
I can go from fucking little fucking
prefecture to prefecture and play a little

2409
02:25:41,861 --> 02:25:45,280
song for you and get a meal from me
and my family. That's how I equate it.

2410
02:25:45,281 --> 02:25:48,500
Like it's, it's a trade, you
know what I mean? And, and it's,

2411
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:52,750
it's an imbalanced society that
gives, that has be, I mean, I,

2412
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:56,050
I've met teachers that I feel like should
be making way more fucking money than

2413
02:25:56,051 --> 02:26:00,820
me, man. Like on real levels that I, that
I've seen do things for kids on like,

2414
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,220
you know, like my school has
a mixture. Like, you know,

2415
02:26:03,221 --> 02:26:06,970
kids that go there because they lived
there and then there's a lot of people

2416
02:26:06,971 --> 02:26:10,420
trying to go to school cause it
was very nice school. But you know,

2417
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:13,060
so there's imbalances and these,

2418
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:17,200
I've seen teachers like come out their
own pockets and do things for people that

2419
02:26:17,201 --> 02:26:19,210
was like, wow man, that's,
you know what I mean?

2420
02:26:19,390 --> 02:26:21,940
I like to think I do nice
things and I think I do,

2421
02:26:21,941 --> 02:26:25,960
but I'm saying it's like when I see it
on a level where it's like grassroots

2422
02:26:26,140 --> 02:26:29,050
ground level, it's, it's impactful to me.

2423
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:32,020
Yeah, it's too, you know,
when you think about teachers,

2424
02:26:32,021 --> 02:26:34,520
that's the one that's the
heartstring puller. You know,

2425
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:37,840
like how much teachers make, you
hear about the rocks to how do you,

2426
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:42,960
you're taking care of our baby is you're
teaching our babies and you hear about

2427
02:26:44,321 --> 02:26:48,160
the bad ones here about the mean
teachers that fuck would a kid's head.

2428
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:51,190
You don't realize it. They don't realize
what they're doing to the kid. Like,

2429
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:56,170
oh some people are just
angry. This is angry in me.

2430
02:26:56,171 --> 02:26:57,370
And it comes out in their teaching.

2431
02:26:58,390 --> 02:27:00,760
And if your teacher gets
stuck or your kid rather,

2432
02:27:00,761 --> 02:27:02,440
if your kid gets stuck
with one of those teachers,

2433
02:27:02,441 --> 02:27:05,680
like that can have a devastating
impact on the kid's life.

2434
02:27:06,870 --> 02:27:07,800
We're, we're, we're,

2435
02:27:07,801 --> 02:27:12,360
we're experiencing like something like
that but not on a mat on a very minor

2436
02:27:12,361 --> 02:27:14,820
level of like, you know,
like, um, the way the school,

2437
02:27:14,850 --> 02:27:19,290
we just found out like today, yesterday,
like what teachers our kids have,

2438
02:27:19,291 --> 02:27:23,010
you know what I mean? It's like
there's the whole like, um, cultural,

2439
02:27:23,490 --> 02:27:26,790
parents' circle of knowing who's teaching
which teachers you want and which ones

2440
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:28,530
you don't, you know what
I mean? So it's like,

2441
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:31,260
I'm not going to go into whether
we got what we wanted or not,

2442
02:27:31,261 --> 02:27:34,950
but it's like the fucking drama by, and
it is, it's a Laramie to me. It's like,

2443
02:27:34,951 --> 02:27:37,780
it's such a, it's such a
like, whoa, like, yeah.

2444
02:27:38,610 --> 02:27:40,580
Is there abuse going on or why, you know,

2445
02:27:40,690 --> 02:27:43,920
when teachers a little more strict
than the other? I, in my day,

2446
02:27:43,921 --> 02:27:46,890
my parents would've said like,
that's the teacher we want nowadays.

2447
02:27:46,890 --> 02:27:49,920
It's almost like the opposite.
I mean that in an old days,

2448
02:27:49,921 --> 02:27:52,200
my mom would been like, that's district
or teacher yet, put them in that class,

2449
02:27:52,390 --> 02:27:55,650
put them in that class, cause that's
the one that's not gonna take any shit.

2450
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:57,260
And that's the one that's going
to get, you know, tell him,

2451
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:59,790
make sure he knows and people aren't
going to take shit from him and like,

2452
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:04,410
you know what I mean? And that's, I
understand that mentality. You nowadays,

2453
02:28:04,530 --> 02:28:09,340
it's almost the flip like, oh, that
teacher's like, she just so, you know,

2454
02:28:09,370 --> 02:28:12,840
abrasive too. It's like,
well what does she do? Well,

2455
02:28:12,841 --> 02:28:15,450
she raised her voice to the kid.
That was, what was the kid doing?

2456
02:28:15,451 --> 02:28:19,470
He was fucking losing his mind in
class. So the teacher raised their toys.

2457
02:28:19,471 --> 02:28:22,190
There's that, you know,
it's just a general example

2458
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:26,300
here, but, well, I, it's hilarious. And
we got paddled. Yeah. Paddled at school.

2459
02:28:26,301 --> 02:28:30,230
I got in a fight with a kid named
Preston banks. We duked it out. Well, no,

2460
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:33,140
we were like got paddle. I was like, fuck.

2461
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:36,830
I lived there from 11 and 13
so somewhere in that range.

2462
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:42,200
They fucking whacked me in there.
Florida, Florida. Yeah. Yeah, Florida,

2463
02:28:42,201 --> 02:28:44,690
they used to be a lot of powder
you this dude had a paddle,

2464
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:49,280
like an actual wooden paddle and me and
this kid got in a [inaudible] this I

2465
02:28:49,281 --> 02:28:53,270
remember thinking even though I was
probably like 11 or 12 or whatever it was,

2466
02:28:53,271 --> 02:28:54,440
when I got in a fight with this kid,

2467
02:28:54,441 --> 02:28:58,760
I realized this kid had been like badly
burned when he was young and we were,

2468
02:28:58,940 --> 02:28:59,570
you know,

2469
02:28:59,570 --> 02:29:04,070
we're in school together and he was like
missing part of his ear and his neck

2470
02:29:04,071 --> 02:29:06,470
was all fucked up. And I was
thinking like, oh, this guy,

2471
02:29:06,620 --> 02:29:11,040
like he's not doing so well like
this is, it made me realize like we,

2472
02:29:11,041 --> 02:29:14,270
we got into this little scrap
over nothing because it just,

2473
02:29:15,140 --> 02:29:19,070
he wasn't doing so well and
I didn't realize that until
I was in the principal's

2474
02:29:19,071 --> 02:29:20,510
office with them and the fight,

2475
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:23,240
like we couldn't fight in front of the
principal. That was the authority figure.

2476
02:29:23,241 --> 02:29:26,760
We were both like subdued, but I
was realizing when I was around the,

2477
02:29:26,970 --> 02:29:30,230
but this isn't a mean
guy. He's a sad guy. Like,

2478
02:29:30,231 --> 02:29:33,140
he's the guy that just didn't get any
love and he feels like you got ripped off

2479
02:29:33,141 --> 02:29:36,290
by life cause he got burned when
he was a little kid for sure.

2480
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:40,100
And it made me think like it, it
changed the way I looked at people.

2481
02:29:40,370 --> 02:29:44,450
But then one little argument fight
with one kid and then getting paddles,

2482
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:49,020
getting paddled just
cemented it like out there.

2483
02:29:50,090 --> 02:29:52,760
I don't agree with it, you know?
And the guy didn't hurt me.

2484
02:29:52,850 --> 02:29:55,820
He didn't try to hurt me and tried
to hurt the other duty either.

2485
02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:59,840
But he definitely paddled us. He used
to be, it used to be a legal thing,

2486
02:30:00,830 --> 02:30:03,280
staying on it, man. You know what I mean?
That's what we grew up with. You guys.

2487
02:30:03,770 --> 02:30:07,460
I got spanked her, but
it's that good I think.

2488
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:11,460
I think there's appropriate time
in place. I really do for girls.

2489
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:13,700
I don't know about that. That's different.

2490
02:30:13,910 --> 02:30:15,470
Cause I have two girls and I've never,

2491
02:30:15,471 --> 02:30:19,020
I've never spanked my kids and
I don't think I threatened to,

2492
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:26,150
but I've never had to actually commit
and do it. Uh, so I don't know.

2493
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:27,170
Yeah, no, it's,

2494
02:30:27,171 --> 02:30:30,620
it seems like that might not be the
right and even when the boy I'm talking

2495
02:30:30,621 --> 02:30:35,540
about that physical justice for me,

2496
02:30:35,690 --> 02:30:37,340
she would be a rare thing.

2497
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:41,210
Let me give you an example of when like
a time in my life when I definitely

2498
02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:44,300
deserve physical justice and
got it. My father, you know,

2499
02:30:45,370 --> 02:30:49,220
I was using guns when I was very
young. We'd go out and shoot and like,

2500
02:30:49,221 --> 02:30:50,270
not hunting necessarily,

2501
02:30:50,271 --> 02:30:53,750
but he'd take us out and shoot in the
mountains out in the Angeles for us back

2502
02:30:53,751 --> 02:30:55,160
in the day. And like fucking,

2503
02:30:55,161 --> 02:31:00,161
I had a very good gun
education and understanding
of guns and one time when they

2504
02:31:00,561 --> 02:31:01,394
were away,

2505
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:05,750
I fucked around with his like pumped
shotgun and fucking accidentally fucking

2506
02:31:05,751 --> 02:31:09,590
loaded it and fucking bang and
shot into the wall. All right.

2507
02:31:09,980 --> 02:31:12,050
This was an apartment
too. This wasn't a house.

2508
02:31:12,051 --> 02:31:13,940
This was in an apartment building. Now.

2509
02:31:13,941 --> 02:31:18,050
It wasn't a wall connected to in another
apartment, but put the possibilities,

2510
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:19,070
you know what I mean? When they came,

2511
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:24,690
uh, a few hours later that apartment
outside was surrounded by police,

2512
02:31:24,691 --> 02:31:26,910
like with guns. Like, they
didn't know what happened.

2513
02:31:26,911 --> 02:31:29,430
The neighbors all called cops,
didn't they heard a shotgun?

2514
02:31:29,431 --> 02:31:32,730
But so after they all
settled it down and shit,

2515
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:36,690
I got my ass fucking kicked that
last, that night on my father.

2516
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:38,820
You know what I mean? And you know,

2517
02:31:39,030 --> 02:31:43,500
some people nowadays would say
that's fucking rough, but no,

2518
02:31:43,501 --> 02:31:47,310
I fucking could have fucking killed
a human being easily. I'd just,

2519
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:50,100
you need sometimes no, like, okay,

2520
02:31:50,310 --> 02:31:54,930
this is because what you just did
could have wound you up in fucking the

2521
02:31:54,931 --> 02:31:56,790
penitentiary for the rest of your life.

2522
02:31:56,791 --> 02:32:01,791
So an ass kicking doesn't seem as extreme
as you think when you put it in the

2523
02:32:02,131 --> 02:32:06,420
balance of that. So when you're getting
to like a level of that, I think,

2524
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:09,860
especially for a boy, you
know what I mean? And I, I've,

2525
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:12,530
I don't know if [inaudible] girl
was going that wowed. I mean, I,

2526
02:32:12,610 --> 02:32:14,700
I would encourage the mom to
throw the beginning. I mean,

2527
02:32:14,701 --> 02:32:17,850
a dad can't throw that beating,
you know, it'd be a little rough.

2528
02:32:17,910 --> 02:32:20,780
But I think there's a time and
a place where like, hey you,

2529
02:32:20,860 --> 02:32:23,430
if you're going to stop you, you
gotta let them know and here's,

2530
02:32:23,730 --> 02:32:27,900
this will be the rest of your life.
If you keep down this path, that's,

2531
02:32:28,170 --> 02:32:30,810
it's gotta be that extreme to me
for it to be a beating nowadays.

2532
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:34,040
When I was young, a beating could
come from talking back. Right.

2533
02:32:34,410 --> 02:32:38,130
At least a smack in the face. Yeah.
Well that's, you know, a shoe.

2534
02:32:38,190 --> 02:32:39,900
Just a little of my, if it was mom,

2535
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:44,670
after like 13 moms stopped using
the hands, cause you know it then,

2536
02:32:45,130 --> 02:32:48,390
you know, I had outgrown her. She,
my mom was little, my mom was little,

2537
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:52,320
almost a little woman, like
four foot 11, five foot tops.

2538
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:55,830
That's just throwing shit. Oh yeah. So
after awhile I was like, it went from,

2539
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:59,580
it went from the hands to like
a stirring spoons and shit.

2540
02:32:59,581 --> 02:33:03,540
And then once those started breaking,
it became shoes and like, you know, uh,

2541
02:33:03,570 --> 02:33:05,160
whatever else, broomstick.

2542
02:33:06,300 --> 02:33:10,460
And then it became like with to your
fucking father gets home and mom might've

2543
02:33:10,470 --> 02:33:13,170
like gently smacked me
upside the head gently,

2544
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:17,700
like never like a real like wound,
you know, my mom was a Brooklyn Lady.

2545
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:20,640
She might've been like,
what are you doing? Stupid.

2546
02:33:22,630 --> 02:33:27,330
I never got my dramas tried
to forever drop me. Ma.

2547
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:32,430
I remember being like nine or 10 and mom's
chasing me down the block catching me

2548
02:33:33,140 --> 02:33:33,973
and fucking

2549
02:33:36,910 --> 02:33:41,730
like dead ass beat up in front of it.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

2550
02:33:41,910 --> 02:33:46,200
yeah. Happens to happen. The worst had
happened. My mom was not chasing me.

2551
02:33:46,530 --> 02:33:50,790
She'd be like, you're coming home
eventually dummy. My mom wasn't,

2552
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:55,680
I mean she wasn't having that. No. Oh
word. My mom would've never chased me.

2553
02:33:56,130 --> 02:34:01,020
She would be like, I'm not playing your
games. She's little. But she was fast.

2554
02:34:01,590 --> 02:34:05,280
She was fast. She caught you beat
your ass in front of your friends.

2555
02:34:05,281 --> 02:34:08,880
So rough when you're young
boy and you try to be cool.

2556
02:34:08,910 --> 02:34:10,020
It's like the most embarrassing.

2557
02:34:10,170 --> 02:34:14,910
Like any day you can just trip on your
own Dick and fall face to do a fence like

2558
02:34:14,911 --> 02:34:17,980
a fucking asshole. Just so
goofy. I think it actually

2559
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,760
made some more friends at the time
understand me a little bit differently.

2560
02:34:21,761 --> 02:34:25,300
Do like, oh wow dude.
Alright. Like yeah, for sure.

2561
02:34:25,301 --> 02:34:29,200
We get you now we understand kind of
your whole thing. Like you're Steve,

2562
02:34:29,201 --> 02:34:32,290
like you're, you guys
are nuts. Yeah, for sure.

2563
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:37,630
But don't you like when you think of
yourself as like a musician, an artist,

2564
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:40,870
like you're so fortunate,
this is going to sound weird,

2565
02:34:40,871 --> 02:34:43,630
but you're so fortunate to
come from a chaotic upbringing.

2566
02:34:44,230 --> 02:34:48,400
I feel like everyone who I know that
comes from some sort of a chaotic

2567
02:34:48,430 --> 02:34:53,170
upbringing has like a different kind of
like horsepower to their shit. You know,

2568
02:34:53,171 --> 02:34:57,230
like all my favorite people that I like
to listen to and watch y'all at some

2569
02:34:57,231 --> 02:35:01,360
like real fucked up moments
and struggles and chaos.

2570
02:35:01,361 --> 02:35:03,730
I'm sure madness. You don't,

2571
02:35:04,270 --> 02:35:08,920
you don't get what you put out without
that. That's like the root of it all.

2572
02:35:08,950 --> 02:35:11,530
That's the seed that
causes it all to grow.

2573
02:35:12,130 --> 02:35:17,110
I mean it's similar to a joke,
a song you're trying to find.

2574
02:35:18,430 --> 02:35:21,220
It depends on what you know.
Whenever you you take from it.

2575
02:35:21,221 --> 02:35:25,150
I like to call it the highest common
denominator like that. I'm trying to find,

2576
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:28,510
it's like the, the the highest
level thing we can all connect on,

2577
02:35:28,511 --> 02:35:32,710
you know what I mean? Not the basis,
most lowest level or common denominator.

2578
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:36,760
I'm trying to find the word. What kind
of elevated level can I speak to you on?

2579
02:35:36,761 --> 02:35:38,140
Even if it's about fuckery,

2580
02:35:38,980 --> 02:35:43,980
can I raise the level of speaking about
it and just telling a tale about it

2581
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:48,550
without it, you know, being, you know,

2582
02:35:48,810 --> 02:35:53,810
again the most basin and and easiest
lowest hanging fruit [inaudible] yeah.

2583
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:58,210
You know, that's the same thing. I think
with the joke you're trying to find,

2584
02:35:58,510 --> 02:36:01,300
there's no real new,

2585
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:06,790
like you're just finding new angles
on funny shit. You know what I mean?

2586
02:36:06,910 --> 02:36:10,690
Like things are news when things are
newly invented or when there are new

2587
02:36:10,691 --> 02:36:11,524
events,

2588
02:36:11,890 --> 02:36:16,600
like it has to be like a significant
event or a new invention then then things

2589
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:20,380
open up new pathways. Other than that,
like you're talking about relationships.

2590
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:26,160
You're doing a variation of exactly take
on it that everybody's had who's had a

2591
02:36:26,381 --> 02:36:29,650
long life and been in relationships,
especially Larry King.

2592
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:35,050
Holla at your boy going on number eight.
Was that number seven? They just left

2593
02:36:37,430 --> 02:36:39,370
eighth divorce. Seventh wife I
think here he married one of them.

2594
02:36:39,610 --> 02:36:44,200
Damn like that. You know
Larry King still alive.

2595
02:36:44,470 --> 02:36:48,060
You didn't know. Oh Roy would Roy would,

2596
02:36:48,610 --> 02:36:51,820
Roy and I were looking
at pictures of a lacking.

2597
02:36:51,910 --> 02:36:56,050
I'm really impressed that he's
still alive. Divorced at 85.

2598
02:36:56,540 --> 02:37:00,160
Hawkins more power to him. Get busy. If
you got the money to get divorced at 85,

2599
02:37:00,161 --> 02:37:00,994
go for it.

2600
02:37:01,050 --> 02:37:03,720
And then shooting him up with steroids
and cocaine and they're just going to

2601
02:37:03,721 --> 02:37:08,110
start Viagara just having gals come over
to the place he's over at art's Deli,

2602
02:37:08,530 --> 02:37:10,740
holding court. You imagine if, uh,

2603
02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:16,080
over the last like year of his life he
just banks and unprecedented volume of

2604
02:37:17,150 --> 02:37:20,420
Internet porn and just
releases it all in one blast.

2605
02:37:20,450 --> 02:37:24,780
Larry King Fox, he just called it king.

2606
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:29,900
Yes. King sex tapes. Yeah. King. Yeah.

2607
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:34,460
Just Bang it out and just, yeah,

2608
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:38,020
that's how I was going
to get a lot of pictures.

2609
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:43,280
You get so much money if you really
just want money, now's the time to act.

2610
02:37:44,810 --> 02:37:47,090
That's wild. Poor Larry.

2611
02:37:48,950 --> 02:37:52,670
He doesn't seem like he
has um, good posture.

2612
02:37:53,620 --> 02:37:57,410
Like that's not good when you're an
older fellow and he likes the curve,

2613
02:37:58,220 --> 02:38:02,420
that curve. He was a very nice
guy. I was on a show at twice.

2614
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:06,830
I was the show twice for fear factor.
So he's very nice, very friendly guy.

2615
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:08,610
You know, he kind of

2616
02:38:08,670 --> 02:38:12,760
gotta be when you do that for a living
and every night you're talking no person,

2617
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:16,750
you gotta be good at that Shit
can't be like me. I'd be like, fuck,

2618
02:38:17,740 --> 02:38:21,310
I go to jail. Is there a Larry King?
We need to get a Larry King much shot.

2619
02:38:21,550 --> 02:38:25,520
Yeah. Get the Larry King Mugshot or
that shit up. Go to take the phone.

2620
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:29,440
You need you five foot of Larry King
Mugshot. How do we not have Larry King?

2621
02:38:29,860 --> 02:38:33,280
We just decided to get Pablo Escobar
and need to get the mugshot of the dude

2622
02:38:33,450 --> 02:38:38,380
who's still on CNN, who got found
out like in central park in New York,

2623
02:38:38,381 --> 02:38:40,250

2626
02:38:46,300 --> 02:38:50,730
How do we know the English dude with
the glasses? Uh, dude with glasses. Uh,

2627
02:38:50,731 --> 02:38:55,630

2629
02:38:57,361 --> 02:39:01,480
I help to come on to stage
ordering up up large Richard print.

2630
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:06,220
Richard [inaudible]. Oh Man.

2631
02:39:06,450 --> 02:39:08,140
You know, as soon as you see
his face you can be like, oh,

2632
02:39:08,141 --> 02:39:11,680
that Guy Richard Quest.
Richard quests. Richard Quest.

2633
02:39:11,681 --> 02:39:14,800
He's the guy I'm talking about.
I don't know who he is. Oh Dude.

2634
02:39:14,801 --> 02:39:16,720
If you see his face, you'll
be like, oh yeah. He's like,

2635
02:39:17,190 --> 02:39:21,580
he's like the English guy on CNN.
He got caught and like central park,

2636
02:39:21,670 --> 02:39:26,500
we're like meth, like fucking some sort
of noose or something around his dick.

2637
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:28,580
I'm this, as far as I
remember reading, we were,

2638
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:32,170
we were clouding there for a
while. If you're a single gay guy,

2639
02:39:32,171 --> 02:39:35,320
isn't that what you're supposed to do? I
don't know. He's supposed to have math.

2640
02:39:35,350 --> 02:39:40,070
I don't know. New Tech that's like,
oh no. Is this not on the Internet?

2641
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:43,630
That am I making this up? I was looking
for a mugshot. There's not mugshot,

2642
02:39:43,631 --> 02:39:47,080
but here's an explanation
for what happened. Oh,
there's an explanation. Okay,

2643
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:52,090
this next one, she know I'm not
making this up, right? I'm not.

2644
02:39:52,091 --> 02:39:55,350
This wasn't like a drug induced like
hallucination or something, right? God,

2645
02:39:55,630 --> 02:39:58,090
how hilarious is the way they
put this? CNN personality.

2646
02:39:58,091 --> 02:40:01,180
Richard Quest is busting in central park
earlier yesterday with some drugs in

2647
02:40:01,181 --> 02:40:05,650
his pocket and a rope wrapped around
his tie and his genitals. No big deal.

2648
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:07,630
And a sex toy in his boot.

2649
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:12,970
Law enforcement official said source
of said quest was initially busted for

2650
02:40:12,990 --> 02:40:16,530
loitering. Really wasn't about that.

2651
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:19,530
Aside from the oddly configured rope,

2652
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:25,160
this search also turned up a sex toy
inside of his boot that means his ass hole

2653
02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:30,570
and a small bag of methamphetamine
in his left jacket pocket.

2654
02:40:30,700 --> 02:40:33,650
It wasn't immediately
clear what the rope was for

2655
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:41,590
[inaudible] shot. You were showing a
picture so he'll know who I'm talking to.

2656
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:45,480
Bobby, please. I'm going to talk
about that on stage from now on.

2657
02:40:46,230 --> 02:40:51,180
Send me that guy. Dude, you don't know
that guy. He's all over the fucking CNN.

2658
02:40:51,240 --> 02:40:52,950
I do not know that guy. To me,

2659
02:40:52,951 --> 02:40:56,250
that article that we just
sent it to my Evernote.

2660
02:40:56,340 --> 02:40:59,700
I hope it provides you
something beautiful. Something
there. There's something

2661
02:41:01,970 --> 02:41:04,170
this, the best part about the
article, it was not clear.

2662
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:08,040
It was not immediately clear what the
tow rope floor and I'm like, let me help.

2663
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:09,533
Let me help you out.

2664
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:14,090
What does it tighten around
his neck and his dick? What

2665
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:25,830
pocket goes? Mr Quest at 64th street
in west drive at about three Oh,

2666
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:29,190
the police noticed Mr [inaudible]
at 64th street in west drive.

2667
02:41:29,191 --> 02:41:33,420
They'll have 3:40 AM the official
said as he was being escorted out,

2668
02:41:33,421 --> 02:41:37,050
he volunteered in quotes.
I have meth in my pocket.

2669
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:40,440
According to an official
briefed on the case.

2670
02:41:40,620 --> 02:41:45,400
The police searched him and recovered a
small amount of methamphetamine in a zip

2671
02:41:45,720 --> 02:41:50,720
lock bag and a rope around his dick
and his neck and a sex bullying.

2672
02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:56,780
More importantly, there's a lot of
dudes who do math. Oh, they keep,

2673
02:41:56,781 --> 02:42:01,440
I take Chandler and they stay on the
farm or what kind of boots he had on his,

2674
02:42:01,500 --> 02:42:03,270
there's a snake in my boot

2675
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:09,600
that means in his asshole. Is this an
English paper? No, this is New York.

2676
02:42:09,601 --> 02:42:11,700
It was central park. I
think they mean his asshole.

2677
02:42:11,910 --> 02:42:15,900
I don't think they mean his boot or
think they made it his ass. His ass.

2678
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:20,170
That's a whole new dementia. It's your
trunk Bro. They wouldn't call it English,

2679
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:24,170
but it's like this. Isn't
this, this New York Times? Yes.

2680
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:26,890
They using proper British
English. That's America.

2681
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:29,360
That's The New York Times called
boots and boot in American.

2682
02:42:29,370 --> 02:42:33,030
Let's go with the better angle on it.
This dude was in his ass and that's fun.

2683
02:42:33,180 --> 02:42:35,300
It's the better New York poster.
Do you know our times yet?

2684
02:42:35,460 --> 02:42:38,960
It was in his asshole. That's what
it is. Boot his boot. His boot is,

2685
02:42:39,270 --> 02:42:43,380
it's proper British for like if
you watch like a that is factual.

2686
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:47,100
That is factual. Clarkson and
fucking Richard Hammonds. James Bay.

2687
02:42:47,240 --> 02:42:51,210
They were virtual truck is the best
of boot. Yes. As soon as asshole.

2688
02:42:52,450 --> 02:42:55,080
Right. You got sex toys, asshole. Hey,

2689
02:42:55,320 --> 02:43:00,300
no judgment brought a whole new
like fucking like dimension to that.

2690
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:04,980
No judgment. Wow. It's okay.

2691
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:11,190
It's fine. Yes sir. Even
if he didn't get caught

2692
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:16,360
with that in his asshole, he's still
doing math and talking to cops. Like what?

2693
02:43:16,540 --> 02:43:17,570
The rope around his

2694
02:43:17,880 --> 02:43:19,890
Dick and nick. Yeah, that part
too. I was going to get to that.

2695
02:43:23,310 --> 02:43:27,970
It was so crazy. Beata of fucking rubber
Dick and his ass like, wait, what?

2696
02:43:28,330 --> 02:43:32,250
I'm fighting that shit on [inaudible]
I'll get you that mugshot.

2697
02:43:32,320 --> 02:43:37,000
I'm finding it a little math every now
and then. Rob Ran his dick and balls,

2698
02:43:37,001 --> 02:43:37,500
whatever

2699
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:42,380
or whatever you got. Not
all charges were dismissed.

2700
02:43:42,410 --> 02:43:43,340
Thank God for a man.

2701
02:43:55,200 --> 02:44:00,050
You dude is black. Is Wesley
stipes with dreadlocks?

2702
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:05,910
They catch you with a rub. Proud your
Dick and neck with your pocket, Bro. Yeah,

2703
02:44:05,911 --> 02:44:08,390
I in jail. Okay. Yeah.

2704
02:44:10,700 --> 02:44:11,900
Yeah, I think so.

2705
02:44:11,970 --> 02:44:16,580
100% I think so hundred
a hundred dismissed.

2706
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:22,240
You had meth and a rope already connecting
your neck and cock and probably a sex

2707
02:44:25,881 --> 02:44:26,714
toy in your ass.

2708
02:44:27,140 --> 02:44:31,160
You can't be UK for a different
issue at the very least.

2709
02:44:31,270 --> 02:44:34,490
And I was going to say in his shoe,
which is weird enough, it's my,

2710
02:44:34,491 --> 02:44:37,130
it might even be weirder, but
let's not jump to conclusions.

2711
02:44:38,310 --> 02:44:42,530
[inaudible] confusing interpretation of
the American version of boot and them

2712
02:44:42,531 --> 02:44:46,400
saying maybe they think shoe means
ass too. I was with another man.

2713
02:44:47,900 --> 02:44:52,100
Oh, maybe nobody's got a fucking
rubber Dick in their boots.

2714
02:44:52,130 --> 02:44:54,860
That's outrageous. That would make
your boot off fucking uncomfortable.

2715
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:57,620
Why wouldn't you just put it in
your pocket? It's in his ass, Bro.

2716
02:44:57,740 --> 02:45:00,640
Let's just run with this.
He had in his pocket. Shit,

2717
02:45:02,630 --> 02:45:06,500
Google search. Shut off all the
computers, spread misinformation.

2718
02:45:07,740 --> 02:45:09,800
Look, I'm sure it was just
an issue. Whatever, whatever.

2719
02:45:10,190 --> 02:45:14,780
Don't ever volunteer that you have
drugs. Let them find the drugs.

2720
02:45:14,870 --> 02:45:18,110
Let them find the drugs. Unless you
want. Fuck the cop. I have a quick, hey,

2721
02:45:18,140 --> 02:45:18,973
good one on that.

2722
02:45:19,830 --> 02:45:23,940
On that level. Shit on first time
I went to Japan with house pain.

2723
02:45:24,210 --> 02:45:25,440
What happened? We were on, you know,

2724
02:45:25,441 --> 02:45:27,510
it was one of them things where we
were touring from tour to tour tour.

2725
02:45:27,511 --> 02:45:30,480
I would go home and literally take
one set of clothes out of a bag,

2726
02:45:30,730 --> 02:45:31,770
thrown in another bag and leave.

2727
02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:36,930
So we got to Japan and on this particular
trip I brought my girlfriend at the

2728
02:45:36,931 --> 02:45:40,890
time and I think Danny did and lethal
brought his own homie or whatever,

2729
02:45:40,891 --> 02:45:41,250
but all the,

2730
02:45:41,250 --> 02:45:46,020
we brought a bunch of guests and
everybody gets through customs and as I'm

2731
02:45:46,021 --> 02:45:46,980
getting through customs,

2732
02:45:46,981 --> 02:45:50,390
the guy reaches into this one jacket
I have and he pulls his hand out and

2733
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:54,720
there's this little nugget of
bud and he's like, what is that?

2734
02:45:55,740 --> 02:46:00,180
And I was like, well, can you speak
English? Because he said it in Japanese.

2735
02:46:00,330 --> 02:46:03,990
So I said, okay, okay, what is that?
I was like, my brain just was like,

2736
02:46:03,991 --> 02:46:08,230
well fuck man, just, it looks like weed.
I said, it looks like we, you know,

2737
02:46:08,231 --> 02:46:12,020
I just fucking owned it wherever they
went and got this little test or put some

2738
02:46:12,190 --> 02:46:14,750
shit in instead. If it turns blue,
it's weed. I was like, it's weed.

2739
02:46:15,170 --> 02:46:18,180
Let's just fucking save a little
trouble. This we, meanwhile,

2740
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:21,920
everybody else had gotten through. They
brought everybody else back in, right?

2741
02:46:22,190 --> 02:46:26,990
Fucking gave him the fucking finger.
Like I have like my, my lady,

2742
02:46:26,991 --> 02:46:29,390
everything at the time,
everybody got the strip search.

2743
02:46:29,480 --> 02:46:33,110
They never strip searched me. They
searched everything. I had all my bags,

2744
02:46:33,111 --> 02:46:36,890
everything right? They tested one
nug of weed, whatever. I ended up,

2745
02:46:36,891 --> 02:46:41,210
after several hours, the record label
paid off, whatever they ended up pay off.

2746
02:46:41,211 --> 02:46:45,210
We got into the country and were able to
do our tour and the point of the story

2747
02:46:45,211 --> 02:46:48,410
is everybody fucking hated my guts.
The whole fucking bunch of them.

2748
02:46:48,411 --> 02:46:49,460
We get to the hotel.

2749
02:46:49,970 --> 02:46:52,850
I'm unpacking my bag and trying to
figure out how the whole fucking thing

2750
02:46:52,851 --> 02:46:56,960
happened and I'm looking at the jacket
and I reach into the pocket that was out

2751
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,910
of, there's nothing in there.
I was like, fuck, that's crazy.

2752
02:46:58,911 --> 02:47:00,740
I reached into the other
pocket of the jacket.

2753
02:47:02,030 --> 02:47:04,910
I pulled out a fucking
ounce of fucking weed.

2754
02:47:05,990 --> 02:47:10,250
They never looked in the other pocket
of the jacket out fucking ounce of weed.

2755
02:47:10,251 --> 02:47:13,490
I Shit, you're done what you wear
without even knowing you were doing it.

2756
02:47:13,491 --> 02:47:18,491
You were like sending a small meal to
get busted so that the big ones can sneak

2757
02:47:18,681 --> 02:47:19,431
around side.

2758
02:47:19,431 --> 02:47:23,210
I must've been rolling a joint somewhat
at the last tour and I had a nug left

2759
02:47:23,211 --> 02:47:26,150
over and just thrown it in the pocket,
not thinking about it on one side.

2760
02:47:26,150 --> 02:47:27,080
Cartel does that,

2761
02:47:27,110 --> 02:47:29,990
but if they would have found out other
ones first I thought I'd be in jail in

2762
02:47:29,991 --> 02:47:34,490
motherfucking in Japan for a long
time ever and ever. But I got in,

2763
02:47:34,491 --> 02:47:35,181
I called the whole,

2764
02:47:35,181 --> 02:47:38,840
I called everybody that smoked in the
crew down to the room after that and I was

2765
02:47:38,841 --> 02:47:41,600
like, Yo, check it out man. I really
didn't mean this to happen but

2766
02:47:43,190 --> 02:47:48,190
I probably had more good ass fucking
weed in Japan than anybody at the time.

2767
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:50,990
You know what's incredible cause all
they had was hash and shit like that.

2768
02:47:50,991 --> 02:47:53,030
Stop and think of that
moment, that moment.

2769
02:47:53,180 --> 02:47:56,990
If they didn't go in that one pocket and
they went in the other pocket first and

2770
02:47:56,991 --> 02:48:00,260
they found that giant bag of weed, we
wouldn't be having this conversation.

2771
02:48:00,261 --> 02:48:05,090
Nope. We probably wouldn't. No, I
don't think so. That's a lot of weed.

2772
02:48:05,660 --> 02:48:07,610
Who knows though, in
Japan it would have been,

2773
02:48:07,611 --> 02:48:12,470
it took a lot of money to get me out
of the AB regardless a lot instead of,

2774
02:48:12,471 --> 02:48:15,080
I think it cost him like 1000
bucks in there, like you know,

2775
02:48:15,081 --> 02:48:19,580
which was like 10,000 or something
again or $100 a year post.

2776
02:48:19,581 --> 02:48:22,790
Put your lights on. No, this
was in house paint days.

2777
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:24,980
This was like when the only story,

2778
02:48:24,981 --> 02:48:29,870
like it was like Paul McCartney is banned
for life because he got caught with

2779
02:48:29,871 --> 02:48:34,250
some weed. That's, that was like,
I don't know if it still exists,

2780
02:48:34,251 --> 02:48:37,700
but there was a point where he was banned
for life cause he got caught with weed

2781
02:48:37,701 --> 02:48:40,040
over there. Wow. Well
you used to be in Nevada,

2782
02:48:40,041 --> 02:48:44,290
you get sent to jail for life if you
had weed and now it's legal there. Yeah.

2783
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:47,540
There's a bunch of dudes like looking
out those barred windows dad. Yeah.

2784
02:48:47,541 --> 02:48:50,600
That's just got it. Something's
gotta be done about that. That ain't,

2785
02:48:50,630 --> 02:48:54,020
that ain't working. Yeah, that's the
problem. That's the number one problem.

2786
02:48:54,210 --> 02:48:58,370
Number one problem with laws against
things like we'd like as long as you can

2787
02:48:58,730 --> 02:49:01,520
buy some Wizkid's part of the
number one problem. A lot of it too,

2788
02:49:01,670 --> 02:49:04,040
as long as these prisons are privatized
and they don't want to let a lot of

2789
02:49:04,041 --> 02:49:04,970
these guys go, man,

2790
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:08,370
a lot of these guys get money for the
amount of fucking people in their prisons.

2791
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:11,880
I got a solution. Those private prison
dudes just start selling the weed.

2792
02:49:15,360 --> 02:49:18,390
Right. That's not cleaner
way to live your life, man.

2793
02:49:18,420 --> 02:49:22,830
Don't be a goddamn slave owner. Slave
owners. This whole leg, urban legend that,

2794
02:49:22,831 --> 02:49:26,970
I mean it's very believable about this
letter that went around like a bunch of

2795
02:49:26,971 --> 02:49:30,690
people in, in the, in the hip hop
music industry got not, I don't know,

2796
02:49:30,691 --> 02:49:35,691
maybe it was within the last decade where
they described like this guy claimed

2797
02:49:35,941 --> 02:49:39,930
to be a member of the elite, um,

2798
02:49:40,350 --> 02:49:44,640
a class of like executives of the music
business in there in the mid nineties

2799
02:49:44,641 --> 02:49:45,211
and whatnot.

2800
02:49:45,211 --> 02:49:49,590
And there was a time when the private
prison industry kind of came and got

2801
02:49:49,591 --> 02:49:53,460
involved and got a lot of these people
to invest and then kind of help direct

2802
02:49:53,461 --> 02:49:56,850
like things like rap music and if you
remember they used to be like public,

2803
02:49:56,851 --> 02:49:59,160
I don't know if you were, how
big are you a fan of music?

2804
02:49:59,161 --> 02:50:02,370
You were at the time x
clans and public enemies.

2805
02:50:02,370 --> 02:50:04,980
There was all these
proactive like you know,

2806
02:50:05,190 --> 02:50:09,200
counters to like the party drug dealer
guys or whatever. You know, there was,

2807
02:50:09,360 --> 02:50:10,230
there was, there was a nationally,

2808
02:50:10,231 --> 02:50:14,790
another side to it that existed and
was successful in flourished, you know,

2809
02:50:14,791 --> 02:50:19,140
amongst it, you know, and that
disappeared. But, and like their,

2810
02:50:19,150 --> 02:50:23,490
this letter that went around was I kind
of claiming this guy was part of this

2811
02:50:23,491 --> 02:50:25,890
thing and he left the meeting
when they, these guys,

2812
02:50:25,891 --> 02:50:27,470
it was like a whole conspiracy
thing like you going to,

2813
02:50:27,471 --> 02:50:30,090
but it's like totally
believable that the upper could,

2814
02:50:30,300 --> 02:50:34,500
these guys would direct a music and a
fucking media in a certain direction to

2815
02:50:34,501 --> 02:50:38,790
encourage fucking basically a
cycle of fucking prison for fraud.

2816
02:50:38,970 --> 02:50:40,620
Cause if you look at rap music,

2817
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:43,710
if you look at rap music and what
happened from the nineties till now,

2818
02:50:43,711 --> 02:50:48,690
there is no conscious music anymore.
There's none. It's um, it's again,

2819
02:50:48,930 --> 02:50:52,020
it's, some people will tell you
it's fucking God's honest truth.

2820
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:54,210
So I'm gonna tell you it's the
wildest speculation in the world,

2821
02:50:54,420 --> 02:50:58,680
but you can dig it up easily. Kanye
has some conscious music for sure,

2822
02:50:58,681 --> 02:51:01,620
but like what? Like Jesus Walks, I'm,
that was written by a guy named, uh,

2823
02:51:01,621 --> 02:51:05,790
a rhyme fast, I think is his name.
I think is the guy from Chicago,

2824
02:51:05,791 --> 02:51:08,130
one of his partners from Chicago
wrote that song. You know what I mean?

2825
02:51:08,730 --> 02:51:09,720
Which guy? Remember these guys are like,

2826
02:51:09,721 --> 02:51:12,120
Connie's a producer and I'm
going to say he doesn't write,

2827
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:14,190
but what I'm saying is a lot
of you know, he's also like,

2828
02:51:14,191 --> 02:51:18,870
he will take a song and make the song
because he's a producer conscious.

2829
02:51:18,871 --> 02:51:21,960
A lot of people do. I'm not just saying
Kanye is like a fraud or anything.

2830
02:51:21,961 --> 02:51:24,740
I'm just saying like as
a producer, like people,

2831
02:51:25,220 --> 02:51:26,900
Drake doesn't write all his records like,

2832
02:51:26,901 --> 02:51:30,960
like it was a different era of rap and
shit like that going on from when I was

2833
02:51:30,961 --> 02:51:31,794
young. When I was young,

2834
02:51:31,850 --> 02:51:35,850
it was pretty much 90% if you couldn't
call yourself an MC or a rapper,

2835
02:51:35,851 --> 02:51:38,670
if you didn't write your own shit,
there were cast it didn't do it.

2836
02:51:38,730 --> 02:51:41,400
It's always been there. There's
always been the ghost writing scene.

2837
02:51:41,640 --> 02:51:44,850
But if you wanted to walk in a room
and hold down any kind of respect when

2838
02:51:44,851 --> 02:51:47,370
people, you had to know, you wrote
your Brian's, you know what I mean?

2839
02:51:47,371 --> 02:51:50,250
It's the same in comedy.
Yeah. So it's like, you know,

2840
02:51:50,251 --> 02:51:52,080
and it's not saying
like you're not a fraud,

2841
02:51:52,081 --> 02:51:54,270
you're just a Democrat of
entertainer. You know what I mean?

2842
02:51:54,271 --> 02:51:56,220
As far as I'm concerned, I don't
shit on it. You know what I mean?

2843
02:51:56,221 --> 02:51:59,550
There's a lot of Drake records I like,
there's a lot of other shit I like,

2844
02:51:59,551 --> 02:52:00,240
you know what I mean? This,

2845
02:52:00,240 --> 02:52:02,790
I know those guys didn't write those
records cause I can look at the writer's

2846
02:52:02,791 --> 02:52:06,160
credit and see 20 writers
credits on it. So, but I come

2847
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:09,010
from there era of like, you know,
you gotta write your Shit. Yeah.

2848
02:52:09,070 --> 02:52:11,950
I think some people feel
the value of collaboration,

2849
02:52:11,951 --> 02:52:13,270
which is a legitimate thing.

2850
02:52:13,330 --> 02:52:16,390
And if your ego is good enough
where you can like work with,

2851
02:52:16,391 --> 02:52:19,000
like Paul Mooney worked
with prior, you know,

2852
02:52:19,001 --> 02:52:23,890
prior is the greatest of all time in my
opinion. And he, he worked with Mooney.

2853
02:52:24,070 --> 02:52:26,650
Mooney helped him a lot,
you know, and Richard,

2854
02:52:27,010 --> 02:52:30,580
Jenny worked with Chris Rock and you
know, and others as well, you know,

2855
02:52:30,581 --> 02:52:32,950
like this, it's not like some
of the greatest of all time.

2856
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:36,820
I've had people that work with them and
oh my God, that's, he's the greatest.

2857
02:52:36,880 --> 02:52:40,480
He's like, he sees my most important uh,

2858
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:43,720
important influencers. When I,
when I was at the comedy store,

2859
02:52:43,721 --> 02:52:46,330
because he was like the first guy
that I felt like it was a real,

2860
02:52:46,420 --> 02:52:50,140
I was scared of him cause I knew he
worked for prior. I knew he was like,

2861
02:52:50,141 --> 02:52:53,410
he's connected to royalty and he'd be
around the comedy store and I'd just

2862
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:57,400
feeding it still sharp is or a
female. It's still right there.

2863
02:52:57,401 --> 02:53:01,900
That's when I was in like
my twins and he laughed.

2864
02:53:01,901 --> 02:53:04,210
One time I was in, I was on stage
in front of like 10 people in,

2865
02:53:04,211 --> 02:53:06,030
I was doing my act and I
heard it in the back of it.

2866
02:53:06,610 --> 02:53:10,580
Ah, ah.

2867
02:53:10,910 --> 02:53:13,430
And then he came up to me afterwards
and he said that you were funny

2868
02:53:13,431 --> 02:53:17,180
motherfucker. He goes, you, you did
that shit. Like it was a sold out room.

2869
02:53:17,450 --> 02:53:19,880
He goes, you're a real
comic. And I was like, wow.

2870
02:53:20,090 --> 02:53:23,210
Like Paul Mooney said that to me.
Cause I remember he was connected.

2871
02:53:23,240 --> 02:53:25,640
He's connected to the fucking, the man.

2872
02:53:25,910 --> 02:53:30,350
He was connected to prize made like all
those, the like it's the contribution,

2873
02:53:30,410 --> 02:53:34,360
like it's, I mean I guess it might be,
maybe it's different in hip hop but,

2874
02:53:34,520 --> 02:53:37,220
but in standup it's similar that we,

2875
02:53:37,900 --> 02:53:41,240
there's guys like Bill Burr
who writes everything he says.

2876
02:53:41,420 --> 02:53:43,850
Everything he says is coming
from a bill. Birthplace of my,

2877
02:53:43,930 --> 02:53:47,300
he's not contributing with anybody. He's
not, you know, he's not collaborating.

2878
02:53:47,301 --> 02:53:51,710
He's just, he's just being built
by, you know, Joey Diaz, same thing.

2879
02:53:51,800 --> 02:53:55,160
Like absolutely everything that
guy says coming out of his head.

2880
02:53:55,460 --> 02:54:00,290
There's something extra to that, you
know, it doesn't sound better or worse.

2881
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:01,730
It's just like you'd go into,

2882
02:54:01,750 --> 02:54:05,930
it's like difference between you
going to a restaurant and everything's

2883
02:54:05,931 --> 02:54:06,764
homemade.

2884
02:54:07,190 --> 02:54:10,670
It might be the same as if everything
wasn't homemade in terms of like the way

2885
02:54:10,671 --> 02:54:14,280
it tastes, but not the
way it feels. Right.

2886
02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:18,500
Like you got like you
writes your own shit.

2887
02:54:18,830 --> 02:54:21,410
Like when you write your own
shit and you play your own songs,

2888
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:23,840
it's like I'm getting a piece of you.

2889
02:54:24,380 --> 02:54:27,350
I'm getting a little piece of you
comes out of your art and that's,

2890
02:54:27,380 --> 02:54:30,950
that's the difference. It's not like
does anything wrong with collaboration?

2891
02:54:30,951 --> 02:54:34,130
Collaboration is, look, if
you look at Chris rock stuff,

2892
02:54:34,131 --> 02:54:37,130
it's arguably some of the greatest
work of all time in terms of like the

2893
02:54:37,131 --> 02:54:40,050
finished product of standby, stand
up comedy bigger and blacker.

2894
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:44,300
It's one of the greatest comedy specials
in the history of the world. Period.

2895
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:47,510
End of discussion. Anybody that
argues with you as an asshole,

2896
02:54:48,410 --> 02:54:51,380
so that came out of collaborative
efforts. It's nothing wrong with that.

2897
02:54:51,440 --> 02:54:56,440
Obviously you made something amazing and
many other bits and many other things

2898
02:54:56,601 --> 02:55:01,400
that a lot of great comics have done,
but it is different, man. It's different,

2899
02:55:01,880 --> 02:55:03,110
you know, but we're all,

2900
02:55:04,700 --> 02:55:07,940
some will in some way connected to each
other and collaborating with each other

2901
02:55:08,090 --> 02:55:08,930
whether we like it or not.

2902
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:12,860
It's not like the the as like
how many stages into the game?

2903
02:55:12,861 --> 02:55:14,060
Where are they going to
collaborate with you?

2904
02:55:14,540 --> 02:55:16,730
Are they going to be there
for the final product?

2905
02:55:17,540 --> 02:55:21,320
Are they just going to be influences all
along the way in your artistic journey?

2906
02:55:22,650 --> 02:55:25,780
Well, yeah, it means a lot
of words. Even the most,

2907
02:55:26,060 --> 02:55:30,310
they'd be the thing that I would consider
that I wrote completely by myself.

2908
02:55:31,210 --> 02:55:33,670
If you want it, if you get
down to the next level,

2909
02:55:33,671 --> 02:55:38,671
it's like there's 25,000 things that
have influenced why I think that way or

2910
02:55:38,681 --> 02:55:42,590
feel that way. What I mean, so
that's determined. That's why I,

2911
02:55:42,730 --> 02:55:44,920
that said the whole angle of
like there's really nothing new.

2912
02:55:44,921 --> 02:55:46,990
It's all about the angle. And,

2913
02:55:47,080 --> 02:55:51,250
and I liken it to like when
I watched two a I like,

2914
02:55:51,280 --> 02:55:55,310
I like watching the, um, old, uh, uh, uh,

2915
02:55:55,340 --> 02:56:00,100
a dog town like documentaries,
dog town and the z boys and shit.

2916
02:56:00,101 --> 02:56:02,830
And it's like the whole
approach to skating was like,

2917
02:56:03,860 --> 02:56:08,770
everybody can do that, but it's the
style you do it in. You know what I mean?

2918
02:56:08,771 --> 02:56:11,470
That's what it really starts coming
down to. There's not many, again,

2919
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:14,350
if there's no brand new
invention or brand new event,

2920
02:56:14,980 --> 02:56:17,970
we're rehashing experiences that are,

2921
02:56:18,010 --> 02:56:20,740
that have been happening
since the dawn of time.

2922
02:56:20,860 --> 02:56:24,400
And you're just finding a new style
at a new angle to dress it up.

2923
02:56:24,401 --> 02:56:28,820
And that makes people feel like
it's new. Sure. Sorrow, romance,

2924
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:30,630
love. That's

2925
02:56:32,470 --> 02:56:37,240
you're breaking the boredom of the way
it's been thought of before in a new way.

2926
02:56:37,420 --> 02:56:40,180
And that's what becomes
appealing to people.

2927
02:56:40,320 --> 02:56:43,180
The goddamn when someone hits
it and they do get through

2928
02:56:43,360 --> 02:56:46,600
with something, that's a new way of
describing some shit we can all relate to.

2929
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:50,440
Makes you feel so good. Like music
makes you feel good in a way.

2930
02:56:50,441 --> 02:56:51,580
The comedy never can.

2931
02:56:51,790 --> 02:56:54,280
Like comedy makes you laugh and it
makes you have a good time together.

2932
02:56:54,281 --> 02:56:58,330
We're all in a room laughing, hooting it
up. But music, when you're by yourself,

2933
02:56:58,331 --> 02:57:02,830
man, you can just be, it's just be you
and that music can you get goosebumps?

2934
02:57:02,950 --> 02:57:07,360
You can lift more weights. You run
faster. Like if fires you up, man.

2935
02:57:07,361 --> 02:57:09,970
If I'm running hills and
I'm listening to music,

2936
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:11,770
I honestly feel like I'm cheating.

2937
02:57:12,190 --> 02:57:15,970
I feel like I'm cheating because I feel
like I take this like burst of like

2938
02:57:16,210 --> 02:57:19,780
artificial energy. It's not dependent
upon my discipline or drive.

2939
02:57:19,960 --> 02:57:22,900
It's not artificial though. I know
it's not, but it's, I didn't make it.

2940
02:57:23,240 --> 02:57:26,080
Yeah, no, but again, see,
I don't know if it's,

2941
02:57:26,081 --> 02:57:27,760
some grass is greener shit and I don't,

2942
02:57:27,770 --> 02:57:29,680
I don't even know if
that's the proper phrase,

2943
02:57:29,681 --> 02:57:33,490
but like just when I
look at as an art form,

2944
02:57:34,790 --> 02:57:37,960
you like that comparison when you're
like, it's good music is this. I'm like,

2945
02:57:37,961 --> 02:57:42,961
comedy is so much more precious because
you work it to that point and even if

2946
02:57:43,721 --> 02:57:47,350
you tell an amazing joke that lives
in me and I fucking love it so much,

2947
02:57:47,351 --> 02:57:51,100
I take it and tell it to him for me,

2948
02:57:51,190 --> 02:57:54,220
the minute I tell it to him, its ends,

2949
02:57:54,280 --> 02:57:57,630
it's like that's the end of that joke
from me. You know what I mean? It's,

2950
02:57:57,790 --> 02:58:00,640
it's like there's a preciousness
today. It's like a fucking,

2951
02:58:01,890 --> 02:58:06,160
to me like there's a finite, you're
creating an art that's like a,

2952
02:58:06,330 --> 02:58:10,290
it's like almost like a dude who creates
art just to fucking watch it. Like,

2953
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:11,530
yeah, Yup, Yup.

2954
02:58:11,660 --> 02:58:15,510
I did it like as some Japanese lantern
that's going to just go up and flames and

2955
02:58:15,511 --> 02:58:19,290
fucking disappear. It's like
there's a beauty in that.

2956
02:58:19,291 --> 02:58:22,920
That to me is far different
and far more again,

2957
02:58:22,921 --> 02:58:26,820
precious because it's,
it's life is shorter.

2958
02:58:27,090 --> 02:58:31,770
You have to watch it and that's my point
is like you have to watch an idea of

2959
02:58:31,771 --> 02:58:34,520
yours come to a finite end. Whereas I,

2960
02:58:34,710 --> 02:58:38,700
when an idea of mine comes to a finite
end and it's good and it connects,

2961
02:58:39,090 --> 02:58:43,530
it can, I can repeat it over and over and
over and people accept that, you know,

2962
02:58:44,250 --> 02:58:48,420
so it's not, it's just a bit to me
it's just the, the preciousness of it.

2963
02:58:48,490 --> 02:58:51,000
You understand? What I'm
getting at is like wow,

2964
02:58:51,001 --> 02:58:55,400
that was that all that work for
that. For the, it's like the limp.

2965
02:58:55,500 --> 02:58:59,040
It's almost like the Olympic
athlete training his old life.

2966
02:58:59,400 --> 02:59:03,240
Like that's how each joke almost is when
you write it. When I, the way I allow,

2967
02:59:03,350 --> 02:59:04,230
I've watched a lot of economy,

2968
02:59:04,231 --> 02:59:07,860
I'm fucking them all over all
y'all motherfuckers shit on the,

2969
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:13,020
when they post specials bill, all those
dudes, I'm Tony, I'm mind all this shit.

2970
02:59:13,290 --> 02:59:16,980
So it's like I'm really a fan of
comedy and it's just amazing to me.

2971
02:59:16,981 --> 02:59:21,180
Like I said, the finite, this
stuff it is is, is precious,

2972
02:59:21,570 --> 02:59:23,010
but that's an interesting
way of putting it.

2973
02:59:23,400 --> 02:59:24,660
I never really thought about that way.

2974
02:59:24,990 --> 02:59:28,320
I thought about it in the way that like
you have to write new stuff that I'd

2975
02:59:28,330 --> 02:59:31,320
never thought about it in a way that like
the first time that someone hears it,

2976
02:59:31,321 --> 02:59:33,740
that's the only time they
really hear it every night.

2977
02:59:33,780 --> 02:59:37,470
Every time after that they know what's
coming. They never see it the same way.

2978
02:59:37,650 --> 02:59:42,450
You know? It's like, again,
like an Olympic athlete,

2979
02:59:42,451 --> 02:59:45,750
you're working that joke, you're
working that joke out and your work,

2980
02:59:45,751 --> 02:59:47,530
the jokes getting better
and it's like, okay,

2981
02:59:47,600 --> 02:59:50,070
it's a bronze metal joke right
now and it's a silver manager.

2982
02:59:50,370 --> 02:59:54,450
If you ever get it to that gold metal
joke and then you drop it where it's

2983
02:59:54,451 --> 02:59:58,260
supposed to be in that place in time of
this special or the thing that everybody

2984
02:59:58,261 --> 02:59:59,910
sees, then it's done.

2985
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,340
You know what's interesting now
is there's a lot of comedy nerds.

2986
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:06,540
They want to watch the process is the
watch it flip punch lines around and flip

2987
03:00:06,541 --> 03:00:09,930
things around and they go, hey, you did
that thing different now I go, yeah,

2988
03:00:09,931 --> 03:00:11,150
I'm trying to figure out how to do it.

2989
03:00:11,330 --> 03:00:14,340
That'd be amazing to me if I had the
time to just sit and watch you guys work

2990
03:00:14,530 --> 03:00:17,100
out like go to the comedy
club every night or whatever.

2991
03:00:17,420 --> 03:00:19,860
These two ladies from Arizona
and they came down to the store,

2992
03:00:19,930 --> 03:00:21,810
they travel around the world,

2993
03:00:21,811 --> 03:00:24,960
they want to see Ari in Europe or
Iceland or some shit, but their,

2994
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:27,420
their comedy nerds and they
come to watch and they'll like,

2995
03:00:27,421 --> 03:00:30,600
they'll see you like two months
ago and then they come see again.

2996
03:00:30,910 --> 03:00:33,370
I had conversations with them
and I'm like, yeah, I like,

2997
03:00:33,390 --> 03:00:36,150
I switched that up like you
put that there. I'm like, yeah,

2998
03:00:36,151 --> 03:00:38,480
I'm trying to figure out where to put
it. I don't know where that got hurt on.

2999
03:00:38,490 --> 03:00:42,090
My point is like there's a journey there
until you get to that point where it's

3000
03:00:42,091 --> 03:00:47,091
like dropped in that special or the
thing that's been seen across broad

3001
03:00:47,251 --> 03:00:48,084
spectrum,

3002
03:00:48,270 --> 03:00:52,260
it is a journey and they know that
because they're fans of the comedy,

3003
03:00:52,261 --> 03:00:55,950
so they know there's things that thing's
gonna that thing's going to build into

3004
03:00:55,951 --> 03:00:57,920
something, you know? That's
cool. I would love again, that's,

3005
03:00:57,960 --> 03:00:59,980
that sounds like a fucking
amazing time to me.

3006
03:01:00,370 --> 03:01:03,880
It's also like if you're a fan of music,
it's hard to go watch people practice.

3007
03:01:05,140 --> 03:01:06,520
It's different. Yeah.

3008
03:01:06,580 --> 03:01:09,850
Because you're practicing in front of
motherfuckers and they're reacting.

3009
03:01:10,360 --> 03:01:13,210
I'm practicing what we
do. We call it shedding.

3010
03:01:14,120 --> 03:01:17,520
Cause we're locked in a fucking room doing
it by ourselves and we ain't going to

3011
03:01:17,521 --> 03:01:21,490
do it in front of you until we got that
shit right. You know, we can't do that.

3012
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:23,680
We have to do it in front
of people. But the weird,

3013
03:01:23,710 --> 03:01:27,760
the weird thing about it is it's like
a, like they can come and see it.

3014
03:01:28,300 --> 03:01:31,960
They can see practice. No, that's not,
people can't see you practice. Really.

3015
03:01:32,350 --> 03:01:35,960
It's not practice. You're just
fucking perform. It's proof.

3016
03:01:36,650 --> 03:01:39,130
Comedy's performance art, you
know what I mean? Yeah, for sure.

3017
03:01:39,160 --> 03:01:42,130
So it's like you're working
it out. You have the concept,

3018
03:01:42,131 --> 03:01:46,420
but it has to be worked out. It has to
be walked to a destination so to speak.

3019
03:01:46,450 --> 03:01:48,310
You know what I mean? The
other part of it is though,

3020
03:01:48,311 --> 03:01:51,880
there's so many more people doing
music from the rod doing comedy,

3021
03:01:52,510 --> 03:01:55,810
like the waters are like less
populated. What do you think?

3022
03:01:56,020 --> 03:01:59,320
Like the numbers for sure.
Right? Absolutely. Because hey,

3023
03:01:59,321 --> 03:02:02,830
more great bands and there are great
Camino. There's not a lot of great bands.

3024
03:02:02,831 --> 03:02:07,060
There's a lot of fucking artists. Like
there's not a lot of new and great bands.

3025
03:02:07,210 --> 03:02:10,090
Name a couple new gray
pants. Oh yeah. Okay. I saw,

3026
03:02:10,091 --> 03:02:11,240
I thought we were talking
about like coming,

3027
03:02:11,470 --> 03:02:14,890
you know the mailers for
all active currently. Yeah.

3028
03:02:15,170 --> 03:02:18,520
Do the rolling stones are still on
tour? What the fuck is happening?

3029
03:02:18,880 --> 03:02:20,350
They just waiting for someone to explode.

3030
03:02:20,650 --> 03:02:23,620
The funny thing was I think I went to
their farewell tour and like fucking

3031
03:02:29,940 --> 03:02:34,450
blossom and everybody back then
was saying, isn't it amazing?

3032
03:02:34,620 --> 03:02:38,170
They're still touring amazing
Aerosmith too. Same deal.

3033
03:02:38,380 --> 03:02:42,190
They were probably in their 50s then
you know now what the like seventies

3034
03:02:42,190 --> 03:02:45,220
eighties, David Lee Roth looks healthy
as fuck. It was funny when you were,

3035
03:02:45,250 --> 03:02:49,510
you had him in his, uh, in your
lyrics. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Dude,

3036
03:02:49,511 --> 03:02:53,800
he's healthy as fuck, man. That guy
has no connection to the outside world.

3037
03:02:53,801 --> 03:02:56,590
He has a lady he uses.
The lady has a phone. She,

3038
03:02:56,820 --> 03:02:59,380
she tells David where he should
go and when did she meet you?

3039
03:02:59,410 --> 03:03:01,420
David goes there and David
doesn't bring a phone.

3040
03:03:01,421 --> 03:03:04,870
I don't even know if he had a wallet. I
paid for dinner. I'm like, this guy is,

3041
03:03:04,930 --> 03:03:09,930
he's not connected at all to give a
fuck smiles and everybody couldn't be

3042
03:03:10,091 --> 03:03:12,700
friendlier. He just knows his vibration.

3043
03:03:12,940 --> 03:03:16,180
He figured it out and he
sticks with it. Can't, hey,

3044
03:03:18,310 --> 03:03:22,420
he's hilarious, man. He's a fascinating
cat that David Lee Roth, you know,

3045
03:03:22,421 --> 03:03:25,210
he lived in Japan for like
a year and learned Kendo,

3046
03:03:25,420 --> 03:03:29,000
which is the art of sword fighting,
trained under a Japanese mastery,

3047
03:03:29,020 --> 03:03:33,040
brought his dog, renting an apartment,
got a fucking apartment in Tokyo,

3048
03:03:33,430 --> 03:03:36,910
and just every day went to Kendo.
Practice got whacked with bamboo swords.

3049
03:03:39,030 --> 03:03:41,470
My, my, one of my traumas,
the guy, he's a fish,

3050
03:03:41,471 --> 03:03:45,580
he's actually the band fish bone
into one of the namesakes and uh,

3051
03:03:46,690 --> 03:03:50,050
uh, he's into all that, like heavy
Jujitsu, but like martial arts.

3052
03:03:50,051 --> 03:03:51,430
But he's weapons trained.

3053
03:03:51,431 --> 03:03:56,431
Like how many people move to Japan
to train with a Japanese Kendo master

3054
03:03:58,220 --> 03:04:02,000
for a fucking year? He
didn't even speak Japanese.

3055
03:04:02,210 --> 03:04:07,210
He brings his dog to the other side of
the planet to learn sword fighting for a

3056
03:04:07,910 --> 03:04:11,810
year. And he's David Lee Roth and
he learned of these things. Oh,

3057
03:04:11,930 --> 03:04:15,020
he learned a lot of shit. Yeah, he
can speak like a broken version,

3058
03:04:15,021 --> 03:04:18,980
I'm sure of of Japanese, but I
bet his candles pretty bad ass.

3059
03:04:19,010 --> 03:04:22,610
I don't want a sword fight him.
He really went for it. You know,

3060
03:04:22,700 --> 03:04:27,250
he trained a martial arts and
karate and kickboxing under Benny,

3061
03:04:27,480 --> 03:04:31,970
her or Ketos Benny the jet or Kitezh
who was like a California legend,

3062
03:04:31,971 --> 03:04:35,600
a worldly Jim like in Van Nuys ran
eyes. When I first came to California,

3063
03:04:35,601 --> 03:04:36,950
there's two things that I needed to do.

3064
03:04:37,190 --> 03:04:40,070
I needed to go to the comedy
store first and foremost.

3065
03:04:40,100 --> 03:04:42,170
Number two is I needed
to go to the jet center.

3066
03:04:42,470 --> 03:04:44,810
The jet center was bending
the jets. Place a van.

3067
03:04:44,811 --> 03:04:48,470
I shot my first album cover
there. Did you really?

3068
03:04:48,620 --> 03:04:52,880
I'm pretty sure that's what
year, like 1988 oh my God.

3069
03:04:53,180 --> 03:04:54,920
I wasn't out here yet. That's crazy.

3070
03:04:54,921 --> 03:04:59,130
I was just starting the first ever
last record with ice tea. Iced tea,

3071
03:04:59,150 --> 03:05:04,040
like had a sign. Wow, that's
crazy. The label. Yeah.

3072
03:05:04,041 --> 03:05:05,480
I got here too late man.

3073
03:05:05,481 --> 03:05:09,680
I got here in 94 and the gym had been
so badly damaged by the earthquake that

3074
03:05:09,681 --> 03:05:12,920
when it started raining was
a year after the earthquake.

3075
03:05:13,430 --> 03:05:16,430
When it started raining, the rain was
leaking all throughout the ceiling.

3076
03:05:16,431 --> 03:05:18,920
The ceiling was a wreck and they had
abandoned the building and I don't think

3077
03:05:18,921 --> 03:05:19,500
they ever,

3078
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:22,490
they started off another place in north
Hollywood but it wasn't quite the same

3079
03:05:22,491 --> 03:05:22,761
thing.

3080
03:05:22,761 --> 03:05:26,840
Like the jet center in Van Nuys was like
one of those places where I'm positive.

3081
03:05:27,020 --> 03:05:29,690
No, that's where it is. Cause
it's a boxing ring like,

3082
03:05:29,691 --> 03:05:31,620
and I remember the Jetson
incident, that's where we shot it.

3083
03:05:31,621 --> 03:05:34,910
That's how I knew about banks. And all.
That's how I learned about tough dudes,

3084
03:05:34,911 --> 03:05:35,421
man. I went there,

3085
03:05:35,421 --> 03:05:40,421
I was so nervous cause I came here from
New York and I was still sparring back

3086
03:05:40,701 --> 03:05:40,881
then.

3087
03:05:40,881 --> 03:05:43,940
I had decided to stop sparring yet I
just needed something to do and I was out

3088
03:05:43,941 --> 03:05:47,630
here doing TV work and I was training
with all these gang bangers. Man.

3089
03:05:48,380 --> 03:05:51,320
I remember this one dude, he
had something on his back,

3090
03:05:51,321 --> 03:05:53,660
I don't remember what he,
what the name of the gang was,

3091
03:05:54,010 --> 03:05:57,020
let's like flopped us
or something like that.

3092
03:05:57,110 --> 03:06:00,680
And then it just said
fuck the rest on his back.

3093
03:06:01,190 --> 03:06:05,660
And I remember thinking Jesus and one of
the guys like blinky Rodriguez who was

3094
03:06:05,661 --> 03:06:10,580
a world class world championship level
kickboxer he knocked out Johnny Terrio.

3095
03:06:10,580 --> 03:06:11,380
He was like a,

3096
03:06:11,380 --> 03:06:16,040
like top of the food chain kickboxer he
had a son that succumb to gang violence

3097
03:06:16,041 --> 03:06:19,100
and so he like worked really, I'm
sure. Pretty sure this is a story.

3098
03:06:19,280 --> 03:06:21,600
And he worked really
hard to like help the,

3099
03:06:21,601 --> 03:06:25,310
the gang members in the community and
bring them in the gym for free and teach

3100
03:06:25,311 --> 03:06:30,290
them kickboxing and show them that they
have value in that they get work out

3101
03:06:30,291 --> 03:06:33,800
their differences inside the ring
like men and not get involved in gang

3102
03:06:33,801 --> 03:06:34,750
violence, check test.

3103
03:06:34,790 --> 03:06:38,330
And so it was a weird thing because
we'd go there and he was like,

3104
03:06:38,570 --> 03:06:43,190
you're taking kickpop on the fucking
kid from the suburbs of Boston. Okay.

3105
03:06:43,220 --> 03:06:47,570
And I'm a comedian and I'm like fucking
26 years old and I'm hanging out with

3106
03:06:47,571 --> 03:06:52,571
gang bangers and there's like hardcore
kickboxing gym of one of my martial arts

3107
03:06:53,900 --> 03:06:56,550
idols, Benny or Kitezh. And another one,

3108
03:06:56,551 --> 03:06:59,890
blinky Rodriguez was another one of
my martial arts idols and you know,

3109
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,970
they didn't know who the fuck I was and
I was just in there like training with

3110
03:07:02,971 --> 03:07:04,230
them. And then it went
under and I was like,

3111
03:07:04,290 --> 03:07:09,290
if I got this brief glimpse into
this place that was in my childhood,

3112
03:07:10,290 --> 03:07:12,270
like my, my martial arts childhood,

3113
03:07:12,480 --> 03:07:14,700
like that was one of the
MCAS that I need to go to.

3114
03:07:15,180 --> 03:07:19,710
I needed to go drays the jet center,
but it just all went away real quick.

3115
03:07:19,711 --> 03:07:23,190
Like within, I don't know, I don't know
how many months after I joined there.

3116
03:07:23,940 --> 03:07:27,510
One was forever everlasting. Me
Like in a corner of a building,

3117
03:07:27,750 --> 03:07:29,970
cause they had the Everlast
they had me in a boxing ring.

3118
03:07:30,270 --> 03:07:33,600
Then just fucking [inaudible]. That
was the jet center. We shot that.

3119
03:07:33,660 --> 03:07:37,350
It's Benny. The jet was nasty.
There it is. You Go, wow.

3120
03:07:37,410 --> 03:07:42,150
That's actually my father. That's my
father on the, on the upper right there.

3121
03:07:42,180 --> 03:07:44,490
Dude. I bought that. Guaranteed.

3122
03:07:44,491 --> 03:07:48,160
I bought that CD 100% a
hundred percent I bought that.

3123
03:07:48,240 --> 03:07:52,620
So that was all with the jet center
man. Wow. That guy was a legend man.

3124
03:07:52,890 --> 03:07:54,000
Benny or Ketos was a beast.

3125
03:07:54,450 --> 03:07:58,080
He would go to Hawaiian fighting these
crazy mixed tournaments or they do judo

3126
03:07:58,081 --> 03:08:02,910
on you and boxing and all kinds of crazy
shit. These guys were the originators,

3127
03:08:02,911 --> 03:08:07,040
man. They were the hardcore second
wave after Bruce [inaudible].

3128
03:08:07,580 --> 03:08:10,560
Damn handsome bastard.
God Damn He, look dude,

3129
03:08:10,561 --> 03:08:13,080
I got like a little Hitler stash
or something going on there.

3130
03:08:13,170 --> 03:08:14,430
What would I think? I
was trying to grow it.

3131
03:08:15,860 --> 03:08:20,550
I looked like a quarterback in
a movie like a high school movie

3132
03:08:26,520 --> 03:08:28,920
Burley Asshole who I was I
think 16 right there, man.

3133
03:08:29,160 --> 03:08:31,410
That shot is taken by a
legendary photographer.

3134
03:08:31,550 --> 03:08:34,320
Don't name by the name of Glen
Friedman. Man. He took many,

3135
03:08:34,321 --> 03:08:37,770
many of the most iconic shots
ever do. Shout out to Glenn.

3136
03:08:37,890 --> 03:08:41,330
You would play a perfect guy in like a
movie about a quarterback was an asshole

3137
03:08:41,390 --> 03:08:42,840
to his girlfriend. There's
another guy in the,

3138
03:08:42,960 --> 03:08:46,080
in the school and he's like real sensitive
and he writes poetry and the girl

3139
03:08:46,270 --> 03:08:49,680
wants to be with him like want to kick
his ass. Yeah, that's you right there.

3140
03:08:49,681 --> 03:08:53,940
Bullying. Yeah. Listen man,
this lady is fuck right.
