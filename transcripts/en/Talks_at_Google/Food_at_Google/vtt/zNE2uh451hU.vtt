SARAH ANNESE: Thank you
everybody for having us.

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:05.550
This is one of the coolest
things we've ever done.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.290
As Thomas, said
I'm Sarah Annese.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.710
This is Giancarlo Annese.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.880
We are married, not brother and
sister-- common misconception.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.530
So we wrote "Beer
Lover's New York."

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.910
We're super excited to be here.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.020
Thank you guys for
having us, and we're

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.300
excited to try some
home brews later.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.360
So it's really awesome.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.650
Last May we were up
in Glens Falls, which

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.760
is kind of like northern
New York in the Adirondacks.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.480
And we were visiting this
little brewery called Davidson

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.490
Brothers, and it was, you
know, like a little brew pub.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.540
And we're talking to the
founder, Rick Davidson,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.560
and there's a lull
in conversation

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.340
and he kind of turns to me and
goes, what size are your feet?

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.109
So next thing I know I'm inside
the brewing kettle-- cleaning

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:57.900
the brewing kettle.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.129
So then like a month
later, we find ourselves

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.575
100 feet up in the air
in a cherry picker,

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:07.950
in the middle of
the finger lakes

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.710
looking over at
what is soon going

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.840
to be-- which you
could see here--

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.545
a brewery called
Miles Craft Ales.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.700
This whole experience
of writing this book

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.320
has had so many times where
we've kind of just looked

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.790
at each other and been like,
holy crap-- are we really here?

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.680
So those are just two examples
of that kind of thing.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.420
New York State has an
incredibly rich beer history.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.190
At one time, the state produced
90% of the country's hops.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.370
And we have these two really
historical breweries--

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.900
Matt Brewing, which
was founded in 1888,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.270
is still owned by
the Matt family.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.120
And made the first beer served
after prohibition legally--

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.100
which is Utica Club.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.140
And it's definitely iconic beer.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.960
And then we also have Genesee,
which was founded in 1878.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.840
And even though it's
not craft anymore,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.320
it's still part of New
York state beer history.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.700
Fast forward to today--
since we finished

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.630
writing the book,
which was August 5th,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.210
30 breweries have
opened up in New York.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.770
So it's definitely a
really exciting time

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.710
to be involved in beer
in New York state.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.070
The laws are changing to
support this industry,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.810
and it's really cool.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.530
How we got this
book-- as Thomas said,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.920
we write the website
beerunion.com.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.810
It started as a
little blog in 2009,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.770
and we redeveloped it
into website in 2012.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.810
And then in April of 2013 we
just got an email, randomly,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.630
from an editor at Globe
Pequot Press asking us

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.630
if we could write this book.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.430
And we were just kind of
like, what, yes, of course.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.915
So we are part of a
beer lover series.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.340
There's beer lover's
Colorado, beer lover's Oregon,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.350
beer lover's mid-Atlantic--
books about regional and state

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.820
beer cultures and beer guides.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.830
So we are the New
York one, and our book

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.960
is separated by region.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.160
It covers the best-- not
all-- but the best breweries,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.700
brew pubs, and bars
across the whole state.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.610
There is New York City,
Long Island, Hudson Valley,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.170
capital region, northern New
York and the Adirondacks,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.962
central New York and the Finger
Lakes, and Western New York.

00:03:52.962 --> 00:03:54.670
So today we're going
to talk a little bit

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.190
about regional trends
across the state

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.240
and also highlight some
interesting and exciting

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.980
breweries going on.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.570
GIANCARLO ANNESE: One of
the most challenging parts

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.170
about it was the four
months that we had

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.800
and the size of the state.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.640
To do the research we
traveled over 4,000 miles

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.880
from Buffalo, Lake
Placid, Green Port.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.150
So we were all over, and
we only had four months

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.690
to do this while holding
down full-time jobs.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.640
So it was a lot
of long weekends,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.230
a lot of time in the car.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.830
We used trains, planes,
automobiles-- the whole thing.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.862
We had our adventures
on Amtrak and such.

00:04:42.862 --> 00:04:44.320
I mean, we were
all over the place.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.820
And some of the trips were
kind of natural trips,

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.590
and we knew right
from when we started

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.100
that they would be dedicated
trips-- like the Adirondacks

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.169
and Lake Placid.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.960
That's one of the first
things that we did.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.450
Even before we signed
our book contract,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.910
we sat down and
looked at the state--

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.320
where the breweries
were, what kind of trips

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.240
we were going to need
to make, and how many

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.580
we could jam into these trips.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.700
Because with 135 breweries,
plus bars and home

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.200
brew shops and festivals
that we also covered,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.080
it was a lot to fit
into four months.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.610
We had trips to
Rochester, Buffalo, self

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.250
explanatory trips, and around
the New York City area, which

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.420
thankfully we already knew
pretty well from covering

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.680
the city on our website.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.380
But probably the biggest
challenge was the Finger Lakes.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.150
How many of you have been
around the Finger Lakes?

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.570
Do you guys know the
Finger Lakes at all?

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.440
There's not really
great transportation

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440
around the Finger Lakes.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.830
There's a lot of small roads
connecting these breweries--

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.770
not really major
highways connecting them.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.690
You have 90 that
runs along the north,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.380
and you have Route 17
that runs along the south.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.230
But in the middle
there are a lot

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.080
of roads that run
north-south but not much

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.640
that runs east-west.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.970
So it was tough to get
to all these breweries,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.030
try to meet with the
brewers, and taste the beer.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.570
So we had to do a bunch
of different trips

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.680
to the Finger Lakes
and central New York.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.919
Thankfully, Sarah did
most of the driving,

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.460
and I did most of the tasting--
which was pretty good for me.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.020
And some of the days we
were at a brewery at noon,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.110
and we would hit five
or six on a normal day.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.057
We topped out at 10 one day.

00:06:49.057 --> 00:06:50.640
SARAH ANNESE: It's
a really tough job.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.920
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Yeah.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.120
Well, when everywhere you
go you ask for a flight,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.380
and the tenth brewery brings
out a flight of 10 beers--

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.630
that's not what
you want, actually.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:10.790
So that was a challenge,
but I think we actually

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.030
finished with a couple weekends
left at the end where we didn't

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.870
have to visit any breweries,
which I was kind of amazed

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.770
about.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.010
I think we visited
our last breweries

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.380
in the middle of July.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.820
SARAH ANNESE: It was
July 12th, I think.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.680
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Yeah, we
finished at Southern Tier,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.300
in western New York.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.700
I'm sure most of you
know Southern Tier.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.380
And that was a great
place to finish it.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.565
It was a lot of planning,
but it was worth it.

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:46.610
And because we got to
do that we surprised,

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.410
I think, some people
by actually going

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.397
to visit them in
the four months,

00:07:50.397 --> 00:07:51.730
instead of just calling them up.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.580
We got to really see what
the trends were in the state

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.315
and how the regions
are really different.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.640
One of the regions that
surprised us the most

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.370
was the Adirondacks-- around
Lake Placid they don't really

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.900
seem to care very
much about what's

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.552
going on outside their bubble.

00:08:18.552 --> 00:08:20.510
The breweries don't really
distribute very far,

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:26.115
and they're focused on making
classic English styles-- scotch

00:08:26.115 --> 00:08:29.380
ales, red ales.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.950
We had a brewer look at
us totally straight faced

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.850
and tell us that the
hop craze is just a fad.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.809
It's gonna go away.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.039
People will get over
it and stop using

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:46.270
hops so much, they'll get back
to scotch ales and brown ales,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.982
and, you know,
they'll just get over.

00:08:49.982 --> 00:08:51.440
That was one of
those moments where

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.790
we were kind of dumbfounded.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.410
I mean, it's kind of great
that these people just

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.910
do what they do and
they don't care.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.850
SARAH ANNESE: And I mean
the same line up for years.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.730
They just never brew
anything different

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.840
and they just stick
to what they know.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.691
There's something really
beautiful in that.

00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:07.690
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Right.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.100
And then even this
little brewery--

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:18.860
Blue Line Brewing, in Saranac
Lake-- it's in an old car wash.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.770
So they benefited from
some great drainage.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:30.790
But he's kind of the
experimental brewer

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.680
in the region, almost, because
he added ginger to his red ale.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.550
And he made a pale
ale, but it's sweet.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.030
It's a sweet pale ale.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:46.640
So it's not a American pale ale,
that by most other standards

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.540
is pretty hoppy.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.310
It's sweet.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.350
It's malt forwarded.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.820
The hops are almost
not important to him.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.640
So that for him to be kind of
the new experimental guy doing

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.320
that stuff-- compared to
other regions in the state--

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.640
it's kind of incredible
that there's this feel.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.129
Almost all the brewers
feel this way in that area.

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:11.920
They've just been doing
what they're doing,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.647
and they're going to
continue doing it.

00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:15.980
SARAH ANNESE: So this blue
line on the right-- those two

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.390
photos-- that's the
car wash outside,

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.010
and that's his brew system.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.870
And on the left,
those are the tab

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.060
handles at Great
Adirondack Pub and Brewery,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.860
and the brewer
actually carves those.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.580
So he does all this
woodwork and it feels really

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.850
like the Adirondacks.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.240
GIANCARLO ANNESE: We saw a lot
of that, actually, upstate.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.970
Where Brewer's-- they're brewing
and they're making everything

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.850
else in that brewery.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.970
They are working at
the bar, and they're

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.560
making the tap handles and--

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.802
SARAH ANNESE: Making the
food for the brew pub.

00:10:46.802 --> 00:10:49.010
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Yeah,
there was one little brew pub

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.440
that we want to where
the brewer-owner,

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.460
he does everything.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.965
He cooks.

00:10:53.965 --> 00:10:54.965
He does the whole thing.

00:10:54.965 --> 00:10:56.480
SARAH ANNESE: We were
sitting there talking to him,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.100
and then he took
a break to go put

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.401
some french fries in the fryer.

00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:00.900
And then came back
and talked to us.

00:11:04.534 --> 00:11:06.950
GIANCARLO ANNESE: So upstate
is really different than some

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.220
of the breweries that
you might see down here.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.465
The Hudson Valley, on the other
side, is incredibly creative.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.230
Newburgh Brewing
kind of, we thought,

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.160
encapsulates a lot of
the range of the state.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.680
They're making things like
English style bitters,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.200
that are nice and sessionable.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.630
They're making cream ales,
kind of classic styles.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.670
On the flip side, they
make some crazy stuff.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.550
They made this beer
called Cafe Sour,

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.650
that we had when
we were up there.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.124
It's just kind of bizarre.

00:11:44.124 --> 00:11:45.290
SARAH ANNESE: But delicious.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.206
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Yes.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.710
So it's sour.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.240
It's tart.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.530
It's got a light body,
and it's refreshing.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:58.090
But they use Ethiopian
coffee and geisha root in it.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.500
It smells exactly like
coffee and that aromas

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.510
that you might associate
with a stout or a porter.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.980
And then you get this really
tart beer coming after it,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.510
and it's a little
confusing but wonderful.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.290
So they're doing that.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:21.210
And they're barrel aging and
trying out different yeasts.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:26.220
Peekskill Brewery, which you
see there on the bottom left,

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.250
is really easy to visit
from here, actually.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.630
It's right across the street
from the Peekskill train

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:38.070
station, and they've got
one of the first coolships

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.370
in New York state.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.890
So they have cooled
beer in an open vessel,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.010
after it's been brewed.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.500
And they're brewing things
like simple sour, which

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.100
is corn and wheat based
and also really sour, tart,

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.850
refreshing-- great for
summer type of deal.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:03.190
And they brew a beer
called Amazeballs, which

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:08.069
is like an IPA with all
the aroma and flavors

00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:10.360
but without bitterness,
because they just didn't really

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.570
use much bittering hops at all.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.060
So they're really
trying to find new ways

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.190
to do interesting things
and change things up.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.710
And then they have little
guys like Sloop Brewing, which

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.780
you may have heard
recently-- they're expanding.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.260
But they started
out in a garage,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.010
selling a peach berliner
weisse at farmers' markets.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:41.130
So the Hudson Valley
for us really kind of

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.250
showcased the wide variety
of what's out there,

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:45.997
the creativity--

00:13:45.997 --> 00:13:47.830
SARAH ANNESE: Really
pushing the boundaries.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:48.788
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Yeah.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.250
And then in New York City.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.677
New York City-- I'm
sure most of you

00:13:56.677 --> 00:13:58.510
have been to visit some
of these breweries--

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:04.560
but New York City has kind of
a weird brewing scene because

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.710
of the space issues and the
cost associated with being here.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:15.810
So a place like Big Alice
opened on a 10 gallon system--

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.910
so probably what some of you
home brewers are brewing on.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.974
I mean it's tiny.

00:14:20.974 --> 00:14:22.390
You walk into the
brewery and it's

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.015
just-- it's just
there, that's it.

00:14:25.015 --> 00:14:26.390
SARAH ANNESE: Can
we take a tour?

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.556
Yeah, sure, it's right here.

00:14:27.556 --> 00:14:28.532
Here it is.

00:14:28.532 --> 00:14:29.490
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Yeah.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.850
So they started on that.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.940
They're moving to a
five barrel system soon.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.990
They're brewing with kind
of wild, wacky things

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.920
like kumquats and
jalapenos and teas

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.790
and all kinds of
different things.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.130
We hadn't heard of
some of them before.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.910
So they're really kind
of changing things up.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.800
They're taking a home
brewer's approach to beer.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.950
Like Chris Cuzme,
which is actually

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.630
at 508 Gastrobrewery--
which is not far from here.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.330
How many of you have been
to 508 Gastrobrewery?

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:05.270
Any of you?

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.740
SARAH ANNESE: It's in Tribeca.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.670
Some people.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.760
This is a picture of
his brewing system

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.980
on the bottom, right side.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.980
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Right.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.090
It's a small, two
barrel homemade system.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.880
SARAH ANNESE: It's in the
basement of this Tribeca

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.380
restaurant.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.046
GIANCARLO ANNESE: It's jammed in
to the basement of a restaurant

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:26.788
that's been made into
a little brew pub.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.300
These tiny little
breweries are what's

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.490
driving New York's growth,
to some degree right now.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.460
And they're fitting it in.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.020
But we're also getting some of
these mid-sized brewers that

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.050
are brewing on 15
barrel systems,

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:52.430
like Sam Richardson at Other
Half, who's pictured here.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.530
He's brewing almost
exclusively west coast style

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.730
IPA's-- so the complete
opposite of the Atterondacks.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.529
All you taste is hops
when you go in there

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:04.820
and when you come out of there.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.819
SARAH ANNESE: It's good.

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:06.810
It's a lot of hops.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:07.768
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Yeah.

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:11.080
You can't really taste
much else after, though.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.810
New York City is seeing
this boom, and a lot of it

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.550
is happening out in
the outer boroughs.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.330
Finally, all of the
boroughs have a brewery.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.340
Flagship Brewing just
opened on Staten Island.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.740
The Bronx got Gun
Hill in February,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.800
and Bronx Brewery is finally
going to be opening, hopefully

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.260
later this summer.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.880
In Queens-- like Big Alice
Brewing and Transmitter Brewing

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.390
and SingleCut-- Queens
is the fastest growing

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.360
in terms of breweries.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.930
They just keep adding them.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.138
SARAH ANNESE: Like five or
six in the past two years,

00:16:50.138 --> 00:16:51.070
even-- breweries.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.520
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Yeah,
so the New York City

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.040
kind of landscape of beer
is really changing a lot.

00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:02.495
SARAH ANNESE: Now we'll
talk about the Finger Lakes.

00:17:05.288 --> 00:17:06.829
We talk about the
Finger Lakes a lot,

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.800
because we were so surprised.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.079
It has the largest concentration
of breweries in any region.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.569
I mean Seneca lake alone,
there's like 10 breweries

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.359
right around it.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:20.576
And a lot of the
breweries are in wineries.

00:17:20.576 --> 00:17:22.950
And what happened was, we
talked to a lot of these owners

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.827
and they were like,
well, women were coming,

00:17:24.827 --> 00:17:26.410
and they were bringing
their husbands.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.589
And they were going
on wine tours,

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.839
and the husbands didn't want
to drink any of the wine.

00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:31.070
So we opened a brewery.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.550
On the top left side you'll
see War Horse Brewing, which

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.580
is like a theme
park of drinking,

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.710
of wine and beer and food.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.640
There's different
areas you can go to.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.370
There's like a pirate
themed food place.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:56.330
They're opening to be like a one
stop shop of drinking and fun.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.660
And then on the
right, this picture

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.100
is from Starkey's Lookout.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.890
The Finger Lakes--
it's just the view.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.234
The view is really what
makes it so amazing.

00:18:07.234 --> 00:18:08.650
The one on the
bottom left, that's

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.620
from Two Goats Brewing,
which is also on Seneca Lake.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.940
You're just sitting out on this
deck, drinking a fresh beer.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.920
What could be any
better than that?

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.790
What we did find about
the Finger Lakes,

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.000
was a little weird,
was that nobody's

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.290
really doing any barrel aging.

00:18:26.326 --> 00:18:29.680
There's such an opportunity here
for the winery slash brewery

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.910
to use the wine barrels
and age some beer.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.110
But we didn't really
see any of that.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.470
Although we did
see War Horse makes

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:41.060
a riesling ale, which is juice
from New York Riesling Grapes,

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.920
blended into the wort.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.819
So it's contracted out,
but it was really good.

00:18:45.819 --> 00:18:48.360
GIANCARLO ANNESE: And a lot of
those Finger Lakes breweries--

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.130
they're contract brewing.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.590
At regional breweries in
New York State, mostly.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.360
I think they're kind of
catching up a little bit

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.780
with-- maybe they want to
have a brewing system or not,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.920
but they're not quite there yet.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.580
SARAH ANNESE: So that brings
us to western New York.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.660
On the left, that's
Community Beer Works,

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.100
which is in Buffalo.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.210
And on the right, on the top is
Rock Brewing and on the bottom

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.260
is Rohrbach Brewing, both
of which are in Rochester.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.100
The interesting thing
about western New York

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.641
is that they don't
really care what's

00:19:21.641 --> 00:19:23.700
going on in New York City.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.685
They associate way
more with Toronto.

00:19:25.685 --> 00:19:26.720
It's closer.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.352
They're in their
own little world of,

00:19:28.352 --> 00:19:30.310
you know, we're gonna
make a really great beer.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.018
And we're just gonna
have it around here.

00:19:32.018 --> 00:19:38.270
We're not gonna send it off to
New York, or to New York City.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.240
They're making some
really amazing beers.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.545
And I don't know about you guys,
but we grew up on Long Island,

00:19:44.545 --> 00:19:45.920
and we live in
New York City now.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.570
So we kind of felt
like, we have everything

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.910
we want here in New York City.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.420
What do we need go to
Buffalo or Rochester?

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.970
Let me tell you that
this book-- I mean

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.060
we couldn't have
been more wrong.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.960
The beers at Community Beer
Works, they're so great.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.000
It's just so worth the trip
to Buffalo or Rochester

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.910
just to taste some beers.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:13.080
It was a really eye
opening experience for us.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.730
So then we have
Long Island, which

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.670
is all the way on the
other side of the state.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.510
Particularly Greenport-- this
picture on the bottom left

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.490
is of the view of
Greenport Harbor.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.660
And Greenport is really
representative of what's

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.130
going on in Long
Island right now,

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:33.370
which is growth Long Island
Beer-- so many breweries are

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.810
opening, and they're
getting bigger.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.620
Greenport just
last week opened up

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:45.340
an expansion in Peconic,
which will increase their beer

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:51.880
output to over 25,000
barrels, from just over 3,000.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.820
So it's really a lot of
excitement and growth

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.910
going on in Long Island.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.380
And the one thing that the
Long Island breweries are

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.880
is they're very collaborative.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.090
So on the top left,
that's Barrier Brewing.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.240
And Barrier kind of
made news, in a bad way.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.940
The entire brewhouse
was destroyed

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.205
during Hurricane Sandy.

00:21:10.205 --> 00:21:12.830
And at one point, we didn't know
if they would ever open again.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.860
They didn't know if they
would ever open again.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.360
But the Long Island
brewers really

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.040
kind of banned
together behind them.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.960
Blue Point invited them all
over to do a collaboration brew,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.990
and they raised almost
$30,000 to rebuild.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:31.330
Now they opened a new
taproom a couple months ago.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.299
There's really a lot of
collaboration and community

00:21:35.299 --> 00:21:36.590
going on with Long Island beer.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:44.210
When we got this
assignment I thought,

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.380
you know what, no big deal.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.520
It's four months.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.690
There's two of us.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.950
We can do all this traveling
and all this writing

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.090
and it's not really
going to be so hard.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:52.760
What was that?

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.720
Wrong.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.967
My God, it was like a lot more
work than we even thought.

00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:00.800
We had a couple of
challenges along the way.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.580
We changed our editor.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.760
Our original editor left,
and another editor came in.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.070
And thankfully, she was as
excited about the project

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.790
as we were, so she
really pushed it through.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.140
We had heard horror stories
about people changing

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:19.430
their editors and their project
just kind of like fizzling out.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:25.730
This is a guidebook, so I
really wanted-- oh sorry, I

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.650
should say that a
lot of people ask us

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.970
how we split up the work.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.267
And naturally Giancarlo loves
planning trips and traveling,

00:22:33.267 --> 00:22:34.600
and I don't like to plan things.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.130
I just like to go on trips.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.760
So he did all that,
which was really great.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.340
Just totally naturally
that kind of went to him.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.780
And since I have a
background in journalism,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:49.150
I sort of took over
making the book cohesive.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.219
While we both wrote
pretty much equally--

00:22:52.219 --> 00:22:53.760
it's split up into
different sections

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.720
for each brewery,
brewpub, and bar.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.100
So we wrote about half and
half but I took it upon myself

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.850
to make sure the book
had a cohesive voice.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:09.110
Because it is a guidebook, and
because people could write it

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:13.400
off as, oh, I'll just
find that on the internet,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.780
I really wanted it to
have a personality.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.657
I really wanted people
to feel the enthusiasm

00:23:20.657 --> 00:23:22.990
and the excitement that we
had when we were visiting all

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.320
these places and
to inspire people

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.860
to go visit their tiny little
brewery in the Adirondacks

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.660
or in the Finger Lakes.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.040
And just see it see what
regional beer in New York

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.820
tastes like, because we
do live in New York City

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.580
and it's easy to just feel like
we can get whatever we want.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:49.780
So yeah, that's what I hope to
infuse-- this beautiful feeling

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.140
that we had about New
York beer in this book.

00:23:56.544 --> 00:23:58.710
GIANCARLO ANNESE: We're
originally from Long Island.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.010
We live in New York.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:05.510
So we do feel a
connection to our state.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.000
But heading upstate
and exploring

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.390
all these different
areas, we really

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.130
got to know the
state so much better.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:18.710
And breweries are a great
way to learn a place,

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.140
and know what people
are like, and talk

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.920
to people at the
brewery or the brewers

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.880
and see what it's
like where they live.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.720
SARAH ANNESE: You really get
like a cross section of locals

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.592
sitting at the bar when
you're at a brewery.

00:24:31.592 --> 00:24:33.300
You talk to some of
them, and you kind of

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.900
get a feel of what
this area is like.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.732
Are people really coming to
this one brewery every week,

00:24:38.732 --> 00:24:40.815
or are they going to a lot
of different breweries?

00:24:40.815 --> 00:24:42.800
Or are they going
to a bar instead?

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.780
It's a really interesting way to
learn about a city or a region.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.904
And this kind of
project-- the fact

00:24:51.904 --> 00:24:53.570
that the New York
beer writing community

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:57.330
is so supportive and so
amazing-- we couldn't have

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.370
done it without
our fellow authors.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.010
Particularly John Holl, who
wrote the American Craft Beer

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.230
Cookbook, and Josh
Bernstein, who

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.270
wrote the Complete Beer Course.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.520
This is our first book, so we
were in totally new territory.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.380
And these guys really
took us under their wings

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:18.160
and just were so generous
with advice and information.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.470
Look out for this, or
make sure about this.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.104
So we did have a lot of
help, also from Seamless,

00:25:24.104 --> 00:25:26.520
because we never would have
made it through that last week

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.960
if we didn't have
food delivered.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.170
GIANCARLO ANNESE: We were
pretty much just hunkered down,

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:31.670
writing.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.336
SARAH ANNESE: Holed
up in our apartment.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.530
GIANCARLO ANNESE:
Now that we've gone

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.580
through this whole
experience, and we

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.040
traveled all over the state,
we met all these people,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.940
we drank a lot of beer--
we think New York State has

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:55.330
a really special place in what's
happening in beer right now.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:26:00.160
The country in general
is excited about beer.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.830
There are new breweries
opening almost every day,

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.200
it seems like,
across the country.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.110
But New York in
particular-- I think partly

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:13.100
because of its brewing history
and its agricultural industry

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.620
and where it's headed-- really
has a special place in that.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.380
When we started, there were
130 breweries last year.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.400
Now there's 165.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.060
It's a $2.2 billion
industry in this state

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.770
alone, which Governor
Cuomo is pushing for.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.270
He's realized there's
a lot of money

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.430
here, so he's
really going for it.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.279
And he's changing
some of the laws.

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:42.320
Whatever you think about
other things he's doing,

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.890
he's really helped brewers
out-- with the Farm Brewery

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:51.290
Law and the new Craft Act.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.560
So he has been-- and
the state in general

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.230
has been really
supportive of brewers

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.840
and changing laws and
trying to help them.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:04.021
So especially with something
like the Farm Brewery Law--

00:27:04.021 --> 00:27:05.520
it's one of the
things that we think

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.980
will make New York different
and unique from other states

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:15.200
where beer is an
agricultural product.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.290
When it comes down to it, you've
got grain and hops and yeast.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.920
Water isn't agricultural, but
the grain and the hops are.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.340
By having fresh,
local ingredients

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.270
you can give beer
a different taste

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.980
that you can't get elsewhere.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.620
You won't be able to get New
York hops, really, elsewhere

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.490
when New York brewers
are using those hops.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.850
And we're seeing hop farms
pop up around the state,

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:48.105
kind of reclaiming that history
of being a major producer.

00:27:48.105 --> 00:27:52.090
Cornell Cooperative Extension
is helping them out with that,

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.830
and helping them get
set up, and figure out

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.047
what they need to do.

00:27:56.047 --> 00:27:57.380
So there's a real push for that.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:06.130
And there is a kind of fledgling
but growing grain supply

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.300
in the state.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.830
No maltsters yet, but they're
apparently on the way.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:18.150
I think that will give the state
a different identity than it

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.030
has had and that
other states have.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.000
And on top of that,
there are some breweries

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.940
growing their own ingredients.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.550
Ithaca is working
towards brewing a state

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:32.870
beer with their own barley,
and they've got hops growing.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:36.690
Hopshire Farm Brewery, just
down the road from them,

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.510
is growing their own hops.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.690
Ommegang, pictured
here on the left,

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.500
is also talking
about growing hops.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.020
So there's a lot of
push towards making

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.590
this a local ingredient that
is specific to New York,

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.760
that you can't get elsewhere.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.420
And then on the
other side of things,

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.750
just in terms of the
opening of breweries,

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.270
New York City is finally
having its explosion

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.350
of breweries that I think
everyone has been waiting for.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.160
Until a few years
ago, we had a couple.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.010
Compared to the
number of people here,

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.970
it was kind of staggering
how few breweries we had.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:21.120
And now a little place like
Rockaway Brewing Company--

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.610
which is oddly in Long Island
City, down in the bottom right,

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:29.800
it's tiny-- but they
opened a couple years ago.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.120
Queens has seen the explosion.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.540
The Outer Boroughs
are seeing it.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.540
And we're getting specialized
brewers like Other Half brewing

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.040
west coast IPA's, and
Transmitter Brewing,

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:45.120
in Long Island City,
brewing farmhouse styles.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.130
And there are things
that you can do now

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.740
that you just
couldn't do before.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.430
Recently, there was a day
in Long Island City where

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.780
you could walk one mile
and visit three breweries.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.280
A little over a mile--
visit three breweries.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.740
That's something that just
you couldn't do before.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:05.550
You pretty much had Brooklyn and
Chelsea, which is now closed.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.140
They are a brewpub.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.520
They're still brewing,
but it's really

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.480
changed in terms of
taprooms you can visit.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.970
Local beer is out and around
town at bars and restaurants.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.330
So that has really
changed and is

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.890
pushing things in a different
direction and making New York

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:26.350
a better place to drink beer.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.070
SARAH ANNESE: Exactly.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.120
Until recently, people didn't
really think about New York

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.020
when they thought about
great beer states.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.830
You think about
great beer cities

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.950
even-- Portland and
Asheville-- those are really

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.760
what people think of when
they think beer cities.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.790
And we hope that New York
can finally be on that map.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.840
We think it should be.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.860
We think New York is kind of
an unsung beer destination--

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.360
the whole state.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.820
And we really hope to
inspire more and more people

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.690
to visit New York breweries.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.380
So that about wraps
it up for our talk.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.970
I don't know if you
want do some Q&amp;A. Great.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.200
AUDIENCE: So I'll
start with a question.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.440
Do you see any common
trends in the people

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.910
that are opening up
these new breweries?

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:17.430
SARAH ANNESE: So there's kind
of like a couple different sides

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:18.050
to that.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:23.217
A lot of brewers who are going
professional were home brewers.

00:31:23.217 --> 00:31:25.300
I would say it's about
half and half home brewers,

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.965
and the other half
would be brewers

00:31:26.965 --> 00:31:28.560
who have trained
at other breweries.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.560
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Right.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.230
A lot of the brewers who are
starting these really tiny

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.200
breweries are home brewers who
have just kind of scaled up

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.740
a little bit.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.040
Some of them are brewing
out of their garages.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.150
There's actually a
surprising number that are.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.810
And they're brewing
on a couple barrels.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.510
But then there are
some mid-size brewers

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.900
that are opening
with brewers that

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.700
have been brewing for a long
time-- like Other Half, Sam

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.030
Richardson or
Newburgh's, Chris Basso.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.240
They've been in the
brewing industry

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.840
for I think at least
10 years, each of them.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.920
So that is starting
to happen as well.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.590
You've got small
guys, and you've

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:13.175
got some of the brewers who have
been at places like Brooklyn

00:32:13.175 --> 00:32:17.425
Brewery kind of graduating
out and starting their own.

00:32:17.425 --> 00:32:18.800
SARAH ANNESE:
Barrier was started

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.900
by two guys who
worked at Sixpoint.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.559
It's an interesting
trend, that's

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:24.600
going two different ways.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.315
AUDIENCE: So I wasn't familiar
with that Farm Brewery

00:32:33.315 --> 00:32:36.850
law you mentioned, but I looked
it up while you were talking.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:41.200
So you have to use a certain
amount of New York sourced

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.941
ingredients in your beer,
which starts at like 20%,

00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:45.315
but then in a few
years increases

00:32:45.315 --> 00:32:47.930
to 60%, then eventually 90%.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.344
I'm surprised to see that
even included like hops.

00:32:50.344 --> 00:32:52.760
These are things that I really
associate with like Pacific

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.670
Northwest, for the
great hops or whatever.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.000
Are you seeing also a
corresponding explosion

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.610
in producers of some
of these ingredients?

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.870
And is the quality up to snuff?

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.582
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Yeah,
especially with hops.

00:33:08.582 --> 00:33:10.165
People are getting
excited about hops.

00:33:13.064 --> 00:33:14.950
Some of these farmers
are looking at it

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:20.430
as a good way to-- because
hops are popular and expensive

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.560
you can make a good
profit margin on then

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.100
if you can sell them.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.760
The problem is, there isn't
really the infrastructure here

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.320
that there used to be.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.910
And the climate is actually
a little bit different.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.430
It's not as ideal as
the Pacific Northwest

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.780
for some of the
varieties, but they're

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.160
looking to find which
varieties work best.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.529
And so I think we're in a
little bit of that time frame,

00:33:44.529 --> 00:33:46.070
in terms of hops,
where they're still

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.320
figuring out what works best.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.330
And we'll see.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:53.710
There's going to be more,
especially in the short term.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:57.380
There's going to be things like
wet hop beers more in New York

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.560
than there have been.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.700
Greenport opened
their new brewery.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.990
It's literally down the
road from the hop farm.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.365
And so they can
go get the hops--

00:34:06.365 --> 00:34:07.948
SARAH ANNESE: It's
like a hundred feet

00:34:07.948 --> 00:34:10.139
away from the farm--
you're really close.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:12.340
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Things
like that are showing up,

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.880
but at the same time the
hop production isn't there

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.931
to support the
year-round production.

00:34:19.931 --> 00:34:21.639
SARAH ANNESE: And
especially because hops

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:24.750
are such a small
ingredient by weight.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.840
The 20% is 20% percent
of ingredients by weight,

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.752
aside from water.

00:34:29.752 --> 00:34:31.710
So there needs to be
other things besides hops.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.409
And a lot of the
brewers, I think

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.670
they are a little concerned
as to the percentages,

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.010
because the agricultural
aspect of it

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.679
hasn't met the
brewing aspect of it.

00:34:47.694 --> 00:34:50.110
GIANCARLO ANNESE: There are a
couple maltsters opening up,

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.929
and there's some
grain being grown.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.770
We've heard a good
amount about rye

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.175
being grown in the state--
not really as much barley.

00:34:59.175 --> 00:35:00.550
SARAH ANNESE:
Previously it would

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.595
have to leave the
state to go get malted.

00:35:02.595 --> 00:35:03.810
GIANCARLO ANNESE:
Right, it still does.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:04.643
SARAH ANNESE: Right.

00:35:04.643 --> 00:35:06.550
So until these
maltsters open, it's

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:09.389
kind of defeating the purpose
of getting the New York grain,

00:35:09.389 --> 00:35:11.930
because it has to go get malted
elsewhere and then come back.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.555
GIANCARLO ANNESE: It
supports the farm,

00:35:13.555 --> 00:35:16.245
but it's a little bit weird
that the closest place it can go

00:35:16.245 --> 00:35:18.670
is Massachusetts
to go get malted.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.130
So the other thing
some brewers are

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.530
doing to get in under
the Farm Brewery laws--

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.050
they're using other ingredients.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:29.530
One of the most popular ones
we're seeing is New York honey.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.840
They'll make a beer
that use a lot honey,

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.270
and then they'll make their 20%.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.540
Almost nobody can go out
there and just brew an IPA

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.540
and hit their 20%.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.727
Right now it's not happening,
to be a year round beer

00:35:48.727 --> 00:35:49.310
type of thing.

00:35:52.665 --> 00:35:54.790
AUDIENCE: Have you seen
differences in distribution

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.650
regionally within
New York State?

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.390
I'm asking you this, because
I spent a while on the Finger

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.260
Lakes and literally was
unaware that there were

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.218
any other breweries there,
besides like Ithaca.

00:36:02.218 --> 00:36:04.560
And yet, I come to New York,
and it's really obvious

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.680
that there's all these local
breweries that are distributing

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.770
at least within their
area and possibly farther.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.040
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Right,
so one of the things

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.540
we found in the Finger
Lakes, particularly--

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.840
these winery-breweries--
they're pretty much just serving

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.050
their beer at
their tasting room.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.800
SARAH ANNESE: They're
basically brew pubs.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.940
GIANCARLO ANNESE:
Yeah, in a way.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.470
They're not the traditional
brewpub you might think of,

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.060
but they're pretty much
just serving on premises.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.310
SARAH ANNESE: We operated
on the definition of brewpub

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.710
meaning they didn't distribute.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.704
So a brewery that did
distribute was a brewery,

00:36:38.704 --> 00:36:40.870
but a brewery that didn't
distribute it and had food

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:41.770
was a brewpub.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:42.770
GIANCARLO ANNESE: Right.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:48.810
And so like Ithaca and some
other breweries in the region--

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.942
they're distributing.

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:52.900
There's a tiny one that's
a farm brewery called

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:59.360
Good Nature in Hamilton.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.530
So there are some that are
small and distributing,

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:05.080
but a lot of
breweries-- they're not.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.530
Or they're self-distributing
in a ten mile radius.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.200
SARAH ANNESE: Yeah, just to
like the bars around them.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.000
GIANCARLO ANNESE:
So a lot of them,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.860
you'll never see
unless you go there.

00:37:20.257 --> 00:37:22.840
AUDIENCE: So there are lots of
great new breweries opening up,

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.630
but I understand there are
also some that haven't made it

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.060
and are closing down.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.900
So my question is, what makes
a brewery have the greatest

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.710
chance of success?

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:35.785
What is the sort of secret sauce
that the ones who've grown up

00:37:35.785 --> 00:37:37.410
have really had, from
what you've seen?

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.270
Is it just making great
beer or is it also

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.930
about the distribution and the
ingredients and the equipments

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:42.900
and so on?

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.790
SARAH ANNESE: Well,
I think it definitely

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.210
starts with making
really good beer.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:51.300
But we all know of some
breweries that aren't really

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.440
making great beer but
still kind of hang around.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.320
But I think also, on
top of having good beer,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.284
you really need at
least a local following.

00:38:00.284 --> 00:38:02.450
I mean, people who are going
in to get their growler

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.140
fills every week.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:09.930
And we saw that, mostly,
across the board.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.010
GIANCARLO ANNESE: I think
that a lot of breweries

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:17.550
have-- because it's a
localized kind of movement--

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.960
New York breweries have been
pretty successful at staying

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.250
open, because they don't
over stretch themselves.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.920
And they first make
sure that they've

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.100
got a good imprint
in their local area.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.240
And they try to make
themselves the local beer.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.440
So they've got a
small distribution,

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.010
but they're selling
all their beer.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.970
And their beer is
fresh and tastes good.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.210
And that's something
that we're seeing more.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.760
Brewers are not going
immediately to distributor.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.210
They're self distributing,
while they can.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.950
And then after they've
established a following,

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.580
they go to a distributor
who is obviously

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.150
going to take them
to a larger audience.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:01.920
But it's a difficult
thing to manage--

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.210
giving your beer to
somebody else-- letting

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.350
them kind of decided
where it's going,

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:10.470
and how it's being stored,
and all that stuff.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:13.890
So that's kind of
the progression

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.494
that we see almost
everywhere, now.

00:39:17.494 --> 00:39:19.910
AUDIENCE: What are some of the
smallest breweries that you

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:23.510
guys considered or wrote about?

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.320
SARAH ANNESE: Big Alice brewing
I think was the smallest.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.610
Oh, wait a minute--
Bridge and Tunnel is--

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.320
GIANCARLO ANNESE: No,
Bridge and Tunnel is larger.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.050
Big Alice was
probably the smallest.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.600
They were brewing
10 gallon batches.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.170
Cave Mountain is really tiny.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.840
They're brewing half
a barrel at a time.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.956
Well, we visited them.

00:39:42.956 --> 00:39:44.580
SARAH ANNESE: Oh,
they are in the book.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.371
There's another one
that we didn't--

00:39:46.371 --> 00:39:48.370
GIANCARLO ANNESE: There's
a few really tiny ones

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:52.660
that we visited that were
kind of-- they were OK

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:57.690
but they were finding
their way, still.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.610
And there's some
brewers that will get it

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:00.485
after a little while.

00:40:00.485 --> 00:40:02.068
SARAH ANNESE: But
definitely Big Alice

00:40:02.068 --> 00:40:03.450
was the smallest actual brewer.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:09.460
There were small brewpubs,
but Big Alice is the smallest.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.810
AUDIENCE: Great,
well, I'll say thanks

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.370
very much for coming to visit.

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.640
If anyone bought
the book, these guys

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.394
are going to do signing
here afterwards.

00:40:20.394 --> 00:40:21.810
But yeah, thanks
again for coming.

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.022
This was really fascinating.

00:40:23.022 --> 00:40:24.480
I look forward to
reading the book.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.000
SARAH ANNESE: Yeah,
thanks so much.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:25.870
This was great.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:27.070
Enjoy your book.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.120
