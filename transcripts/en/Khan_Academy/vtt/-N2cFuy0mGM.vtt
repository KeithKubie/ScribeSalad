00:00:00.414 --> 00:00:01.280
- Hello, everyone,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.926
and welcome to Khan
Academy Live SAT Class.

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:07.136
I'm Erik, and I'm an SAT tutor

00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:10.185
and one of the SAT experts
here at Khan Academy.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.112
I'm super excited to join you today

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:15.862
for our third and final
class on SAT Writing.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.157
We had an earlier class on SAT Math

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:20.430
and one on SAT reading,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.492
and if you've missed those
classes, don't worry.

00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:23.879
We have those in our YouTube channel.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:24.870
You can check them out,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.268
but for today, the focus
is all about SAT Writing,

00:00:27.268 --> 00:00:28.156
and there's a lot to cover,

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:30.349
so let's take a look at
the schedule for the day.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.776
So for today, the first 25 minutes,

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:35.774
I'm gonna spend on instruction
and practice problems,

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:38.612
and so I'll give you an
overview of the SAT Writing test

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:39.965
so you know what to expect

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:42.374
and share a few tips about
how you can mark it up,

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:46.984
so when you underlining,
boxing, and so forth.

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.367
Then I'll cover subject-verb agreement,

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.497
and we'll do some practice problems here,

00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:53.892
and then I'll wrap up there

00:00:53.892 --> 00:00:55.373
with some sentence punctuation.

00:00:55.373 --> 00:00:57.116
And so these are two important concepts

00:00:57.116 --> 00:00:59.919
that come up quite commonly on the SAT

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:02.770
writing and language section.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.294
And now after that, I'll spend
10 minutes doing Q and A,

00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:10.180
and so I'll answer your
questions that you have,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.703
and then I'll share the
badge with you as well

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:16.018
that you earned by completing the class.

00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:18.484
Then at that point we have
something a little bit different,

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:21.840
and so you get to pick what
you think will help you most,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.798
and so the first option
you'll have at that point

00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:26.414
to wrap up the class is to
head over to Khan Academy

00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:27.717
to practice what you've learned,

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:29.295
and at the same time you'll have access

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:31.478
to one on one chat
support from our wonderful

00:01:31.478 --> 00:01:33.504
Khan Academy and College Board staff.

00:01:33.504 --> 00:01:36.400
Or the other thing you
can do is stay on YouTube

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.421
and watch me work
through a writing passage

00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:40.463
from start to finish.

00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:42.874
And so again, for the last 25 minutes,

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:44.772
you can practice what you learned yourself

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:46.037
on Khan Academy,

00:01:46.037 --> 00:01:49.198
or watch me work through
a writing passage.

00:01:49.198 --> 00:01:51.319
So that's the schedule for today.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.918
There's a lot to cover, as you can see,

00:01:53.918 --> 00:01:55.703
and I'm excited to get started.

00:01:55.703 --> 00:01:57.120
So let's jump in.

00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:01.483
So what can you expect

00:02:01.483 --> 00:02:03.696
on the writing and language test?

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:07.446
Well, it's a 35 minute
section with four passages

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:08.862
with 11 questions each,

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:12.581
and so you've got 44
questions to deal with,

00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:15.091
and the passages will have a few topics,

00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:17.256
so you can have any of
these topics you see here,

00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:19.097
history, humanities, science,

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.604
or career-focused ones,

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:23.059
and then you have a few
passage types as well.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.771
And so argument questions
will try and, you know,

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.883
argue a point with evidence.

00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:31.361
Narrative passages will tell you a story,

00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:35.101
whereas informative and
explanatory, as it sounds like,

00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:37.197
will just try to educate you about a topic

00:02:37.197 --> 00:02:39.616
that you might not have
known about before.

00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:42.326
Then I wanna finally cover question types,

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:43.321
which are very important,

00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:46.821
and so there are two question
types on SAT Writing,

00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:48.780
and the first is the expression of ideas.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.702
And so these ask you to improve

00:02:50.702 --> 00:02:53.509
the effectiveness of
communication in the passage.

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.871
And so this will ask you to
improve things like the flow,

00:02:56.871 --> 00:02:58.621
the order, the logic,

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.310
the clarity, things like that,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.142
and the second type of question focuses

00:03:06.142 --> 00:03:08.155
on standard English conventions.

00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:11.035
And so they'll ask you to
make sentences in the passage

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:13.411
consistent with grammar
usage, punctuation,

00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:14.909
and other rules.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.113
And so I really wanna,
before I wrap this one up,

00:03:18.113 --> 00:03:20.650
emphasize that the SAT
Writing and Language test

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.817
is not just about grammar.

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:24.862
That is a part of it,

00:03:24.862 --> 00:03:27.515
but expression of ideas,
clarity of communication,

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:30.059
is also really highlighted.

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.142
So let's keep going then,

00:03:33.322 --> 00:03:35.853
and now I'll cover how to mark up the test

00:03:35.853 --> 00:03:37.146
now that you know what to expect

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:40.880
in passages and in the
different question types.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.289
How can you interact with the test?

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.789
Let's take a look.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.575
So how you can mark up the test.

00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:49.376
There are broadly four tips
that I would share with you.

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:53.013
So the first is to annotate
the passage as you go,

00:03:53.013 --> 00:03:56.641
and so this involves
circling, underlining,

00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:59.565
boxing things like transition words

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:01.587
or topic sentences,

00:04:01.587 --> 00:04:05.754
so transitions, or topic
sentences are important as well.

00:04:09.447 --> 00:04:12.005
The second tip I have is
to underline the question

00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:13.567
and the answer choices.

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:16.376
So underlining the question
will help you understand

00:04:16.376 --> 00:04:17.503
obviously the question,

00:04:17.503 --> 00:04:19.848
but then underlining the answer choices

00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:21.288
will also help you break things up,

00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:22.912
and if you can't read this,

00:04:22.912 --> 00:04:24.598
if it's fuzzy on your screen, don't worry.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:28.323
We'll get a chance to
practice this in real life

00:04:28.323 --> 00:04:29.979
in just a bit,

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.546
and then the third tip I have

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:34.453
is to cross out words to
simplify long sentences.

00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:38.620
So often you have things
like prepositional phrases,

00:04:39.576 --> 00:04:41.330
prepositional phrases,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.506
that are part of sentences,

00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:45.914
but they really don't affect the meaning

00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:48.259
or the grammatical correctness,

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.830
and in fact can make it harder
to understand the sentence.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.519
And so we'll walk through an example

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.830
of what it looks like to
spot prepositional phrases

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.687
and cross them out to simplify,

00:04:56.687 --> 00:04:58.080
and then the final tip I would have

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.839
is just to use process of elimination.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:02.688
So the moment you decide that an answer,

00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:04.431
answer choice A is out,

00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:06.264
cross it out, or B, C,

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:10.253
so that really saves
you a lot of brain power

00:05:10.253 --> 00:05:12.454
and processing time so
you're not going back

00:05:12.454 --> 00:05:14.398
and thinking, "Wait, did I already look

00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:15.900
"at this answer choice or not?"

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.297
And so once you've eliminated something,

00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:21.225
go ahead and cross it off the list.

00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:23.117
So those are just a few tips

00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:24.845
for how you can mark up the test,

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:27.801
and we'll get a chance to apply marking up

00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:30.924
and annotating and process
of elimination later today,

00:05:30.924 --> 00:05:33.873
but for now, I wanna walk
through subject-verb agreement,

00:05:33.873 --> 00:05:36.469
which is a very common
concept that's tested.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.762
And I'm sure you've heard a bit about it

00:05:38.762 --> 00:05:39.754
in your reading class,

00:05:39.754 --> 00:05:41.093
but I'll give you a refresher,

00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:44.510
and then we'll do some practice problems.

00:05:45.408 --> 00:05:47.575
So subject-verb agreement,

00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:51.135
so to start as a background,

00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:53.312
you wanna remember that complete sentences

00:05:53.312 --> 00:05:57.097
must have a subject and verb that agree.

00:05:57.097 --> 00:05:58.786
Now before I go any further,

00:05:58.786 --> 00:06:02.275
a quick reminder, a subject
is the person, place, or thing

00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:04.323
that is doing or being something,

00:06:04.323 --> 00:06:07.360
so you know, that is
doing or being the action,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.497
and then the verb is
the part of the sentence

00:06:09.497 --> 00:06:11.777
that expresses the action.

00:06:11.777 --> 00:06:13.675
So those are every complete sentence

00:06:13.675 --> 00:06:15.458
has to have both of those parts.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.391
If it doesn't have one of those parts,

00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:19.265
it is an incomplete sentence.

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:21.205
Now, when I say agreement, what do I mean?

00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:23.104
Well, I mean that singular subjects

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:24.723
have to go with singular verbs

00:06:24.723 --> 00:06:27.361
and plural subjects with plural verbs,

00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:30.778
and we'll get to do some practice on this

00:06:31.672 --> 00:06:32.518
in just minute,

00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:34.022
but for now, there are two quick tips

00:06:34.022 --> 00:06:35.486
I wanna share with you.

00:06:35.486 --> 00:06:39.079
So when I approach subject-verb
agreement questions,

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:41.457
I find it really helpful
to find the subject

00:06:41.457 --> 00:06:42.846
of the sentence first,

00:06:42.846 --> 00:06:44.733
then check for agreement.

00:06:44.733 --> 00:06:48.375
And so this one is very
straightforward, right,

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.563
more straightforward,
what is the subject here?

00:06:50.563 --> 00:06:52.642
We have the dog, right,

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:53.954
so that's the subject,

00:06:53.954 --> 00:06:55.498
and then what is the action?

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.708
Barks, so that is the verb there.

00:06:58.708 --> 00:07:01.476
This is will obviously
get more complicated,

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:02.643
so stay tuned.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.052
The next tip I'd share is to cross out

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:08.285
unnecessary words to simplify sentences.

00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:09.981
So this one's a bit longer,

00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:12.820
but it reads the dog along with the cat

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.856
was convinced that it was nap time.

00:07:14.856 --> 00:07:16.686
So now for those at home,

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.769
what is the subject here?

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:22.061
Is it just the dog?

00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:24.811
Is it the dog along with the cat?

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.154
So answer is that it is just the dog,

00:07:30.077 --> 00:07:34.043
so, along with the cat,
is a prepositional phrase

00:07:34.043 --> 00:07:36.498
that does not create a compound subject.

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:39.080
And so it's just the dog
that's doing the action,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.159
and then the verb is, was,

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.643
so if you cross out the
prepositional phrase,

00:07:43.643 --> 00:07:44.763
the sentence is a bit simpler

00:07:44.763 --> 00:07:46.627
and just reads the dog was convinced

00:07:46.627 --> 00:07:47.677
that it was nap time,

00:07:47.677 --> 00:07:50.643
and then you can tell
that the agreement is fine

00:07:50.643 --> 00:07:54.413
and eliminating the prepositional
phrase really helps.

00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:57.342
So that's a quick overview
of subject-verb agreement.

00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:59.503
Like I said, you probably heard this

00:07:59.503 --> 00:08:02.453
in your reading or
English classes in school,

00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:03.781
but this is a quick refresher,

00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:06.789
and now we're gonna do a
little back and forth quiz

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:08.221
to see what you remember

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.777
and show you some examples.

00:08:10.777 --> 00:08:12.944
So subject-verb agreement,

00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:15.185
the game we're gonna play today is

00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:17.490
is this singular or is this plural?

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.487
And so I'm gonna go
through these one by one

00:08:19.487 --> 00:08:21.001
and give you a chance to reply,

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.551
and then I'll reveal the answer.

00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:24.026
So he or she?

00:08:24.026 --> 00:08:25.755
So that one is singular,

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.307
and that one's more straightforward.

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:29.522
We're just referring to one person there.

00:08:29.522 --> 00:08:32.165
What about anyone or each one?

00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:34.186
So that one is also singular,

00:08:34.186 --> 00:08:36.907
and the way I remember
it is I see this one.

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:38.249
I see the one.

00:08:38.249 --> 00:08:40.064
It makes it a little easier to remember.

00:08:40.064 --> 00:08:42.064
Okay, now what about we?

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:44.682
We is plural,

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.705
so you know, multiple people.

00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:51.538
You've got a few stick
figures here like that.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:56.372
Now what about everyone and everybody?

00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:57.955
Singular or plural?

00:08:59.883 --> 00:09:01.966
So this one is actually singular,

00:09:01.966 --> 00:09:03.878
and I wanted to include this one

00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:06.599
because it can seem like it's plural

00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:08.406
because you're referring to,

00:09:08.406 --> 00:09:10.472
oh, it seems like I've got a lot of people

00:09:10.472 --> 00:09:12.015
in everyone and everybody,

00:09:12.015 --> 00:09:15.662
but this is what's called
an indefinite pronoun.

00:09:15.662 --> 00:09:19.064
And you don't need to
necessarily remember that term,

00:09:19.064 --> 00:09:20.405
but you do need to remember

00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:23.738
that everyone and everybody is singular.

00:09:25.095 --> 00:09:28.012
Now moving on, what about somebody?

00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:31.014
Somebody is again singular,

00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:34.387
and so it's the same situation as above,

00:09:34.387 --> 00:09:37.257
and it's also an indefinite pronoun,

00:09:37.257 --> 00:09:40.886
and so that is, you'll remember that

00:09:40.886 --> 00:09:42.670
when you're on the SAT.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.275
Now what about, the turkey
as well as the chicken?

00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:48.525
Is that singular or plural?

00:09:50.696 --> 00:09:52.974
So this one is also singular.

00:09:52.974 --> 00:09:54.228
Now why is that?

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:56.456
Well, the subject of this phrase

00:09:56.456 --> 00:09:58.064
is actually just turkey,

00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.980
and, as well as the chicken,

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.612
is one of those
prepositional phrases again

00:10:03.612 --> 00:10:07.176
that do not create a compound subject.

00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:09.649
And so if you just have one turkey there,

00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:11.048
the turkey's by himself.

00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:12.895
It's a singular subject.

00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:13.963
Now last example here,

00:10:13.963 --> 00:10:17.130
James and I, is it singular or plural?

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.342
This one is plural.

00:10:21.342 --> 00:10:24.054
So the important word here is, and,

00:10:24.054 --> 00:10:26.221
so, and, is a conjunction,

00:10:27.152 --> 00:10:31.152
and that conjunction
creates a compound subject,

00:10:34.775 --> 00:10:37.025
creates a compound subject.

00:10:38.976 --> 00:10:41.294
Oh, excuse the handwriting.

00:10:41.294 --> 00:10:42.746
Subject and compound subjects

00:10:42.746 --> 00:10:44.829
like he and I, she and I,

00:10:45.734 --> 00:10:48.347
are all plural since you're
referring to multiple people,

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:51.006
but a conjunction is different
from a prepositional phrase.

00:10:51.006 --> 00:10:53.142
And so these are just a few examples

00:10:53.142 --> 00:10:54.981
that you wanna make sure you understand,

00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:58.179
so there are some easier
ones like he or she,

00:10:58.179 --> 00:10:59.910
but you wanna make sure
you understand someone,

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.091
everyone, each one, all
of those different cases,

00:11:04.091 --> 00:11:07.556
and that will make sure you
cover your bases for the SAT.

00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:09.423
So we've done some back and forth now,

00:11:09.423 --> 00:11:12.215
but we haven't yet seen an SAT question.

00:11:12.215 --> 00:11:15.132
So let's do some practice problems.

00:11:17.608 --> 00:11:19.455
So let's take a look at this.

00:11:19.455 --> 00:11:21.434
I'll zoom in a little bit
to make it easier to see,

00:11:21.434 --> 00:11:24.041
and so what I wanna do
here is read the sentence

00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:26.095
and underline it before I go any further.

00:11:26.095 --> 00:11:28.930
So, Billy, although he had a great sense

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.718
of timing for stand up comedy,

00:11:30.718 --> 00:11:33.457
were handicapped by his poor memory.

00:11:33.457 --> 00:11:38.316
So again, what I wanna do
here is find the subject.

00:11:38.316 --> 00:11:41.347
Subject, where is the subject?

00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:45.769
Well, so what or who is doing
the action in this case?

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:47.982
Well, it's gonna be Billy over here,

00:11:47.982 --> 00:11:49.457
so that's the subject,

00:11:49.457 --> 00:11:50.831
and then I wanna look at the verb here,

00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:52.394
so that's, were.

00:11:52.394 --> 00:11:54.954
And so then the other thing I can do here

00:11:54.954 --> 00:11:59.075
to simplify is cross this whole part out,

00:11:59.075 --> 00:12:01.540
and so I know what the subject is.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.411
I know what the verb is,

00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:03.348
and so then I have,

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.651
Billy were handicapped by his poor memory,

00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:08.883
and then that, you can
tell, were, does not agree

00:12:08.883 --> 00:12:10.119
'cause that's plural,

00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:11.976
and you want it to be singular,

00:12:11.976 --> 00:12:14.223
and so this should be, was.

00:12:14.223 --> 00:12:16.255
Billy was handicapped,

00:12:16.255 --> 00:12:18.135
and so then you can do that,

00:12:18.135 --> 00:12:20.359
and what you saw me do there

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:23.352
was figure out what the sentence meant,

00:12:23.352 --> 00:12:24.997
what the different parts are.

00:12:24.997 --> 00:12:29.020
And then by honing in on
the error and fixing it,

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.888
it allowed me to go straight
to the answer choice

00:12:31.888 --> 00:12:34.274
and pinpoint the right one here

00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:36.520
rather than going through each one,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.217
and so that's one way you can save time,

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:42.923
and it's one way you can speed things up

00:12:42.923 --> 00:12:45.243
as you're on the SAT Writing test.

00:12:45.243 --> 00:12:47.027
Now that was a good warmup question.

00:12:47.027 --> 00:12:49.371
Let's try one a little
bit more challenging

00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:51.454
and see what that's like.

00:12:53.387 --> 00:12:54.963
So let's take a look at this.

00:12:54.963 --> 00:12:57.956
With the help of the Mat
Su Regional Medical Center,

00:12:57.956 --> 00:13:00.466
middle school students in Gateway, Alaska

00:13:00.466 --> 00:13:03.246
observe intubation and sets bones.

00:13:03.246 --> 00:13:06.467
So again, what is my subject?

00:13:06.467 --> 00:13:10.483
So who or what or what
thing is doing the action?

00:13:10.483 --> 00:13:12.747
So with the help of
Mat Su Regional Center,

00:13:12.747 --> 00:13:14.315
middle school students, okay,

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:18.031
so middle school students
here is my subject.

00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:19.390
And what are they doing?

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.911
They are observing
intubation and setting bones.

00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:25.805
So those are my verbs,

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.575
and this is the one that's underlined

00:13:27.575 --> 00:13:29.593
so I wanna pay extra attention here.

00:13:29.593 --> 00:13:31.021
And just to simplify,

00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:33.077
I've got another one of those
prepositional phrases here.

00:13:33.077 --> 00:13:34.481
So in Gateway, Alaska,

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.822
I don't need to worry about that

00:13:36.822 --> 00:13:39.133
since it doesn't change
the grammatical structure

00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:40.297
of the sentence,

00:13:40.297 --> 00:13:42.661
and then even if I take
this a step further.

00:13:42.661 --> 00:13:45.819
With the help, all of that is
another prepositional phrase.

00:13:45.819 --> 00:13:48.442
So prepositional phrase,
prepositional phrase,

00:13:48.442 --> 00:13:49.923
and the way I know it's
a prepositional phrase,

00:13:49.923 --> 00:13:51.827
by the way, is that
I've got this, in, here,

00:13:51.827 --> 00:13:52.875
I've got, with,

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:55.019
and so these phrases that
start with prepositions

00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:57.757
are prepositional phrases.

00:13:57.757 --> 00:14:00.714
So now, I'm left with,
middle school students

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:03.179
observe intubation and sets bones,

00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:05.074
and since observed isn't underlined,

00:14:05.074 --> 00:14:07.129
I can even, you know,
stop worrying about that

00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:10.902
and just say, middle
school students sets bones.

00:14:10.902 --> 00:14:13.471
So that looks like there's an error there

00:14:13.471 --> 00:14:16.888
because sets does not agree, is singular,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.605
but I want it to be plural,

00:14:20.605 --> 00:14:23.188
and so this should be set here.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.883
And so I'm left with,

00:14:24.883 --> 00:14:28.867
middle school students observe
intubation and set bones.

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:32.131
And so that was a little
bit of a longer sentence,

00:14:32.131 --> 00:14:36.405
but if you're organized
and go through the sentence

00:14:36.405 --> 00:14:39.743
and cross out prepositional
phrases that you don't need,

00:14:39.743 --> 00:14:41.798
it can help you identify
where the subject is,

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:42.936
what the verb is,

00:14:42.936 --> 00:14:44.782
and once you're left with
just the subject and the verb,

00:14:44.782 --> 00:14:46.911
it becomes easier to read the sentence

00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:51.531
and determine if the subject
and verb agree or not.

00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:52.415
We'll do one more example,

00:14:52.415 --> 00:14:54.415
and then we'll move on.

00:14:56.351 --> 00:14:58.029
Let's take a look.

00:14:58.029 --> 00:15:01.145
Adventure climbers like
Alex Honnold specializes

00:15:01.145 --> 00:15:03.207
in free solo ascents without ropes

00:15:03.207 --> 00:15:04.546
up sheer cliff faces,

00:15:04.546 --> 00:15:07.495
such as El Capitan in
Yosemite National Park.

00:15:07.495 --> 00:15:09.586
So we've got, adventure climbers,

00:15:09.586 --> 00:15:12.791
so again, I wanna learn
about the subject here,

00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:16.139
and we've got what is the subject?

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:17.765
Is it climbers?

00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:19.348
Is it Alex Honnold?

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.571
The subject is, climbers,

00:15:22.571 --> 00:15:24.080
so that's the subject.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.484
Now, like Alex Honnold,

00:15:25.484 --> 00:15:27.535
like, is another one
of those prepositions,

00:15:27.535 --> 00:15:28.944
so that's a prepositional phrase,

00:15:28.944 --> 00:15:31.735
so, like Alex Honnold, is not the subject,

00:15:31.735 --> 00:15:34.104
and then we have this
verb here of specializes.

00:15:34.104 --> 00:15:37.764
So adventure climbers
specializes in free solo ascents

00:15:37.764 --> 00:15:38.890
without ropes.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.390
Well, specializes is singular,

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.559
but I want it to be plural,

00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:47.892
should be plural, be plural,

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:54.304
and the plural verb for
specializes is specialize,

00:15:54.304 --> 00:15:55.408
and so here we are.

00:15:55.408 --> 00:15:58.186
Is specializing, is out
and, has specialized,

00:15:58.186 --> 00:15:59.186
is also out,

00:16:00.264 --> 00:16:03.262
and so again, this is another example

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:06.845
where dissecting the
sentence that you have

00:16:08.144 --> 00:16:11.811
will really help you
simplify and go through

00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:14.152
and find the right answer.

00:16:14.152 --> 00:16:16.596
Now one thing I forgot to mention earlier

00:16:16.596 --> 00:16:17.830
before these practice problems

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.909
is that on the real SAT
Writing and Language test,

00:16:20.909 --> 00:16:23.318
the context that you see in the passage

00:16:23.318 --> 00:16:24.653
is very, very important,

00:16:24.653 --> 00:16:26.822
and so with these practice questions,

00:16:26.822 --> 00:16:30.072
they just focus on the grammar concept,

00:16:31.288 --> 00:16:32.262
and there's no passage.

00:16:32.262 --> 00:16:33.535
But on the real thing,

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:34.957
the context is very important,

00:16:34.957 --> 00:16:37.016
and so we'll get a
chance to do that later,

00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:39.717
but just wanna emphasize
that in the real thing,

00:16:39.717 --> 00:16:41.621
make sure you look at
what the passage says

00:16:41.621 --> 00:16:43.158
since that's really
important for helping you

00:16:43.158 --> 00:16:45.151
figure out what the right answer is.

00:16:45.151 --> 00:16:46.526
So for now, we're gonna move on

00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:48.477
to sentence punctuation

00:16:48.477 --> 00:16:50.894
and shift gears a little bit.

00:16:52.604 --> 00:16:53.998
So sentence punctuation,

00:16:53.998 --> 00:16:55.086
this is another one of those things

00:16:55.086 --> 00:16:57.537
that you've probably heard
about in English class,

00:16:57.537 --> 00:17:00.569
but maybe you forgot a few parts of it,

00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:02.238
and so I'm gonna give you a quick overview

00:17:02.238 --> 00:17:03.910
before we do some practice problems.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.560
So to start, we're gonna start

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.591
with a semicolon and the period.

00:17:08.591 --> 00:17:10.141
Now these two are used to separate

00:17:10.141 --> 00:17:11.736
two independent clauses,

00:17:11.736 --> 00:17:13.375
and what are independent clauses?

00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:16.016
Well, they need to have
a subject and a verb.

00:17:16.016 --> 00:17:17.490
If they don't have a subject and a verb,

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.534
they are not an independent clause.

00:17:19.534 --> 00:17:21.246
So an example of this is

00:17:21.246 --> 00:17:24.456
if you just ignore the
second part of the sentence,

00:17:24.456 --> 00:17:26.470
Yoda can read minds, semicolon,

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.513
I hate playing card games against him.

00:17:28.513 --> 00:17:31.521
So Yoda can read minds,
is an independent clause.

00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:33.104
We've got, Yoda can

00:17:36.939 --> 00:17:38.431
read minds.

00:17:38.431 --> 00:17:40.905
Oh, what happened there?

00:17:40.905 --> 00:17:42.698
I lost my ability to write.

00:17:42.698 --> 00:17:44.281
Oh, I'm back, okay,

00:17:45.126 --> 00:17:47.136
and then the second part of the sentence

00:17:47.136 --> 00:17:49.117
is also an independent clause.

00:17:49.117 --> 00:17:50.005
So that's how you know

00:17:50.005 --> 00:17:53.281
that the semicolon has
been used correctly.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.776
Now a comma and a conjunction
is the next thing,

00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:57.781
so these are used to join clauses

00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:01.565
by converting one clause
into a dependent clause,

00:18:01.565 --> 00:18:02.965
and so an example sentence would be,

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:04.927
George Lucas is a creative genius,

00:18:04.927 --> 00:18:08.008
but, comma, but Episode
Three was not his best work.

00:18:08.008 --> 00:18:12.148
And so this then is
now a dependent clause,

00:18:12.148 --> 00:18:14.557
whereas, George Lucas
is a creative genius,

00:18:14.557 --> 00:18:16.640
is an independent clause.

00:18:17.982 --> 00:18:20.007
Okay, and the last thing I'll cover

00:18:20.007 --> 00:18:22.257
are the dash and the colon.

00:18:23.891 --> 00:18:26.521
Now these two are used
to introduce a list,

00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:28.511
a quote, or an explanation,

00:18:28.511 --> 00:18:29.702
and the part of the sentence

00:18:29.702 --> 00:18:31.797
that you wanna remember is that

00:18:31.797 --> 00:18:34.968
the part of the sentence
before the dash or the colon

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:37.296
must be an independent clause,

00:18:37.296 --> 00:18:39.988
and so that's the part that a
lot of students will forget.

00:18:39.988 --> 00:18:41.080
But an example would be,

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.454
Star Wars movies always
start with the same phrase,

00:18:43.454 --> 00:18:46.042
and so that's an independent clause.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.446
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,

00:18:48.446 --> 00:18:52.487
dot, dot, dot, and so this
was a quote example obviously,

00:18:52.487 --> 00:18:53.792
and as you can tell,

00:18:53.792 --> 00:18:54.634
I'm a Star Wars fan,

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.470
and so figured I'd write

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.502
whatever sentences made sense to me.

00:18:58.502 --> 00:19:02.128
And so this is one thing you can also do,

00:19:02.128 --> 00:19:03.994
whatever sentences you wanna make up

00:19:03.994 --> 00:19:06.247
to reinforce grammatical concepts.

00:19:06.247 --> 00:19:07.321
Make it easier on yourself.

00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:09.473
Make it interesting for yourself, right?

00:19:09.473 --> 00:19:11.669
So now let's look at
some practice problems

00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:15.086
that will allow you to test this concept.

00:19:18.083 --> 00:19:20.121
So President Thomas Jefferson

00:19:20.121 --> 00:19:22.402
had one slightly unusual dream,

00:19:22.402 --> 00:19:24.739
comma, and just to make this clear,

00:19:24.739 --> 00:19:27.642
I'll just emphasize the punctuation.

00:19:27.642 --> 00:19:31.069
Comma, he hoped to find
a living woolly mammoth

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:33.592
in the western United States.

00:19:33.592 --> 00:19:34.639
Think they were all gone by then,

00:19:34.639 --> 00:19:35.632
so he was out of luck.

00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:37.826
But President Thomas Jefferson

00:19:37.826 --> 00:19:40.577
had one slightly unusual dream, comma,

00:19:40.577 --> 00:19:41.981
he hoped to find a living woolly mammoth.

00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:43.792
And so I wanna look at this comma

00:19:43.792 --> 00:19:46.666
and see if there is something to fix,

00:19:46.666 --> 00:19:49.166
and if so, how would I fix it?

00:19:50.138 --> 00:19:52.221
Well, a comma, let's see.

00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:57.760
Well, let's take a look at the first part

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.886
of this sentence first.

00:19:58.886 --> 00:20:00.040
So President Thomas Jefferson

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.985
had one slightly unusual dream,

00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:04.482
so that one's an independent clause.

00:20:04.482 --> 00:20:05.469
That seems right.

00:20:05.469 --> 00:20:07.366
Comma, he hoped to find
a living woolly mammoth

00:20:07.366 --> 00:20:09.247
in the western United States,

00:20:09.247 --> 00:20:10.978
so that one's another independent clause,

00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:13.643
but I've only got a comma
here to separate it,

00:20:13.643 --> 00:20:15.512
and so there is an error,

00:20:15.512 --> 00:20:18.988
and it's called the comma splice error.

00:20:18.988 --> 00:20:21.037
And so you're using a comma

00:20:21.037 --> 00:20:22.948
to separate two independent clauses,

00:20:22.948 --> 00:20:24.330
and that is not okay.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.598
So to join two independent
clauses like we said,

00:20:27.598 --> 00:20:30.698
we need to use this, a
semicolon, or a period,

00:20:30.698 --> 00:20:32.677
and so let's take a look
at the answer choices.

00:20:32.677 --> 00:20:33.548
We know there's an error,

00:20:33.548 --> 00:20:35.689
so colon, no, that does not separate

00:20:35.689 --> 00:20:37.689
two independent clauses.

00:20:40.118 --> 00:20:42.451
Dream, hoping to find, nope.

00:20:44.635 --> 00:20:46.229
(murmuring)

00:20:46.229 --> 00:20:48.133
Nope, hoping to find,

00:20:48.133 --> 00:20:49.476
had one slightly unusual dream.

00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:50.893
He hoped to find,

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.890
so then that one is out,

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.819
and let me see here.

00:20:56.819 --> 00:20:58.710
Had one slightly unusual dream,

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.347
this should be a semicolon.

00:21:01.347 --> 00:21:04.001
(murmuring)

00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:08.882
Actually, this one looks
like it is our winner here.

00:21:08.882 --> 00:21:11.115
Oh, I've lost the pen again,

00:21:11.115 --> 00:21:13.282
so let me go through that.

00:21:14.572 --> 00:21:16.557
And so what was his dream?

00:21:16.557 --> 00:21:19.111
Well, he hoped to find
a living woolly mammoth,

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.381
and so this is the explanation

00:21:21.381 --> 00:21:23.481
for the first part of the sentence there.

00:21:23.481 --> 00:21:25.398
And so my mistake here,

00:21:26.931 --> 00:21:30.118
and so as you can see,
anyone can make a mistake,

00:21:30.118 --> 00:21:31.279
and that's okay,

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:34.418
but in this sentence, we
have an independent clause,

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:36.257
and then instead of this comma,

00:21:36.257 --> 00:21:38.633
we can use this colon

00:21:38.633 --> 00:21:40.729
to separate this next clause,

00:21:40.729 --> 00:21:42.732
which is an explanation for the first one.

00:21:42.732 --> 00:21:44.560
And so in that case,

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.893
the answer is B.

00:21:47.387 --> 00:21:49.193
So we had that one example.

00:21:49.193 --> 00:21:51.276
Now let's take the look at another one

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:53.526
and get some more practice.

00:21:56.163 --> 00:21:59.755
So, this year's Shark
Week on Discovery Channel

00:21:59.755 --> 00:22:01.656
features the rarely seen sharks

00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:02.943
of the Cuban coral reefs,

00:22:02.943 --> 00:22:05.818
and this is a semicolon
for those who can't see it.

00:22:05.818 --> 00:22:07.397
Footage includes in water

00:22:07.397 --> 00:22:09.764
and on water activities with sharks.

00:22:09.764 --> 00:22:12.952
So again, here I wanna
understand, is there an error?

00:22:12.952 --> 00:22:14.967
So is there something to fix?

00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:17.869
And if so, how would I do it?

00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:19.977
So we have, this year's Shark Week,

00:22:19.977 --> 00:22:23.698
and this first clause is
an independent clause,

00:22:23.698 --> 00:22:25.404
and then footage includes in water

00:22:25.404 --> 00:22:28.333
and on water activities with sharks.

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:30.465
And so that one is another
independent clause,

00:22:30.465 --> 00:22:32.624
and we have this semicolon there,

00:22:32.624 --> 00:22:35.695
and so I think that
actually works quite well.

00:22:35.695 --> 00:22:38.476
And so I have a semicolon to separate

00:22:38.476 --> 00:22:40.476
two independent clauses,

00:22:41.563 --> 00:22:43.939
independent clause and independent clause,

00:22:43.939 --> 00:22:45.820
and so then I think this case,

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.147
the answer is gonna be A.

00:22:48.147 --> 00:22:49.483
Now just to go through this,

00:22:49.483 --> 00:22:51.066
reefs, a semicolon,

00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:56.280
or reefs, colon, for in answer choice B,

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.759
is not correct,

00:22:57.759 --> 00:22:59.512
and it is tempting though

00:22:59.512 --> 00:23:03.582
because it looks like the second part here

00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:06.115
is related to the first clause.

00:23:06.115 --> 00:23:09.115
But reefs, colon, would
be more appropriate

00:23:09.115 --> 00:23:11.449
if the second clause were an example

00:23:11.449 --> 00:23:13.554
of some of these rarely seen sharks.

00:23:13.554 --> 00:23:15.310
So because the first clause talks

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.387
about releasing sharks,

00:23:16.387 --> 00:23:18.648
and then the second
clause talks about footage

00:23:18.648 --> 00:23:20.423
of the water activities,

00:23:20.423 --> 00:23:22.756
they're not tied as closely.

00:23:24.261 --> 00:23:25.902
And so that one, while tempting,

00:23:25.902 --> 00:23:27.485
is not quite there,

00:23:28.597 --> 00:23:30.989
and then this is a semicolon and, and,

00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:32.334
and so you don't need that

00:23:32.334 --> 00:23:33.996
'cause a semicolon is enough by itself.

00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:35.865
And then reefs with a comma,

00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:39.032
this is that comma splice error again.

00:23:40.509 --> 00:23:43.842
Okay, so we've got one final example now

00:23:45.055 --> 00:23:47.342
before we wrap up sentence punctuation,

00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:48.752
and then we'll do some questions,

00:23:48.752 --> 00:23:51.503
but let's take a look
at one more sentence.

00:23:51.503 --> 00:23:52.560
It's a little bit longer,

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.906
but I think you're up for it.

00:23:54.906 --> 00:23:58.232
So contrary to the popular perception

00:23:58.232 --> 00:24:01.071
that DNA was Watson and Crick's discovery,

00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:03.908
so this is, just to emphasize, is a colon.

00:24:03.908 --> 00:24:06.770
Its helical structure
and phosphate backbone

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.183
were first recognized by a woman,

00:24:09.183 --> 00:24:11.738
and that one is a semicolon,

00:24:11.738 --> 00:24:15.157
the English chemist Rosalind Franklin.

00:24:15.157 --> 00:24:16.716
Okay, so this is a longer sentence,

00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:17.988
and so I wanna break this down

00:24:17.988 --> 00:24:22.628
and really focus in on these
two parts of the question.

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:25.890
So let's take a look
just at the colon first,

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.468
so contrary to the popular perception

00:24:27.468 --> 00:24:29.780
that DNA was Watson and Crick's discovery,

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.064
colon, its helical structure
and phosphate backbone

00:24:33.064 --> 00:24:35.393
were first recognized by a woman.

00:24:35.393 --> 00:24:38.393
So is that a correct use of a colon?

00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:40.414
Is that right or wrong?

00:24:40.414 --> 00:24:41.331
Check or X?

00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:45.266
Well, so if you recall,

00:24:45.266 --> 00:24:48.094
the part that precedes a colon

00:24:48.094 --> 00:24:49.824
must be an independent clause,

00:24:49.824 --> 00:24:52.425
and so let's test that,
independent clause.

00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:53.742
Contrary to the popular perception

00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:57.121
that DNA was Watson and Crick's discovery,

00:24:57.121 --> 00:24:59.778
that is not an independent clause,

00:24:59.778 --> 00:25:02.746
and it's namely because of this, contrary,

00:25:02.746 --> 00:25:03.634
that we have here.

00:25:03.634 --> 00:25:06.792
And so this is a dependent clause,

00:25:06.792 --> 00:25:08.209
dependent clause,

00:25:09.426 --> 00:25:12.179
so this one I could actually
fix with just a comma,

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:14.513
and so I could do that.

00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.680
So the colon is not right,

00:25:18.401 --> 00:25:20.573
and then let's move on to the next part.

00:25:20.573 --> 00:25:23.203
So its helical structure
and phosphate backbone

00:25:23.203 --> 00:25:26.482
were first recognized by a woman.

00:25:26.482 --> 00:25:28.312
And then we've got the semicolon,

00:25:28.312 --> 00:25:31.417
the English chemist Rosalind Franklin.

00:25:31.417 --> 00:25:34.500
So a semicolon should separate
two independent clauses,

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.497
and so while this whole thing

00:25:36.497 --> 00:25:38.724
is an independent clause,

00:25:38.724 --> 00:25:40.616
the English chemist Rosalind Franklin

00:25:40.616 --> 00:25:42.240
only has a subject.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.065
So no verb, so that means
that's a dependent clause,

00:25:46.065 --> 00:25:49.467
and so this semicolon is incorrect,

00:25:49.467 --> 00:25:50.974
and so but in this case,

00:25:50.974 --> 00:25:53.483
we could use a colon.

00:25:53.483 --> 00:25:54.494
And so let's take a look.

00:25:54.494 --> 00:25:56.746
We want a comma and a colon instead,

00:25:56.746 --> 00:25:58.496
so comma and a colon,

00:25:59.387 --> 00:26:00.459
and there we go.

00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:01.354
We have that here.

00:26:01.354 --> 00:26:02.770
We have this discovery.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.507
Its helical structure
and phosphate backbone

00:26:04.507 --> 00:26:06.586
were first recognized by a woman,

00:26:06.586 --> 00:26:09.604
colon, the English
chemist Rosalind Franklin.

00:26:09.604 --> 00:26:13.271
And so this takes a
little bit of a process,

00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:18.549
but if you break down
some of the punctuation

00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:21.069
that separates each of the clauses,

00:26:21.069 --> 00:26:23.676
it can really help simplify

00:26:23.676 --> 00:26:26.358
and help you make sense of the question

00:26:26.358 --> 00:26:27.710
that you're being asked.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.879
So we've done some practice questions now.

00:26:31.879 --> 00:26:34.778
We started with some that
were a little simpler,

00:26:34.778 --> 00:26:37.616
but then started to get
more complex as you go,

00:26:37.616 --> 00:26:41.535
and as you saw, I got
sidetracked a little bit there

00:26:41.535 --> 00:26:43.027
before coming back on track.

00:26:43.027 --> 00:26:46.346
And so this is a topic
where the more you practice,

00:26:46.346 --> 00:26:47.333
the better you'll get,

00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:49.064
and so don't be afraid to make mistakes

00:26:49.064 --> 00:26:53.412
or miss a question here or
there as you're practicing.

00:26:53.412 --> 00:26:56.917
So now, I'm gonna pause and take a minute

00:26:56.917 --> 00:26:58.193
to answer questions.

00:26:58.193 --> 00:27:00.834
So if you have a question about
anything I've talked about,

00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:02.729
go ahead and add it in the
YouTube comments there,

00:27:02.729 --> 00:27:03.818
and in the meantime,

00:27:03.818 --> 00:27:05.096
I'll start answering the questions

00:27:05.096 --> 00:27:06.536
that have already come in, okay?

00:27:06.536 --> 00:27:07.619
So let's see.

00:27:10.151 --> 00:27:11.297
We have a question.

00:27:11.297 --> 00:27:13.538
Is the SAT Writing mandatory?

00:27:13.538 --> 00:27:15.325
So yes, it is,

00:27:15.325 --> 00:27:18.678
so it's one of the three main sections

00:27:18.678 --> 00:27:21.258
on the test that you'll have to take,

00:27:21.258 --> 00:27:24.254
and it is that, you
know, 35 minute section.

00:27:24.254 --> 00:27:27.615
The only part that you might
be getting confused about

00:27:27.615 --> 00:27:28.448
is the essay.

00:27:28.448 --> 00:27:29.769
So the essay is optional,

00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:32.143
but the SAT Writing questions and section

00:27:32.143 --> 00:27:34.976
are required for everyone to take.

00:27:36.745 --> 00:27:37.988
Let's see, what is a good way

00:27:37.988 --> 00:27:39.845
to complete the test on time

00:27:39.845 --> 00:27:42.148
while still answering correctly?

00:27:42.148 --> 00:27:45.982
So this one, I wish there were
a silver bullet answer here,

00:27:45.982 --> 00:27:48.925
but it really just comes down to practice,

00:27:48.925 --> 00:27:51.159
and so the more you practice,

00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:52.606
the more familiar you'll get

00:27:52.606 --> 00:27:55.125
with the format and structure of the test,

00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:58.305
the quicker you'll get at recognizing,

00:27:58.305 --> 00:27:59.629
oh, this is the error here,

00:27:59.629 --> 00:28:02.375
or this is how I can improve this passage.

00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:05.039
And if while you practice,

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:06.681
if you time yourself,

00:28:06.681 --> 00:28:09.015
that will really help reinforce

00:28:09.015 --> 00:28:10.990
your internal clock of, okay,

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.207
I've got 35 minutes total.

00:28:13.207 --> 00:28:15.662
I need to go at about this pace,

00:28:15.662 --> 00:28:18.664
and so once you internalize
and practice more and more,

00:28:18.664 --> 00:28:20.127
it'll really help with that.

00:28:20.127 --> 00:28:22.873
We also have a number of articles

00:28:22.873 --> 00:28:24.510
in our tips and strategies section

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.174
on Khan Academy where we go through

00:28:27.174 --> 00:28:29.520
time management tips for
math, reading, and writing.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.831
And so take a look there,

00:28:30.831 --> 00:28:35.522
and we'll also try and
share those out as well.

00:28:35.522 --> 00:28:37.064
Let's see, so many grammar questions

00:28:37.064 --> 00:28:38.626
include logic questions

00:28:38.626 --> 00:28:41.855
such as whether one should
insert a sentence or not.

00:28:41.855 --> 00:28:45.611
Can you go over how to
reason those questions over?

00:28:45.611 --> 00:28:46.981
So yeah, great question,

00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:49.802
so you're talking about writing questions

00:28:49.802 --> 00:28:52.530
that ask you should the
author insert this sentence

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.419
into the passage,

00:28:53.419 --> 00:28:56.251
or should the author delete this,

00:28:56.251 --> 00:29:00.418
or what is an example that will
bolster the author's point?

00:29:02.008 --> 00:29:03.900
And there in those questions,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.534
the context of the passage matters,

00:29:05.534 --> 00:29:06.704
and so what I like to do

00:29:06.704 --> 00:29:09.648
is read around that part of the passage

00:29:09.648 --> 00:29:10.481
that is relevant.

00:29:10.481 --> 00:29:12.511
So say it's sentence number seven.

00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:14.257
Then I'll go back to the passage,

00:29:14.257 --> 00:29:16.904
look through and read
a little bit around it,

00:29:16.904 --> 00:29:20.283
and try to understand
what is the author's goal

00:29:20.283 --> 00:29:23.024
in that paragraph or in those paragraphs,

00:29:23.024 --> 00:29:24.776
and one way you can do that

00:29:24.776 --> 00:29:26.902
to find that out is to
read the topic sentence,

00:29:26.902 --> 00:29:29.053
which is the first
sentence in the paragraph.

00:29:29.053 --> 00:29:30.523
Once you read the topic sentence,

00:29:30.523 --> 00:29:32.283
you can get an understanding of, okay,

00:29:32.283 --> 00:29:35.467
the author wants to talk about amphibians

00:29:35.467 --> 00:29:38.146
and how they've spread
across North America.

00:29:38.146 --> 00:29:39.946
Then that gives you the background

00:29:39.946 --> 00:29:43.149
and context you need to
evaluate the answer choices

00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:44.938
or the question of should you add it,

00:29:44.938 --> 00:29:47.498
should you add a sentence,
delete it, so forth.

00:29:47.498 --> 00:29:51.271
And you almost wanna put
yourself in the writer's shoes

00:29:51.271 --> 00:29:53.306
to say, "If I were making this argument

00:29:53.306 --> 00:29:56.139
"or informing my peers about frogs

00:29:56.989 --> 00:29:59.868
"and their spread through North America,

00:29:59.868 --> 00:30:02.974
"would I want to have
this sentence where it is?

00:30:02.974 --> 00:30:03.807
"Would I delete it?

00:30:03.807 --> 00:30:06.741
"Does it help the case that
I'm trying to make or not?"

00:30:06.741 --> 00:30:09.087
And so to boil that down,

00:30:09.087 --> 00:30:11.105
it's reread the parts of the passage

00:30:11.105 --> 00:30:13.864
to understand the author's
point and the context,

00:30:13.864 --> 00:30:16.328
and then put yourself
in the author's shoes

00:30:16.328 --> 00:30:19.178
and consider does keeping or adding

00:30:19.178 --> 00:30:22.325
or deleting the sentence
most bolster your point?

00:30:22.325 --> 00:30:24.412
So that's how I'd approach that.

00:30:24.412 --> 00:30:26.307
We also have an article
in tips and strategies

00:30:26.307 --> 00:30:27.468
that you can check out

00:30:27.468 --> 00:30:29.052
specifically about how to approach

00:30:29.052 --> 00:30:33.219
inserting sentences, deleting
sentences, and so forth.

00:30:35.276 --> 00:30:36.349
Please explain the difference

00:30:36.349 --> 00:30:38.579
between a colon and a semicolon.

00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:41.746
So the colon is a type of punctuation,

00:30:44.138 --> 00:30:48.138
and I'll go back to the
desktop here to explain.

00:30:50.438 --> 00:30:52.021
So a colon leads to

00:30:59.555 --> 00:31:02.055
a list, quote, or explanation,

00:31:06.303 --> 00:31:10.053
whereas a semicolon is used to separate

00:31:10.053 --> 00:31:12.053
two independent clauses,

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.600
two independent clauses,

00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:20.206
and the other thing is, for a colon,

00:31:20.206 --> 00:31:21.977
the first part before the colon

00:31:21.977 --> 00:31:24.560
also has to be an independent clause.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.840
So we have an article on
tips and strategies again

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.622
about punctuation,

00:31:29.622 --> 00:31:32.519
and that you can cover and review there.

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:35.758
How long, or word count,
should your written portion be?

00:31:35.758 --> 00:31:38.213
And so this sounds like
it's an essay question,

00:31:38.213 --> 00:31:40.380
so for the essay question,

00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:43.944
I wouldn't focus on quantity.

00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:47.014
Instead I would focus
on following the prompt,

00:31:47.014 --> 00:31:48.652
and so the prompt will ask you

00:31:48.652 --> 00:31:51.965
to analyze how the author uses evidence,

00:31:51.965 --> 00:31:56.280
quotations, and different
rhetorical devices

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.503
to build up their argument,

00:31:58.503 --> 00:32:01.887
and so you wanna make
sure you focus on the how,

00:32:01.887 --> 00:32:03.919
and you are able to analyze

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:06.293
how the author pieces
their argument together.

00:32:06.293 --> 00:32:08.424
A common thing that many students will do

00:32:08.424 --> 00:32:11.001
is just restate or summarize the passage

00:32:11.001 --> 00:32:13.120
and say, "The author says this,

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.257
"and then he says that."

00:32:14.257 --> 00:32:16.139
What you wanna do instead is say,

00:32:16.139 --> 00:32:19.847
"The author's use of research evidence

00:32:19.847 --> 00:32:23.097
"and metaphors strengthens his argument

00:32:23.946 --> 00:32:26.489
"or claim that blah, blah, blah."

00:32:26.489 --> 00:32:29.396
And so I wouldn't focus
so much on the length,

00:32:29.396 --> 00:32:32.305
but I would focus on
honing in on that prompt

00:32:32.305 --> 00:32:33.658
and making sure you answer that

00:32:33.658 --> 00:32:35.835
rather than just summarizing

00:32:35.835 --> 00:32:39.502
and restating what the
author's passage was.

00:32:40.553 --> 00:32:41.861
How can you stop yourself

00:32:41.861 --> 00:32:45.862
from feeling too anxious
before and during the SAT test.

00:32:45.862 --> 00:32:47.754
So that's a great question,

00:32:47.754 --> 00:32:50.895
and I think there are a
few ways you can do that.

00:32:50.895 --> 00:32:52.155
So before the test,

00:32:52.155 --> 00:32:55.614
I would encourage you
to make sure you relax,

00:32:55.614 --> 00:32:58.157
and so do something that you enjoy,

00:32:58.157 --> 00:33:00.293
whether that's sports, or reading,

00:33:00.293 --> 00:33:01.935
or hanging out with friends,

00:33:01.935 --> 00:33:03.704
whatever you wanna do to relax.

00:33:03.704 --> 00:33:05.117
When you're this close to the test,

00:33:05.117 --> 00:33:08.110
and if you're taking the test on Saturday,

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.499
the most important thing to do

00:33:09.499 --> 00:33:11.711
is to relax and not stress yourself out,

00:33:11.711 --> 00:33:14.719
so do something that will
get your mind off the test,

00:33:14.719 --> 00:33:16.081
and then during the test,

00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:19.175
what you can do is think back

00:33:19.175 --> 00:33:21.951
to all of the good practice
habits that you've developed,

00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:23.629
the skills that you've learned

00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:25.150
in school along the way,

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:28.011
and just remind yourself that, hey,

00:33:28.011 --> 00:33:29.385
you've done this before.

00:33:29.385 --> 00:33:30.734
You can do this,

00:33:30.734 --> 00:33:32.482
and then after the test,

00:33:32.482 --> 00:33:34.357
if it turns out you didn't feel quite good

00:33:34.357 --> 00:33:35.466
about how you did,

00:33:35.466 --> 00:33:36.556
or you're worried,

00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:39.053
the good news is that you
can take the SAT again.

00:33:39.053 --> 00:33:41.854
And so it's not a one chance.

00:33:41.854 --> 00:33:43.422
There's not just one chance to do it,

00:33:43.422 --> 00:33:46.930
and so if you don't do
quite as well as you hoped,

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.102
you can always take it again,

00:33:48.102 --> 00:33:50.442
and that's completely okay.

00:33:50.442 --> 00:33:52.457
Let's see, okay.

00:33:52.457 --> 00:33:53.947
So we have last question.

00:33:53.947 --> 00:33:57.217
Due to the more contextualized
sentences or paragraphs,

00:33:57.217 --> 00:33:59.022
how do you think we should manage our time

00:33:59.022 --> 00:34:01.275
with the reading and questions?

00:34:01.275 --> 00:34:04.935
So this is an area where I
encourage you to experiment,

00:34:04.935 --> 00:34:06.325
so for some students,

00:34:06.325 --> 00:34:09.278
they'll read through the whole passage

00:34:09.278 --> 00:34:11.234
and then go to the questions,

00:34:11.234 --> 00:34:12.942
whereas other students will go

00:34:12.942 --> 00:34:14.454
through the first two paragraphs

00:34:14.454 --> 00:34:15.941
and then answer those questions

00:34:15.941 --> 00:34:17.303
and then move on to the
next two paragraphs,

00:34:17.303 --> 00:34:18.710
and then answer the questions.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.691
And so test out both of those approaches,

00:34:21.691 --> 00:34:25.358
and figure out which
one works best for you.

00:34:26.245 --> 00:34:27.912
What you'll find is,

00:34:28.779 --> 00:34:31.268
try to avoid jumping around too much

00:34:31.268 --> 00:34:33.935
would be a good piece of advice.

00:34:35.252 --> 00:34:38.589
And so if you're going to
whatever strategy you use,

00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:39.965
don't jump around too much

00:34:39.965 --> 00:34:40.907
through the questions

00:34:40.907 --> 00:34:42.998
because that will force you to jump around

00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:44.681
through the passage as well,

00:34:44.681 --> 00:34:46.545
and each time you jump
around through the passage,

00:34:46.545 --> 00:34:48.187
you'll have to remind yourself,

00:34:48.187 --> 00:34:49.966
wait, what was the author saying here?

00:34:49.966 --> 00:34:51.922
What was the author saying over here?

00:34:51.922 --> 00:34:53.030
So on and so forth,

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.545
so however you do it,

00:34:54.545 --> 00:34:56.347
make sure you just go top to bottom,

00:34:56.347 --> 00:34:58.242
either paragraphs and then questions

00:34:58.242 --> 00:34:59.917
or reading the whole passage

00:34:59.917 --> 00:35:02.628
and then going to the questions.

00:35:02.628 --> 00:35:04.963
So I think those are all the questions

00:35:04.963 --> 00:35:06.612
that I have time for now,

00:35:06.612 --> 00:35:08.707
but now you have an option.

00:35:08.707 --> 00:35:11.724
And so I'm gonna flip back over here,

00:35:11.724 --> 00:35:15.120
and right now, you have two options.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.111
You can either like I said,

00:35:17.111 --> 00:35:20.690
head to Khan Academy to
do practice problems,

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.201
and while there, you'll have access

00:35:22.201 --> 00:35:23.890
to the one on one chat support

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.355
from Khan Academy and
College Board experts,

00:35:26.355 --> 00:35:28.805
or you can stay here on YouTube,

00:35:28.805 --> 00:35:31.713
and I'll work through a full
11 question writing passage.

00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:35.130
And so this will have all of the context,

00:35:36.128 --> 00:35:37.209
and you'll get to see

00:35:37.209 --> 00:35:39.920
what a real writing passage looks like.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.346
And so go ahead and decide.

00:35:42.346 --> 00:35:45.208
Do you wanna head to Khan
Academy or stay here?

00:35:45.208 --> 00:35:46.278
Both are gonna be great.

00:35:46.278 --> 00:35:48.331
Both will be really helpful for you,

00:35:48.331 --> 00:35:49.649
and so just pick one of those,

00:35:49.649 --> 00:35:53.149
and then I'll be back on in just a minute.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.926
Hey there, welcome back.

00:35:55.926 --> 00:35:58.979
So if you've decided to stay put

00:35:58.979 --> 00:36:01.381
and stay on YouTube Live,

00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:04.875
I'm now going to work
through a full writing

00:36:04.875 --> 00:36:07.251
and language practice passage.

00:36:07.251 --> 00:36:08.898
Keep in mind if you change your mind

00:36:08.898 --> 00:36:09.922
anytime throughout,

00:36:09.922 --> 00:36:11.801
and you're like, "Ah, I'm over this guy,"

00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:13.641
you can head over to Khan Academy,

00:36:13.641 --> 00:36:15.353
my feelings won't be hurt,

00:36:15.353 --> 00:36:16.554
to practice on your own,

00:36:16.554 --> 00:36:18.042
and people will be able to chat with you

00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:19.753
one on one if you have any questions,

00:36:19.753 --> 00:36:21.605
but we have a full passage ahead of us,

00:36:21.605 --> 00:36:23.703
and so let's take a look.

00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:26.797
We're gonna start by reading

00:36:26.797 --> 00:36:31.375
just the first two paragraphs
of this reading passage.

00:36:31.375 --> 00:36:32.664
And so let's take a look.

00:36:32.664 --> 00:36:34.991
A high profile unelected official

00:36:34.991 --> 00:36:38.053
with the political resources
to influence domestic policy,

00:36:38.053 --> 00:36:39.519
so high profile,

00:36:39.519 --> 00:36:41.494
the President of the
United States has a wife

00:36:41.494 --> 00:36:43.416
known as the First Lady,

00:36:43.416 --> 00:36:45.527
occupies a unique position.

00:36:45.527 --> 00:36:47.431
Many First Ladies, not content with simply

00:36:47.431 --> 00:36:50.742
playing the role of a demure
wife and social hostess,

00:36:50.742 --> 00:36:53.645
have taken an active role
in the political sphere.

00:36:53.645 --> 00:36:55.942
Even though her power
comes by way of marriage

00:36:55.942 --> 00:36:58.932
rather than from the
electorate or the Constitution,

00:36:58.932 --> 00:37:00.918
the First Lady or First Gentleman

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:03.188
has a responsibility to capitalize

00:37:03.188 --> 00:37:05.133
on her situation and attempt to create

00:37:05.133 --> 00:37:07.830
significant lasting change.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.711
If the President of the
United States is female,

00:37:09.711 --> 00:37:12.329
her husband's title would
be the First Gentleman.

00:37:12.329 --> 00:37:13.404
Throughout U.S. history,

00:37:13.404 --> 00:37:16.261
there have been a number of influential,

00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:17.782
politically engaged First Ladies

00:37:17.782 --> 00:37:19.703
from whom future First Ladies or Gentlemen

00:37:19.703 --> 00:37:21.346
can take inspiration.

00:37:21.346 --> 00:37:22.449
Okay, so before I move on,

00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:24.166
I just wanna make sure I
understand that passage.

00:37:24.166 --> 00:37:28.179
So talking about First Ladies
or First Gentlemen today,

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:32.427
and the political role and
influence that they can have

00:37:32.427 --> 00:37:34.396
to create lasting change,

00:37:34.396 --> 00:37:37.217
and then in this last part,

00:37:37.217 --> 00:37:38.970
it sounds like we're gonna talk about

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.580
some First Ladies in history.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.883
Okay, so that makes sense.

00:37:42.883 --> 00:37:43.926
Let's keep going.

00:37:43.926 --> 00:37:46.580
Abigail Adams, the second
First Lady in American history,

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.566
was the first to assume a protruding role

00:37:50.566 --> 00:37:51.810
in the political sphere.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.144
Unlike her predecessor, Martha Washington,

00:37:54.144 --> 00:37:56.320
Adams was outspoken, well educated,

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.975
and quickly developed a reputation

00:37:57.975 --> 00:38:00.071
of a staunch partisan defender

00:38:00.071 --> 00:38:02.393
after openly criticizing Congress

00:38:02.393 --> 00:38:05.787
for not declaring war on France in 1798.

00:38:05.787 --> 00:38:07.575
Her influence is so well known

00:38:07.575 --> 00:38:09.510
that opponents claim the President refused

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:12.695
to make any appointments
without her approbation,

00:38:12.695 --> 00:38:14.792
and, comma, and aspiring politicians

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:16.696
sought her endorsement.

00:38:16.696 --> 00:38:18.983
In recent years, Adams
has become a popular topic

00:38:18.983 --> 00:38:21.009
for biographers because of her thoughts

00:38:21.009 --> 00:38:23.424
on gender, slavery, and politics.

00:38:23.424 --> 00:38:25.230
Okay, so we're talking about Abigail Adams

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.437
in the second one,

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:30.020
and how she was well
spoken, well educated,

00:38:31.937 --> 00:38:35.324
so it seems to be quite
positive about her role,

00:38:35.324 --> 00:38:39.413
and so she was influential and supportive.

00:38:39.413 --> 00:38:42.327
Okay, so pretty positive about her.

00:38:42.327 --> 00:38:43.917
Okay, now we're gonna take a look

00:38:43.917 --> 00:38:45.744
at this first question.

00:38:45.744 --> 00:38:48.032
So question number one,
there's no question here,

00:38:48.032 --> 00:38:52.198
so this is what's called
a stemless question.

00:38:52.198 --> 00:38:54.035
And so what that means is

00:38:54.035 --> 00:38:56.814
that you wanna refer back
to this part of the passage

00:38:56.814 --> 00:38:58.111
where you see the one,

00:38:58.111 --> 00:39:00.618
and it's asking you should
that part of the passage

00:39:00.618 --> 00:39:01.791
be changed or not,

00:39:01.791 --> 00:39:03.405
and if so, how?

00:39:03.405 --> 00:39:05.854
So let's reread some of
these sentences again

00:39:05.854 --> 00:39:07.967
to get the context of the passage.

00:39:07.967 --> 00:39:10.261
So a high profile, unelected official

00:39:10.261 --> 00:39:12.879
with the political resources
to influence domestic policy,

00:39:12.879 --> 00:39:15.293
the President of the
United States has a wife

00:39:15.293 --> 00:39:16.615
known as the First lady,

00:39:16.615 --> 00:39:18.398
occupies a unique position.

00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:21.817
So that probably sounds weird to you,

00:39:21.817 --> 00:39:23.542
but why does it sound weird?

00:39:23.542 --> 00:39:25.362
Well, there's an issue here

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:29.195
called modifier placement,
modifier placement,

00:39:30.096 --> 00:39:32.383
and that really means
that you have a phrase

00:39:32.383 --> 00:39:35.361
that's meant to modify an object,

00:39:35.361 --> 00:39:39.402
and it's pretty far from
what it's supposed to modify.

00:39:39.402 --> 00:39:42.815
So that phrase is, a high
profile, unelected official

00:39:42.815 --> 00:39:44.248
with the political resources,

00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:49.032
so that's referring to the
wife or the First Lady,

00:39:49.032 --> 00:39:51.737
and so but the passage doesn't have that.

00:39:51.737 --> 00:39:54.570
It says we have all of this description

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:56.652
about the First Lady
or the First Gentleman,

00:39:56.652 --> 00:39:58.930
and then it says the President
of the United States,

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.578
and so we're not talking
about the President,

00:40:00.578 --> 00:40:02.151
and so to fix that,

00:40:02.151 --> 00:40:04.818
what we can do is move this wife

00:40:06.308 --> 00:40:08.118
in this case to be a little closer.

00:40:08.118 --> 00:40:09.721
And so let's take a look
at the answer choices.

00:40:09.721 --> 00:40:12.070
We know it's not no change
because there's that error.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:14.864
The United States has a, well,

00:40:14.864 --> 00:40:16.130
so we're talking about the First Lady,

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:17.880
and if you swap in B,

00:40:18.962 --> 00:40:21.121
then it's saying that the United States

00:40:21.121 --> 00:40:22.977
is a high profile, unelected official,

00:40:22.977 --> 00:40:24.442
and that does not make sense.

00:40:24.442 --> 00:40:26.312
A country cannot be an elected official,

00:40:26.312 --> 00:40:28.291
and then the United States President,

00:40:28.291 --> 00:40:31.145
so again, this one is
talking about the President,

00:40:31.145 --> 00:40:32.353
and so we're not talking
about the President.

00:40:32.353 --> 00:40:35.251
We're talking about the wife,

00:40:35.251 --> 00:40:37.951
and so that is how you can go through

00:40:37.951 --> 00:40:40.464
a stemless question together,

00:40:40.464 --> 00:40:43.527
and now let's keep on going.

00:40:43.527 --> 00:40:44.955
That was one of 11,

00:40:44.955 --> 00:40:48.473
and I wanna show you
as many different kinds

00:40:48.473 --> 00:40:50.317
of SAT Writing questions as possible,

00:40:50.317 --> 00:40:53.185
so let's get right back to it.

00:40:53.185 --> 00:40:54.359
So let's take a look.

00:40:54.359 --> 00:40:57.970
The writer is considering
deleting the underlying sentence.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.704
Should the sentence be kept or deleted?

00:40:59.704 --> 00:41:01.777
So this is an example
of one of the questions

00:41:01.777 --> 00:41:02.846
that was asked earlier.

00:41:02.846 --> 00:41:06.869
How do I approach a deletion
or addition question?

00:41:06.869 --> 00:41:08.500
And so what I wanna do then

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.262
is the first decision I try to make

00:41:11.262 --> 00:41:13.679
is if I wanna keep or delete,

00:41:14.543 --> 00:41:16.279
and what you'll notice
is in these questions

00:41:16.279 --> 00:41:17.510
I've got two keeps,

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.613
and I've got two deletes.

00:41:18.613 --> 00:41:21.351
And so if I can make this decision

00:41:21.351 --> 00:41:24.271
about if I should keep or delete,

00:41:24.271 --> 00:41:27.521
it helps me narrow it down just to two.

00:41:28.649 --> 00:41:31.249
And so what I wanna do is take a look

00:41:31.249 --> 00:41:33.019
at this paragraph

00:41:33.019 --> 00:41:35.395
and make sure I understand the context

00:41:35.395 --> 00:41:38.419
and determine if this really helps

00:41:38.419 --> 00:41:41.148
the flow of the passage, of the paragraph,

00:41:41.148 --> 00:41:42.860
and reinforce the author's point

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.241
or if it detracts from it.

00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:49.018
So let me just read from
about here down to here.

00:41:49.018 --> 00:41:52.386
So even though her power
comes by way of marriage

00:41:52.386 --> 00:41:54.383
rather than from the
electorate or the Constitution,

00:41:54.383 --> 00:41:55.874
the First Lady or First Gentleman

00:41:55.874 --> 00:41:58.049
has a responsibility to
capitalize on her situation

00:41:58.049 --> 00:42:00.810
and attempt to create
significant lasting change.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.603
If the President of the
United States is female,

00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:04.898
her husband's title
would be First Gentleman,

00:42:04.898 --> 00:42:06.907
and then I say throughout history,

00:42:06.907 --> 00:42:08.173
there have been a number of influential

00:42:08.173 --> 00:42:10.199
or politically engaged First Ladies

00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:11.737
from whom we can draw inspiration.

00:42:11.737 --> 00:42:14.767
Okay, so let's think
about that flow there.

00:42:14.767 --> 00:42:17.267
Does this second sentence here

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.301
add or detract from the author's point

00:42:21.301 --> 00:42:23.154
and the logical flow of the paragraph?

00:42:23.154 --> 00:42:25.129
Well, it seems like we're talking about

00:42:25.129 --> 00:42:27.248
the First Lady and the responsibility

00:42:27.248 --> 00:42:30.491
and the opportunity that that person has,

00:42:30.491 --> 00:42:32.491
and then about all these

00:42:34.411 --> 00:42:36.495
influential historical First Ladies.

00:42:36.495 --> 00:42:38.749
And so it feels a bit random to me

00:42:38.749 --> 00:42:41.441
to have this blurb about
the First Gentleman

00:42:41.441 --> 00:42:43.613
because it seems more like a factoid,

00:42:43.613 --> 00:42:47.307
and so I think it doesn't
help with the passage,

00:42:47.307 --> 00:42:49.762
and so I'm gonna go ahead
and cross those off.

00:42:49.762 --> 00:42:51.402
And then let's look at C and D,

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:54.064
deleted because it
interrupts the introduction

00:42:54.064 --> 00:42:55.490
of the passage's main point

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.378
with a loosely related detail.

00:42:57.378 --> 00:42:58.637
So that's pretty much what I said

00:42:58.637 --> 00:43:00.773
'cause so there's the factoid

00:43:00.773 --> 00:43:02.777
that I don't think is relevant,

00:43:02.777 --> 00:43:05.058
and so that's pretty positive.

00:43:05.058 --> 00:43:06.594
Feeling good about that.

00:43:06.594 --> 00:43:07.543
Let's take a look at D,

00:43:07.543 --> 00:43:09.637
deleted because it weakens
the passage's influence

00:43:09.637 --> 00:43:10.968
on the importance of work done

00:43:10.968 --> 00:43:13.522
by several influential First Ladies.

00:43:13.522 --> 00:43:16.010
So I don't think it does that.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.748
It's a random factoid,

00:43:17.748 --> 00:43:19.665
but the real harm of it

00:43:23.104 --> 00:43:25.422
is not that it weakens the emphasis,

00:43:25.422 --> 00:43:29.107
and so C is the right, final answer.

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:33.282
Okay, let's keep going then
to question number three.

00:43:33.282 --> 00:43:35.204
Which choice is most consistent

00:43:35.204 --> 00:43:36.294
with the writer's position

00:43:36.294 --> 00:43:37.886
as established in the passage?

00:43:37.886 --> 00:43:39.824
So which choice is most consistent

00:43:39.824 --> 00:43:41.171
with the writer's position

00:43:41.171 --> 00:43:42.749
as established in the passage?

00:43:42.749 --> 00:43:46.480
And so this is another one
of those stemless questions,

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.006
and so I'd look at
question number three here.

00:43:49.006 --> 00:43:52.603
So Abigail Adams, the second
First Lady in American history,

00:43:52.603 --> 00:43:55.362
was the first to assume a protruding role,

00:43:55.362 --> 00:43:57.300
so we've got protruding role,

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.598
in the political sphere.

00:43:59.598 --> 00:44:02.044
Unlike her predecessor
and all of that, okay,

00:44:02.044 --> 00:44:04.941
so and remember, this
paragraph was pretty positive

00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:06.572
about Abigail Adams,

00:44:06.572 --> 00:44:10.749
and so we wanna understand
if protruding fits

00:44:10.749 --> 00:44:13.571
and is consistent with
the writer's position.

00:44:13.571 --> 00:44:17.374
And to me, protruding sounded a bit odd

00:44:17.374 --> 00:44:18.530
when I first read it,

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.056
and so protruding seems like,

00:44:21.056 --> 00:44:23.652
the meaning of protruding is

00:44:23.652 --> 00:44:26.643
of something that is
sticking out in some way.

00:44:26.643 --> 00:44:30.341
And so, given that the
author is pretty positive

00:44:30.341 --> 00:44:31.374
about Abigail Adams,

00:44:31.374 --> 00:44:33.980
to say that she was the First Lady

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.070
to really stick out in
kind of a negative way

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:38.477
makes me think that that's probably out.

00:44:38.477 --> 00:44:39.867
So let's take a look at B,

00:44:39.867 --> 00:44:43.034
an obtrusive role, so obtrusive again,

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.919
also has a similar meaning to protruding

00:44:46.919 --> 00:44:48.232
in that it's sticking out

00:44:48.232 --> 00:44:49.750
but in a slightly negative way.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:50.583
So that's negative.

00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:53.375
That's negative, and so
we can cross that out,

00:44:53.375 --> 00:44:54.916
and then what about a prominent,

00:44:54.916 --> 00:44:57.766
first to assume a prominent
role in the political sphere.

00:44:57.766 --> 00:45:00.272
So that has a connotation that's positive

00:45:00.272 --> 00:45:04.912
and is positive and
roughly means influential,

00:45:04.912 --> 00:45:08.082
significant, and so that one, I like.

00:45:08.082 --> 00:45:10.438
And then last one, an ostentatious role

00:45:10.438 --> 00:45:12.016
in the political sphere,

00:45:12.016 --> 00:45:13.805
so that one again is slightly negative

00:45:13.805 --> 00:45:15.972
and has a bit more of like

00:45:17.135 --> 00:45:19.968
a show off connotation or meaning,

00:45:20.899 --> 00:45:24.293
and so then my final
answer here is gonna be C.

00:45:24.293 --> 00:45:26.157
Now I like this question

00:45:26.157 --> 00:45:27.881
because there were some words in here

00:45:27.881 --> 00:45:31.632
that maybe you don't use
in everyday language.

00:45:31.632 --> 00:45:32.873
So I don't know.

00:45:32.873 --> 00:45:34.481
You probably don't go up
to your friends and say,

00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:35.742
"Hey, you're really ostentatious,"

00:45:35.742 --> 00:45:37.948
'cause it's not, you know,

00:45:37.948 --> 00:45:40.357
so there are some words
that you might not be

00:45:40.357 --> 00:45:41.774
as familiar with.

00:45:41.774 --> 00:45:45.553
And so vocab is something
that may come up in the SAT,

00:45:45.553 --> 00:45:47.022
and so what you can do there

00:45:47.022 --> 00:45:50.632
is anytime you encounter a word on the SAT

00:45:50.632 --> 00:45:51.985
that you don't understand,

00:45:51.985 --> 00:45:54.504
write it down, and go take a look,

00:45:54.504 --> 00:45:55.554
and look it up,

00:45:55.554 --> 00:45:58.208
and so that you don't come
across that word again.

00:45:58.208 --> 00:45:59.878
And then you're like,
"Oh, I didn't look it up

00:45:59.878 --> 00:46:00.711
"that one time,

00:46:00.711 --> 00:46:01.544
"and I still don't know it now,

00:46:01.544 --> 00:46:02.377
"and here it is again."

00:46:02.377 --> 00:46:04.155
And you know, you wanna
avoid that situation,

00:46:04.155 --> 00:46:06.927
and so that's what I'd
encourage you to do,

00:46:06.927 --> 00:46:08.099
and the more you read

00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:10.049
and the more you practice on the SAT,

00:46:10.049 --> 00:46:12.192
the more familiar you'll get
with some of these words.

00:46:12.192 --> 00:46:14.258
So let's keep on going.

00:46:14.258 --> 00:46:17.175
So question number four, no change,

00:46:18.555 --> 00:46:20.594
so protruding role.

00:46:20.594 --> 00:46:22.475
Her influence is so well known

00:46:22.475 --> 00:46:25.063
that opponents claim the President

00:46:25.063 --> 00:46:26.486
refused to make any appointments

00:46:26.486 --> 00:46:27.879
without her approbation,

00:46:27.879 --> 00:46:29.462
so is that correct?

00:46:31.212 --> 00:46:33.946
Well, what I wanna look at here

00:46:33.946 --> 00:46:37.539
is the verb tense in the
rest of the sentence,

00:46:37.539 --> 00:46:39.525
and so I've got claimed, refused,

00:46:39.525 --> 00:46:41.556
and so those are all past tense.

00:46:41.556 --> 00:46:43.750
And so I want something that's past tense,

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.899
and so I think, was, would fix it.

00:46:45.899 --> 00:46:47.691
Her influence was so well known

00:46:47.691 --> 00:46:49.753
that opponents claimed
the President refused,

00:46:49.753 --> 00:46:51.389
and so there we go.

00:46:51.389 --> 00:46:53.786
I have my answer of B.

00:46:53.786 --> 00:46:55.319
Okay, moving right along,

00:46:55.319 --> 00:46:56.602
we're running a little short on time here,

00:46:56.602 --> 00:47:00.185
so let's see, which
choice most effectively

00:47:01.334 --> 00:47:02.844
concludes the paragraph.

00:47:02.844 --> 00:47:05.472
So we wanna look here at this part,

00:47:05.472 --> 00:47:07.098
and let's see.

00:47:07.098 --> 00:47:08.724
We're talking about Abigail Adams,

00:47:08.724 --> 00:47:10.616
her prominent role,

00:47:10.616 --> 00:47:13.033
and how she's very outspoken,

00:47:14.435 --> 00:47:17.120
and we have in recent years,

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.616
she's become a popular topic.

00:47:18.616 --> 00:47:21.049
So that's pretty positive,

00:47:21.049 --> 00:47:23.250
and so but I want something

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:26.199
that links back to this
topic sentence here,

00:47:26.199 --> 00:47:28.310
and so this is where I'm looking here.

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:30.060
And so she was the second First Lady

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.283
and was the first to
assume a prominent role,

00:47:32.283 --> 00:47:33.906
and so I want something positive

00:47:33.906 --> 00:47:36.550
that also ties back to
this topic sentence.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.228
Okay, so let's take a look at B.

00:47:38.228 --> 00:47:40.132
In a period of limited female autonomy,

00:47:40.132 --> 00:47:41.942
Adams demonstrated that the First Lady

00:47:41.942 --> 00:47:43.776
could substantially influence politics

00:47:43.776 --> 00:47:45.526
in the United States.

00:47:46.423 --> 00:47:49.262
So yeah, that is very positive,

00:47:49.262 --> 00:47:53.594
and also ties back to
this influence politics

00:47:53.594 --> 00:47:55.153
in the United States,

00:47:55.153 --> 00:47:57.216
and then in the topic sentence over here,

00:47:57.216 --> 00:47:59.837
we're talking about a influential role

00:47:59.837 --> 00:48:00.788
in the political sphere.

00:48:00.788 --> 00:48:03.082
So I actually think that
one works better than A,

00:48:03.082 --> 00:48:05.313
so I can go ahead and cross that one off,

00:48:05.313 --> 00:48:07.096
and then a major
component of Adam's legacy

00:48:07.096 --> 00:48:09.362
is a collection of more than 1,100 letters

00:48:09.362 --> 00:48:12.200
written between Adams and her husband.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.950
So that is another random
fact that detracts,

00:48:16.935 --> 00:48:20.685
and so we're not talking
about these letters.

00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:26.316
The author is really focusing on, nope,

00:48:26.316 --> 00:48:29.550
on, let me zoom in there, sorry,

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:31.300
is really focusing on

00:48:34.155 --> 00:48:37.058
Abigail herself, not these letters.

00:48:37.058 --> 00:48:38.259
And so then the last part,

00:48:38.259 --> 00:48:40.389
I'll just zoom in a little bit more here.

00:48:40.389 --> 00:48:42.165
Abigail Adams was not only the wife

00:48:42.165 --> 00:48:43.510
of the second U.S. President,

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:45.956
but also the mother of
the sixth U.S. President,

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.333
John Quincy Adams.

00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:51.361
So again, that one is
talking about the mother,

00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:53.016
and rather than Abigail Adams,

00:48:53.016 --> 00:48:56.555
and so B is gonna be our final answer.

00:48:56.555 --> 00:48:57.816
Got some feedback that
I should zoom in more,

00:48:57.816 --> 00:48:59.528
so I will do my best to do that

00:48:59.528 --> 00:49:01.897
in the second half of the passage.

00:49:01.897 --> 00:49:03.830
First, let's read the
second half of the passage,

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:06.830
and then we'll tackle the questions.

00:49:12.874 --> 00:49:14.874
Okay, from 1933 to 1945,

00:49:16.096 --> 00:49:19.688
Eleanor Roosevelt was intimately involved

00:49:19.688 --> 00:49:21.726
in her husband's domestic policies

00:49:21.726 --> 00:49:25.105
during the tumultuous Great Depression.

00:49:25.105 --> 00:49:26.975
So intimately involved, for example,

00:49:26.975 --> 00:49:29.777
she spearheaded the
establishment of Arthurdale.

00:49:29.777 --> 00:49:31.839
Arthurdale was a resettlement community

00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:33.561
that combined subsistence farming

00:49:33.561 --> 00:49:36.843
and simple industry for
impoverished mine workers.

00:49:36.843 --> 00:49:38.084
After convincing her husband

00:49:38.084 --> 00:49:40.094
to bring the project
under federal authority,

00:49:40.094 --> 00:49:42.305
Roosevelt became the
unofficial project director

00:49:42.305 --> 00:49:44.558
and supported the community
through regular visits

00:49:44.558 --> 00:49:46.642
and budgetary oversight.

00:49:46.642 --> 00:49:48.857
However, she became,

00:49:48.857 --> 00:49:51.192
however, that's a funny word to use there.

00:49:51.192 --> 00:49:53.376
She became beloved by the American people

00:49:53.376 --> 00:49:55.835
who admired her commitment
to helping those in need,

00:49:55.835 --> 00:49:58.054
so admired her commitment
to helping those in need.

00:49:58.054 --> 00:50:01.027
So this time, we're talking
about Mrs. Roosevelt here,

00:50:01.027 --> 00:50:03.610
and the positive impact she had

00:50:04.545 --> 00:50:07.311
on policies in the Great Depression,

00:50:07.311 --> 00:50:10.593
and she was quite well loved
by the American people.

00:50:10.593 --> 00:50:11.799
So I'll draw a heart.

00:50:11.799 --> 00:50:13.459
Okay, let's keep going here.

00:50:13.459 --> 00:50:16.206
Two decades later,
Claudia Lady Bird Johnson

00:50:16.206 --> 00:50:19.504
pushed further into the political sphere

00:50:19.504 --> 00:50:21.640
than had any previous First Lady.

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.777
She attended legislative strategy sessions

00:50:23.777 --> 00:50:25.330
and directly interacted with Congress

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:28.476
to garner support for her
environmental legislation.

00:50:28.476 --> 00:50:31.834
Okay, environmental legislation,

00:50:31.834 --> 00:50:33.169
Johnson established her legacy

00:50:33.169 --> 00:50:34.591
by using her political leverage

00:50:34.591 --> 00:50:38.287
to influence the passage of
nearly 200 environmental laws.

00:50:38.287 --> 00:50:42.204
Wow, that's a lot of laws
that she helped pass.

00:50:43.316 --> 00:50:44.941
So despite the important contribution

00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:47.711
these First Ladies made
to American society,

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:50.733
her activism often resulted
in scathing critiques.

00:50:50.733 --> 00:50:53.758
Adams was mockingly called Mrs. President.

00:50:53.758 --> 00:50:55.765
Roosevelt was ridiculed in newspapers,

00:50:55.765 --> 00:50:58.768
and a Montana billboard
read, "Impeach Lady Bird."

00:50:58.768 --> 00:51:00.783
Yet as Barbara Bush aptly noted,

00:51:00.783 --> 00:51:03.889
the First Lady is going to be criticized

00:51:03.889 --> 00:51:05.130
no matter what she does.

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:06.391
First Ladies have a responsibility

00:51:06.391 --> 00:51:08.249
to ignore the inevitable criticism.

00:51:08.249 --> 00:51:10.849
They should use the position
to create invaluable social

00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:14.068
and political change as
they have for centuries.

00:51:14.068 --> 00:51:16.901
Okay, so we've talked about so far

00:51:18.172 --> 00:51:20.686
Mrs. Roosevelt, Mrs. Johnson here,

00:51:20.686 --> 00:51:24.019
and then about the need for First Ladies

00:51:25.519 --> 00:51:27.686
to make change regardless.

00:51:28.706 --> 00:51:31.779
So let's take a look now
at question number six.

00:51:31.779 --> 00:51:35.458
Which option most effectively
combines the sentences

00:51:35.458 --> 00:51:37.015
at the underlying portion?

00:51:37.015 --> 00:51:39.302
So we're looking at number six here,

00:51:39.302 --> 00:51:41.466
so Arthurdale, so four examples,

00:51:41.466 --> 00:51:44.678
she spearheaded the establishment
of Arthurdale, period.

00:51:44.678 --> 00:51:46.535
Arthurdale was a resettlement community

00:51:46.535 --> 00:51:48.550
that combined subsistence farming.

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:50.895
Okay, so it's grammatically correct,

00:51:50.895 --> 00:51:53.757
but I think I could
improve the clarity here

00:51:53.757 --> 00:51:54.894
and streamline it,

00:51:54.894 --> 00:51:56.900
and so I might wanna use a comma,

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.925
would be a good one,

00:51:57.925 --> 00:52:00.433
and then delete that.

00:52:00.433 --> 00:52:03.440
And so that would be the
simplest solution to that,

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.320
but let's take a look
at the answer choices.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:09.146
Arthurdale, and it was
a resettlement community

00:52:09.146 --> 00:52:11.229
that combined, not quite,

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.620
so not quite.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.286
Arthurdale, comma, okay, so that one is,

00:52:16.286 --> 00:52:17.842
combines the sentences effectively

00:52:17.842 --> 00:52:19.363
and is very streamlined,

00:52:19.363 --> 00:52:21.011
and so I like that one.

00:52:21.011 --> 00:52:25.464
Arthurdale, semicolon, it
was a resettlement community.

00:52:25.464 --> 00:52:26.816
So that one is okay,

00:52:26.816 --> 00:52:29.556
but it's not as streamlined as B,

00:52:29.556 --> 00:52:31.083
and so that's out,

00:52:31.083 --> 00:52:34.670
and then Arthurdale, comma,
this being the name of,

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:36.244
so you don't need to say that.

00:52:36.244 --> 00:52:37.167
It's a bit repetitive

00:52:37.167 --> 00:52:39.151
'cause you know that you're
talking about Arthurdale,

00:52:39.151 --> 00:52:41.079
and then this is explaining what it is,

00:52:41.079 --> 00:52:44.306
and so the answer choice is B.

00:52:44.306 --> 00:52:47.721
Let's keep going here onto number seven,

00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:50.183
so this is another one of
those stemless questions,

00:52:50.183 --> 00:52:53.550
and we wanna look at here number seven,

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:56.198
and say let's read a little bit before

00:52:56.198 --> 00:52:58.144
and a little bit after to get the context.

00:52:58.144 --> 00:53:00.122
Again, context is super important,

00:53:00.122 --> 00:53:01.723
so after convincing her husband

00:53:01.723 --> 00:53:03.854
to bring the project
under federal authority,

00:53:03.854 --> 00:53:06.346
Roosevelt became the
unofficial project director

00:53:06.346 --> 00:53:08.666
and supported the community
through regular visits

00:53:08.666 --> 00:53:10.322
and budgetary oversight.

00:53:10.322 --> 00:53:12.853
However, she became beloved
by the American people

00:53:12.853 --> 00:53:16.045
who admired her commitment to
helping those most in need.

00:53:16.045 --> 00:53:20.563
So is that the right
word for in number seven?

00:53:20.563 --> 00:53:23.651
So, however, doesn't feel quite right

00:53:23.651 --> 00:53:26.658
because all of this
passage is quite positive

00:53:26.658 --> 00:53:28.079
about Eleanor Roosevelt,

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:29.688
and so to say, however, indicates

00:53:29.688 --> 00:53:32.027
that there should be a contrast,

00:53:32.027 --> 00:53:33.740
and there isn't a contrast there.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.226
So we don't want a contrast.

00:53:35.226 --> 00:53:38.041
It should be something like, therefore,

00:53:38.041 --> 00:53:41.240
so she's done all of these great things,

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.179
and she's been influential.

00:53:43.179 --> 00:53:45.779
Therefore, she was loved,
would make a lot more sense

00:53:45.779 --> 00:53:47.698
than this contrasting phrase,

00:53:47.698 --> 00:53:49.826
and so it's not no change.

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.549
For instance, she became loved.

00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:55.195
That doesn't quite
match my therefore here.

00:53:55.195 --> 00:53:57.115
In keeping with this tradition,

00:53:57.115 --> 00:53:58.556
nope, we're not talking about traditions.

00:53:58.556 --> 00:53:59.443
That's out,

00:53:59.443 --> 00:54:01.145
and then as a result of these efforts.

00:54:01.145 --> 00:54:02.194
So there we go.

00:54:02.194 --> 00:54:05.545
That one almost exactly
matches my therefore prediction

00:54:05.545 --> 00:54:08.030
and fits with the flow of the passage

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:10.154
that says, you know, she
was very influential.

00:54:10.154 --> 00:54:11.668
She did all of these great things.

00:54:11.668 --> 00:54:13.763
Therefore, as a result of these efforts,

00:54:13.763 --> 00:54:15.596
she became well loved.

00:54:16.784 --> 00:54:19.442
So we are almost through to the end,

00:54:19.442 --> 00:54:20.864
only three more questions,

00:54:20.864 --> 00:54:23.233
and so we'll keep going through

00:54:23.233 --> 00:54:25.658
just so you see a few more question types,

00:54:25.658 --> 00:54:27.866
and then I'll close with a few final tips

00:54:27.866 --> 00:54:32.579
for those of you who are
taking the SAT on Saturday.

00:54:32.579 --> 00:54:35.356
So question number eight,

00:54:35.356 --> 00:54:36.785
so I'll just zoom in on the question

00:54:36.785 --> 00:54:39.554
'cause this is a lengthy question here.

00:54:39.554 --> 00:54:40.843
So you can take a look.

00:54:40.843 --> 00:54:43.011
At this point, the writer wants to provide

00:54:43.011 --> 00:54:44.911
an example of legislation

00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:46.723
mentioned in the previous sentence.

00:54:46.723 --> 00:54:50.490
Which choice most effectively
accomplishes this goal?

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:53.073
So we want an example of legislation.

00:54:53.073 --> 00:54:56.958
Okay, so we'll come back
to these answer choices,

00:54:56.958 --> 00:54:58.895
but first I wanna look
back at the context.

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:00.618
So this is question number eight,

00:55:00.618 --> 00:55:02.437
and so we're talking
about Lady Bird Johnson,

00:55:02.437 --> 00:55:03.887
so we're looking here.

00:55:03.887 --> 00:55:06.778
And so two decades later,

00:55:06.778 --> 00:55:08.490
she pushed further into
the political sphere.

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:11.128
She attended legislative strategy sessions

00:55:11.128 --> 00:55:12.809
and directly interacted with Congress

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:15.493
to garner support for her
environmental legislation.

00:55:15.493 --> 00:55:17.670
So bingo, there is the
environmental legislation

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:19.456
we are talking about,

00:55:19.456 --> 00:55:21.774
and okay, so we want an example

00:55:21.774 --> 00:55:23.364
of environmental legislation,

00:55:23.364 --> 00:55:25.587
and so let's see which
of these answer choices

00:55:25.587 --> 00:55:27.016
best accomplishes that,

00:55:27.016 --> 00:55:28.958
and I'll move back here for now.

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:30.915
So one such legislative effort,

00:55:30.915 --> 00:55:33.047
the Beautification Act of 1965,

00:55:33.047 --> 00:55:35.289
improved the environment
surrounding America's highways

00:55:35.289 --> 00:55:36.897
by eliminating billboards and junkyards

00:55:36.897 --> 00:55:38.540
and adding scenic landscaping.

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:40.554
Well, I've got legislative effort there,

00:55:40.554 --> 00:55:43.168
and I've got a act and I've got a bill,

00:55:43.168 --> 00:55:45.008
so any time you see an answer choice

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:48.793
that matches a lot of the
language in the passage,

00:55:48.793 --> 00:55:49.966
that's generally a good sign.

00:55:49.966 --> 00:55:52.024
So I'm feeling good here.

00:55:52.024 --> 00:55:53.855
Let's take a look though
at the other ones.

00:55:53.855 --> 00:55:55.370
After her husband signed into law

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:57.588
the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

00:55:57.588 --> 00:56:01.174
Johnson went on two solo,
multi-state speaking tours

00:56:01.174 --> 00:56:03.456
in southern U.S. to
advocate for her husband

00:56:03.456 --> 00:56:05.424
and advance his policies.

00:56:05.424 --> 00:56:08.708
So we're talking about the
Civil Rights Act in this case,

00:56:08.708 --> 00:56:12.185
and rather than about
Johnson's legislation herself,

00:56:12.185 --> 00:56:13.944
and it's also not about the environment.

00:56:13.944 --> 00:56:15.111
So that's out.

00:56:16.193 --> 00:56:17.969
Lady Bird's beautification directive

00:56:17.969 --> 00:56:20.970
had begun when she formed
the First Lady's committee,

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:22.258
which focused on urban decay

00:56:22.258 --> 00:56:23.649
and planted millions of flowers.

00:56:23.649 --> 00:56:25.816
So this one is about the environment,

00:56:25.816 --> 00:56:27.697
so I like that,

00:56:27.697 --> 00:56:30.987
but it's not as strong
an answer as this one,

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:34.791
and so I don't have the
laws that are being passed.

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:37.021
And so that one's not as strong as A,

00:56:37.021 --> 00:56:38.030
and then the last one,

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:40.374
in support of the government's
See America First campaign,

00:56:40.374 --> 00:56:41.926
Johnson undertook a series of trips

00:56:41.926 --> 00:56:44.862
to national parks to
highlight the natural beauty

00:56:44.862 --> 00:56:45.711
of the American outdoors

00:56:45.711 --> 00:56:47.040
and promote ecotourism.

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.197
So again, this one talks
about the environment,

00:56:49.197 --> 00:56:52.197
but then what about the law part?

00:56:52.197 --> 00:56:53.289
So that one's out,

00:56:53.289 --> 00:56:56.163
and so my final answer here is A.

00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:58.996
So just a few more questions here.

00:57:00.098 --> 00:57:02.316
Let's take a look, question number nine,

00:57:02.316 --> 00:57:03.779
so this is a stemless question,

00:57:03.779 --> 00:57:07.493
and so we're gonna take a
look at question number nine.

00:57:07.493 --> 00:57:09.009
Despite the important contributions

00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:11.824
these First Ladies made
to American society,

00:57:11.824 --> 00:57:14.233
and I'll zoom in here,

00:57:14.233 --> 00:57:16.875
her activism often resulted
in scathing critiques.

00:57:16.875 --> 00:57:20.259
So I'll just focus on this her part here,

00:57:20.259 --> 00:57:21.838
so despite the important contributions

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:23.283
these First Ladies made,

00:57:23.283 --> 00:57:25.106
her activism often resulted.

00:57:25.106 --> 00:57:27.364
So this is a pronoun, her,

00:57:27.364 --> 00:57:30.678
and what is the pronoun referring to?

00:57:30.678 --> 00:57:34.417
So important contributions
these First Ladies,

00:57:34.417 --> 00:57:36.500
so this is the antecedent

00:57:37.674 --> 00:57:39.137
or what the pronoun is referring to.

00:57:39.137 --> 00:57:41.169
So First Ladies and her,

00:57:41.169 --> 00:57:42.690
well, her doesn't quite work

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:44.553
because First Ladies is plural,

00:57:44.553 --> 00:57:46.553
so if I go back up here,

00:57:47.763 --> 00:57:49.743
I want the plural pronoun,

00:57:49.743 --> 00:57:52.160
so, their, would be this one.

00:57:53.057 --> 00:57:55.112
And so their contribution,

00:57:55.112 --> 00:57:56.905
so they're, this one is wrong

00:57:56.905 --> 00:57:58.355
because this is, they are,

00:57:58.355 --> 00:57:59.715
so it's not possessive,

00:57:59.715 --> 00:58:02.798
and, there, is more like, over there.

00:58:04.572 --> 00:58:07.870
Okey doke, and question number 10,

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.371
let's go back over here.

00:58:10.371 --> 00:58:12.429
Okay, her activism often resulted

00:58:12.429 --> 00:58:14.971
in scathing critiques, colon,

00:58:14.971 --> 00:58:17.961
Adams was mockingly called Mrs. President.

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:19.891
Okay, so resulted in scathing critiques,

00:58:19.891 --> 00:58:20.909
that seems clear,

00:58:20.909 --> 00:58:22.785
and I don't see an error here

00:58:22.785 --> 00:58:24.368
with a colon there,

00:58:26.911 --> 00:58:28.491
and the part before the colon

00:58:28.491 --> 00:58:29.929
is an independent clause,

00:58:29.929 --> 00:58:31.792
so that seems right.

00:58:31.792 --> 00:58:35.252
So I actually don't there
is anything wrong here,

00:58:35.252 --> 00:58:38.580
so then you can go ahead and go with that.

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:39.886
And so in this case,

00:58:39.886 --> 00:58:41.981
I'm able to choose A because

00:58:41.981 --> 00:58:45.314
I was able to confirm that it was clear,

00:58:46.724 --> 00:58:47.787
so there's clarity,

00:58:47.787 --> 00:58:49.369
and it was also correct.

00:58:49.369 --> 00:58:51.966
And so clarity is more of a,

00:58:51.966 --> 00:58:54.103
the more you practice, the
better you'll understand

00:58:54.103 --> 00:58:56.390
what is clear enough and what is not,

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:58.327
and then in terms of
grammatical correctness,

00:58:58.327 --> 00:58:59.571
it's more about familiarity

00:58:59.571 --> 00:59:02.293
with the standard English conventions

00:59:02.293 --> 00:59:04.604
and paying attention in English class,

00:59:04.604 --> 00:59:06.160
but so knowing those two

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.337
allows me to hone in on
A a little bit quicker.

00:59:09.337 --> 00:59:11.773
And then the last question,

00:59:11.773 --> 00:59:13.440
so mockingly called,

00:59:14.542 --> 00:59:15.487
impeach Lady Bush,

00:59:15.487 --> 00:59:17.524
yet as Barbara Bush aptly noted,

00:59:17.524 --> 00:59:19.557
the First Lady is going to be criticized

00:59:19.557 --> 00:59:21.292
no matter what she does.

00:59:21.292 --> 00:59:24.459
So yet, comma, as Barbara Bush, comma,

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:28.259
aptly noted, the First Lady
is going to be criticized

00:59:28.259 --> 00:59:29.417
no matter what she does.

00:59:29.417 --> 00:59:32.212
Okay, so is there an issue here?

00:59:32.212 --> 00:59:33.906
So yet, comma, looks good.

00:59:33.906 --> 00:59:36.118
As Barbara Bush, comma, aptly noted,

00:59:36.118 --> 00:59:37.795
so I don't think I need the second comma

00:59:37.795 --> 00:59:40.667
because this is all part of
the same prepositional phrase.

00:59:40.667 --> 00:59:42.974
So as Barbara Bush aptly noted,

00:59:42.974 --> 00:59:44.629
so I don't think I need that second one,

00:59:44.629 --> 00:59:46.618
and that should be a fix.

00:59:46.618 --> 00:59:50.103
So yet, comma, as Barbara
Bush aptly noted, comma,

00:59:50.103 --> 00:59:53.522
okay, yup, so that one gets me there.

00:59:53.522 --> 00:59:55.338
So yet as, the comma there,

00:59:55.338 --> 00:59:57.156
that placement is wrong.

00:59:57.156 --> 00:59:59.315
We know that it's not no change,

00:59:59.315 --> 01:00:00.883
and then yet as, well,

01:00:00.883 --> 01:00:02.216
I'm missing a comma here,

01:00:02.216 --> 01:00:03.988
so that one's out.

01:00:03.988 --> 01:00:05.071
And yeah, so,

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:09.259
there we are.

01:00:09.259 --> 01:00:13.426
Now we've gone through a
full writing passage now,

01:00:14.298 --> 01:00:15.854
and I know there was some jumping around

01:00:15.854 --> 01:00:16.834
and some zooming in,

01:00:16.834 --> 01:00:19.621
so if it was a bit harder to follow along,

01:00:19.621 --> 01:00:21.366
apologies for that.

01:00:21.366 --> 01:00:22.806
Hopefully this could give you

01:00:22.806 --> 01:00:24.753
a good example of what it's like

01:00:24.753 --> 01:00:29.239
to work through a full SAT
Writing and Language passage

01:00:29.239 --> 01:00:31.550
and also shows you how important it is

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:35.688
to take the context of the
passage into consideration.

01:00:35.688 --> 01:00:37.837
So that's all for SAT
Writing and Language for now,

01:00:37.837 --> 01:00:39.527
but to just close things out,

01:00:39.527 --> 01:00:42.975
for those of you who are
taking the SAT this Saturday,

01:00:42.975 --> 01:00:44.484
I just wanna share a few final tips.

01:00:44.484 --> 01:00:47.061
So the SAT is in two days,

01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:49.076
so number one, relax.

01:00:49.076 --> 01:00:50.300
Don't try and cram.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:54.625
Don't try and review all 20
pages of your notes beforehand.

01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:56.784
Just do something that
will help you relax,

01:00:56.784 --> 01:00:58.294
and hang out with friends

01:00:58.294 --> 01:00:59.697
or read a book or watch TV.

01:00:59.697 --> 01:01:00.736
Play some video games,

01:01:00.736 --> 01:01:03.266
whatever floats your boat,

01:01:03.266 --> 01:01:05.466
and then the one thing you should do

01:01:05.466 --> 01:01:07.834
before Saturday morning is
to prepare your backpack

01:01:07.834 --> 01:01:09.164
with everything.

01:01:09.164 --> 01:01:11.147
Prepare all of your
materials for test day,

01:01:11.147 --> 01:01:13.058
so that is your number two pencils,

01:01:13.058 --> 01:01:15.403
your photo I.D., your calculator,

01:01:15.403 --> 01:01:17.236
your admission ticket,

01:01:18.252 --> 01:01:20.594
and figure out how you're gonna get there

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:21.603
on the morning of

01:01:21.603 --> 01:01:25.749
so that you're not rushed or
flustered when you wake up.

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:28.388
And the last thing is just
to get a good night's rest.

01:01:28.388 --> 01:01:30.147
Eat well the night before,

01:01:30.147 --> 01:01:31.797
and you know, trust yourself,

01:01:31.797 --> 01:01:32.935
that you've been practicing,

01:01:32.935 --> 01:01:35.292
and you're ready to take the test,

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:37.312
and hopefully you do well,

01:01:37.312 --> 01:01:40.522
but if not, remember, you can
always take the exam again.

01:01:40.522 --> 01:01:42.786
So that is all that I have for you today.

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.203
I hope this was helpful,

01:01:44.203 --> 01:01:45.156
today's class was helpful,

01:01:45.156 --> 01:01:48.253
along with the SAT
Reading and Math classes

01:01:48.253 --> 01:01:50.083
that we hosted before.

01:01:50.083 --> 01:01:51.982
For those of you taking
the test on Saturday,

01:01:51.982 --> 01:01:53.084
best of luck.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.408
For everyone else, keep practicing.

01:01:54.408 --> 01:01:55.395
Keep working hard,

01:01:55.395 --> 01:01:56.879
and good luck to you.

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:57.796
Take care.
