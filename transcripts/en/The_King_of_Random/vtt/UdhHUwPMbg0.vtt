00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.840
Hey guys welcome back to the King of Random cooking show where today were cooking with a fun little chemical called potassium chlorate.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.640
Now's that time of year where these little marshmallow peeps are popping up all around the local grocery store.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.640
So i ran down to pick up a few boxes to see if it would assist us with out chemical experiment today

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.360
Now in addition to these seasonal flavors here, I also picked up some pink bunny rabbits as well as some white Easter eggs

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.020
not that it makes any kind of a difference to the reaction itself

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.020
,but it just adds a little variety

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.220
So what exactly is potassium chlorate? Well let me tell you a little bit about this cool chemical substance I have in my possession today.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.200
As you can see potassium chlorate is a very fine white

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.510
crystalline substance now this stuff's
been reduced down to a very very fine

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960
powder because it's used for
pyrotechnics I got this stuff from a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.469
pyrotechnic supply company because it's
a very strong oxidizer used in

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.399
manufacturing fireworks but it's also
the main component in the match heads

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.149
you have in your boxing matches at home
it's a very reactive material once it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.079
mixed with a fuel but by itself it
actually won't burn instead if we can

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.050
throw enough heat at it we can actually
get it to melt down because it's

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.129
actually got a melting point around 672
degrees Fahrenheit so this is the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.460
purpose of our experiment today let's
melt down our potassium chlorate into a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.880
hot molten bath then take one of our
little marshmallow peeps and let them go

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.680
for a swim and observe what happens it
really looks and feels a lot like

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.100
powdered sugar that should be more than
enough it's a quick update on what I'm

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.590
thinking here guys we're going to get
this stuff up to about 700 degrees

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.040
Fahrenheit and I'd really like the
reaction to take place inside of a glass

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.080
now the problem is glass is sensitive to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.640
thermal shock and if we take a blowtorch to it it will probably shatter into a million pieces.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.000
So what im hoping we could do is liquify the potassium chlorate in the pan first and transfer it slowly

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.759
into the glass where it may have a
little bit better chance of staying

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.329
intact if it does we should be good to
go and if it doesn't we'll just find

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.159
another way I'm using a map gas torch
which produces a very very hot flame so

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.649
I'm just going to sweep that back and
forth over the white powder until it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.100
liquifies and I've never actually
liquidfied potassium chlorate before so

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.659
I'm very interested to see how this
looks

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.759
glasses on for safety let's rock

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.909
there we go
you'd actually already see at the top

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.140
there parts of it are liquifying and
melting down and the edges here are

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.800
spewing looks like they're reacting with
something maybe that's the nonstick

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.209
surface of the pan itself not exactly
sure but doesn't look like it's taking

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.780
too much to melt this down it's
definitely a different reaction than if

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.050
you were to try this with sugar the
sugar would just burn and turn black you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:34.659
can see this is turning into a very
translucent liquid syrup

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.250
it's not sticking anymore that's a good
sign our potassium chloride is

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.920
completely molten now it's not even
sticking to the pot anymore so let's go

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.280
ahead and transfer it to glass my only
concern is whether or not the glass will

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.550
hold up there's a possibility it will
just crack and splatter this stuff

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.450
everywhere
that glass warmed up a little bit very

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.260
carefully make the transfer

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.440
cool holding up so far now that we've
got our potassium chlorate completely

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.890
liquefied let's take one of our fruit
punch flavored peeps and let them go for

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.340
a swim pretty oh this one looks like
he's crying oh don't worry little buddy

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.030
it'll be over soon
that's so wrong isn't it what's going to

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.750
happen three two one

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.590
oh my goodness oh my goodness

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.920
oh there goes a glass that is crazy I
can't believe how quickly that took off

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.909
this looks like instant reaction just
burst right into flames like the second

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.409
it made contact there was barely enough
time to get my hands away guys you got

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.190
to come check this out there is nothing
left of that red peep look it is

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.640
completely disintegrated all that's left
is a little tiny bit of black ash

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.750
residue but other than that it is gone
you can see our potassium chlorate has

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.540
actually solidified again back into this
big white blob look there goes el sweet

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.739
so it looks like this stuff is castable
look at that I just cast it into a cone

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.239
shape that's kind of fun that reaction
took off immediately burst into these

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.289
bright magenta pink flames very very
vigorous and produced a lot of smoke

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.440
that was pretty cool and you can see
from the heat of the reaction the glass

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.220
actually did end up exploding everywhere
which is why I put this plate underneath

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.400
it so we could recapture some of the
potassium chlorate and use it again it's

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.910
expensive stuff you know for our next
experiment I thought it would be fun to

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.210
try one of these decorated marshmallow
Easter eggs so let's recapture some of

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.880
our potassium chlorate melt it down and
let it up

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:07.789
oh there goes the glass look at that egg
glass is done so you get for getting

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.779
your glass at the dollar store okay so
that was kind of expected when I poured

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.569
the potassium chloride into the glass it
sat there for like just a couple of

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.289
seconds and then completely shattered
because it wasn't able to withstand the

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.560
thermal shock we're down to our last
glass here I'm not very confident it's

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.949
going to hold up either let's go ahead
and put it to the test anyway you see

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.590
there are chunks of glass still stuck in
there but those are going to come right

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:36.360
out in solution

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.370
let's see how those glass pieces are
free now freedom and the separate the

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:53.160
night out will the glass survive here we
go alright so far so good let's go ahead

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.220
and throw in our egg I'm going to be a
little bit guts here now that I've got

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.040
the tongs here here we go
and contact

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:10.899
Wow okay I was going to say look
underneath there look at the color of

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:17.379
those flames see how you got like
beautiful magenta pink some orange in

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.849
there so as much as I wanted to do these
experiments in glasses they're not

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:25.119
holding up very well to the heat you can
see that just within a few seconds of

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:30.729
pouring the molten potassium chlorate oh
there goes the plate plate just cracked

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.689
so as much as I want to do this reaction
inside of glass containers they don't

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.049
hold up very well to the heat at all you
can see that within a few seconds of the

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:41.139
liquid making contact with the glass it
shatters and spills out the molten

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.889
material and then it very quickly
solidifies and the reaction stops so for

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.860
our next experiment let's try placing
our peeps down below and melting the

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.519
potassium chlorate from above so it
drips down on the marshmallow and watch

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:54.419
what happens in that scenario

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.069
there and I'm just going to let that
cool down and solidify she give us a

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.759
nice little chunk cuz you gotta enter so
here we are I've got a nice chunk of our

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.550
chlorate melted down and Risa Lydda fide
now we're just going to hold a flame to

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.960
it and drip it down onto our peeps

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:20.349
that's so cool you can see how it balls
up on the top and then just explodes

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:23.379
boom

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.870
this stuff drips off when it hits the
marshmallow it has such a vigorous

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:36.450
reaction it just explodes sweet let's do
that again but a little bit longer

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.290
what we saw in that last experiment was
a lot more stability and control because

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.620
we were able to regulate the flow of
potassium chlorate down onto the peeps

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.740
themselves when the stuff actually hit
the peeps it seemed to ball up into a

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.990
very vigorous reaction and then explode
for one final experiment let's mix up

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.010
one large batch of molten potassium
chlorate in the pan itself and take a

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:03.410
whole peat party and throw the whole lot
in at once

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.100
that's so cool huh

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:18.730
oh look at that guys we have a huge pot
full of molten potassium chlorate let's

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:28.990
get ready for the Big Finish let's do it
Pete Pete Pete we don't want these guys

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.310
to be left out of the party

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:42.120
the smoke coming off that's incredible
whoo and look at those flames

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.840
we've got magenta we've got pink we got
kind of like purplish whitish flames

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.770
going on in there as well and the
reaction just died out does that mean we

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:55.320
used up all of our potassium chlorate
that quickly what or did it just

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:02.460
solidify and look yeah all the potassium
chlorate is gone that's amazing that

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:08.070
burned up so fast
look at that goopy glue a mass of molten

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.580
pipi marshmallows this one's still
growing look at that that looks pretty

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.140
trippy check that out these marshmallows
are still on fire though from the heat

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.190
of the reaction let's stop and take just
a second to recap what we did here today

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.580
we learned about a chemical called
potassium chlorate that's used as an

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.090
oxidizer and building fireworks it's
normally a crystal or a fine white

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.260
powder but if we get a hot enough it'll
completely liquefy we found that if we

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.890
mix this molten potassium chlorate with
peeps it bursts into a very vigorous

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.510
reaction of pink purple and magenta
flames very appropriate for Easter we

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.360
also found that the liquid is so hot
that if we pour it into a glass it'll

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.640
shatter within seconds due to the
thermal shock

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.190
so we tried dripping it onto the piece
from above where we saw the reaction

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.030
caused it to ball up and explode we
finished up our experiments with a whole

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.750
pan full of liquid chlorate and threw in
a whole Easter party it beeps at once

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.280
that reaction took off very vigorously
producing a lot of black smoke and even

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.580
brighter purple pink and even white
flames that we hadn't seen before

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.270
very cool chemical experiments and the
perfect day to do them we also

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.330
discovered that even using all that
potassium chlorate it was still the

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.060
limiting factor in the reaction because
it disappeared before all the

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.270
marshmallows did well there you have it
hey thanks for joining me for this

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.240
experiment guys it's been fun hanging
out with you peeps and I'll be looking

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.480
for you the next video
talk to you that if I was addicted to

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.760
any white substance it probably testing
for a chlorate

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:35.699
you
