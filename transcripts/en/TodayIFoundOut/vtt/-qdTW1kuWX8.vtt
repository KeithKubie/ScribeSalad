00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.590
What Happened to Howard Hughes' Money After
He Died

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.350
Over his lifetime, Howard Hughes’ wallet
became one of the fattest of his time.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.530
It isn’t known exactly how much he was worth
at the time of his death, but ten years before

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
he died, he was forced to sell his shares
in the airline company TWA.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.920
The payout?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.039
$546 million (about $3.8 billion today), estimated
by some to have been about 1/3 of his net

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.039
worth.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.239
When he died, there was one major problem:
Hughes had no direct descendants or immediate

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.630
family, and he didn’t leave behind a will.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.370
At least, that’s what authorities were forced
to conclude after an extensive search for

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.370
one.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.430
After contacting his various banks, lawyers,
and employees, every hotel he’d ever stayed

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.250
in, posting classifieds in various newspapers,
and even consulting a psychic, they were forced

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.350
to accept that settling the massive estate
was not going to be an easy matter.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.850
So just where did all of that money go after
his death?

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.310
Most assumed he wanted the money to go to
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.720
It was well-known that he didn’t want the
money falling into the hands of any distant

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.940
relatives, but without hard evidence, distant
cousins and others began snatching for the

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.940
cash.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.509
A battle ensued between the temporary administrator
of the Hughes estate, cousin and lawyer William

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.310
Lummis, and those who ran the Medical Institute.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.079
It was a multi-state war, with Nevada, California,
and Texas all claiming to be responsible for

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.439
the distribution of the state, and all of
which had their own laws about inheritance.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.590
While the various parties were fighting it
out, a couple of different wills surfaced,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.979
though eventually thrown out as fakes.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.399
A notable one was the three-page document
that declared Melvin Dummar, a gas station

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.380
attendant, was to inherit 1/16 of Hughes’
fortune.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.829
Supposedly, Dummar once picked Hughes up off
the side of the road and gave him a ride to

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.189
his hotel, and Hughes was so grateful that
he left Dummar a huge chunk of money.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.310
In 1978, the will was thrown out as a forgery.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.899
Next, “wives” started emerging from Hughes’
past, taking advantage of his reclusive reputation

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.450
to explain why no one had heard of them before.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.689
Terry Moore, an actress, claimed to have married
Hughes twice, but provided no documentation

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.439
to support her assertions.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.109
She did, in fact, once live with Hughes in
the 1940s, but her claim that they were not

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.580
only married, but never divorced, was called
into question given the fact that she married

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.530
three times after her supposed marriage to
Hughes.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.110
Nevertheless, she must have put forward a
good argument, or at least pestered the estate

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.060
managers so much that they decided to pay
her just to get rid of her, because she was

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.830
paid $400,000 by the estate.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.700
Later, Moore wrote a book titled Beauty and
a Billionaire which made the bestseller list,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.100
likely lining her pockets a bit more.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.410
In addition to supposed wives, an extraordinary
number of Hughes’ supposed children decided

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.420
to acknowledge their deceased father.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.480
One was said to be the lovechild of Hughes
and Amelia Earhart, even though Earhart never

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.720
had any children.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.190
At least two were black, but their claims
were thrown out as Hughes was known to be

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.290
quite the racist.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.210
After years of struggle trying to sort the
people with legitimate claims from the fakers

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.680
who were in it to try to grab some of the
cash, a lot of the money did end up going

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.250
to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.930
However, a huge chunk of it also went to various
Hughes heirs.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.130
According to the Wall Street Journal, around
1000 people have benefited from the estate,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.220
including 200 of Hughes’ distant relatives.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.890
After liquefying many of his assets, they
collectively were awarded over a billion dollars.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.620
Interestingly, the liquidation of the estate
wasn’t completely finalized until 2010—34

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.900
years after his death.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.810
The last piece of the puzzle was the Summerlin
residential development.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.480
In 1996, Rouse Co. (now General Growth) agreed
to buy the Summerlin land from the Hughes’

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.800
estate on a 14-year repayment plan.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.120
With that, finally, the estate of Howard Hughes
was laid to rest.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.110
Bonus Howard Hughes Facts:
• Howard Hughes was born on Christmas Eve

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.290
in 1905 into a family who ran a very successful
oil tool business.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.590
He inherited that business when he turned
eighteen—his parents had died the year before—and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.990
just like that, he was a millionaire.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.150
With his new wealth he decided to fund a few
films rather than manage the family business.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.819
His most popular movie was Hell’s Angels,
the World War I flying epic, which fueled

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.090
Hughes’ interest in aviation.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.920
It cost around $4 million to make (about $54
million today) and also grossing about $8

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.920
million.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.200
It helped catapult Howard Hughes into Hollywood
fame.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.150
His name was even coupled with the likes of
Ginger Rogers, Ava Gardner, and Katherine

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.569
Hepburn.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.100
• Hughes’ true love was flying.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.440
He suffered from partial deafness and complained
of a constant ringing in his ears, but when

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.850
he was in the air, the ringing stopped, or
at least was drowned out by other noises.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.680
Credited with many successful aviation inventions,
he was also well-known for the Spruce Goose,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.840
a wooden sea plane that Hughes worked on tirelessly
until its completion in 1947.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.060
The plane was only flown once, partially because
Hughes began withdrawing from aviation and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.720
from society after being involved in a horrific
plane crash in 1946.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.500
• Hughes lived a fascinating life, but the
end of his life was nearly as interesting,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.810
if a bit peculiar.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.860
He gained a reputation as a recluse, conducting
nearly all of his business from a suite in

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.730
the Desert Hotel, which he owned.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.520
According to the few handlers who managed
things for him, the fabulous Hollywood playboy

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.090
started letting himself go in the last twenty-five
years of his life.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.120
His hair was constantly dirty and his teeth
were rotten, he became addicted to drugs,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.600
and he had an obsession with germs.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:28.290
When he died on April 5, 1976, he weighed
just 92 pounds.
