big part of this so a lot of our games

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970
big part of this so a lot of our games
 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.550

for for either the kid or the parents

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990
for for either the kid or the parents
 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.630
for for either the kid or the parents
and that's why this is a strong point

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640
and that's why this is a strong point
 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.360
and that's why this is a strong point
because I think sometimes we completely

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370
because I think sometimes we completely
 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.100
because I think sometimes we completely
forget about this I mean we're working

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110
forget about this I mean we're working
 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.790
forget about this I mean we're working
with kids so how how should you play how

kids
so sometimes we receive some news like a

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780
so sometimes we receive some news like a
 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.750
so sometimes we receive some news like a
key the expand spends like I don't know

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:36.760
key the expand spends like I don't know
 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.480
key the expand spends like I don't know
five thousand dollars on on an app so

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490
five thousand dollars on on an app so
 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.280
five thousand dollars on on an app so
that's not really good so you have to

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.290
that's not really good so you have to
 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.650
that's not really good so you have to
really balance and again think as a

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:43.660
really balance and again think as a
 

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.140
really balance and again think as a
parent think as a kid and see how you're

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.150
parent think as a kid and see how you're
 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.340
parent think as a kid and see how you're
demonstrating that inside your game so

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.350
demonstrating that inside your game so
 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.740
demonstrating that inside your game so
and I can't I can't go on I mean there's

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750
and I can't I can't go on I mean there's
 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.030
and I can't I can't go on I mean there's
like for instance if you're launching

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.040
like for instance if you're launching
 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.130
like for instance if you're launching
your game on us you have like Coppa

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.140
your game on us you have like Coppa
 

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.250
your game on us you have like Coppa
which is like legal that that has some

how you're separating your games from

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:26.650
how you're separating your games from
 

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.040
how you're separating your games from
what is already launched we in cartoon

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.050
what is already launched we in cartoon
 

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.520
what is already launched we in cartoon
we never simply okay flappy birds is

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:31.530
we never simply okay flappy birds is
 

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.469
we never simply okay flappy birds is
okay doing your amazing let's just

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479
okay doing your amazing let's just
 

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:35.850
okay doing your amazing let's just
create a flappy birds with a cartoon

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:35.860
create a flappy birds with a cartoon
 

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.680
create a flappy birds with a cartoon
character that's not how we play it

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:37.690
character that's not how we play it
 

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.620
character that's not how we play it
that's not how how we sell our games and

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:40.630
that's not how how we sell our games and
 

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.900
that's not how how we sell our games and
that's not how we envision the creation

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:42.910
that's not how we envision the creation
 

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.360
that's not how we envision the creation
of content and game

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:44.370
of content and game
 

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.910
of content and game
so what we we usually do is actually

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920
so what we we usually do is actually
 

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.829
so what we we usually do is actually
thinking about it a little bit more okay

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839
thinking about it a little bit more okay
 

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:50.389
thinking about it a little bit more okay
so flappy birds is something that works

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399
so flappy birds is something that works
 

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:53.090
so flappy birds is something that works
how can we we learn from that what are

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.100
how can we we learn from that what are
 

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.400
how can we we learn from that what are
the things that kids are addicted to how

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:55.410
the things that kids are addicted to how
 

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.069
the things that kids are addicted to how
can we evolve that and add a new thing

00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079
can we evolve that and add a new thing
 

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:00.079
can we evolve that and add a new thing
inside of our game so how can we

00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:00.089
inside of our game so how can we
 

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:01.850
inside of our game so how can we
innovate on something that it was

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860
innovate on something that it was
 

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.949
innovate on something that it was
already launched so this is number three

00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959
already launched so this is number three
 

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:06.079
already launched so this is number three
because it's part of this the Cartoon

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:06.089
because it's part of this the Cartoon
 

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:08.749
because it's part of this the Cartoon
Network DNA which is innovation I mean

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:08.759
Network DNA which is innovation I mean
 

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:11.449
Network DNA which is innovation I mean
if you if you take a little bit from the

00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459
if you if you take a little bit from the
 

00:09:11.459 --> 00:09:13.430
if you if you take a little bit from the
previous talk I mean we were learning

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440
previous talk I mean we were learning
 

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.920
previous talk I mean we were learning
about kids curiosity so this is

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:15.930
about kids curiosity so this is
 

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.300
about kids curiosity so this is
important for us as well which is

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:17.310
important for us as well which is
 

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.509
important for us as well which is
actually bringing some new stuff so that

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519
actually bringing some new stuff so that
 

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:22.910
actually bringing some new stuff so that
the kid can actually have something new

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920
the kid can actually have something new
 

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.519
the kid can actually have something new
to iterate and to learn from so it's not

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:25.529
to iterate and to learn from so it's not
 

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:27.740
to iterate and to learn from so it's not
simply a copy from an hour game so this

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:27.750
simply a copy from an hour game so this
 

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.360
simply a copy from an hour game so this
is this is another thing that is really

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:29.370
is this is another thing that is really
 

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.129
is this is another thing that is really
important and we learn a lot from this

00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:31.139
important and we learn a lot from this
 

00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:33.590
important and we learn a lot from this
is that iteration I mean once you have a

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600
is that iteration I mean once you have a
 

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.680
is that iteration I mean once you have a
game project from the day one show I

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:36.690
game project from the day one show I
 

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.280
game project from the day one show I
don't know day five day 10 day 100 the

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:40.290
don't know day five day 10 day 100 the
 

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.009
don't know day five day 10 day 100 the
game skip keeps on changing I mean you

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:43.019
game skip keeps on changing I mean you
 

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:44.870
game skip keeps on changing I mean you
learn a lot from playtesting so you play

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880
learn a lot from playtesting so you play
 

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.550
learn a lot from playtesting so you play
tasks with a kid and you simply

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560
tasks with a kid and you simply
 

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.870
tasks with a kid and you simply
understand it's something that you

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880
understand it's something that you
 

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.269
understand it's something that you
imagine like oh this is just like a side

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279
imagine like oh this is just like a side
 

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:52.460
imagine like oh this is just like a side
part of the app it suddenly that that's

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:52.470
part of the app it suddenly that that's
 

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.319
part of the app it suddenly that that's
the thing that you need to focus your

00:09:54.319 --> 00:09:54.329
the thing that you need to focus your
 

00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:55.790
the thing that you need to focus your
efforts on because this is the thing

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800
efforts on because this is the thing
 

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.980
efforts on because this is the thing
that it's it's playing the most and kids

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:57.990
that it's it's playing the most and kids
 

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.050
that it's it's playing the most and kids
are enjoying the most so your game

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060
are enjoying the most so your game
 

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.990
are enjoying the most so your game
constantly changed and the project will

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000
constantly changed and the project will
 

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.939
constantly changed and the project will
will never be the same because it keeps

00:10:04.939 --> 00:10:04.949
will never be the same because it keeps
 

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:07.040
will never be the same because it keeps
on evolving and keeps on evolving and

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.050
on evolving and keeps on evolving and
 

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.900
on evolving and keeps on evolving and
changing so this is an example that we

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:11.910
changing so this is an example that we
 

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.999
changing so this is an example that we
do as well this is Adventure Time game

00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:14.009
do as well this is Adventure Time game
 

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:15.499
do as well this is Adventure Time game
wizard this is a game that we released

00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:15.509
wizard this is a game that we released
 

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:19.280
wizard this is a game that we released
in 2013 if I'm not mistaken and this

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.290
in 2013 if I'm not mistaken and this
 

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.129
in 2013 if I'm not mistaken and this
evolved involved innovation in so many

00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:22.139
evolved involved innovation in so many
 

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:24.920
evolved involved innovation in so many
ways I mean it was like a platformer

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:24.930
ways I mean it was like a platformer
 

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.129
ways I mean it was like a platformer
think on a Mario but the big change this

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:28.139
think on a Mario but the big change this
 

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:30.679
think on a Mario but the big change this
game is that you could actually create

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:30.689
game is that you could actually create
 

00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:33.740
game is that you could actually create
your own game on paper so you could draw

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:33.750
your own game on paper so you could draw
 

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.379
your own game on paper so you could draw
your levels and you could scan your

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:36.389
your levels and you could scan your
 

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:37.879
your levels and you could scan your
levels through the cell phone and that

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:37.889
levels through the cell phone and that
 

00:10:37.889 --> 00:10:40.370
levels through the cell phone and that
level would be written by the app and

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.380
level would be written by the app and
 

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.139
level would be written by the app and
you could play the game on on your own

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:42.149
you could play the game on on your own
 

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:44.689
you could play the game on on your own
level and kids could create a vast

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:44.699
level and kids could create a vast
 

00:10:44.699 --> 00:10:46.699
level and kids could create a vast
majority of levels you could play with

00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:46.709
majority of levels you could play with
 

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:48.860
majority of levels you could play with
with other levels created by other kids

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:48.870
