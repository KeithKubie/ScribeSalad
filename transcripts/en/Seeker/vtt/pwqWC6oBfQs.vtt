00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:08.630
Is walking 10,000 steps a day really the ultimate
way to reach good health?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.910
Anthony Carboni here for DNews and about a
year ago I heard that walking 10,000 steps

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.350
a day is better for you than just about anything
else you can do.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.350
Why?

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.740
Well, the average person has such a sedentary
lifestyle- sitting at a desk, in the car,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.640
in front of the TV or computer- that doing
the recommended 30 minutes of moderate physical

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.780
activity recommended by the CDC couldn't possibly
counteract all that lying around.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.370
But why 10,000 steps?

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.460
What's the theory behind it?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.220
What research led to this magical, seemingly
way-too-round and simple a number?

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.220
Well, none.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.220
At first.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.120
In the 1960s, walking clubs were super popular
in Japan.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.850
So popular that everyone wanted pedometers.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.110
Those pedometers were marketed under the name
"manpo-kei," which means "10,000 steps meter,"

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.680
because Japanese doctor Yoshiro Hatano estimated
that should be enough to burn 20% of the calories

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.530
someone takes in.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.530
Good name.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.530
Good estimate.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.530
The concept stuck.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.129
But does walking 10,000 steps a day actually
work?

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.209
Yes- studies done recently show that hitting
the goal can lower your blood pressure and

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:10.560
improve your glucose levels.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.060
An Australian study showed that meeting the
goal actually improved their brain function

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.469
and level of physical fitness by 2 percent-
but so can considerably less, for most people.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.000
The average American takes about 5,100 steps
a day.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.169
The CDC says that upping that to 8,000 can
still give you the health benefits you need-

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:32.590
and is basically equivalent to adding a 30
minute walk onto your day.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.060
Soooo... what if you already work out?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.439
Or jog- even if you get less than 10,000 steps,
running's gotta be equal to walking, right?

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.439
Not really.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.979
Over the last 19 years, obesity in the US
has increased about 57%- and physical activity

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.630
at work and at home has declined at a similar
rate.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.239
We sit around a LOT.

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:55.740
Laci did an entire video here on the channel
about how unhealthy long periods of sitting

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.740
can be.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.889
So if you jog a couple miles and get 4000
steps in, or hit the gym and get 30 minutes

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:05.270
of increased heartrate, but spend the other
23 and a half hours of your day sitting around,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.329
you're not getting the same health benefits
you would by hitting the gym but ALSO making

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.849
sure you hit your goal.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.819
That's not to say stop going to the gym.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.069
It's also not to say jump in now and get 8,000
to 10,000 steps a day RIGHT AWAY.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.879
Adding any level of activity can get you immediate
benefits.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.840
Colorado has one of the lower obesity rates
in the US, and they walk about 6,500 steps

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840
a day.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.129
Tennesee and Arkansas have high obesity rates,
and they walk 4,500 steps a day.

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.500
That 2,000 steps makes a big difference.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.370
So no- 10,000 steps is not a magic number,
and it's not going to get you in shape on

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.370
its own.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.980
But a day full of slow, steady, simple physical
activity like walking can be extremely healthy

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.980
for you.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.980
Have you guys tried this?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.730
How's it working for you?
