[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So here
we are on Main Street.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.290
It's pretty much the
main thoroughfare

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.390
at Google I/O 2017.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.910
I figured let's take a stroll
and see what's going on,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.021
want to come with me?

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:16.520
OK.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.730
Hi, everybody.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.420
Enjoying the festival?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.920
OK.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.220
Good.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.350
So apparently, this is
an AR, augmented reality,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.700
for those paying attention.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.380
Well, I haven't figured out
how to do it just yet, though.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.460
Maybe it's over this way.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.140
Just one of the many
things you could do here

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.430
in between the sessions.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.060
I believe this is
dancing, right?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.080
So let's go over here.

00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:02.400
So one of the coolest
things that I found here

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.230
on Main Street is
the opportunity

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.760
to send a postcard
out to anybody.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.930
I'm choosing to send
it to future Timothy.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.470
Shall we write me a few notes?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.660
OK.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.560
Hi.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.110
I'm going to join you all
here and write a postcard.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.240
Well, who did you write to?

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.200
SPEAKER 1: I'm writing back
home to Georgia, the country,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.289
quite far, so let's see how
long it takes to get there.

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:26.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We'll find out.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.100
I'm sending mine
to future Timothy.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.150
SPEAKER 1: Wow, can I do that?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.112
But not future Timothy,
but future Nina.

00:01:33.112 --> 00:01:33.608
Can I send it to myself?

00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:34.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes,
let's both do it here.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.905
I'm just going to
write mine over here

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:38.567
SPEAKER 1: But I
don't know where

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:39.791
I will be living at the time?

00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:41.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What was that?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.830
SPEAKER 1: I don't know were
you living at that time.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.310
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, if you
send the postcard now, future

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.800
you is any time after now.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.610
So you're good.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.276
SPEAKER 1: OK. so the
address is future.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.335
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:14.280
Let's see, you had a great
time at I/O, smiley face.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.735
Are you still writing
the address there?

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:19.360
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.540
It's pretty long.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.505
I'll get there.

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:26.310
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Are all the
addresses in Georgia long?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.390
SPEAKER 1: No, not really, OK.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.427
So, but you had the yours
written, so that was cheating.

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:33.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.960
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.162
OK.

00:02:35.162 --> 00:02:37.261
Hey.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's OK.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.760
We'll wait.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.560
SPEAKER 1: I have
you are doing well.

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:45.470
Take care.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.570
I'm so nice to myself.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.560
Take care, and good
luck with your startup.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.340
I have a start up.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.090
OK.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.742
Great, so--

00:02:58.742 --> 00:03:00.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I think
we've got to mail them.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.070
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.528
There was more,
more of these guys.

00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:06.200
Next time?

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.039
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.622
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:03:07.622 --> 00:03:08.163
Here it goes.

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:12.807
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Bye.

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:13.682
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:14.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: See you.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.690
SPEAKER 1: See
you in the future.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.608
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.100
All right.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.462
Let's check out what
this wall is all about.

00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:23.637
SPEAKER 2: How's it going?

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:24.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's going well.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.420
How are you?

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.990
SPEAKER 2: I'm great, thanks.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.550
I'm having a great time here.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
a developer festival.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.880
How could you not
have a good time?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.810
SPEAKER 2: I have
no idea honestly.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.601
It's beautiful out.

00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.580
It's an awesome time.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So tell me
what's going on with this wall.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.510
It's more than
just a wall, right?

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.360
SPEAKER 2: It is more
than just the wall.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.190
So this is actually
going to be an AR mural.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.960
So as you can see there's
a lot of little icons

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.001
and things on the screen.

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:42.660
If I actually put
up my tablet here,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.560
you can see that
there's actually

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.920
going be floating overlays.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.010
So this AR, is being generated,
because of these triggers

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.650
within the actual mural itself.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.630
So there's a couple of different
icons and different animations

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.750
here.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.999
So here you can see there's
going to be the Google I/O

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:54.882
icon spinning.

00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:56.340
And so what we've
been doing today,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.985
is just taking little short,
five second GIFs for people,

00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:00.360
and then, being
able to send them

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.840
to them so they have that
kind of a memento of today.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.570
I love it.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.590
SPEAKER 2: Do you
want to do one?

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I do, but can
you send me a gift, not a GIF?

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.310
SPEAKER 2: I don't
know about that.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Whatever.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.626
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:11.598
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.150
There you go.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.816
It's going to generate
a little preview.

00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:26.110
So there you are jumping
around in the background.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.475
What do you think?

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:28.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's very cool.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.690
It's got the heel
click and everything.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.610
SPEAKER 2: Exactly.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.600
Awesome.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thank you so much.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.830
SPEAKER 2: You're very welcome.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.960
Of course.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.330
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.330
Let's go somewhere else.
