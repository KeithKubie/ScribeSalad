00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.570
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hi, everybody.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.380
We are joined today by Chef Daniel Humm and
Will Guidara at Eleven Madison Park in New

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.940
York City.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.519
Daniel is the Executive Chef of Eleven Madison
Park and owner, recent owner, as of 11/11/11,

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.800
which I think is quite fortuitous.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.850
Chef Humm started his career at several of
Switzerland's finest hotels and restaurants,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.310
eventually moving to San Francisco as Executive
Chef of Campton Place, where he garnered attention

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.029
for his innovative interpretation of contemporary
French cuisine.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.530
In 2006, Chef Humm became Executive Chef of
Eleven Madison Park--where he still is--quickly

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.989
transforming the restaurant into one of the
city's top dining restaurants or destinations.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:40.989
And restaurants.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.100
Under his leadership, Eleven Madison Park
received four stars from the New York Times,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.489
one Michelin star, and several James Beard
awards, including the James Beard Award for

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.680
Best Chef in New York City.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.090
And Will Guidara--what's wrong with me?

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.090
Guidara.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.940
I keep trying to say "Will Guidara."

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.129
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: She's trying to make me sound
more Italian than I really am.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.149
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I know.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.920
He said he was gonna pretend to do the entire
interview in Italian and pretend like he didn't

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.970
speak any English 'cause I kept wanting to
call him "Will Guidara."

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.970
Will Guidara--

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.970
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Thank you.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.970
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: is from New York.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.810
He's the General Manager of Eleven Madison
Park.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.420
And since joining Union Square Hospitality
Group in 2001, Will has worked at some of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.640
the group's finest establishments, including
Tabla, where I worked, too, Cafe 2, Terrace

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.090
5, and The Modern at the MoMA, and now as
General Manager of Eleven Madison Park and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.090
co-owner.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.390
Together, Daniel and Will are responsible
for Eleven Madison Park's magnificent art

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.079
deco dining room, which provides an idyllic
backdrop for some seriously delicious and

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.079
artful cuisine.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.799
Please join me in welcoming to Google New
York, Will and Daniel.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.950
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Thank you very much.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.950
[applause]

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.960
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, thank you so much
for coming out of your busy schedule across

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.970
town to join us.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.970
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: No, thank you.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.970
It's really exciting to be here.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.200
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We're very excited to
have you.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.670
So, Chef, can we start with you?

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.759
Tell us how you got interested in cooking.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.910
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: You know, I started cooking
really early when I was 14.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:13.450
And my mom cooked at home and she always bought
her ingredients at the farmer's market and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.900
at farms.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.290
And she made me help in the kitchen.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.130
And but, I only got to do the boring stuff,
like cleaning salads and vegetables.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.060
I never really knew at that point that--.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.760
I didn't like it at that time.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.430
And I never really thought that I would follow
into that direction.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.090
But in school, I had a hard time just sitting
still.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.570
And some of the stuff that we were taught
just didn't interest me.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.620
And during the summers, I was working on farms
and at home, I was helping in the kitchen.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.530
And eventually, I went and worked in a restaurant.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.110
And I just fell in love with it and I left
school and I started cooking.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.599
And I worked my way up.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:16.810
And I knew the pressure was definitely on
because I left school, my dad was not happy,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.460
nobody was happy.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.430
And I knew that this is my only ticket, this
is my only chance I have.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:34.640
And I just worked hard and thankfully, I love
cooking today.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.120
And there has never been a day where I didn't
wanna come to work.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.790
That is, I think, the greatest sign that I
choose the right profession.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.790
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Right.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.790
I feel the same way.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.790
Every day.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.790
Being a lawyer.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.790
It's true.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.790
I know.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.879
Being lawyer is the same.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:55.879
[laughter]

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.549
So, Will, how did you get into the restaurant
business?

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.019
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Similarly, it's what I've
done my entire life.

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.690
And a little bit different for me because
my dad was in the restaurant business as well.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.769
So, we work pretty long hours, so my mom was
the one that didn't want me to go into the

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:12.769
business.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.330
My dad was very supportive of it.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.720
I was a soda jerk at Baskin Robbins in Westchester,
New York, when I was 14.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.900
Which, by the way, for a winter job working
at an ice cream shop is one of the most relaxing

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.900
jobs you could ever have.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.900
[laughter]

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.419
I make a sick mint chocolate chip milkshake,
if you're ever interested.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.130
And then that's essentially all I've ever
done.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.270
I worked at Tribeca Grill as a server when
I was a teenager.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.650
My dad was running Wolfgang Puck's restaurants
in California.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.410
He had moved to California and I was a bus
boy at Spago.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.680
I went to Cornell to the Hotel School there.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.580
And then, after spending some time in Spain
working as a prep cook for a little restaurant

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.650
in the north of Spain, came back and started
working for Danny Meyer.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.650
That's when I was at--.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.650
I say Tabla.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.650
Tabla.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.650
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That's right.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.220
My people say Tabla.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.220
[laughter]

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.660
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: And I was a ma?tre d' there
and worked at a few of his restaurants.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.240
Opened all of the restaurants at the Museum
of Modern Art.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.690
But what I never wanted to do was be in fine
dining.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.979
That was never a part of my plan.

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.889
I always detested the idea of working in these
really stuffy, formal environments.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.090
And fine dining for me was the antithesis
of who I was or what I wanted to represent.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.850
But I loved working for Danny and he asked
me to go work with Daniel as Eleven Madison

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.600
Park was beginning its transformation.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Right.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.630
So, tell us about that.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.169
How did the partnership come to be?

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.720
How did you guys find your way to Eleven Madison?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720
You came through Danny.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Well, yeah.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720
So, it started with him.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.870
I'll let you actually start the story 'cause
he was at Campton Place.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.350
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I was at Campton Place and
I was in the US three years at that time.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.330
And Danny called me and he said he had dinner
at Campton Place and he loved it.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:10.440
And he has this great restaurant in New York
that he wants to just make into a different

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:18.630
restaurant because at that time, it was known
to be a brasserie, and the food was like Cote

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.950
de Boeuf , shellfish platters, French fries.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:32.419
And Danny felt like Eleven Madison Park deserved
to be a greater restaurant, a world class

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:33.419
restaurant.

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:39.500
And at that time, I didn't know who Danny
was and I did some research and I only heard

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.389
very positive things.

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.389
So, I started--.

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.190
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Just Danny for everyone
as a--.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.190
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Danny Meyer.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.190
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Danny, yeah.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.190
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yes.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.190
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Danny Meyer, who--.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.190
Go ahead.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:56.060
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Who owns, you know, who started
Union Square Cafe and then Gramercy Tavern

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.560
and now many restaurants, including Shake
Shack.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.260
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: It's the one that most people
can connect to.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.260
[laughter]

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.479
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Those fries are no joke.

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:14.310
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: And I had a great interview
process with him because for me, as a chef

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.900
coming to New York, it's tough.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:26.110
And when don't get it right, I think in the
beginning, it's very hard to recover from

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.110
it.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.680
So, I really had to make--.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:36.539
Because as a chef, all we have is reputation.

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:42.210
And this is like the thing that you have to
really be careful of, you know?

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:47.919
And it can get damaged and then everything
is down the drain.

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:54.569
And I've been cooking now for over 20 years,
but you really want to protect your reputation.

00:07:54.569 --> 00:08:00.729
And coming to New York, I had to make sure
I'm gonna work for the right guy, it's the

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:04.870
right restaurant, it's the right time, and
so forth.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:14.710
And eventually, I decided to come and not
far into it, we also needed a strong person

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.069
in the dining room.

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:20.889
And then, this is how we met.

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:29.770
Danny felt, and I think because Danny is a
lot about the culture, that is unique and

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:37.190
really powerful and different and he's been
a great mentor in that for me because nobody

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.500
ever has taught me that side of the business.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.740
But he felt that it was important to bring
somebody from within his organization who

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.910
really knows the culture.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:57.110
And we met briefly in meetings before and
I asked.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.570
I said, "What about Will?"

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.570
And--.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.160
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: He pursued me.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160
[laughter]

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.180
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yeah.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.279
And then, it was love at first sight.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:09.440
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: We actually, whenever there

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.480
was a GM there and Daniel and that GM weren't
getting along.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.779
So, whenever it's that kind of thing, you
need to meet and get to know one another in

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:18.779
clandestine ways.

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:23.550
So, we actually had, we met really, fully
for the first time right around the corner

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.550
at Crispo.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.300
Have you guys been to Crispo?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.490
And we gorged on pasta.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.630
And then there's a little Dominican bar like,
three doors down from Crispo.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.360
And we drank plenty of beers there.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.620
And that gets me to where I was, where I didn't
want to be in fine dining, but I wanted to

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.330
grow within Danny's company.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.730
And he was a guy that I had a lot of respect
for.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:52.020
And my dad, who's always played a very significant
role in my evolution, said, "Listen, if this

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.410
is a guy you respect and they ask you to do
something, you should do it.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.430
But put a time limit on it."

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.740
So, when I went to work with Daniel at Eleven
Madison, it was supposed to be for a year.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:08.570
And we'll tell the whole story of the evolution,
but within that year, what I hated about fine

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.500
dining was that it needed to be stuffy.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.890
It needed to be inaccessible.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.970
It needed to be pretentious.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.730
And I found though our youthfulness and through
the friendship that started to develop between

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.550
the two of us, that it didn't actually need
to be that way.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.940
It was just that way because that's how it
had been before.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:34.390
And within that year, we started approaching
the three Michelin star experience with a

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.470
little bit more of a sense of humor.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.149
And we started surrounding ourselves with
people who felt the same way.

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:44.209
And so, at the end of the year, they came
back to me and they said, "All right.

00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:45.209
You've put in your year.

00:10:45.209 --> 00:10:46.209
Thank you.

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:47.209
It's time to move on."

00:10:47.209 --> 00:10:48.209
And I said, "No.

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:49.660
No, this is just starting to feel good."

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.720
And that was in 2007, so we've come a long
way since then.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.660
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, talk to us about that
evolution because I remember going to Eleven

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.279
Madison Park when I first moved to New York.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:04.500
And I think my law firm took us there for
some sort of dinner and it was very different

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.500
back then.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.500
It was before you came on board.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.700
It was much more upright, I guess.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.741
And so, talk to us a little bit about the
evolution that you came to create with your

00:11:12.741 --> 00:11:16.339
food and then how you came to influence that
as well in the front.

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:20.610
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: I think in the beginning,
it's clear.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.420
When you're trying to make a restaurant better,
there's things that you know you need to do.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.250
You need to have less seats.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.510
When we got there, there were 190 seats in
the restaurant and that's just too many to

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.870
do anything that's really world class.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.550
So, we removed seats to get ahead.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.980
We're now at 80 seats.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.380
So, we've removed a ton of seats from the
restaurant.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.149
And then, you need to change the way that
you train your staff.

00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:45.030
You need to get nicer china, nicer glassware,
nicer silverware.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.880
And there's all the obvious things.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.230
But to Daniel's point, the thing that I think
we learned most from Danny, is the importance

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.540
of culture.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.690
And even beyond that, the importance of language
to help define a culture.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.370
We, at Eleven Madison Park, we have 150 people.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.200
And now, with the new restaurant opening,
which we'll talk about soon, we have 500 people

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.550
in our company.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.510
And that's a lot of people to get on the same
page.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:18.860
And I think language is really important to
get people aligned in the spirit of our collective

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.820
endeavor and the philosophy that we're trying
to pursue.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.980
So, the real evolution of Eleven Madison Park
started--and you'll all see a picture of him

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:33.589
if you bought the cookbook--with Miles Davis,
which was our first review.

00:12:33.589 --> 00:12:36.380
We got reviewed for the first time in the
New York Observer in 2006.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.480
And it was a far better review than we deserved
at the time.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.120
We were not anywhere near as good as we wanted
to be.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.400
But at the end of the review, Moira Hobson,
the reviewer at the time, said that she wished

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.820
we had a bit more Miles Davis.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.820
And so we said, "Wow.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.820
That's really cool."

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.620
And then we're like, "I have no idea what
that means."

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.620
[laughter]

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.240
So, we started listening to a bunch of Miles
and started reading a bunch about Miles.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.920
And we came up with a list of 11 words.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:10.779
And within that list were words like collaborative,
fresh, endless reinvention, forward-moving.

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:14.360
And essentially, that list of words, which
hangs in our kitchen now, along with a couple

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.880
pictures of Miles, became our mission statement
and essentially guided all of the decisions

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.720
that we made.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.570
When you listen to Miles' music, or when you
read about Miles Davis, what you find is a

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.500
guy that was instantly successful, right?

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.910
With "Kind of Blue," he released one of the
most seminal jazz albums in the history of

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.200
jazz.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.130
But then, rather than resting on his laurels,
rather than sitting back and enjoying the

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.029
ride, he completely changed his approach to
music.

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:47.329
And then less than, I think it was five or
six years later, he released "Bitches Brew,"

00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:51.430
where he was adding for the first time ever,
electric instrumentation to jazz, which is

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.920
something that anyone who was a purist in
the art form at the time would've certainly

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.949
said was going to fail.

00:13:57.949 --> 00:14:03.990
And it was that approach to his music that
made him what we all know him now to be.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:09.800
And the other thing that he did really, really
effectively was he approached his music very

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800
collaboratively.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.339
When you look at some of the great jazz musicians
over time, most of them came from Miles' band.

00:14:17.339 --> 00:14:22.529
And the reason that they went on to do such
cool things is because it was never just Miles.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:25.529
It was him and his entire band developing
music together.

00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:32.600
So, the evolution of Eleven Madison Park,
I really believe, is due to--of that list

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.010
of words--those two: endless reinvention and
collaborative.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.639
Collaborative, starting with the two of us.

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:44.760
They're in restaurants, and you've seen Hell's
Kitchen or likely some of these shows, there's

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.320
this inherent tension between the people serving
the food and the people cooking it.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.870
He's my best friend.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.140
Definitively, we should hate each other.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.670
We should be yelling at each other throughout
service, but what we effectively realized

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.310
was in order for work to A, be fun, in order
for us to have the capacity to do something

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.130
significant in the dining room, we needed
to be very collaborative in our approach.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.610
It wasn't about the back of house and the
front of house.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.740
It was about a restaurant that included a
kitchen and a dining room.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.029
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You guys are really Bert
and Ernie up here.

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:15.029
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: What's that?

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:16.029
[laughter]

00:15:16.029 --> 00:15:17.029
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's really sweet.

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:18.029
It's like Bert and Ernie.

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:19.029
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Thank you.

00:15:19.029 --> 00:15:20.029
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Like Sesame Street.

00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:21.029
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: That's really sweet.

00:15:21.029 --> 00:15:22.029
This is on the internet, right?

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:23.029
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's true.

00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:24.029
Yeah, it is.

00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:25.029
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: That's good.

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:26.029
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Out there forever.

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:27.029
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Everything, like sensitivity.

00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:28.029
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's a good reference,
influence.

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:29.029
Bert and Ernie.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:31.019
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: It's the sweater that he's
wearing.

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:32.930
And then it--.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.720
[laughter]

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.800
And then, the idea of endless reinvention,
which is the hallmark of what we've done.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.730
In changing so much, we're able to consistently
get people to pay attention to us and identify

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:49.480
or acknowledge how much we're improving over
the years, which is how we went from a two-star

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.529
restaurant to a three-star restaurant to a
four-star restaurant within three years, which

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:54.529
has never been done.

00:15:54.529 --> 00:15:56.540
And I have to correct one of your facts.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.470
This year, we became a three Michelin star
restaurant.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:59.759
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Sorry.

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:00.759
I Googled it.

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:01.759
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: And we became the first--.

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:02.759
[laughter]

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:03.759
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I Binged it, I meant.

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:04.759
Or something like that.

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:05.759
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: You Binged it.

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:06.759
That was the problem.

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:08.180
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That was the problem.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.180
[Will Guidara and Female Presenter laugh]

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:14.269
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: So, I mean, that's really,
at least philosophically, marks how we approached

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:15.509
the last few years.

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:18.440
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, the book finally came
out.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.790
So, tell us about your inspiration for the
book, apart from Miles Davis.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.130
What else fed into--?

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.360
Why was this the right time to bring it out
and all that?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:33.040
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I think for me as a chef, I've
been collecting cookbooks all my life.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:41.740
And it was always a dream to, at some point,
have a book of my own.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:49.910
And the last five years at Eleven Madison
Park have been--.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:58.760
We've been focusing on to get to a certain
goal and we had this vision.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:05.280
And really, it took five years to get there.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:14.939
Since then, our vision has become much greater
and we have new goals, but I think last year,

00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:24.540
we really arrived at a place where we'd been
working so long for five to get there.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:32.770
And so, also from the team, we had many people
who have been with us for the entire five

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.320
years.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:44.650
And for many people, this has been professionally
the most important time in our time, but beyond.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:51.110
Like, so many more people, it has been their
most important time as well.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:18:07.630
And we wanted to mark that with a book because
different to art or architecture or music,

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:15.610
things get recorded, buildings get built,
and paintings get made.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:20.640
And then, they're there forever exactly the
way they're intended to be.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.990
And the restaurants are different.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:31.610
A restaurant experience is really only lives
in your memory and in 30, 40 years, nobody

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.340
will remember and it's gone.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:42.950
And I think a book is a great way for, in
our business, to really mark that time that

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.270
was so special.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:52.700
I think for a lot of the employees and us,
but also for I think a lot of the guests.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.440
And it's really great to have it.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.320
Definitely a dream come true.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.550
And now, it's a new chapter.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.910
Now, we own the restaurant.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.220
I mean, everything happened.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.410
It was a crazy last year, the way it all happened.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.370
I mean, we got three Michelin stars.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.480
We became owners of the restaurant.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.030
And we released a cookbook.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.570
It happened within like, three weeks.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:23.570
Everything.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.750
And they were big goals.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.010
And everything happened.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.010
So--.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.690
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: So, now we're bored.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.690
[laughter]

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.690
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: No.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:33.690
Now, this is--.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:39.960
I mean, this is also, there are recipes for
the food exactly the way we do it at the restaurant,

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.870
or we did do it at the restaurant.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:52.740
And then, there's also the recipes and stories
of how we got to where we are today.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.740
But now, we're excited.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:20:01.830
I mean, in the kitchen I can tell you that
our goal is not to cook anything that's in

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.440
the cookbook ever again.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440
And--.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.170
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That really is a commemorative
issue.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.100
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yeah.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:14.800
It's a special time and now we have to move
forward.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:23.720
And we, in three or four years, there will
be a new book and maybe it's gonna be black

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720
and--.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.909
[laughter]

00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:30.530
Everything will be different.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.669
But that's what's so exciting.

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:36.150
And I think last year was a really special
year.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:42.070
So, we're so fortunate to have it in a book
form and be able to share.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.390
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: The process of making the
book--.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:50.169
However, I think it was a much messier experience
than I think what you see in front of you.

00:20:50.169 --> 00:20:52.770
We had no idea what we were doing in the beginning.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:58.169
And we talk about collaboration and that approach,
and the publisher and the book agents say,

00:20:58.169 --> 00:20:59.169
"All right.

00:20:59.169 --> 00:21:01.580
You need a writer and you need a recipe tester."

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.760
They want you to have this entire team.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.490
And the idea of involving anyone outside the
walls of our restaurant in the production

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.060
of our book seemed completely counter intuitive
to us.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.920
So, we said, "No, no, no.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920
We got this."

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.030
And we had our assistant was going to do all
the recipe testing.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.460
And one of the cooks was gonna like, write
all the recipes.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:26.539
And two weeks later, we were missing all of
our meetings and the whole thing was an absolute

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:27.559
disaster.

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:31.850
And we really had to stop and collect ourselves.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:37.850
And we still did it internally, but that book
is the result of about 20 people working only

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:43.940
on that for an entire year because we wanted
it to be a few things.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.590
We wanted it to be reflective of what the
restaurant is.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.809
We wanted it to work.

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:52.360
Every one of those recipes was tested over
and over and over again.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.590
And in spite of the fact that they're an absolute
reflection of his food, they're actually as

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:01.909
accessible as possible considering the food
that you're making.

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:05.990
And we wanted it to be dynamic and innovative.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:10.290
And we wanted to put a lot of thought into
changing the way that a cookbook can work.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:16.309
We have an email address--I mean, if you're
emailing us right now--in the beginning of

00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:20.030
the book saying, "Hey, email us if you have
a problem with any of these recipes."

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.030
And it was--.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.460
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You're gonna get bombarded
now when this goes on YouTube.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.830
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: cookbook at Eleven Madison
Park dot com.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:31.490
But so, it was a huge, huge endeavor--much
bigger than we ever imagined.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:35.770
I think if we had known how much it would've
taken to make it happen, we would've been

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.600
reticent to start.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.500
But now that we're done, we're really happy
that we did it.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.950
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Do you guys have a favorite
recipe from the book or from that time?

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.330
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: That's a hard question.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.820
I mean, there's so many.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.380
I think there is, we're doing the suckling
pig.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.600
So, the book is organized by seasons.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:09.110
And in each season, there is one ingredient
that we've done four dishes of.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:15.030
And in the springtime, it's the suckling pig,
where we use the shoulder, the belly, the

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.570
rack, and the leg.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.920
And I think these are some of my favorite
pages, spreads, in the cookbook.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.720
And then in the summer, we have tomato four
different ways.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.970
And in the winter, we have game.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.630
And in the winter, we have black truffles.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:41.960
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: For the reasonably ambitious,
but not overly committed home cook, the chicken--I'm

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.610
not a chef.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:47.462
So actually, I cooked out of this book once
because someone bought my girlfriend and I

00:23:47.462 --> 00:23:50.250
a pasta maker and I got it and I was like,
"Yeah, let's make pasta."

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.860
And then I was like, "I have no idea how to
make pasta."

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.860
[laughter]

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.360
So, what you do when you're me is you call
the three-Michelin chef who is on your speed-dial.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.900
And you're like, "Chef, how do I make pasta?"

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.200
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: No, what he did first, he Googled.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.460
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: I did, actually.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.360
And then I was like, "Wait.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.360
Hold on.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.360
I should call Chef."

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.360
[laughter]

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.900
And he's like, "Dude, it's in the book you
just wrote."

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.900
[laughter]

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.529
So, A, if you need a pasta recipe, I can attest
from personal experience, it's a good one.

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:19.700
But the chicken, the roast chicken, the whole
bird in there is unbelievable.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.350
And that's what I've cooked for my friends
now since then.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.990
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, that's the one thing
you can make now?

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.440
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: That's the only thing that
I can--.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.289
That and exceptional macaroni and cheese.

00:24:28.289 --> 00:24:30.070
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That's awesome.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.070
[laughter]

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:36.330
So, given that we all have apartments with
pretty small kitchens, I'm guessing a suckling

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:41.950
pig is not realistic for me personally to
make, apart from roast chicken, what else

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.440
do you recommend that we try in our tiny kitchens?

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:52.690
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: You know, there's also a few
beautiful vegetable dishes like roasted cauliflower

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.480
or a dish with eggplant.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.290
There's some salads in there.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:06.360
And you know also, use the book as using some
of the elements of the book.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:13.750
We have a chapter in the back of the book
with basics, where we have a lot of different

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.049
purees for example.

00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:21.890
And so, if you make one of these purees, you
can also make these purees with more liquid,

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.870
more water or chicken stock.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.890
And you can make it into soup.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:31.140
And I think it's just a really interesting--.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:36.780
If you read the recipes, you're gonna learn
a lot in just your everyday cooking.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.110
Just certain tips and tricks, how we do things
different.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.350
And the dishes don't need to be done--.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:51.299
You know, some of the dishes have 12 recipes
and for the most case, you can make the main

00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:56.809
part, which is the meat or the fish or the
vegetable, and then maybe two other parts.

00:25:56.809 --> 00:25:59.150
And you have a great dish.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:04.650
But we wanted the book to be exactly what
we do at the restaurant.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:09.039
And some recipes are a little crazy when you
really read through them.

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.039
I'm like, "Really?

00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:11.570
Are there that many recipes?"

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.410
And yes, there are.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.980
But you don't need to make them all at home.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.799
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: We had to get really good
on our book tour at defending the accessibility

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:22.320
of the book.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.159
And we found two ways to most effectively
do that.

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:30.260
A, a lot of people challenge whether people
can do sous vide cooking in their home and

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.850
we spent enough time on airplanes to have
combed through every single page of Sky Mall.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:38.840
And so, I actually took the Sky Mall magazine
with me because they now sell sous vide machines

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.929
in Sky Mall, which means it's now the everyman's
approach to cooking.

00:26:42.929 --> 00:26:43.929
[laughter]

00:26:43.929 --> 00:26:48.520
And when we were in LA, this 12-year old kid
came to one of our book signings and he'd

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.059
already cooked through half of the book out
of his bedroom.

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:53.360
So, if he can do it.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.679
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That's a little creepy.

00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:57.500
Pretty precocious 12-year old.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.500
We need to get him at Google.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.500
Maybe there's a job for him.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:04.090
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: We actually invited him to
our restaurant and he spent a week working

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.049
in the kitchen at Eleven Madison Park two
months later.

00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:07.049
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That's amazing.

00:27:07.049 --> 00:27:08.049
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: It was really cool.

00:27:08.049 --> 00:27:09.049
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Unbelievable.

00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:10.049
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I hope you guys videotaped
that or something.

00:27:10.049 --> 00:27:11.049
It sounds amazing.

00:27:11.049 --> 00:27:12.049
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: We got some good pictures.

00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:13.049
But he was so serious.

00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:14.049
It was--.

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:17.000
I like, tried to joke around with him and
he's like, "I'm working, dude."

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
[laughter]

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.310
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: He's like, "Cut it, Ernie."

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.050
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: He's like, "Come on."

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:22.490
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: "I'm very busy."

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.299
Well, if you guys weren't in the food business,
what would you do?

00:27:26.299 --> 00:27:29.450
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I don't know.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.150
I would be probably a professional cyclist.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.150
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Cyclist?

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.150
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yeah.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.070
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: He's a ridiculous athlete.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.200
He ran like, a two hour and 48 minute marathon.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:46.620
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I was, when I was a junior,
I was in the Swiss National Team for Mountain

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:54.870
Biking and I had the opportunity to go be
a professional cyclist.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.100
But then something--.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.559
I also wasn't--.

00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:02.180
I felt like I always got beaten by the same
guys.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:06.429
There were always a few guys that were just
a little better.

00:28:06.429 --> 00:28:08.530
And I hated not to be the best.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.530
And so,--.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:10.630
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: So, you quit.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I quit.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:14.250
[laughter]

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.530
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: That's inspiring.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.150
That's good to say.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.150
[laughter]

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:26.309
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: And I love cooking and so I
cooked and tried to be the best here.

00:28:26.309 --> 00:28:28.659
And I think I'm doing better.

00:28:28.659 --> 00:28:29.659
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Yeah.

00:28:29.659 --> 00:28:30.659
[laughter]

00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:31.810
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: What about you, Will?

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.809
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: When I was a kid, I wanted
to be an astronaut.

00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:39.190
My parents sent me to Space Camp.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.750
And then that wasn't a reality.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:41.750
I'm a musician.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.860
I play the drums.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.470
That was what I did for a really long time.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:50.100
And I always wanted to follow my dad's footsteps
and I also always wanted to be a musician.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.970
And at a certain point, I just decided that
I could be in the restaurant business and

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.659
still play music, but I couldn't do it the
other way around.

00:28:57.659 --> 00:29:00.320
So, probably in the music business.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.950
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, what is the best meal
you guys have ever had, apart from something

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.950
you've made?

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:06.950
Apart from his chicken.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.950
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Thank you.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.950
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It sounds pretty good.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.299
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: That's hard.

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:13.799
I mean, I don't think it's possible to--.

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:17.420
It's like asking you, "What's the best website
that you've ever visited?"

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.420
Or something.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.420
I mean, I think--

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.420
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Google dot com, obviously.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.100
It leads me to the whole interweb.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.100
[laughter]

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.640
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: No, but I think that there's
different restaurants that speak to us in

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640
different ways.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.559
And one of the things that we do in the book,
is we talk a lot about the different places

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:33.360
from which we've garnered inspiration.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:39.169
I think in terms of restaurants that are doing
more or less what we're doing, and I can speak

00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:43.140
on behalf of both of us 'cause we talk about
this a lot, but Alinea in Chicago.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.820
Obviously, Noma is pretty exceptional.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:50.409
COI in San Francisco, Daniel Patterson's restaurant
is unbelievable.

00:29:50.409 --> 00:29:57.730
We had a really great meal at Benu, which
is Corey Lee's new restaurant in San Francisco.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:03.309
But then, there's plenty of restaurants that
you get a lot inspiration from, even places

00:30:03.309 --> 00:30:10.221
like Rella's in uptown where obviously that's
not at all what we look to do, but there's

00:30:10.221 --> 00:30:16.930
things about that experience--the dialogue-driven
approach to order taking.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:22.059
There's these little places all over the world
that do really cool things and if we--.

00:30:22.059 --> 00:30:25.799
Our intention was to take fine dining and
change the way that it was approached a little

00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:26.799
bit.

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:30.970
And so, we needed to look beyond the world
of fine dining in order to be inspired.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:36.100
And so, I think it's hard to say what's the
best, but we're blessed in that we get to

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.750
travel and dine at some pretty cool places.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.000
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, what's next?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.059
You guys mentioned a new project in the horizon.

00:30:43.059 --> 00:30:44.059
Tell us about it.

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:51.310
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Well, for us, this is, today
was actually a big day because 80 percent

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:59.580
of our kitchen staff started for our new restaurant,
which is NoMad, north of Madison Park.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.679
It's on 28th and Broadway.

00:31:03.679 --> 00:31:06.850
Pretty close to Eleven Madison Park.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:12.169
And this is our first restaurant that we are
opening.

00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:15.400
I mean, you've opened restaurants.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:20.679
I've never opened, but it's definitely our
first owned restaurant.

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:23.649
So, we're really focused on that.

00:31:23.649 --> 00:31:28.270
I mean, beyond that, it's hard to say.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:35.100
Right now, we just gotta crush it with the
second one because also, the problem when

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:42.809
you get so much acclaim like we did the last
year, is that now people are gonna be really

00:31:42.809 --> 00:31:43.919
watching.

00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:51.659
And so, we have to really make sure we're
really good right out of the gate.

00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:53.240
And we're really focused on that.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:32:02.940
And as far as the concept of the new restaurant,
it's gonna slightly more casual compared to

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:03.940
Eleven Madison.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:08.700
It's gonna have an a la carte menu, which
is different to Eleven Madison.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:16.990
So, it's gonna be more accessible from price
point, but also more accessible from a time

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.730
commitment point.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.550
But the food and the experience is gonna be
really creative.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.279
We're gonna have an open hearth oven.

00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:29.799
We're gonna bake our own bread for every table.

00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:31.549
We're gonna have a whole roasted chicken.

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:32.549
[laughter]

00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:34.140
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Are you making it?

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.140
You're making it?

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.070
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Sous vide chef waits for no
man.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.640
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: We'll have a lot of dishes
with vegetables.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640
We'll have seafood.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.690
We'll have meats, obviously, but vegetables
will play a big role.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:51.130
But the place is like an urban playground.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:56.910
I don't know if you've been to Hotel Costes
in Paris.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:05.860
And it's a very fashionable hotel and it's
been trendy for the past 15 years, but it's

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.309
a really cool space.

00:33:07.309 --> 00:33:12.880
It's designed by Jacques Garcia, which is
the same designer that we choosed for our

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.400
project.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.940
And it has many different rooms with different
feels.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.179
It has a library.

00:33:19.179 --> 00:33:20.400
It has a bar.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.510
It has a fireplace room.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:23.670
It has an atrium.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.110
It has the room where there is the open hearth
oven.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:33.630
And everything has a different feel, but with
the same food.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:39.230
The food and service at the Costes is not
very good.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.820
And we really wanna change that.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:49.450
We wanna have, who says that if you're more
casual and if you're cooler and there's louder

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:54.720
music, who says that the service can't be
just as good?

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.980
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: The French.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.980
[laughter]

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.980
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: The French.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.980
I thought it was them.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.980
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Just them.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:05.570
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: I think if, at Eleven Madison,
the idea was to take formal dining and make

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.129
it less stuffy and more fun.

00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:11.629
The idea here is to take more casual dining
and make it more composed.

00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:14.079
So, it is a la carte.

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:17.070
The food is his food, just not plated with
tweezers.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:22.579
The service is our service, but if there's
50 steps of service at Eleven Madison, there's

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:25.399
20 steps of service at NoMad.

00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:28.730
And music is a big part of it for us as well.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:33.690
I think at Eleven Madison, music is only there
so that people don't feel a compulsion to

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.580
whisper when there's only a few tables in
the dining room.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.610
But then, when the dining room is full at
Eleven Madison, you can't even hear the music

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:41.610
anymore.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.470
At NoMad, we want people to hear the music.

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:47.240
We want that to actually be another ingredient
in the experience.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:54.179
And that's been really fun for us to put that
together and looking at everyone from Etta

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:55.990
James to Johnny Cash--

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:57.820
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Miles Davis, I hope.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.140
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: no, to the Rolling Stones.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.140
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: No, Miles Davis?

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.420
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: No, Miles Davis is Eleven
Madison Park.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.420
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Oh, interesting.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:07.710
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Actually, the musical inspiration
for the NoMad are the Rolling Stones because

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:13.240
the Rolling Stones, if anyone here has read
Keith Richards' book, which is a pretty cool

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.780
book to read, you know this.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.880
Or also, just by reading everything else that's
been written about them, the Rolling Stones

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.580
come off as crazy, loud, totally chaotic,
unplanned.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:28.849
But if you learn their story, they're one
of the most deliberate, intentional, contemplative

00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:30.350
bands ever.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.950
When they were in the UK, just developing
their music, they'd buy every single blues

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:38.500
album that would come out of America, learn
every song note from note, break them down,

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.090
study them, why was it done this way?

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:46.080
And Eleven Madison, or excuse me, The NoMad,
should be the louder, looser version of Eleven

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.380
Madison Park--the music turned up, our hair
let down a little bit.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.150
But where every single thing is intentional
and nothing is on accident.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.359
And we're really excited for it.

00:35:55.359 --> 00:35:56.630
I think it's gonna be a really fun restaurant.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.000
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It sounds amazing.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
When does it open?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
When can we look forward to going?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.070
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: End of March.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.200
So we're in it right now.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.200
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.020
Thanks for stopping and taking the time out
when you're very busy.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.020
OK.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.980
We'll do a couple of fill-in-the-blanks because
this is what I do now--this has become my

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.220
thing--before we turn it over to Q and A.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.220
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yeah.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.220
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: OK.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.210
So, you guys just finish the sentence, whatever
comes to mind.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.210
No pressure.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.210
Good?

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:23.210
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Oui.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.210
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Good?

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.210
Oui?

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.210
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Oui, Chef.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:27.210
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Now you've turned to French?

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.210
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Yeah.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.210
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: On from Italian to French.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:30.210
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: That's how we communicate
in the kitchen.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.210
Oui, Chef.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.210
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Oui.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:33.210
French food is--.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.210
[laughter]

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:35.210
Will Guidara: Delicious.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.210
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Delicious.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.210
[laughter]

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.980
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You're gonna give the
same answer for everything?

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:41.980
[laughter]

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.980
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: We're alike.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:49.420
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: French food is the basic of
what we do.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.619
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And delicious for you.

00:36:52.619 --> 00:36:53.619
Good.

00:36:53.619 --> 00:36:54.619
Danny Meyer is--.

00:36:54.619 --> 00:37:01.710
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Is an incredible guy and was
my mentor for the first ten years of my career.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:11.920
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: As well, Danny is a mentor
and is the first person who made me look at

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.470
running restaurants in a different way.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.490
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Junk food is--.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.609
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: What I eat almost all the
time.

00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:20.609
[laughter]

00:37:20.609 --> 00:37:25.190
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: What I have to eat when I travel
sometimes.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.330
When I'm with him.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.330
[laughter]

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:34.280
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: I introduced Chef to every
chain restaurant that a person like him should

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.700
never go to.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.700
[laughter]

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.720
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: But maybe that'll be your
next concept--improving that.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.060
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: I wish I had invented In-N-Out
Burger.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.690
I think that's one of the best things that
has ever been created.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:48.570
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You were saying that to
Danny Meyer with the Shake Shack?

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:49.570
[laughter]

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.770
Just trying to get you in trouble.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.070
OK, food bloggers are--.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.579
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: The best people in the world.

00:37:56.579 --> 00:37:57.579
[laughter]

00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:59.870
Where's the camera?

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:07.230
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: No, for me--

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:10.600
[laughter]

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:19.369
for me actually, when it first really started,
when the first bloggers really started having

00:38:19.369 --> 00:38:24.220
some sort of impact on our business, I was
a little frustrated.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:34.220
But now today, I'm happy because I think in
Europe, growing up, there was only Michelin.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.220
And that was it.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:43.130
And if you go up or down, that could be your
business.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:47.910
If you lose a star, it could be over.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:59.520
And now today, there's so many avenues and
so many publications and bloggers and so many

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.210
informations and I think it's great.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:12.940
I think it's great because it makes each of
them less powerful and there are a lot of

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.100
opinions out there.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.150
And it's fair to listen to everyone's opinion.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:23.380
I think it also, we do pay attention to what
people write about us.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:29.760
And we evaluate everything and we have gotten
better through it.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.910
There's some good information.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:36.790
There's some not so good, but it keeps us
on our toes and it makes us better.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:38.859
So, I'm happy that they're there.

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:43.050
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: I think if you're in this
industry, you made a choice to go into a field

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.030
where you will always be criticized.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:49.100
And I think it's actually funny that people
get upset when they're criticized because

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.960
that's just the nature of what we do.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:57.359
And I also, listen, the only reason you guys
are doing this sort of thing is because that

00:39:57.359 --> 00:39:59.240
world was proliferated, right?

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:04.119
I mean, the success of restaurants has been
helped in a very significant way because so

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:06.170
many people are so passionate about it.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:09.990
We, for example, have no problem with people
taking pictures in our dining room.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:13.230
We ask that people don't use a flash, but
it's honoring.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:18.319
And I don't understand restaurants or chefs
that are so anti that sort of thing because

00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:23.440
bloggers are, at their core, in paying attention
to something and writing about it, you're

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440
honoring it.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440
And--

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.440
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yeah.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.650
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: sometimes it's frustrating,
but we do pretty well, so--.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.770
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So for now it's fun?

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:32.770
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Yeah.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.410
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: A food trend I like is--.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:40.880
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Going more sustainable.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.060
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: OK.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.550
You can take a food trend I hate is--.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:55.260
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: People that take too much
credit for going more sustainable.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.260
[laughter]

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:01.420
No, in seriousness, I hate these restaurants
where you go and you look at the menu and

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.810
they talk about all these random farms with
all the ingredients when I guarantee you they

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:10.060
don't even know what those farms look like
and what does that say for the other 70 percent

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.079
of the ingredients that they didn't put a
farm on?

00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:16.099
It's like, we got all this at C-Town and we
got these three things at a farm.

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:17.099
[laughter]

00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:22.740
I feel like a lot of people are taking it
too far and not doing it in as holistic a

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.329
way as they should be.

00:41:24.329 --> 00:41:26.520
We never write the names of the farm.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.849
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: 'Cause everything's from
C-Town.

00:41:27.849 --> 00:41:29.369
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Yes.

00:41:29.369 --> 00:41:30.369
[laughter]

00:41:30.369 --> 00:41:32.280
Because people, it's all great.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.280
And I think people--.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.710
It's a little bit contrived sometimes.

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:38.020
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Food trucks are--.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:45.390
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: I don't go to food trucks.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:46.560
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yeah, I don't either.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.350
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I believe him.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.050
I don't know if I believe you.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.770
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: No, I would.

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.210
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I think food trucks are overrated.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.329
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And you don't go to them.

00:41:57.329 --> 00:41:58.890
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: They're everywhere.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.920
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Reality chef competitions
are--.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.400
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: No good.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.400
[laughter]

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:10.210
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Are you gonna do one?

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:12.610
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Am I gonna fill in the blank?

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.610
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:14.610
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Do I have a choice?

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:17.070
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You don't have to if you're
feeling pressure.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:22.260
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: No, I actually would honestly
answer in the same way that I answered ultimately

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.630
about bloggers.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.800
I think that they're not so good.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.590
They don't represent restaurants in the best
way.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:31.380
But they help generate a lot of buzz for what
we do.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:38.079
And as long as you can hold yourself above
that fray, I think it's been good for our

00:42:38.079 --> 00:42:39.079
industry.

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:40.079
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Great.

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:41.079
Well, thank you guys.

00:42:41.079 --> 00:42:43.170
We're gonna turn it over to Q and A from the
audience.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:47.630
And if you guys can come up to the mics to
ask your questions, that would be great.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.630
Thanks.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:49.630
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Hi.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.590
I absolutely love your granola.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:56.150
And I wish I could go to the restaurant every
week, but I unfortunately don't have that

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.150
luxury.

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.250
Is there any way that I could get your granola
in any other way?

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.550
Do you sell it by the case?

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:04.420
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: The recipe is in the cookbook.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:05.420
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Oh, OK.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.599
I don't trust my cooking skills, however.

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:12.930
So, is there any other way I could get a can
of, a tin of granola?

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:20.619
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: In addition to the other restaurant,
we are in the process of setting up a company

00:43:20.619 --> 00:43:21.710
to sell the granola.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.339
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Oh, nice.

00:43:23.339 --> 00:43:27.890
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: But we're a little busy right
now, so it's gonna take a few months.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:31.440
In the interim, if you come to the restaurant
and say that you were at the Google Talk,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.440
we'll give you a jar or two of granola.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.440
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Thank you.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.440
I'm so excited.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.440
There's going to be a hundred people there.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.610
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You're gonna so regret
putting that on.

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:40.490
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: No, it's a manageable enough
group.

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:41.710
I think we can deal with that.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:42.710
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: All right.

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:43.710
Make them show ID.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:44.710
There's a lot of people on YouTube.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:45.710
Yeah.

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:52.599
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: When I go to Eleven Madison Park,
what's really nice is you have this quality

00:43:52.599 --> 00:43:56.350
all over the place--in the food, in the presentation,
and in the staff.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:01.130
And what I find impressive is that you are
actually able to maintain on all levels.

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:02.890
So, how do you do it?

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:12.600
How do you like, if 150 people managed to
get high-quality experience, maintain the

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.720
consistent?

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:18.060
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: My dad, when I was a kid,
gave me this quote.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.260
I think it was by Calvin Coolidge.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:24.569
It was this long quote, but the last line
was "persistence and determination alone are

00:44:24.569 --> 00:44:26.099
omnipotent."

00:44:26.099 --> 00:44:33.090
And I think that what we do is something that
requires just being on every single day.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.900
And it's a human organization and it's a team
sport, right?

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:40.050
And you're only as the weakest person on your
team.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.140
So, I think that we hire really good people.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.140
Oftentimes, they bring zero experience.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.940
Most of the people on our team have never
worked in a restaurant before.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.010
But it's our belief that what we do isn't
rocket science.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:56.960
You can teach that, but you need to surround
yourself with really good people.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:02.710
And then, being there every single day to
teach and to motivate and to work with people.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:08.240
And that's why when he says, "I've never gone
to work and not loved it," I don't think you

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.640
can be successful in our business without
just loving it.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:18.680
Otherwise, it would become really, really
exhausting that it's just day in, day out,

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.120
day in, day out.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.840
In his talk today, with all the new cooks,
he was talking about how to be an exceptional

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.200
chef, you really need to value and love repetition.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.460
And not get bored by repetition, but actually
look at it as an incredibly noble thing.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.860
Always looking to just do something a little
bit better than you did it the day before.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:42.381
And I think that that applies to the philosophy
that we ask our entire staff to have, but

00:45:42.381 --> 00:45:46.940
it also applies to the way in which we need
to manage them and manage the restaurant.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.940
[pause]

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:48.940
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.940
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Hi.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.510
So, thanks for coming.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:57.390
I actually had the pleasure of dining at Eleven
Madison Park, both for lunch and dinner.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:02.160
But I do have an accessibility question because
I did see you on Martha Stewart about two

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.160
years ago.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.160
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yeah.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.130
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: You made this roasted chicken
dish.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:12.530
It was so appealing on the show and it was
a roasted chicken, but you had infused it

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.300
with crumbs and butter.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.140
And so then I got inspired that weekend to
actually make it.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:22.430
And living in New York, the accessibility
of ingredients is not an issue, right?

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:27.150
So, I had confidence I could probably get
together any of the ingredients in your cookbook.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:32.770
But when I actually made it, it did turn out
delicious, but it kind of got into this like,

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.440
buttery, sappy, soggy mess.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440
And so--.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.160
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Maybe do it better next time.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.230
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Well, true.

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:42.230
[laughter]

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:48.170
But it is one of those home cooking things
where I'm trying to be you and then it's like,

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:49.170
impossible.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:53.200
So, it was still very flavorful and tasty,
but it really turned into this equivalent

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.200
of like, fried chicken.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.460
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Did you chill it before you
baked it after you filled it?

00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.460
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: The chicken?

00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.460
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yeah.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.090
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: It was a chilled chicken, but
like--.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.720
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: No, after you put in the filling.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Oh, you have to chill it?

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:05.930
[laughter]

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:06.930
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Did you put it back in the--?

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:07.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: No.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:08.930
No.

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:09.930
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: That's why.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:10.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: That's why.

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:11.930
OK.

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:12.930
All right.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.970
I didn't have a specific question about that
particular recipe, but that's my general question

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:20.640
of like, how do we be a little bit more of
a--.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:27.869
I mean, obviously, you're such a trained chef
and then also have that creative mind to just

00:47:27.869 --> 00:47:29.470
have that technique that would--.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:35.690
I can't even possibly conceive of having the
level of technique in cooking as a home cook.

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:40.320
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: I think it's our belief, and
this goes back to the entire philosophy of

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:46.099
this book, that to be accessible does not
mean you don't also have to be precise.

00:47:46.099 --> 00:47:51.000
I think the cooking, and joking aside when
he says you have to chill it, the food is

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.090
as good as it is because everything is done
in a very specific way.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:59.870
It's not necessarily so difficult and maybe
the recipe through Martha Stewart wasn't tracked

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:02.089
perfectly, but you can't skip a step.

00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:03.089
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Oh.

00:48:03.089 --> 00:48:06.849
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: And I think it's the philosophy
behind everything that we do.

00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:10.050
Something doesn't need to be super, out of
control difficult.

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:11.390
It just needs to be perfect.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:12.390
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: And precise.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.210
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: And every single step is important.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:20.059
And when you talk about how do you get the
restaurant to where it is, it's bestowing

00:48:20.059 --> 00:48:22.640
that philosophy on our staff every single
day.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.980
There's no such thing as a shortcut.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.790
I'm not presuming that--.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:29.319
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: No, that's actually very helpful.

00:48:29.319 --> 00:48:30.319
Thanks.

00:48:30.319 --> 00:48:31.319
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: Hello.

00:48:31.319 --> 00:48:32.319
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Hi.

00:48:32.319 --> 00:48:35.099
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: So, I have a two-part question.

00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:39.460
First, is how can I get an invitation to the
soft opening for the new restaurant?

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:43.079
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Everybody at Google, just
show up.

00:48:43.079 --> 00:48:44.890
Say you work there.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:45.890
Joking.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:51.920
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: And then, once I'm there, what
would you be most excited for me to try?

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.900
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I think there's been so much
talk about chicken, so--.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:57.900
[laughter]

00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.970
I think you gotta try the chicken.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.849
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: It's pretty cool.

00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:02.849
Garrett Oliver.

00:49:02.849 --> 00:49:04.250
Do you know who that is?

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:05.530
He runs Brooklyn Brewery.

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:10.470
We're actually doing a project with him where
he's brewing a beer called La Poule, which

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:14.430
is a beer that was made specifically to drink
with that dish.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:17.630
And we're really enjoying that process with
him.

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:22.970
But I think for me, when he talked about the
vegetables that are gonna be at NoMad--we

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:27.059
just did a couple tastings the past week--and
the vegetable-focused dishes--.

00:49:27.059 --> 00:49:29.670
When we say vegetable, we're not saying vegetarian.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:36.160
We're just saying dishes that have a focus
on vegetables, are just unbelievable.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.170
I can say that 'cause I had nothing to do
with their preparation, but they're really,

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.170
really good.

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:41.340
I would try those as well.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.350
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: Great.

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:43.350
Thanks.

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:46.500
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Thank you for letting us get
away with not answering the first part.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.500
[laughter]

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.829
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Thanks again for coming and for
the great book.

00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:52.839
I was curious about the ingredients.

00:49:52.839 --> 00:49:56.350
How easy is it to get some of the ingredients
that you work with?

00:49:56.350 --> 00:50:04.190
I saw this segment on 60 Minutes about truffles
that makes it harder for you to find the real

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:08.569
truffles from Paris or Italy because of this
black market in China.

00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:13.400
Is that the case for you or how about some
of the other ingredients, too?

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:18.780
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I mean, are you speaking for
us in the restaurant or are you speaking for

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:19.780
a home cook?

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.430
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: For you in the restaurant.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:30.180
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I think things are definitely
changing a little bit in the world, especially

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:40.960
with like wild fish from the Atlantic, like
wild turbot or wild John Dory and wild loup

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.119
de mer, and they're much more rare.

00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:52.930
And the price is really now what sometimes
keeps us from really still getting it.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:51:02.380
And because certain things become so expensive
that you would never able to charge that much

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:03.559
to the diners.

00:51:03.559 --> 00:51:09.060
As far as truffles, also why I think there's
less and less truffles each year.

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:12.849
I've heard that in 30 years, there will be
no more truffles.

00:51:12.849 --> 00:51:23.360
I don't know if that's true, but my belief
is that a high-quality ingredients, you don't

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.500
always need to go for this luxurious ingredient.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:35.390
For me like, a high-quality carrot is a luxurious
ingredient.

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:43.970
And we live close to the black dirt region,
which is in the Hudson Valley, in the foot

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.980
of the Hudson Valley.

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:52.570
And the black dirt region is one of the best
regions for growing root vegetables in the

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:53.740
world.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:57.020
And so, I think we just need to rethink a
little bit.

00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:05.850
We need to look close and we can make, and
that's why we are using carrots or cauliflower

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:13.339
or celery as the main ingredient on a dish
because we believe that that is a luxury,

00:52:13.339 --> 00:52:23.599
too, because they're grown in the best way
and it's some sort of an heirloom variety.

00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:30.430
So, the food is definitely changing a little
bit based on what you've seen on 60 Minutes.

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:32.630
And there's definitely some truth to that.

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:33.630
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Thanks.

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.250
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Do we have time for two
more?

00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:37.250
Are we good?

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:38.250
Yeah?

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:39.260
We can do two more.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.680
We'll just take these last two questions.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.780
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: Mine's quick, I swear.

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.579
So, I've had the luxury of going to Eleven
Madison Park a couple of times.

00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:49.280
It's been really amazing every time.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.280
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Yeah.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.440
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: So, my compliments to you.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.440
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Thank you.

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.280
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: But I have this separate question
from something that I was a little hung up

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.280
on.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:02.069
Being a native West Chesterite, I have to
ask which Baskin Robbins you worked in.

00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:03.069
[laughter]

00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:04.510
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: In Tarrytown.

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:05.910
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: Not mine.

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:09.540
I was hoping you would be the one in Rye,
because you probably would've been giving

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.020
me ice cream time I went to Hebrew School.

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.900
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: My friend Jerry Mack's mom
owned the Baskin Robbins, which was why I

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:22.680
was able to get a job and why I didn't lose
it every time I messed up writing on the cakes

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.069
when you had to write "Happy Birthday."

00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:26.140
I still freak out at the idea of having to
do that.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.140
[laughter]

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.140
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: Did you make the clown cones
also?

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.140
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Yes, I did.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.140
I was very good at it.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.140
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: Very impressive.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.140
Thanks.

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:33.140
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Thank you.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.480
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: Hi.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:40.520
I've had the pleasure of being immersed in
the New York City food, wine, and restaurant

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.270
world through a rather diverse background.

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:45.690
And in that, I've met Davis Anderson, your
newest Sommelier.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:46.690
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Oh, yeah.

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:50.180
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: And so, first I just wanted to
say he's already had the pleasure of meeting

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.530
Chef and he said very good things.

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:53.530
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Cool.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:58.970
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: My question is around collaboration
and creativity as you have talked about the

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.470
culture of Eleven Madison Park.

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:03.410
What is the process involving the menu?

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:06.710
Does it involve everyone in the back of house?

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.900
Do you have a conversation with the front
of house?

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:10.599
Is it a weekly meeting?

00:54:10.599 --> 00:54:11.890
How often does it change?

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:21.710
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: I think the menu changes every
week and not fully, but a couple dishes.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:30.140
And the way we do it, we have a meeting every
month that just talks about what dishes we

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.559
gonna change.

00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:36.530
And it's a core group of four people.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:40.970
It's just the people who have been with me
the longest who have creative input.

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:48.900
And then, we're throwing out some ingredients,
some ideas everyone has.

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:52.451
And then, we're reviewing it and we start
working on it.

00:54:52.451 --> 00:54:57.839
And then, each of the sous chefs is gonna
work with the team on it, so we get also influence

00:54:57.839 --> 00:54:59.069
from the team.

00:54:59.069 --> 00:55:06.210
And then every week, we get together and we
see the results of where we went.

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:07.859
And this is the process.

00:55:07.859 --> 00:55:16.000
And sometimes, in the first try, a dish turns
out to be incredible and sometimes, after

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.780
five tries, it's still not working and we
need to scratch the whole idea.

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:27.630
It's never, I wish there would be a very clear
formula how it works.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:35.970
I mean, we have a way of how the process works,
but some ideas work and some don't.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:43.410
And it's important that you have ideas that
some of them that don't work because that

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:48.250
means you're really searching hard enough
and you're really trying to be creative.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:57.980
And sometimes, you go down a path for like,
five weeks and you learn a lot in that process.

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:02.809
And maybe five weeks later, it's like, "Now
the dish is just, now it's just about the

00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:06.530
technique and it doesn't taste good anymore."

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:11.650
But maybe six months later it could be like,
"Oh, you remember when we did that and it

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:12.650
didn't work?

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:13.910
But now maybe it could work."

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:18.950
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: And by not work, it comes back
with the plate full or not fully cleaned off?

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:19.950
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: No.

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.010
It would never be served.

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:28.140
For me, the most important thing is that a
dish has to be really delicious.

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.809
And I think I'm a pretty good judge of that.

00:56:31.809 --> 00:56:38.860
Even as a chef, you have to, yeah, you wanna
show your technique or you wanna show what

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:43.990
you can do, but in the end of the day, it
has to be delicious.

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:50.960
And even if it's like super creative and super
inventive, if it doesn't taste good, forget

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.960
it.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:57.250
And I think I'm a pretty good judge of knowing
when it's just about the technique or when

00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.760
it's actually tastes good.

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.280
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: Thanks.

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.300
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Thank you.

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.790
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Well, thank you both so
much for being here.

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:03.790
It's been fun.

00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:04.790
&gt;&gt;Will Guidara: Thank you.

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:05.790
&gt;&gt;Daniel Humm: Thank you.

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:05.791
[applause]
