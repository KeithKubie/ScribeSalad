00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.389
It's a little daunting because it has fractions, but then when we work through it step-by-step

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.589
Hopefully, it'll feel a little bit more intuitive so it says Calvin cleans

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.670
three-fifths of his bathroom with one third of a bottle of cleaning solution at this rate

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.799
What fraction of the bottle of cleaning Solution will Calvin used to clean his entire bathroom?

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.149
And like always encourage you to pause the video and try to take a stab at this yourself

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.160
So as [I] mentioned it's a little bit

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.700
You know it's a three-fifths of his bathroom with one third of a bottle

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.750
How do we [think] about this and what my brain does is I'd like to say well

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:44.069
How would we like to answer the question what fraction of the bottle of cleaning solution will Calvin used to clean his entire bathroom?

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.800
So we want to figure out is we want to figure out how many bottles so??

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.300
bottles

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.039
bottles

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.039
Per let me write it this way

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.198
So we want to figure out he uses a certain number up with that?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.180
bottles

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.180
bottles per

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.419
Bathroom if we knew this then we have the answer to the question if this would this might be I don't know [two-fifths]

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.350
Bottles two-fifths of a bottle bathroom it might be two

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.790
Bottles per bathroom, but if we know whatever this? Is and we know the answer

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.950
How many bottles doesn't need to take to clean a bathroom or what fraction of a bottle?

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.829
We don't know that they're hinting that it's a fraction of a bottle

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.559
but how much of a bottle or how many bottles per bathroom or another way to think about this if we want to know if

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.780
We wanted to express it as a as a rate more mathematically. We could say?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.670
bottles

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.909
bottles per bathroom

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.689
Bathroom and the Reason why this is helpful

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.529
It makes it clear that look we want to figure out we want to take our

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.839
Units tell us that we want to divide the number of bottles or the fraction of a bottle it takes?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.769
To clean the number of bathrooms or certain fraction of the bathrooms and they tell us over here they tell us that

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.129
It he's able to take one third of a bottle

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.899
He's able to take one third of a bottle so I could write it here 13

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020
of a bottle to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.670
clean to clean

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120
three-fifths of a bathroom

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.490
three-fifths of a bathroom

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.070
three-fifths of a bathroom

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.540
So hopefully it's clear now. Why this was helpful? We say okay?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.929
We want to take how many bottles it takes to clean a certain number of bathrooms one third of a bottle take can clean?

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.950
three-fifths of a bathroom and makes it clear that we need to take the one-third and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.020
Divide it by three-fifths because then we're going to get bottles per bathroom. We're going to get the rate

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.040
We're not going to get bathrooms per bottle we're going to get bottles per bathroom

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.889
Which is what we care about what fraction of the bottle well?

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.149
It will it take to clean entire bathroom to clean one entire bathroom?

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.169
So now we just have to take one-third and divide it by three-fifths

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.570
So this is going to be equal to this is going to be equal to you can write it this way

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.750
13

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.760
three-fifths

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.359
Divided by three fifths and the units are going to be bottles per bathroom. I'll write it like that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.450
Bottles or since if we know that that's going to be a fraction. We could just say rate bottle bathroom bottle

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.079
Bathroom and so this is going to be the same thing as well

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.020
we're going to have one third divided by three fifths is the same thing as

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.510
One-Third times the reciprocal of three fifths so one-third times five thirds

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.860
one-Third times five thirds

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.890
Bottle bathroom, so let me write that down bottle

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.010
bathroom

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.700
Bottle bathroom and what is this going to be well?

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.819
We multiply the numerators 1 times 5 is going to give us 5 and the denominator three times three is nights?

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.499
There's going to be five ninths of a bottle of a bottle

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.290
bathroom

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.059
Bathroom I wrote these a little bit further apart than I would want to let me write that a little bit closer together

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.960
59 59 of a bottle

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.130
bathroom

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.639
So just as a reminder of what we did here

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.440
It could see him a little bit daunting

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.809
But we said okay look he we want how much I'm what fraction of the bottle to clean his entire bathroom

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.500
So we care about bottles per bathroom or since we're talking about a fraction

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.079
I guess we could just say bottle some fraction of a bottle per bathroom so it's bottle

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.079
Bathrooms that's going to give us the correct rate

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.209
So it took one third of a bottle to clean

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.570
Three-fifths of a bathroom so you divide one third by three-fifths?

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.879
You get five ninths of a bottle per bathroom, so this? Right over here that is

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.230
59 it takes five ninths of a bottle of cleaning solution to clean his entire bathroom
