1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:00.670
Yeah.

2
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.140
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.</v>

3
00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:06.280
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday match 25th,

4
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.680
2019.
What's going on?
How are you?
Um,

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.010
I'm going to fucking great mood this Monday.
121 days.

6
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:20.700
No fucking booze.
On Wednesday,

7
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.750
I'll be a third through the year already.
33 fucking present.

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.790
33.5,
whatever the fuck you need.
33.3,
three,
three,
three,
three,
three,
repeating,

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.130
uh,
through the year.
Just like that.
I feel great.
You know,
it's funny,
it was,
um,

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.830
we had some people over here yesterday.
Um,

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.510
I got some family in town,
so we had a little cookout and uh,

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.340
you know,
I needed some space on this table so we can put perhaps some shit.

13
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.130
So I took all my bows and I just,
I brought it out of the kitchen.

14
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.950
I just took it upstairs and put it in the bedroom.
And um,

15
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.310
you know,
just so we have another area.

16
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.140
Pregnant was not the biggest fucking kitchen,
right?

17
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:05.600
So fucking little prep area to cook.

18
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.920
So I fucking last night I'm going to bed and my new thing,

19
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.950
I swear to God to go to sleep rather than they have three fucking scotches like

20
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:16.970
I used to is I actually read,

21
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.870
I swear to God,
I'm reading,

22
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.240
I'm sober and I'm reading how fucking funny is that?
So I uh,

23
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.550
<v 0>yeah,</v>

24
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.840
<v 1>I finished this book on Bob Cousy and Bill Russell that I really enjoyed and I'm</v>

25
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.300
going to give it to a buddy of mine cause I don't like keeping books.

26
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.320
They're fucking heavy.

27
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.010
They take up space and I always act like I'm going to go back and read them

28
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:45.030
again and I don't.
So,
um,

29
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.830
now I'm reading the,
uh,
the Beastie boy book,
a hardcover edition.

30
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:51.960
And as I was taking the plastic off,
I was thinking like,

31
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.450
is this going to affect the value of it?
And it's just like,
Bill,

32
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.420
when do you sell anything on Ebay?
Never.
Alright,
cool.

33
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.050
So I was reading that and all I had was my little reading light on at my bed and

34
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:07.770
I looked over and I had a bottle of the Yippy Kai.
Yay.

35
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Right.
The Bourbon,
absolutely delicious.
Unopened.

36
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.420
Just sitting there and the way the light was hitting it and the way it was

37
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:20.280
passing through the bottle,
it literally looked like it.
Like,
like a sunrise.

38
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.753
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.870
<v 1>And I would be lying to you if I didn't,</v>

40
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.830
so to sit up in bed and just look at it for a hard 20 seconds.

41
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.373
<v 0>MMM.</v>

42
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.970
<v 1>And I was just,
Oh my God.
Yeah.
That was like,
that looks fucking delicious.</v>

43
00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.130
But I didn't,
I bought,
I will tell you this,

44
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:40.780
I'm going to get it out of the bedroom though.

45
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.050
I don't need to be staring at that late at night,
you know,

46
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.670
while I need to do is have a tough day and then have those bottles looking at as

47
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:51.760
me sitting there like,
Hey,
bill will help you take the edge off.

48
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.430
Can I had one drink every 121 days?
That's not a bad thing.

49
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.880
You see is a little taste go on of it until that tasted,

50
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.150
um,
anyways,
uh,
plowing ahead.
So,
uh,
I'm going to get that shit out of there.

51
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.490
Um,
I also buy ordered a one of those pitch backs,

52
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.810
which I haven't had since I was a kid where you,
you know,
you,
it's,

53
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.550
you throw the ball,

54
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.370
it's like basically just like a net and it records Shay's back.

55
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.810
You can either get grounders fly balls or it can come back straight,
you know,

56
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.700
like you actually have a friend to play catch with.

57
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.100
And I've since my fucked up my shoulder,
which is feeling great now by the way.

58
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.653
<v 0>MMM.</v>

59
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.430
<v 1>Since I messed it up,
I've been,
uh,</v>

60
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.470
I switched to becoming a lefty and a,
I just want to get my,
my mechanics down.

61
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:46.020
I'm almost fucking there where I can get a little velocity on it.

62
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:47.020
So that's basically what I'm about.

63
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.450
Basically living like a goddamn eight year old and I love it.

64
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.190
I absolutely love it.
And uh,
you know,

65
00:03:56.191 --> 00:04:01.191
we're up at this week or doing episode number eight of a f is for family four Oh

66
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:06.690
eight written by yours truly.
Um,
I've um,

67
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.630
eight out of 10.
So,
uh,

68
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.150
this season as far as like the heavy lifting,

69
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.770
the writing aspect of it is almost over.
Very thankful for that.

70
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.150
And uh,
we've always had a killer writer,

71
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.720
writers' room and I think this year is our strongest room.

72
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.400
It just keeps getting better and better.

73
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.990
I think that it helps that the show's been on for as long as it has.

74
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:31.050
So writers come in the room now just hitting the ground running.

75
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:34.110
They just understand the characters and all that.
So it's been,
uh,

76
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.370
it's definitely been great.
So with that,

77
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:41.220
I have some new dates I have to announce.
Announce.

78
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.543
<v 0>Uh,</v>

79
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.440
<v 1>let's see here.</v>

80
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.440
I am going to be at the cosmopolitan in Las Vegas on September 6th.

81
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.220
Um,
venue and ticket master Presale is Thursday matched 28th.
Uh,

82
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:01.090
the public on sale is Friday,
March 29th.
I don't know what that means.

83
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:02.990
The public can't go to ticket master.

84
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.220
I'll presale Jesus Christ.

85
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.360
There's always somebody Borden before group one isn't there?
Um,
anyways,
yeah,

86
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:11.051
I'm going to be out there.

87
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:14.470
I'm going to do a Gig and then the following day I'm going to go see Elton John

88
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.470
because I know this is like his last two are a lot of people wrapping it up out

89
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:22.360
there.
Lot of people wrapping it up out there on their fucking tours.

90
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.420
And,
um,
so I'm like,
fuck,
I gotta go see these people before the date.

91
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:31.180
They just don't talk anymore.
And then they die.
And I,
I know you're thinking,

92
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.520
how many times can you get suckered into that bill?

93
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.620
How many fucking times can somebody say it's their last fucking tore and then

94
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:42.580
they come back around again?
You know,
listen,

95
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.250
I forgive it if you get into some sort of tax trouble.

96
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.143
<v 0>MMM.</v>

97
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.330
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Fucking taxes.
Jesus Christ.
Jesus.</v>

98
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.470
Did I start a shitstorm on fucking reddit when I talking about the,

99
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.410
<v 3>uh,
that taxing people,
70% money north of $10 million.</v>

100
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.390
And I am passionately against that.
I don't make north of $10 million,

101
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.860
but I also know how taxes work.
All right?

102
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.950
So they'll create that and then a few years later they are going to be like,

103
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:18.230
well,
people who make eight to 10 should play this.

104
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.750
People who make six to eight should pay this,

105
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.360
and it's just going to trickle all the fucking way down.

106
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.570
<v 0>MMM.</v>

107
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.890
<v 3>Yeah,
dude,
70% tech.</v>

108
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.000
There's no justification for it on any level that is absolute fucking rape.

109
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:33.723
<v 0>MMM.</v>

110
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.700
<v 3>Had people who were saying that,
uh,</v>

111
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.470
that $20 trillion that is in offshore accounts is a complete separate issue,

112
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.200
isn't I?
Completely disagree.

113
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.120
That's basically like you have a house and the foundation is cracked and you're

114
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:55.870
worried that the house is going to fall into the front yard and you're sitting

115
00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:59.990
there going,
we need to raise money to paint the fucking thing.
And it's like,
no.

116
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.880
Do we need to fix the foundation?
And you're like,
that's a separate issue.

117
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.440
Technically,
I guess it is a separate issue,
but it's like,
it's,

118
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.030
it's a more important issue.

119
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.410
You're going to paint something that's going to fall down on his fucking face.

120
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.570
All right?
If you're going to sit there and ignore that,

121
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.070
and you're going to ignore the fact that corporations are dictating our foreign

122
00:07:23.071 --> 00:07:25.710
policy and have bankrupted this country,

123
00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:29.370
this country is fucking backdrop right now.
And they're not bankrupt.

124
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.200
We're not bankrupt because people who make $10 million or more are not paying

125
00:07:34.201 --> 00:07:35.730
70% taxes.

126
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.520
We're fucking bankrupt because we're spending $1 billion over $1 billion of

127
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:41.430
fucking month

128
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.380
fighting some shit that we could actually solve here.

129
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.270
We could just convert to fucking solar power if oil companies didn't own the

130
00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:53.490
politicians,
you could convert to that.

131
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.420
Give the solar pocket the fucking sun to the oil companies so they can still

132
00:07:57.421 --> 00:07:59.400
have their eyes wide shut fucking parties.

133
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.620
And I'm not saying solar powers cleaner,

134
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.190
it doesn't fucking fuck up the ocean when you throw the big fucking things in

135
00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:06.720
there or whatever.
I'm not saying that,

136
00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:08.900
but I'm just saying it would solve the Middle East problem

137
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.620
because all of that fucking terrorism is funded with oil money and nobody uses

138
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:19.110
more of it than us.
So let's just switch over.
I know it's a,
it's a,

139
00:08:19.111 --> 00:08:22.560
it's a fucking,
not an easy and Deborah,

140
00:08:22.561 --> 00:08:24.480
but do it like fucking Ilan mugs.

141
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.210
Put these little fucking glow sticks in the Goddamn road.

142
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.290
We'll do that.
Not for a cleaner earth,

143
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.630
just to get us the fuck out of there.

144
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.820
Cause right now they have us all walking around like zombies going,

145
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.820
I support the to support [inaudible] support the troops,
right?

146
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.920
Who does it support the fucking home team.

147
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.340
But they take it to the point where you create question where you're sending the

148
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:53.090
troops and for how fucking long and you can't even bring up like,
hey guys,

149
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:56.780
we're fucking bankrupt.
This isn't working.

150
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.430
Separate issue,
separate issue.

151
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.580
Let's fucking rape the guy that started dollar shave club.

152
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:05.340
That's the solution and let me guess,
let me guess.

153
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.810
These are the tax dollars that's are actually going to make it to public
schools.

154
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.900
These are the tax dollars that are going to pay for nature wide health care.

155
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.020
These are the tax dollars are going to fucking take over our food supply against

156
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.880
.
So it's not peep.
You know,

157
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.920
little girls aren't getting their period at 10 years old because of all the

158
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.590
fucking hormones in it.
Like you're going to sit there,

159
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.710
you want to put money on that.
This is the tax dollars.
It's going to be spent,

160
00:09:29.711 --> 00:09:32.980
right.
That these fucking assholes correct piece of shit.

161
00:09:32.981 --> 00:09:37.150
Politicians aren't going to steal the fuck outta here.

162
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.021
Do this.

163
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:45.021
People in this country make an 80 to $100 million that are paying 0% taxes,

164
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.020
0% taxes.
Go look up apple.
I've got an apple laptop,
right?

165
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.130
It's sitting right in front of me.

166
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.420
Go look up how they successfully avoided paying 50 billion in American taxes.

167
00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:58.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

168
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.100
<v 3>Hey,
gay guys,
separate issue,
separate fucking issue.</v>

169
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.280
All these corporations making money hand over fucking fist and as such greedy

170
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.060
fucking cunts,

171
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.960
they won't pay dollar number one on $50 billion.

172
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.790
Oh yeah,
no,
no,
no.
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

173
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.270
Let's go after fucking individual Americans who had the balls to go after a

174
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:28.010
fucking look at.
Let's just look at stand up comedians.
I,

175
00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:31.100
I w I would if somebody told me that percentage.

176
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.370
I can't imagine the percentage that actually make it,
you know,

177
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.410
and I was that guy in my mid to late 30 sitting on a Fuckin futon.
No wife,

178
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:47.000
no kids in a fucking studio apartment

179
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.810
knowing that I'm in a young man's game.

180
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.620
Go on w where the fuck does this go,
dude,
if I don't fucking make it,

181
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.401
you know,

182
00:10:57.401 --> 00:11:02.200
I'm going to end up on fucking cruise ships than my 50s and 60s

183
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.310
fighting every night and I'd throw myself over the fucking railing.

184
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:14.570
All right?
And I had the balls to stay in it,
but because I did,

185
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.230
you're now going to fucking punish me and demonize,
you know,

186
00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:22.160
and I'm not saying I don't make that money,
but I know how this game works.

187
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.080
That is going to start at 10 and then it's going to fucking work its way down.

188
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.400
And then what's you're going to have this,
my voice is cracking.

189
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.380
What you're going to have is a literally a wall

190
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.100
between ridiculously unbelievably fucking rich people who are paying no fucking

191
00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:41.760
money in taxes.

192
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.100
And then you're going to push the rest of everybody else backed down and have us

193
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:50.580
all fighting with one another with all of these fucking people who sent me

194
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:54.760
emails who were just saying they'd never heard me be so greedy,

195
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.220
like I'm greedy.
How fucking funny is that?
I'm greedy with what?
My money,

196
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.320
the money that I earned.
I'm fucking greedy with that.

197
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.060
And you who it isn't your fucking money,
uh,

198
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:10.350
telling me to give it to you and I'm the fucking greedy one.

199
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.020
And meanwhile,

200
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.620
you're going to completely ignore this other subset of people who are paying

201
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.490
nobody fucking taxes.
And tell me that that's a separate fucking issue.

202
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.070
I'm not the guy who poisoned the fucking food supply.

203
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.860
I'm not the one who's pouring shit into our drinking water.

204
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.320
I'm not the one who runs a company that makes 50 billion fucking dollars.

205
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.550
And I got lawyers,

206
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.140
a team of fucking lawyers figuring out how I can pay $0 million.

207
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.220
Okay?

208
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.360
I don't have a fucking sweatshop where people are trying to jump to that death.

209
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.340
And rather than pay a more fucking money,

210
00:12:49.341 --> 00:12:51.950
I put nets outside of the fucking factory.

211
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.090
So they just land in that.

212
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.180
And when I can yank him out of the net and stick them back at their fucking

213
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:02.450
workstation,
I'm not the guy doing that.

214
00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:05.210
But you're going to sit there and tell me that that's a separate fucking issue.

215
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.080
Is it a separate issue or is it just more difficult to police?

216
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.280
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

217
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.200
<v 3>So you're going to go for the fucking layup.</v>

218
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:14.300
<v 4>Okay.</v>

219
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.560
<v 3>Unfucking believable.
It's a separate issue.</v>

220
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.800
I'll sit there all day and let's see a fucking point until you say it's a

221
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:25.290
separate issue.
Paying taxes and paying your fair share is,

222
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.110
is fucking straight across the board.
The same issue.

223
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.460
And if you're going to go after people who are already paying more than 50%

224
00:13:34.461 --> 00:13:36.230
taxes on their fucking income,

225
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.000
which is fucking criminal in my world,

226
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.660
that the person who does the job has to give away more.

227
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.570
Then they made,

228
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.840
they get to keep less than what they fucking made and they did the fucking job.

229
00:13:48.841 --> 00:13:53.790
And you're going to sit there and tell me that.
That's fair.
The Fuck Outta here.

230
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.460
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

231
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.010
<v 3>I'll never agree with that,
but I will read your fucking emails.</v>

232
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.900
All of these fucking politicians are all in these fucking people's back pockets.

233
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.930
Don't fucking believe these Goddamn fucking people who come along and say,

234
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.880
I like Trump.
I'm going to,
I'm going to clean up the swell.

235
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:16.590
I'm going to drain the swamp.
He hasn't taken a fucking,

236
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.030
he hasn't taken a Dixie Cup worth of water out of that fucking swamp.

237
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.220
All right?
Cause this is what we all want to fucking do.

238
00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:28.190
Ignore to really change then you would have to have an all out fucking

239
00:14:28.191 --> 00:14:32.270
revolution and there would have to be bloodshed and the only people that really

240
00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:35.840
have the ability to do it would be those lunatics and blackwater.

241
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.970
They would be the only guys who be able to do it at.

242
00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:41.450
All you have to do is cross your fingers and pray that they're decent fucking

243
00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:44.750
human beings because they actually have the weaponry to pull it off.

244
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:45.650
Other than that,

245
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.520
all you're going to do is fucking go after innocent fucking people,

246
00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:52.010
which is what you guys are.
Uh,
some of you are fucking

247
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.810
<v 1>advocating while you ignore the fucking 9,000 pound gorilla in the room who's</v>

248
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:59.360
paying $0 million in taxes.
All right.

249
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:03.470
I'm done until I read it more later on.
Did you guys watch any of the,
um,

250
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.550
I picked someone who makes 50 grand a year,

251
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.060
should be paying 59% taxes.

252
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.310
MMM.
[inaudible]
all right.

253
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.800
Did you guys watch it?
Do you guys watch the Duke for Central Florida game?

254
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.170
Oh my God.
What a fucking heartbreak of that was.

255
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.770
I didn't know what to do cause I love Duke,
but I also root for an underdog.

256
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.720
And uh,
it was June the end of that game.

257
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.750
It was like the basketball gods just chose fucking doke.

258
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.290
You know that alley?
I don't know if it looked like it was mistimed.

259
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.183
I don't know what.

260
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:46.190
And then the fucking Duke misses it and then gets the fucking rebound and then

261
00:15:47.711 --> 00:15:49.600
the shot in the end and the tip and just didn't,

262
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.300
it just didn't want to fucking go in.
Um,

263
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.050
you know,
I'll tell you right now,
if you're a fucking NBA fan,
you're missing out.

264
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.850
You're missing out in what's left of college basketball because there's so many

265
00:16:03.851 --> 00:16:07.420
one and done.
It's just a pleasure to watch

266
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.360
that level of talent and they're actually listening to their coach because

267
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.970
that's just what's missing in the fucking NBA.

268
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.190
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

269
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.090
<v 1>This fucking shit where it's just like,
these guys are the,</v>

270
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.980
they make so much fucking money that,

271
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.530
that they,
they feel like they don't have to listen to their coach.

272
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.010
I just don't,
and I'm not saying all of them,
but just,

273
00:16:35.011 --> 00:16:36.690
it just blows my fucking mind.

274
00:16:36.691 --> 00:16:40.590
It's like you're a platoon and that's the general and he's coming in with the

275
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.890
fight plan and you're like,
ah Nah,
Nah,
we're just going to Improv this.

276
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.240
We're just going to go,

277
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.150
we're all going to go in there and just start open fire and you know,

278
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.730
in the same general fucking direction.

279
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.100
I just feel like when you do that,

280
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:59.980
that's when a team that on paper isn't as good as you can come in and you're

281
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.740
open yourself up to getting beat.
Um,

282
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.190
that's what it is,
man.
That is,
that is,
that is the,

283
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.600
how the NBA game is played now.
What is the individual fucking game?

284
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.560
It's the an one influence on the game,

285
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:21.590
which I'm not on a percent against that level of fucking creativity in one on

286
00:17:21.901 --> 00:17:23.580
one and all that type of shit.
But like,

287
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.910
you know when you have like a coach just sitting there with his fucking thumbs

288
00:17:26.911 --> 00:17:31.911
up his ass cause he can only talk to the lower fucking 70% of the team.

289
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:34.740
You know what I mean?

290
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.980
It's almost like those superstars are like apple,
right.

291
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.610
Don't want to pay their taxes.

292
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.180
They don't want or they think they think they're above being coached.
Um,

293
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.120
anyways,
everything's going to go back to that.

294
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.580
I've been paying attention to the premier league.

295
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.510
Liverpool is still two points ahead but I looked up to schedule this time cause

296
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:00.090
I thought that they were in the lead.
It's just they've played more games.

297
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:04.680
They have nine games left and Man City has 11 games left.

298
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:05.790
And as far as I can tell,

299
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:10.791
none of them really have that much challenging games left other than man city

300
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:16.240
plays.
Man United.
That could be the,
the fly in the ointment game there.

301
00:18:16.241 --> 00:18:17.580
So I'll try to pay attention.
I'll,

302
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:21.430
I'll watch that game cause I figured that's going to be a big one.
Um,

303
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.190
and then I'm going to be watching the Bruins verse Tampa Bay Lightening Tonight.

304
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.030
That's going to be my,
uh,
that's going to be my little fucking a

305
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.850
my little evening tonight.
And,
uh,
I mentioned,
uh,
last week I went,

306
00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:36.460
I went to the premiere,
that Motley Crue movie the dirt,

307
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:41.470
definitely check it out just to fucking,
I,
I really loved the movie.
Uh,

308
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.910
didn't pull any punches and uh,

309
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.950
I actually saw some woman in the La Times was,

310
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.280
was given one of the band members shit going like,

311
00:18:51.281 --> 00:18:54.280
how could you put a movie out post me too.

312
00:18:54.281 --> 00:18:56.500
How could you put a movie out like this?

313
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.700
And the dude was like,
well,
I mean it happened.

314
00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.540
You want us to rewrite history?
It was like the perfect fucking answer.

315
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.610
And if you watch it,
what's so fucked up is it's,
it's all consensual sex.

316
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.180
It's just a bunch of people over indulging.

317
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.450
So have we got in literally to this point that,

318
00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.120
that a bunch of guys playing in a band who have a bunch of groupies who want to

319
00:19:22.121 --> 00:19:26.240
fuck the shit out of them.
So they do is like a bad fuck.
Is,

320
00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:30.700
is like somehow like that there was something wrong there.

321
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.420
I mean,
you could say there was something wrong as far as like a,

322
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.720
what everybody was doing there.

323
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.780
If you want to get into some sort of religious debate about morals leaving,

324
00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:46.781
if you want to get out of religion and just talk about the emptiness of living a

325
00:19:46.871 --> 00:19:50.050
life like that,
how it's exciting in the beginning,

326
00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:55.051
but then afterwards is a profound loneliness to living a life like that for both

327
00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.770
people,
the Groupie and the fucking rock star.

328
00:19:57.771 --> 00:20:00.440
I can have that fucking conversation with you,

329
00:20:00.441 --> 00:20:02.090
but I don't understand how that fucking,

330
00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:04.923
<v 4>you know,</v>

331
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.090
<v 1>I thought me too was you took your dick out at working just on a plan,
right?</v>

332
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.000
I was in that world,
right?

333
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.210
Wasn't played some songs and chicks in the crowd is showing that titties to you

334
00:20:19.211 --> 00:20:20.650
and then afterwards you bang them.

335
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.640
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

336
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.760
<v 1>I,
I didn't think that that,
that fell under that fucking umbrella</v>

337
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.520
does meet to basically you also get to the point of like,
you know,

338
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.450
the,
that that men can't go out and enjoy themselves if they're out there.

339
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:43.590
And then if you play in a band,
it's going to its rated pussy.
You know,

340
00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:48.430
that's going to happen.
There's actually people that got into bands

341
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.710
<v 3>just for the chicks and all of a sudden they're fucking,
they're bad.</v>

342
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.150
Somehow fucking made it.

343
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.800
And this standing up there without that passion is pussy.

344
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.160
Look at Gene Simmons.

345
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.220
I've never heard that guy talk passionately about music.

346
00:21:08.221 --> 00:21:10.200
He just talks passionately about women.

347
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

348
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.290
<v 3>Any so obsessed with it.
He literally says Dumb Shit.</v>

349
00:21:15.291 --> 00:21:19.820
Like anybody who says they got into a bed for the music is a fucking liar.

350
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.710
They got in it for the pussy.
I made it.

351
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.110
That's how that far down the fucking road that guy is.

352
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.200
If everybody doesn't share my opinion,

353
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:28.520
<v 2>yeah,</v>

354
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.500
<v 3>then then,
uh,
they're fucking lying.
Um,
anyways.
Yeah,
it was,</v>

355
00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:37.130
it was 30,
40 fucking years ago.

356
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.620
And uh,
you know,
I dunno.

357
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.950
Motley Crue did what a lot of bands did and they made a fucking movie about it.

358
00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:49.200
And even then,
it's sorta like,
they kind of glossed over a lot of it.
So I don't,

359
00:21:49.201 --> 00:21:51.110
I don't understand what the fucking problem is.

360
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.810
There's always somebody now that's got some sort of problems.

361
00:21:53.811 --> 00:21:57.830
Don't you think that that movie about seagulls,

362
00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.660
Josie,
does it misses the mark about the main issue?

363
00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:06.800
The main issue being the issue that am I'm concerned with.

364
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:08.950
<v 2>Okay.</v>

365
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.371
<v 3>By the way,</v>

366
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:14.371
my favorite thing right now on the Internet is crystally is,

367
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.840
uh,
that thing.
He did that thing,

368
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.540
he's trying to start jokingly or not called the unfollowing

369
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.710
follow Chris Delea on Instagram and scroll through.

370
00:22:26.711 --> 00:22:28.870
I'm sure he's made a couple of videos since his last one.

371
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:31.330
He did this fucking thing on,
I was talking about,

372
00:22:31.331 --> 00:22:32.470
I think I would just talked about this,

373
00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:36.160
but I just want to promote it again because I think it's like all those

374
00:22:36.161 --> 00:22:40.810
Instagram models,
you know,
it goes,
uh,
hey,
he goes,

375
00:22:40.811 --> 00:22:45.700
make no mistake if you're on Instagram and you're taking pictures of your booty

376
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.670
and your Teddy's,
yeah.
Okay.

377
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.250
And he literally breaks it down to all of this shit that I didn't even know

378
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.510
existed,
I guess.
You know,
hot chicks biting into a giant sandwich,

379
00:23:01.511 --> 00:23:06.190
like looking up in the air,
trying to be,
try to be cute or something like that.

380
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.420
And it's like,
uh,
I don't know.

381
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:13.570
He's just saying to unfollow them,
which is fucking funny to me

382
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.890
because I'm not in that world at all.

383
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.400
But I was talking to younger comics about this and I,
you know,

384
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.280
they run into these people I guess,
and they were saying like,
yeah,

385
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:27.190
they actually come up to you and have like an attitude.

386
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.940
Like they're doing something now they are doing something.

387
00:23:30.941 --> 00:23:31.930
They are going to the gym.

388
00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:36.931
They are keeping themselves in shape and God bless him in an entrepreneurial

389
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:41.500
way.
I respect the fact that they're building a brand here.

390
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:43.973
MMM.

391
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:44.380
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

392
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.490
<v 3>But
I don't,
uh,</v>

393
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.390
I don't co sign on then walking around acting like an egotistical maniac.

394
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:55.400
If that's what the fuck that dude,
I don't fucking know.

395
00:23:55.401 --> 00:24:00.180
There's so much shit on it.
That's fucking hilarious.
I saw somebody made,

396
00:24:00.181 --> 00:24:03.510
made a post where they would talk when it was women's Day and of course they

397
00:24:03.511 --> 00:24:06.840
were like,
you know,
fuck that.
It should be women's Day,
everyday of the year.

398
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.140
Which is hilarious because it's just like,
and when would it be guys day then?

399
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.300
Does that seem fair to you?

400
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.960
And the person like took like a fucking picture and it's like a sexy picture.

401
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.940
Like they couldn't just make their,
their statement.

402
00:24:20.941 --> 00:24:23.220
They also had to show off their fucking,
you know,

403
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.910
they have flat stomach and their fucking ass and stuff.
It's just like,

404
00:24:26.911 --> 00:24:28.500
it's like what,
what are you,
what are we doing here?

405
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.980
It's like if that exact picture,

406
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.570
if a guy used it to sell like,
uh,
like you know,

407
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.540
some Coca Cola,
it'd be like objectifying women.

408
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.580
It's Yo Yo Dee what needs to change?
But then,
you know,
I dunno,

409
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.050
but then you can do it if it's you doing it to yourself selling woman's Day.

410
00:24:52.051 --> 00:24:54.360
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't get out of the fucking math works,

411
00:24:54.361 --> 00:24:56.700
but you know something I was never good at math.

412
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.510
All I can tell you this is,

413
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.070
I don't think Lebron James should have to give away 70% of his money over $10

414
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.750
million.
I don't,
I don't,

415
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:11.260
I think he's already fucking play in well over 50 Tom Brady,

416
00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:13.630
all of these fucking people and I think you know something.

417
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.030
I think you paying your fair share at that point.

418
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.990
How much more fucking money do you want to take from these fucking people while

419
00:25:19.991 --> 00:25:23.440
ignoring people who are paying no money in taxes?

420
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:29.880
Why?
Ignoring companies that are leading us off into war that has no end,

421
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.570
that bankrupts the country.
That's a separate issue.

422
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.570
Oh Jesus.
All right,
let me read some advertising here.
Hey,

423
00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:43.530
my book ea,
I look funky door and I write,
um,

424
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.800
brackets.
First round upsets.

425
00:25:46.801 --> 00:25:49.530
The final four march madness is here,

426
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.350
right there on your television screen.

427
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.490
It's time to bet with the best at my bookie.
Hey,

428
00:25:56.491 --> 00:26:01.491
would you rather sit at your office desk or call out sick and binge on NCAA

429
00:26:01.531 --> 00:26:05.640
tournament games and junk food like,
that's okay.
All right,
let's see.
Would you,

430
00:26:05.641 --> 00:26:07.650
would you rather I am the worst?

431
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:13.010
Would you rather sit at your office desk or call out sick and binge on NCA

432
00:26:13.231 --> 00:26:17.670
tournament games and junk food?
Like that's even a choice.
I love how these guys,

433
00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:21.840

they are gamble on sports.

434
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.160
It don't go to work.

435
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.620
Don't even have an apple eat some freedoms anyways.

436
00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:31.050
Sometimes it feels good to be bad.
It's the balance of life,

437
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.890
especially when it's with someone you trust.

438

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.480
sticking it in a window,

457
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.440
hoping that dream person walked by and they need a job.

458
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.460
It ain't like that anymore.

the smartest way to hire.
Oh Geez.

479
00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:03.280
We've got a lot today.
What do we got here?
What do we,
what do we have here?

480
00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.550
Uh,
you know what,
I got one,
two,
three left,
so I'm going to break them up.

481
00:29:06.551 --> 00:29:09.430
I'll read the third one here.
We'll get over the hump.
This is Wednesday here.

482
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.980
Simply safe.
Hi fellas.
Here's something interesting.

483
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.430
Studies show that security systems deter burglars

484
00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:24.640
its effect,
but there's still a burglary every eight seconds in America.

485
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:30.490
Um,
how well think about it.
Think about it.
Do Burglars Give Up?

486
00:29:30.491 --> 00:29:35.110
Just because some housewife houses have security systems?
Of course not.

487
00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.180
They just find a house that isn't protected.

488
00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.860
That's why securing your home is truly necessary.
So wait a minute.

489
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:45.340
So everybody ends up getting a security system that these guys are going to have

490
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:47.980
to up their game like a virus because of,
uh,
you know,

491
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:50.650
if you don't kill the virus,
you just keep using the medicine.

492
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:55.160
They get immune to it.
We have to kill the virus.

493
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:56.480
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

494
00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.540
<v 1>So simply safe,
what I would be doing if I was them,
I would eventually,</v>

495
00:29:59.541 --> 00:30:04.541
I would come with up with a security system that known only deters the intruder.

496
00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.360
It also kills them.
All right.
But that's a different read.

497
00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.950
Simply save sensors will protect every point of access of two year home doors,

498
00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.290
windows,
garage,
you name it.
Yeah.

499
00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.980
If a burglar even tries to break in and ear shattering side,

500
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.910
remember those old cy five things where they would shoot like as sound rape at

501
00:30:28.911 --> 00:30:32.020
somebody.
They would just grab both their resume and be like,
yeah,

502
00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.800
drop to their knees.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

503
00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:40.940
I just pictured the burglar dressed like Captain Kirk.
A best of all,

504
00:30:40.941 --> 00:30:43.670
simply say's 24 you wouldn't want him and his your fucking house.

505
00:30:43.671 --> 00:30:44.690
He tried to bang your wife.

506
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:50.260
Burst of all simply saves 24 seven monitoring is just 14,909 a month and they'll

507
00:30:51.081 --> 00:30:55.370
never lock you in a longterm contract.
More than 3 million people already know.

508
00:30:55.371 --> 00:30:58.970
It feels good to feel less with simply safe.

509
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:03.110
So go with the only home security system you can trust.

L I s?
A.
F.
E.
Yeah.

514
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.630
bird.com.
All right,
let's plow ahead.

515
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.030
Alright.
Cubans role too tight.

516
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.470
Hey Billy suction face.
Uh,

517
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:36.250
if you're Cubans turn your face purple when you smoke them then they are

518
00:31:36.251 --> 00:31:40.030
probably counterfeit.
I know people tell me that but you know something.

519
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.180
I have to be honest with you.
I get a lot of Dominicans,

520
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.240
I get a lot of Nicaraguans and I run into this same problem.

521
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:48.120
Not the same problem with the Cubans.

522
00:31:48.121 --> 00:31:52.510
So if somebody making fake Nicaraguans and Dominican's anyways,

523
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.380
the demand for Cuban cigars far,
far outweighs the availability.
Um,

524
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.040
is another thing too sir.
I fucking,

525
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.510
I've smoked him in different countries and I've had run into the same problem.

526
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.300
Maybe you're saying the worldwide demand,

527
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.960
which you're probably right so they are often faked in nearly indistinguishable

528
00:32:14.391 --> 00:32:17.270
from the real deal.
Even for the train I,

529
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.140
it's only when you start smoking them that it's noticeable.

530
00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:25.880
Rolling a good cigar is a true art which is not mastered by counterfeiters

531
00:32:25.881 --> 00:32:29.360
looking for a quick buck.
The demand for Dominican's for example,

532
00:32:29.361 --> 00:32:31.160
is a lot lower and they are not,

533
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.190
and they are not considered extremely rare or valuable.

534
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:39.400
They are rarely counterfeit greetings from get Belgium and as per go fuck

535
00:32:40.401 --> 00:32:44.150
yourself while he is in Belgium.
So yeah.
Yeah.
I gotta be honest with you,

536
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:46.510
I'm kind of getting away from the Cubans because they're,

537
00:32:46.511 --> 00:32:50.300
they're really expensive.
And um,

538
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.030
I remember one time when I was in Australia,

539
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.680
I must've got the real deal because I,

540
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.190
I bought these Cohibas and when I came back they were,
they were,

541
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.630
they were incredible.

542
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.920
Like they were a cigar that as you will lighting it,

543
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.060
like the first couple of puffs you went,
oh my God.
Oh my God.

544
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:12.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

545
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:17.140
<v 1>Oh my God.
That's believing what you do.
Your whole body fucking relaxes.</v>

546
00:33:17.141 --> 00:33:20.050
And it's an amazing,
having said that,
I would like to quit those.

547
00:33:20.051 --> 00:33:24.130
That might be the next thing that I want to do.
And I am,
um,

548
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:27.510
I am,

549
00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:31.350
I would like to just replace all my vices with something a little more healthy

550
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.490
and then eventually come back to a vice that isn't a bad vice.

551
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.950
What's your vice,
you know,

552
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.970
I guess I think I read too much in bad lighting.

553
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.730
I have to stop.
I know I'm so bad.
I need to go to meetings.

554
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.500
Like I'd love to be that fucking person,
you know?
Um,

555
00:33:49.501 --> 00:33:52.800
so eventually I think I'm gonna like get down to maybe like three,

556
00:33:52.801 --> 00:33:56.430
four cigars a year.
The Rose Bowl,
the big college game,

557
00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.850
my birthday,
and then something around Christmas and,

558
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.050
<v 0>and um,
yeah,</v>

559
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:07.820
<v 1>just sort of leave it at that because I am really getting into living like a</v>

560
00:34:07.891 --> 00:34:08.850
fucking nerd.

561
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.430
<v 0>MMM.</v>

562
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:14.190
<v 1>You know,
it's underrated or overrated.
Underrated.</v>

563
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:19.220
I'll tell you underrated reading a great book at night to make you sleepy rather

564
00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:22.060
than staring at a screen.
And A,

565
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.310
I've kind of realized that one of my vices is the amount of time that I spend on

566
00:34:26.311 --> 00:34:29.010
my phone.
And,
um,

567
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.430
I want to get used to like not being,

568
00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.043
<v 0>uh,</v>

569
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.030
<v 1>you know,
I,
I'd like,</v>

570
00:34:37.031 --> 00:34:40.150
I'll be in the car and I just find myself going over and picking it up like,

571
00:34:40.151 --> 00:34:43.660
like a fucking child with,
with its little favorite teddy bear.

572
00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:47.740
And I'm fucking sitting there looking at the God damn screen and it's like I'm

573
00:34:47.741 --> 00:34:50.740
driving,
scrolling,
trying to find a song.

574
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.083
<v 0>MMM,
okay.</v>

575
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.970
<v 1>So I think what I'm going to just,</v>

576
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.630
I try to put it in airplane mode,

577
00:34:58.631 --> 00:35:01.900
but then most of my songs around the fucking cloud and then I lose all my

578
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.400
goddamn music.
So now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to have a playlist,

579
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.730
download those,
you know,
10 songs or whatever,

580
00:35:09.731 --> 00:35:13.180
and then put it on airplane mode and then literally take the thing and fucking

581
00:35:13.181 --> 00:35:14.440
throw it in the back seat.

582
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.963
<v 0>MMM.</v>

583
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:22.390
<v 1>I would like to do that.
And um,
but I'll tell you,
man,</v>

584
00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:27.160
underrated fucking reading.
I'm back into it.
And,
uh,

585
00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.370
and I told you I had this woman tell me that I,
um,

586
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.060
I wasn't going to be able to learn French.
So back to the flash cards and stuff.

587
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.560
And,
uh,
I got a couple of friends of mine that can speak French.

588
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:40.920
So we only text each other strictly in French.
And I'm not,

589
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:44.100
I'm really starting to learn this shit.
I can't speak it well,

590
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:48.570
but I can read it really well now,
or at least to another level.
And it's,

591
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.350
uh,
I mean,
I could,

592
00:35:50.351 --> 00:35:54.030
I could fucking be doing that rather than slowly killing myself and killing

593
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:56.730
brain cells and shit.
And,
um,

594
00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.330
I dunno man.
I think,
uh,
you know,

595
00:36:01.331 --> 00:36:04.750
like I had that cookout yesterday and there was a bunch of people over and shit

596
00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:08.760
and I was stoned,
fucking sober.
So then,
you know,

597
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.540
jumbo walking around and then I run into my kid,
hey,
are you doing,

598
00:36:11.541 --> 00:36:16.530
I'm not like buzzed.
They,
there's a low point in your fucking life.

599
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:17.820
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

600
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.000
<v 1>You know,
having a little buzz going and then you see it fucking kid.</v>

601
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.660
It's just like,
what am I doing?
What if something happens right now?

602
00:36:24.661 --> 00:36:27.030
And I need to react and I'm a little buzzed right now.

603
00:36:27.031 --> 00:36:31.740
I just can't fucking do it anymore.
But the guilt of it,
I can't handle it.
So,
um,

604
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:36.700
anyways,
I agree with you,
sir.
I like the,
uh,
the Casa Magnus,
the,
uh,
I,

605
00:36:36.701 --> 00:36:38.530
I swear to God,
I think they're called collegal.

606
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.970
He us like that fucking half a porno movie.
Um,

607
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:46.110
I like the Aurora emeralds and um,

608
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.980
he has a couple of my father's cigars that I really like,
but um,
I don't know.

609
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:55.370
I'm going to be basically trying to phase those fuckers out.
All right.

610
00:36:55.371 --> 00:36:58.940
Card Games and board games.
Um,

611
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.330
hey bill catching up on the podcast.
I heard you had fun playing cards.
Yeah,

612
00:37:02.331 --> 00:37:06.800
I loved it.
Played with my mom.
It was awesome.
Uh,
you should check out the word.

613
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.770
Um,
the world of card games and board games.

614
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.430
There's a regular popular game called five crowns.

615
00:37:14.431 --> 00:37:19.410
That's a rummy style game.
That is fun.
Also,
board games have come a long way.

616
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:24.330
I feel like you may have been a risk guy.
I was,
I loved that game.

617
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:30.030
Taking over the world.
Uh,
though I don't recall you saying,
Oh,

618
00:37:30.031 --> 00:37:31.830
I love that fucking game.
Uh,

619
00:37:31.831 --> 00:37:34.920
there are great strategy games out there that are fun to play with.

620
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:37.620
Friends and cigars.
Uh,

621
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:42.550
people love settlers of Catan or Katon.
Again,

622
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:47.630
that is probably sold thriller like numbers in the tabletop game world.

623
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.010
I'm going to check that out.
Hey,
you know what?
I missed?
I lost.

624
00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.650
Um,
let me see if I,
that meditation fucking music.

625
00:38:00.651 --> 00:38:03.500
I lost.
Uh,
you fucking asshole bill.

626
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.020
I was really looking forward to that shit.

627
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.440
God Damn.
I'll be able to find it.

628
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.690
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

629
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.110
<v 1>I guess it's just that music that goes on for like fucking three hours or I can</v>

630
00:38:16.111 --> 00:38:21.020
just go back and listen to my old pod.
She,
you know,
is,
um,

631
00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.780
is amazing here.
I don't,
I don't even know how to fight.
Sorry.

632
00:38:23.781 --> 00:38:24.620
I just unplugged something.

633
00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.830
I don't even know how to fucking listen to my own podcast.
How pathetic is that?

634
00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:30.733
Um,

635
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.000
<v 4>okay.</v>

636
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.950
<v 1>All right.
I'll definitely be checking these things out.</v>

637
00:38:32.951 --> 00:38:37.940
He says there's a game called secret
that's pretty involved.

638
00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.830
I'm not sure you'd have time in your schedule,
but it's worth looking at.
Seek.

639
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:45.230
There's a game called secret Hitler

640
00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.630
object.
Find the person in the game who's had,

641
00:38:50.631 --> 00:38:54.200
who's starting the final solution again.
Um,

642
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:58.970
even the classics are fun to revisit.
Monopoly life,
et cetera.
Yeah,

643
00:38:58.971 --> 00:39:00.920
I love that stuff.
And my kid gets a little bit bigger.

644
00:39:00.921 --> 00:39:03.890
I want to start playing those games.
Have a game night.

645
00:39:03.891 --> 00:39:05.840
We already have the night where we go out.

646
00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.050
This will kill my standup career game that I can't,
I can't do that Gig.

647
00:39:09.051 --> 00:39:13.100
I have game night.
I can't do that Gig.
I have to go out for 'em.

648
00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.380
I have to go out,
take my family out for dinner.
Hey,
by the way,

649
00:39:18.381 --> 00:39:21.560
anybody who lives in La and you know some really good mom and pop places,

650
00:39:21.561 --> 00:39:24.590
it doesn't have to be healthy or anything.
What in the fuck is that?
Oh,

651
00:39:24.591 --> 00:39:26.930
it's a cat.
Jesus Christ.
I thought it was a raccoon.

652
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.580
I just saw a fucking cat

653
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:35.260
just came up on the fucking window through the blinds.

654
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:37.630
Who's like looking in like it was going to do something?

655
00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.710
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

656
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:43.240
<v 1>cancer.
Creepy man.
They just,
they just are mad.
They just always,
they,
they,</v>

657
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.130
they think too much.
You look at a dog,

658
00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:47.020
it's at this not fucking thinking about anything.

659
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.080
Catch just had that fucking that they're plotting,

660
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.073
<v 6>you know,</v>

661
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.490
<v 1>very female energy.</v>

662
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.520
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

663
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.950
<v 1>If you just sit next to your girlfriend and you just feel,
I'm thinking,</v>

664
00:39:57.951 --> 00:40:02.540
you're like,
oh fuck.
Here we go.
Here we go.
What's wrong now?

665
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:06.590
What the fuck is wrong now?
All right,
girlfriend forcing me to go vegan.

666
00:40:06.591 --> 00:40:11.520
Speaking of which,
I bet that guy filtered thinking.
Uh,
first of all,

667
00:40:11.521 --> 00:40:14.360
before we even get into this,
uh,

668
00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.120
your girl [inaudible] cannot force you to do anything.

669
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:20.780
You need to fucking eat a steak in front of her and say,
listen,

670
00:40:20.781 --> 00:40:24.080
you either love me or you dump.
I already know the solution to this

671
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.660
<v 6>all.
[inaudible]</v>

672
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:28.101
<v 1>hey,
Billy,</v>

673
00:40:28.101 --> 00:40:32.900
longtime listener and first time I've written in as I desperately need some

674
00:40:32.901 --> 00:40:36.470
advice.
My girl and I have been together for about eight months.
She's awesome.

675
00:40:36.471 --> 00:40:41.450
And I get laid about three times a week.
All right.
Um,

676
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.310
weird sentence.
Uh,

677
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.300
things have gradually gotten more serious and we now spend most evenings

678
00:40:47.301 --> 00:40:51.200
together eating dinner even though we don't stay over with each other every

679
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.700
night.
Well,
that's good.

680
00:40:52.701 --> 00:40:55.790
That's healthy that you still have a little bitty independence.

681
00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.010
We mostly eat dinner at her place,

682
00:40:58.011 --> 00:41:02.720
so she does the grocery shopping and she's also Vegan,
which isn't bad dude.

683
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:06.910
She's,
you know,
provided she's buying,
you know,

684
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.580
I guess organic.
How do you even tell if it's organic?

685
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:11.140
Because I've heard from a lot of people,

686
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:13.180
and this might come from the meat industry,
I've no idea,

687
00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:15.430
but I've heard from a lot of people that,
you know,
the amount of pesticides,

688
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:15.910
the spraying,

689
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:20.440
I'm sometimes actually eating some iceberg lettuce might be more for you than

690
00:41:20.441 --> 00:41:22.900
eating a fucking pig.
Um,
who knows.

691
00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.470
Also she's a Vegan.

692
00:41:25.471 --> 00:41:28.710
She recently decided that she was not going to buy meat for me.

693
00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.710
So it's easy to cook.
Plus it's better for the environment and health.

694
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.000
Basically.
All the fucking arguments vegans use against us.
Carnivores.
Yeah.

695
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:42.080
All the cows farting and up into the atmosphere.
I do love me,

696
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.110
but also love this girl and would honestly go Vegan for,

697
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.350
should I just be done with it and cut,

698
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.850
cut it meat.
Oh,

699
00:41:51.851 --> 00:41:56.200
see I knew you meant to say cut out meat or am I setting setting the tone for

700
00:41:56.201 --> 00:41:59.100
the whole relationship to get treated like a little bitch.

701
00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:04.060
Appreciate your advice.
All right.
I like that you're asking these questions,
sir.

702
00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.560
So you're still in a healthy place mentally.
Ah,
that's what I would say to her.

703
00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:09.580
Just be like,
listen.

704
00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.680
<v 6>MMM.</v>

705
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.800
<v 1>I'm willing to do this for us,
but I'm also,</v>

706
00:42:15.801 --> 00:42:20.801
I would be lying to you if I wasn't nervous that I was setting a tone that,

707
00:42:21.891 --> 00:42:26.120
you know,
if say you don't like March madness that I'm Grad,

708
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.160
I'm eventually going to stop watching it.

709
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.570
So you got to do it in the front of your way than that.

710
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.230
<v 6>MMM.</v>

711
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.560
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

712
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:42.330
I don't think going Vegan if the person knows what the fuck they're doing.

713
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.740
Cause there's a lot of fat vegetarians out there,
um,

714
00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:52.210
who are eating chips and has made from potatoes.
Um,

715
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:56.260
but the,
you know,
they're not necessarily healthy.
You know,

716
00:42:56.261 --> 00:42:58.690
when the carbon it up.
Um,

717
00:42:58.691 --> 00:43:01.410
I know there's a lot of fake meat and shit out there now.
There's a lot of,

718
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.920
there's a lot of ways to go.

719
00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.513
<v 6>MMM.</v>

720
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:10.330
<v 1>I am not nearly read enough on this subject to give you any sort of advice as to</v>

721
00:43:10.331 --> 00:43:14.530
which way to go.
But I think your concern is correct.

722
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.610
<v 6>MMM.</v>

723
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.910
<v 1>I would just go slow.
I would just say,
all right,
look,</v>

724
00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:24.410
if you just want to cook Vegan here and then I would just,
which isn't bad,

725
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.850
it's not bad to take a break from me that I wouldn't think.
Um,

726
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.360
I dunno,
I,
but I also know that it to really do

727
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.210
do the Vegan thing correctly.
I actually,

728
00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:44.450
you know something to be a meat eater and,
and,
and just eat them.

729
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:49.660
Just really eat well is you borderline need a fucking degree in something.

730
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.460
First of all,

731
00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:56.460
you got to be half a fucking private eye to try and figure out where the organic

732
00:43:56.811 --> 00:44:00.680
shit is because everything now is free range.
Everything is fucking Oregon.

733
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:03.320
The amount of chickens that they say are fucking free range,

734
00:44:03.321 --> 00:44:07.100
but there's still those fucking Arnold Schwartzenegger roided up fucking

735
00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:12.060
chickens.
Cause I remember when I watched that,
that documentary,
um,
um,

736
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:15.200
I forgot what the fuck it was called.
A not,

737
00:44:15.201 --> 00:44:19.640
you are what you eat something about food.
And I saw,
I was like,
man,
fuck this.

738
00:44:19.641 --> 00:44:23.910
I got to go find an organic chicken dude.
I mean,
I,

739
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:27.800
I had to go to a farmer's market and then I had to sift through all the bullshit

740
00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:31.010
there and get people to honestly tell me this guy finally,

741
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.870
almost like he had the Cuban,
the actual real Cubans in the back.

742
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.730
And when he held up,
when he showed me a what a real chicken looks like,
it looks,

743
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.330
I was like,
is that what,
is that a fucking pigeon?
It's like,
no,
that's,
that's,

744
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.000
that's what they're supposed to look like.

745
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

746
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:50.960
<v 1>It looked like a play a football player in the 1930s versus one in the fucking</v>

747
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.580
eighties and nineties when they were fucking all roid it up.

748
00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:59.060
Not like they're not doing right now.
Um,
Oh,
speaking of which,
uh,

749
00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:00.800
football players,
uh,

750
00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:04.550
congratulations to rob Gronkowski going out as a champion.

751
00:45:04.551 --> 00:45:09.551
Thank you so much for all your fucking everything it did over the years playing

752
00:45:10.611 --> 00:45:14.480
for the Patriots.
And I actually think it's a great move.

753
00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.280
Um,
especially when you see,
you know,

754
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:20.300
the results of playing the game and all that.

755
00:45:20.301 --> 00:45:22.970
I think he's leaving at a perfect time.
He's got his money.

756
00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.333
<v 0>MMM.</v>

757
00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.850
<v 1>He was really taken a lot of hits basically below the waist,</v>

758
00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:30.290
which was the only way to get them down.

759
00:45:30.291 --> 00:45:32.360
And they would just chop and his fucking legs down.

760
00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:36.620
And he was probably sick of going into surgeries and being hurt and all of that.

761
00:45:36.621 --> 00:45:40.220
And just the fact that the last game he played,
he made the biggest fucking play,

762
00:45:40.221 --> 00:45:43.190
that big catch that got us to touch down.
That uh,

763
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:47.250
put us over the top and one s are six super bowl.

764
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.890
<v 0>Um,
yeah.</v>

765
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:54.590
<v 1>Hall of fame,
New England Patriot without a doubt.
I don't know.
You know,</v>

766
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.290
I don't collect football cards anymore,
so I don't know what his,
uh,

767
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.000
his numbers are.
But I,
I,

768
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:04.440
I got a good feeling about the actual pro football hall of fame in Canton.
So,

769
00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.370
and I also did a roast with them one time and he was such a fucking cool guy.

770
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.901
And,
uh,

771
00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:13.350
there's a lot of people out there that think he says big dumb guy and he isn't.

772
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.880
I remember I was talking to him about,

773
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.333
<v 0>MMM,</v>

774
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.990
<v 1>we've talking about going to concerts and he was saying how much he fucking</v>

775
00:46:20.991 --> 00:46:21.360
hated.

776
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.370
How people was sitting there videoing their experience rather than having the

777
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.450
experience he's going like,
it's like you're there,

778
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.210
enjoy the experience and all I remember thinking in that going,

779
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.070
I wish people could hear this fucking conversation so that,
you know,

780
00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.053
cause they always just think,

781
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:38.480
they always think that about big fucking people that,
that they're fucking dumb.

782
00:46:38.481 --> 00:46:43.370
He was not,
he was not any,
did great on the roast.
Uh,
Betty was funny,

783
00:46:43.371 --> 00:46:48.160
you know.
Anyways,
so plowing ahead here.
I would,
um,
you know,

784
00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:52.480
I would use this thing as an opportunity to basically yet set some boundaries in

785
00:46:52.481 --> 00:46:55.990
your relationship in a funny way and just be like,
all right,
you know what,

786
00:46:55.991 --> 00:47:00.170
I'll be Vegan when I'm at your house and if,
um,

787
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.900
you know,
she's pushing you to become Vegan and your house just be like,
you know,

788
00:47:04.901 --> 00:47:09.430
I,
I really enjoy a steak.
I really do.
And,
um,

789
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.120
I'm going to keep eating it

790
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:17.270
and if you're going to break up with me over a pork chop than,
uh,

791
00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:21.650
they're probably really wasn't love here in the first place.
Um,
meanwhile,

792
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.513
you know,

793
00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:23.160
<v 0>yeah.</v>

794
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.040
<v 1>Read up on fucking nutrition.
I mean I'm,</v>

795
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:26.790
I'm giving you advice that I should be taken.

796
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:31.791
I should read up on it too because I've been really well over the last year and

797
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:37.130
now that I've,
uh,
I should say since July and I'm,

798
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:41.140
I had somebody put together a died for me and I pretty much loosely use that

799
00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:45.490
with some of my older bad habits.
I'm not going to lie to you and um,

800
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.600
and just cutting out the booze,
it's been really easy to sort of maintain.

801
00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.373
<v 2>Okay.</v>

802
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:51.801
<v 1>Um,
uh,</v>

803
00:47:51.801 --> 00:47:56.400
a decent body weight is probably the smartest thing that you could fucking do.

804
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.570
Learn how to defend yourself and learn how to eat right.
You know,

805
00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.140
figure out why you fucked up so you don't take it out on somebody else and go

806
00:48:04.141 --> 00:48:09.030
out and go find a great person and then work on the relationship like this

807
00:48:09.031 --> 00:48:10.830
person's doing rather than bailing.

808
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:15.150
Cause I actually have a theory about divorce where I think a lot of them,

809
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:18.780
they could have fixed it if they just were working on it along the way.

810
00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:22.110
And then you just start thinking like,
oh,
this person's a fucking asshole.

811
00:48:22.111 --> 00:48:26.100
And then he just had this fantasy that you're going to
meets it.

812
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.640
You just basically chasing that feeling you had when you both met each other in

813
00:48:29.641 --> 00:48:32.340
the beginning and you just never going to be brand new.

814
00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:34.740
You just have to accept that.

815
00:48:34.741 --> 00:48:39.270
But you can get back to different levels of emotional heights if you actually

816
00:48:39.271 --> 00:48:43.620
work on it.
Like the dumbest thing ever.
Just doing shit.
Like,

817
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.710
you know what family dinner night and everybody puts away their phones or

818
00:48:46.711 --> 00:48:50.550
whatever and it's just you.
Or if you're single or whatever,
you may not married,

819
00:48:50.551 --> 00:48:54.250
you can go out to a movie.
Okay.
And uh,
I'm telling you,

820
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:58.790
turn it off your phone is a fucking huge thing,
um,
that I've discovered,

821
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:03.730
especially if you get fucking massive add like me.
Okay.
Um,
where are we here?

822
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.840
Big Sugar.

823
00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:06.550
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

824
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:06.771
<v 1>All right.</v>

825
00:49:06.771 --> 00:49:10.160
I can't tell if this is a place to go skiing or this is more stuff about food.

826
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.290
Hey,
Billy bald balls.

827
00:49:12.291 --> 00:49:17.291
Last week or so you went off on one email proposing a massive tax on the rich.

828
00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.800
No,
I didn't.
No,
I did not.

829
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:27.250
I went off on a massive tax on honest Americans.

830
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.270
Okay.
This is not a tax on the rich.

831
00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:36.271
This is a tax on people who are not smart enough or corrupt enough to have their

832
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:39.160
money in offshore accounts.

833
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.420
That's what I went off on.

834
00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:44.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

835
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.210
<v 1>He said then I learned about how tax dollars are feeding billions to sugar</v>

836
00:49:48.211 --> 00:49:49.044
industry.

837
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:54.090
The U s government has subsidized the domestic sugar industry so much that

838
00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:59.091
domestic sugar prices are up to 50% more than their international counterparts.

839
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:03.750
Separate issue.
Separate issue

840
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:10.050
the government does is by establishing quotas that limit imports.

841
00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:14.820
So now more domestic production means that there is more farmland to take up by

842
00:50:14.821 --> 00:50:19.710
sugar.
Yeah.
Which is people are starting to say is a carcinogen.
Um,

843
00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:22.500
there's another thing too,
when you cut sugar out of your diet,

844
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.260
like I've been having this fucking almond butter.
I know.

845
00:50:25.261 --> 00:50:29.120
Big Hollywood fucking phony.
You have to apologize for trying to eat right.
Right.

846
00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:34.010
Uh,
it's like when I drove a Prius,
savage dude,
but he fucking,
you know,

847
00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:38.300
sandals homophobic shit to me cause I was cause you're just reminding people

848
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.134
that hey man,

849
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.730
the way we're doing this shit is steering us into the fucking sun here.
Um,

850
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.790
anyways,
uh,

851
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.640
and my wife had bought some peanut butter for my daughter and it was just the

852
00:50:49.641 --> 00:50:51.110
regular kind and I,
you know,

853
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:55.010
we ran out of almond butter and I put some on some toast and I bit into it and I

854
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:58.040
have fortunately such little amount of sugar,
my diet.

855
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.000
Then I bit into it like I literally am like my fucking my mouth puckered like

856
00:51:02.001 --> 00:51:06.920
Jesus Christ.
I had no idea how much sugar is in fucking peanut butter.

857
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:09.260
It's insane.
So anyways,
he goes,

858
00:51:09.261 --> 00:51:12.890
if you are wondering why kids are getting beards at 10,

859
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.570
then this might be why these companies don't want to pay for real sugar.

860
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.670
So they just make another sweet poison and call it sugar free lead volume.

861
00:51:22.671 --> 00:51:23.570
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

862
00:51:23.571 --> 00:51:28.571
The environmental impacts are also dire with sugar beets causing worsening soil

863
00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:32.420
quality and water pollution that is much worse than other crops.

864
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:33.820
The worst part of all is,

865
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:39.350
is the insane amount of money these bastards get like one Florida farm families

866
00:51:39.351 --> 00:51:43.890
getting 150 to 250 million that comes out of the taxpayer's pocket.

867
00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.920
Separate issue.
Also,

868
00:51:45.921 --> 00:51:49.760
the increased sugar prices may companies in food processing,

869
00:51:49.761 --> 00:51:54.650
you have to lay off 10,000 to 20,000 employees a year while sugar growers can

870
00:51:54.651 --> 00:51:58.610
usually make up to $750,000 a year,

871
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:03.500
sorry,
750 million a year.
No,
70 to 50,000 a year.

872
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:07.970
That doesn't make any sense that you put the wrong number there.
Um,

873
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:10.450
<v 0>uh,</v>

874
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:15.450
<v 1>the American sugar alliance is one of the most funded lobbying groups with a</v>

875
00:52:15.491 --> 00:52:20.260
handful of companies bringing in the mass amounts of the 4 billion in subsidies

876
00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:21.580
the tax payers give.

877
00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.790
I hope you found this important and interesting and has always go fuck yourself.

878
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:25.653
Yeah.

879
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:30.990
Handful of look at that is one of the most funded lobbying groups.

880
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.690
Yep.
And what do you think all that money goes?

881
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:34.660
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

882
00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.170
<v 1>Do you think it just goes to the lobbying or do you think it goes into</v>

883
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.300
politicians pet projects?

884
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.190
It's fucking ridiculous how corrupt that is.

885
00:52:44.191 --> 00:52:48.930
And you're going to go after the people who create an APP or people who start

886
00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:52.560
movement watches.
These are these,
these people are the fucking,
yeah,

887
00:52:52.561 --> 00:52:56.070
they had the fucking problem.
You can ignore all the corruptions.

888
00:52:56.250 --> 00:53:00.420
So here's a guy here who's basically going to fucking tear me a new asshole.

889
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.530
Alright?
And I love the title.
Why I stopped listening.

890
00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:11.480
And this is the classic baby that exists now.

891
00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:15.470
You know,
you,
you know you,
you don't,
you,
you have a difference of opinion.

892
00:53:15.471 --> 00:53:18.770
So you're going to stop listening.
You fucking child

893
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.940
is,
if my words somehow affected your life,
like I said,

894
00:53:23.941 --> 00:53:26.400
that and then what the IRS

895
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.600
<v 3>is actually going to be going after these fucking people did not.
All right.
Why?</v>

896
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:34.300
I stopped listening,
Bill,
I've stopped listening to your pod.

897
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:42.990
What are you fucking eight years old?
I felt that I should tell you why.

898
00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.630
[inaudible] much like a restaurant who loses a loyal customer,
wants to know why,

899
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:52.350
what went wrong?
You,
you know,
you love always putting those words in my mouth.

900
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:56.520
Like I give a fuck that an absolute child isn't going to listen to my fucking

901
00:53:56.521 --> 00:54:00.690
podcast.
Uh,
so no hard feelings,
but here it is.

902
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.580
You should like flip your hair right now.
Like d Schneider.
Is that his name?

903
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.860
The guy from twisted sister,
when he made that point,

904
00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:12.330
you know when he was in front of Congress about the PMRC man.
Um,

905
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:17.360
I've never heard a more selfish mouth breathing uninformed money grubbing cont

906
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:21.900
speak in my entire life.
This is what I love.
I don't even know.

907
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:26.310
I don't make $10 million a year.
I don't make $10 million a year.

908
00:54:26.311 --> 00:54:30.810
So I was actually defending people whose tax money would actually go,

909
00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:31.770
I guess to help me.

910
00:54:31.771 --> 00:54:35.880
And somehow I'm money grubbing because this person's so up the ass of their own

911
00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:40.350
fucking point.
They can't even listen to what it is that I'm saying.
He goes,

912
00:54:40.351 --> 00:54:44.970
sometimes you say something halfway smart,
but it is surrounded.

913
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.990
He says my so much bullshit.
He's calling me dumb.

914
00:54:48.991 --> 00:54:52.560
He didn't even hit spellcheck by so much bullshit.

915
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:56.730
It makes me feel you stumbled into saying it by accident.
Yes sir.

916
00:54:56.731 --> 00:55:00.780
Because no one could ever be as smart as you like how a monkey banging on a

917
00:55:00.781 --> 00:55:04.650
typewriter might somehow type out Shakespeare.

918
00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.430
I don't think a monkey banging out a typewriter.

919
00:55:09.431 --> 00:55:11.160
It might somehow type out Shakespeare.

920
00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:15.700
Think what you meant meant to say is that he might accidentally spell a word

921
00:55:15.701 --> 00:55:20.130
correctly,
like might accidentally spelled the or APP.

922
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:23.110
I don't think you meant Shakespeare.
All right.
You know what I'm finding,

923
00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:26.380
I think you wrote this in a very high emotional state here.

924
00:55:26.381 --> 00:55:30.580
So I'll cut you some slack.
And uh,
I've always said I'm a moron.

925
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.940
Okay.
And even now that I'm reading,

926
00:55:33.941 --> 00:55:37.240
I'm reading like the fucking Beastie boy autobiography.

927
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:42.310
I'm reading the fucking,
which actually is,
I'm finding out,
uh,
is,

928
00:55:42.311 --> 00:55:44.790
is a history book,
um,

929
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:50.550
on a certain John Rowe of music that I believe the kids call hip hop.
Um,

930
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:50.891
all right.

931
00:55:50.891 --> 00:55:55.891
The biggest problem is you cannot see beyond your own experience making $10

932
00:55:56.020 --> 00:56:00.750
million a year is not my experience.
I've never made $10 million in a year.

933
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:02.401
Okay.

934
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:07.401
And this is most evident in your recent diatribe about the 70% tax rate.

935
00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:16.460
I Dunno.
I like to think I,
I get,
you know,
I don't always,
but I like to think,

936
00:56:16.461 --> 00:56:20.270
you know,
I try,
I try to listen.
Listen to both sides I guess.
I guess I,

937
00:56:20.271 --> 00:56:24.730
I guess I don't,
in case your memory is blinded your own rage.

938
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.990
Uh,
what about your rage?

939
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.270
Let me go over some dumb ass things that you said on Monday,
March 18th.

940
00:56:33.271 --> 00:56:34.200
First of all,
sir,

941
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.920
you calling me a mouth breather and you're saying that I have rage and you're

942
00:56:37.921 --> 00:56:42.660
literally misspelling words and you're so angry at me right now that you can't

943
00:56:42.661 --> 00:56:46.470
present your opinion without calling me names anyways.

944
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.980
You call people making 10 million plus a year.

945
00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:54.570
Regular guys who are deserving of empathy.
Sure.

946
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:58.200
Some are your woe is me.
Lament of these poor,

947
00:56:58.201 --> 00:57:02.190
poor millionaires made my blood boil.
Exactly,

948
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:06.480
exactly.
Ig.
Look how you just phrase that.

949
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:10.660
Look at these poor,
poor millionaires.

950
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:15.460
You're judging them and who they are because of how much money they make.

951
00:57:15.461 --> 00:57:18.710
And you're going to turn it into a Disney movie where anybody who make some

952
00:57:18.711 --> 00:57:20.410
money is fucking evil.

953
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.910
Makes my bud blood boil.
Fuck you.

954
00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.750
This guy literally just said blinded by rage.
Fuck you.

955
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:33.820
You implied that money tax from millionaires goes directly back to lazy cons

956
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:38.360
making less.
I don't remember saying that.

957
00:57:38.361 --> 00:57:41.780
Maybe I did.
Maybe I did.
All right.

958
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:45.500
You said it isn't fair that people being honest with their income have to pay

959
00:57:45.501 --> 00:57:49.820
this rate.
Uh,
while rich people hide their incomes overseas.

960
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.750
You also said that tax money is being wasted,
wasted.

961
00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:58.660
And then it just says corrupt bullshit.
I agree with both of these things.

962
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:02.020
These are separate problems that also need to be fixed.

963
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:03.880
You're often being,

964
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.810
you're often being dumb bullshit like this

965
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.033
<v 4>up.</v>

966
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:15.310
<v 3>What is,
if the government can't do two things at once.</v>

967
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:21.490
Okay.
I think with your fucking half written email,
calling me a moron,

968
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.180
ser,
they're not going after these people.

969
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:27.500
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

970
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.900
<v 3>they're not
okay.</v>

971
00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:35.780
It's been deemed too difficult.
Okay.

972
00:58:35.781 --> 00:58:39.230
Because what they do is be,
I already explained this shit,

973
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:43.310
is how was it explained to me in layman's term?
You have a fucking company,

974
00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:47.360
okay?
You have a bunny,
a pile of fucking money.
So you crew.

975
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.450
So you fucking either incorporate,

976
00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.200
<v 4>yeah,</v>

977
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:55.590
<v 3>in a a a different country or you,
you create a,</v>

978
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.910
a fake,
phony fucking company in that country,

979
00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:03.770
which bills you're legit company a ridiculous amount of fucking money.

980
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.370
So then you're then able to show that your company somehow lost money.

981
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.830
So now you don't have to pay any taxes,

982
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:14.180
but now your money is in this fake company.
So how do you get it right?

983
00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:17.510
You'd be having it in this foreign fucking island,
right?

984
00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:20.180
Which is a different country.
You pay some people off there,

985
00:59:20.181 --> 00:59:24.080
so you let the money go.
Then you start another company in a different island,

986
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:27.860
and then they build that company and you just keep going hopscotch and through

987
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:32.320
the fucking Caribbean or wherever the fuck this shit goes down.
All right?

988
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:38.080
And then the last company goes back to you and gives you like 50 million,

989
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.460
$100 million in the form of alone,
which is untakeable,

990
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.540
and then you're allegedly going to pay it back,
which you don't.

991
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:52.340
And when you don't,
that phony fucking company forgives the loan.

992
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.560
That's the base that in layman's terms,
that's the way it was explained to me.

993
00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:02.930
And the problem is,
is that with each one of those islands that it goes through,

994
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:08.270
it's,
it's a whole new fucking,
it's a different country,
a different government,

995
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:11.960
and you have to go through a mountain of red tape.
So they have seven,

996
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:16.961
10 14 of these fucking companies all ping pong and all through the fucking

997
01:00:17.001 --> 01:00:20.300
islands.
And it just be,
it just,
it's too difficult.

998
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.101
It's too difficult.

999
01:00:22.101 --> 01:00:27.050
And then what you have is honest fucking people who took a fucking chance.

1000
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:33.350
Okay.
And risk basically sleeping alone on a Fuckin futon with no wife,

1001
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:36.350
no fucking family maxed out there.
Fucking credit cards.

1002
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:40.700
And most of those people lose.
And then you're going to come in to take,

1003
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.880
there's no way you can present an argument or 70000070% paying taxes on one

1004
01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:52.280
fucking dollar,
70% you cannot set that fucking precedent by the government,

1005
01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.390
okay?
Considering they are complete corrupt pieces of shit.

1006
01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:00.230
A standup comedian is not a corrupt piece of shit,

1007
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:02.810
okay?

1008
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:05.810
He's not looking at the other way with all that shit that person just said about

1009
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:09.680
sugar.
These are not separate issues.
What you have as a broken fucking system,

1010
01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.420
which is now going to take,

1011
01:01:12.421 --> 01:01:16.650
put duct tape on the fucking problem and go after innocent fucking people and

1012
01:01:16.651 --> 01:01:21.270
for you to call me a moron because you just sit there and you,
oh,
these poor,

1013
01:01:21.271 --> 01:01:24.150
poor millionaires.
If somebody is fucking honest,

1014
01:01:24.151 --> 01:01:27.510
they shouldn't have to fucking pay for it.
Look at the Clintons.

1015
01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:29.850
Look at the bushes.
Look at the Obamas.
Look at them.

1016
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:32.640
Look how fucking corrupt they are.

1017
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.300
The most he ever made was foreign and fucking 500 fucking grand being president

1018
01:01:39.301 --> 01:01:42.990
of the United States and they're all worth millions and millions and millions of

1019
01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:47.670
does go look,
go.
Look at who they fucking give this speech to go look at it.

1020
01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:51.690
Who Obama's first two fucking speeches where to like two of the biggest fucking

1021
01:01:51.691 --> 01:01:54.570
banks that were behind the 2008 scandal

1022
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.960
and they're going up vacuuming up all that fucking money.

1023
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:07.800
It's fucking Michelle Obama has the fucking balls to put out an inspirational

1024
01:02:07.801 --> 01:02:10.320
book on how to be a better fucking person.

1025
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:14.670
It makes your dreams come true is she has all that corporate money fucking

1026
01:02:14.671 --> 01:02:17.850
fallen out from between her fucking titties.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1027
01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.000
What I want

1028
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.300
<v 2>to,
I want you to,
if you're still listening,
what you,
I know you are.
What?</v>

1029
01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.110
Poor poor millionaires.
Well why do you,
why are you judging somebody?

1030
01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.760
Cause they fucking had the balls to put their entire future on the fucking three

1031
01:02:31.761 --> 01:02:35.180
zillion to one dog with the limp at the back of the fucking race.

1032
01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.380
And the thing came in.

1033
01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:41.000
So now they have to give away 70% of their money north of $10 million.

1034
01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.230
<v 3>Listen,
if you're saying that that's what the number is in,</v>

1035
01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:51.190
everybody's going to pay 70% north,
you know,

1036
01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.730
north of $10 million,
which once again,
I'm not making,

1037
01:02:55.950 --> 01:03:00.600
so I'm literally arguing for fucking people that I'm not okay.

1038
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:04.590
But I plan on making more than that and I'm in a country that allows me to do
it.

1039
01:03:04.591 --> 01:03:07.720
Thank Christ.
All right?

1040
01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:10.150
And I hope that you fucking do it someday.

1041
01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:15.690
And it's not my fucking fault that you don't have the fucking balls or an idea

1042
01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:19.240
or the charisma or whatever the fuck you need to get to that level.

1043
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:24.090
I haven't had it yet,
but I'm not going to,
just because I haven't,

1044
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:27.780
I'm not gonna fucking punish these other fucking people.
And here's the thing.

1045
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.260
If every mother fucker in this country,

1046
01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:32.360
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1047
01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.193
<v 3>okay,</v>

1048
01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:37.880
making north of $10 million had to fucking pay that.

1049
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:39.380
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1050
01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.410
<v 3>then you are going somewhere.
But here's the fucking thing though.</v>

1051
01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.670
Here's the thing though.
Where is that money going to go?

1052
01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:49.100
Are you going to fix where the fuck it's going to go?

1053
01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.770
Because are you going to somehow fix our fucking foreign policy?

1054
01:03:54.771 --> 01:03:59.060
So we don't get broke flight in 3,500 jerk offs on a fucking jungle gym.

1055
01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.790
You're going to ignore all of those fucking problems and just take a select few

1056
01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:08.600
group of fucking Americans who did nothing wrong,

1057
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.300
made it in a sports,
created a watch company,
created a shaving company,

1058
01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:22.970
fucking created some something in their standup act that fucking made enough

1059
01:04:22.971 --> 01:04:25.800
Americans want to go to this show that they're making a,

1060
01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:30.570
you're going to punish them.
You're going to co sign on.

1061
01:04:30.571 --> 01:04:34.080
They have to give away 70% of that fucking money.
I just can't get behind that.

1062
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:37.091
I mean,

1063
01:04:37.091 --> 01:04:40.990
all of these politician blow in these fucking people who aren't paying fucking

1064
01:04:40.991 --> 01:04:41.824
taxes

1065
01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:48.130
and then they're going to come out the other side and then go give speeches to

1066
01:04:48.131 --> 01:04:52.120
people who don't pay fucking taxes and companies that don't pay fucking taxes

1067
01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.660
and take that money and stick it in their fucking pocket and go buy themselves a

1068
01:04:55.661 --> 01:04:58.990
big mansion on fucking Martha's vineyard.
That's all fucking fine.

1069
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:04.040
Unfucking believable and just sit there and say that separate issues.

1070
01:05:04.041 --> 01:05:07.250
That's all tax issues.
That's all the same fucking issue.

1071
01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:11.650
Anyways.
Um,

1072
01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:16.360
you said it isn't fair that people being honest with their income have to pay

1073
01:05:16.361 --> 01:05:19.690
this rate.
Rich people hide their income overseas.

1074
01:05:19.691 --> 01:05:23.170
You also said tax money is being wasted on corporate corporate bullshit.

1075
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.760
I agree with Paul.
Ira.
Read this,

1076
01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:27.760
this half a fucking paragraph that this person wrote.

1077
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:32.380
You said we should pay politicians.
Fuck you money.
Uh,

1078
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.970
you don't think if that happens,

1079
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.380
even every money grubbing corrupt con will do anything possible to run for

1080
01:05:38.381 --> 01:05:40.270
office and win an election,

1081
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:44.920
including promising corporation special deals and in exchange for campaigns.

1082
01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:49.840
So I do believe that.
I do believe that you've been saying this for years.
Yes.

1083
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:50.740
I believe that.

1084
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:56.430
I can't believe nobody's called you out on how fucking stupid it is,
dude.
You,

1085
01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.120
what's you're doing is you're basically going to be like this.
Well listen,

1086
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.590
we can't get these guys,

1087
01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:07.540
so let's get the people we can get who haven't poisoned the food supply,

1088
01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:11.020
who don't,
who don't dictate our foreign policy.
Yeah.

1089
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:12.730
Fuck all of that shit.

1090
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:17.230
Fuck the $20 trillion sitting in the islands in the Caymans.

1091
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:22.420
Let's go after the third baseman on the New York Yankees.
Yeah.
Fuck this guy.

1092
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.290
This doesn't make any sense,
dude.
What could,

1093
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:30.970
you can put a name and a face on that fucking guy and because he was better in

1094
01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:35.380
gym class than you,
you have this underlying resentment that you call him a poor,

1095
01:06:35.381 --> 01:06:37.900
poor millionaire.
Anyways,
he goes,

1096
01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:42.901
I think the biggest issue is that you come from comedy and you can't see beyond

1097
01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:46.420
that business.
I,
I seem to be talking about a bunch of businesses,
don't I?

1098
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:49.540
I'm talking about our foreign policy.
I'm talking about the food supply.

1099
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:53.750
Oh,
well how much further do I have to go?

1100
01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.880
I think everyone in this country should be in the position where their success

1101
01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:03.170
is measured by how hard they work and how much they contribute.

1102
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:09.560
That is mostly true in comedy.
Dude.
First of all,

1103
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.460
I'll throw you a hypocritical bolt.
I'm gonna.
I'll,
I'll,

1104
01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:14.960
what the fuck do you know about comedy?

1105
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:22.670
Right?
I know as much about comedy.
Is it,
I mean,

1106
01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:25.130
I know as much about your job as you know about comedy,

1107
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:30.240
so why is your opinion on Comedians more valid
anyways?

1108
01:07:30.241 --> 01:07:34.650
If you are a millionaire and your daddy was a famous comedian,

1109
01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.610
notice how they use the word Daddy,
right?

1110
01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.020
That will only take you so far in comedy if you're not funny.

1111
01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:50.380
This is not true in every single business.
For example,

1112
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:54.700
if Donald Trump had just invested his father's money in the stock market,

1113
01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:57.910
he would be Richard than he is now.

1114
01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.730
What the fuck is that based on?

1115
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:06.790
Like what is the stock market guaranteed you're going to make money.

1116
01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:11.770
The stock market is corrupt,
but he is a very successful,

1117
01:08:11.771 --> 01:08:14.830
hardworking man deserving of all our empathy.

1118
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:19.680
Just like every other rich asshole.
Yeah,
Dude.

1119
01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.040
You know what you have a problem with?

1120
01:08:21.041 --> 01:08:24.970
You have a problem with anybody who's rich cause you're all,

1121
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:29.290
you're putting all of them.
You're using all the buzzwords.
Daddy,
rich,

1122
01:08:29.291 --> 01:08:33.130
asshole,
poor,
poor millionaire.
Anyways,

1123
01:08:33.131 --> 01:08:38.050
I graduated from Harvard in 2015 I'm a public school teacher.

1124
01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:42.880
One of the people you say tax money should be going towards yes.

1125
01:08:42.881 --> 01:08:45.190
Tax money that was already collected,
sir.

1126
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.310
That was wasted on a neverending fucking war.
Yes,

1127
01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:54.250
yes.
But let's not go after the people that wasted that.

1128
01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:58.750
Let's take more tax dollars from somebody who fucking plays fucking power

1129
01:08:58.751 --> 01:09:02.860
forward for the fucking Cleveland Cavaliers anyways,

1130
01:09:02.861 --> 01:09:07.000
unlike my classmates making millions,
no matter how hard I work,

1131
01:09:07.001 --> 01:09:09.280
no matter how much time I spend on my students,

1132
01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:14.230
I don't earn another sent over my $48,000 salary.

1133
01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:15.630
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1134
01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:20.220
<v 3>Okay.
And did you not know that going into that fucking business?</v>

1135
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:26.540
Like what do,
what do you want me to do here?
I don't think you should earn that.

1136
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:28.970
I think you should earn way more than that,

1137
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.990
but I don't think that regular fucking people who don't stick their money in the

1138
01:09:32.991 --> 01:09:37.991
Cayman fucking islands are now required to pay for you because all these other

1139
01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:40.220
Americans are paying no taxes.

1140
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.770
I,
I don't,
I don't feel that that's where that money should come from.

1141
01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.530
I feel that you should make way more money than that.

1142
01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.810
I think that you do one of the most important jobs in this country,

1143
01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:59.130
and I think you should get,
you should get paid,
I don't know,

1144
01:09:59.131 --> 01:10:01.170
200 fucking grand a year to do it.

1145
01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.850
And I think you should have all the supplies that you fucking need.
I 100.

1146
01:10:06.851 --> 01:10:09.130
I just don't agree with where you want to get that money.

1147
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.061
He goes,

1148
01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:16.890
I can earn less than a thousand dollars in the next year pay.

1149
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:20.040
I can't believe you're a fucking teacher by the way,
by the way,
you read,

1150
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:21.910
you wrote this fucking thing,
but I'm going to,

1151
01:10:21.911 --> 01:10:24.840
I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you were fucking

1152
01:10:24.841 --> 01:10:29.070
pissed off and fucking fired this thing off.
Or this is a giant voice text.

1153
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:34.110
Um,
like an earn less than a thousand in the next year.

1154
01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:39.140
Pay Increase based on how my students do on statewide standardized text tests.

1155
01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:43.630
In fact,
if I want to spend money on class material,

1156
01:10:43.631 --> 01:10:45.120
it comes out of my own pocket,

1157
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:50.570
can deduct a maximum of $250 a year.
Meanwhile,
some of the richest continents,

1158
01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:54.870
country are using their money to try and make public schools worse yet.

1159
01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:56.010
I've got to tell you something,
dude,

1160
01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:59.610
these aren't the guys you're going to get what that 70% tax thing.

1161
01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:00.960
And here's another thing,
dude.

1162
01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:06.000
Rather than call me a fucking dumb ass and a monkey hitting a fucking keyboard.

1163
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:12.230
You know,
an idea that I had was I would like to,

1164
01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.270
as a
to do.

1165
01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.720
There's public schools in my fucking neighborhood here,

1166
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:24.080
and I was walking by one the other day and I saw an auditorium and I'm thinking,

1167
01:11:24.561 --> 01:11:28.070
wait a minute,
they have an auditorium,
they got seats.
They've got to stage.

1168
01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:33.460
Why don't I do a fucking fundraiser for the public school?

1169
01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:39.020
That was my thought,
and I know I'm a mouth breather and fucking moron,
dude,

1170
01:11:39.021 --> 01:11:41.000
you and I are on the same fucking team here,

1171
01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.010
and we should not be fighting with each other.

1172
01:11:43.011 --> 01:11:48.011
We should be joining forces and demanding that these corrupt politicians go

1173
01:11:48.051 --> 01:11:49.220
after all the,

1174
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:54.250
all these fucking asshole corporations and individuals who pay no taxes

1175
01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.200
rather than fucking as we're both like fucking trying to scamper out of the

1176
01:12:00.201 --> 01:12:04.100
boiling water point,
pulling each other down by each other's ankles.

1177
01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:07.890
All right,
but here's the funny fucking thing

1178
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:12.120
is the second I've thought about doing that show,

1179
01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:17.180
all I thought was of the hashtags by the fucking parents and all of these

1180
01:12:18.571 --> 01:12:22.860
fucking lunatics whose minds have been poisoned by social media and all.

1181
01:12:22.861 --> 01:12:26.220
It's going to take his fucking one of them to go out there.

1182
01:12:26.221 --> 01:12:30.360
I can't do my fucking act in a public school auditorium in front of the fucking

1183
01:12:30.361 --> 01:12:33.690
parents.
How the fuck do I do that?

1184
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.020
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1185
01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.080
<v 3>I know how I do it.</v>

1186
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:41.670
What I do is I get those cell phone bags and everybody has to put their fucking

1187
01:12:41.671 --> 01:12:44.430
cell phones in the fucking bag before you go in there.

1188
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.560
That's how I'm going to have to end up doing it,

1189
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.980
and unfortunately that's some of the money that I could have given that it could

1190
01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:54.180
have given back to the public school.
So here's the thing.
All right,
sir,

1191
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.370
and I know you're not listening anymore.

1192
01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:01.770
I'm going to start doing those fucking shows.
I'm going to start doing shows.

1193
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:06.690
I'm going to pick a fucking school and I'm going to give back that way,
that way.

1194
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:08.610
I would rather do it that way.

1195
01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:13.290
Then eventually having to pay 60% fucking taxes on my income because I'm already

1196
01:13:13.291 --> 01:13:18.060
paying 56 that's just on my income.
That's not property tax.

1197
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:20.970
That's not fucking,
uh,
um,
sales tax,

1198
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:24.150
tax on gas is all these fucking hidden taxes done.
I'm already paying.

1199
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:28.920
I'm lucky at this point,
if I'm keeping 30% of my fucking money,

1200
01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.140
I would cringe to see what the fuck I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

1201
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:39.200
I'm paying and fucking taxes and I know you have no sympathy for me cause I had

1202
01:13:39.511 --> 01:13:44.511
the audacity to have my fucking 300 to one fucking gray hound come across the

1203
01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:49.770
finish line and I won and that you fucking resent me for that,

1204
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.130
you know,
and you lump me in to people and I'm not even at that fucking level.

1205
01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:57.551
All right?

1206
01:13:57.551 --> 01:14:01.360
But I've been around the block enough times to know that if that's 70% thing

1207
01:14:01.361 --> 01:14:02.590
gets fucking pass,
dude,

1208
01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:05.680
they're not going to stop at 10 and they're gonna keep going down.

1209
01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:07.510
So what I got out of this is,
you know something,

1210
01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:11.710
I'm going to do one of those fucking shows.
Um,

1211
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.400
at the public schools and I'm going to start doing those fucking things and I'm

1212
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:15.850
going to get,

1213
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:19.030
I don't wanna get those fucking cell phone bags and I'll stick them in there.

1214
01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:21.580
And that's the way that I'm going to fucking give back.
And I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,

1215
01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:25.630
I'm gonna get a positive out of this.
All right?

1216
01:14:25.631 --> 01:14:28.270
And I think what regular Americans need to do,

1217
01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:31.450
which is what I still am,

1218
01:14:31.451 --> 01:14:34.630
and you can fucking demonize me all you want because I'm the finally fucking

1219
01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:39.550
making money.
27 years into this fucking shit.
All right?

1220
01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:42.100
Where the fuck were you when I was sitting on the Futon,
waking up,

1221
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:46.720
having panic attacks when I had no manager,
no fucking agent.

1222
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:49.360
And all agents were telling me I had a weird look.

1223
01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:52.930
That's what he used to say to me.
By the way,

1224
01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:57.370
there is an unwritten rule in this fucking business that if you are a redhead,

1225
01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:02.470
you are not the lead in a movie.
Um,
I dunno if that's gradually changing,

1226
01:15:02.471 --> 01:15:06.010
but I remember I used to go to fucking auditions and like they would be prepared

1227
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.830
three scenes.
It was back when I had a black and white photo.

1228
01:15:08.831 --> 01:15:10.860
So I kind of looked like I had brown hair.
It was in [inaudible] 90.

1229
01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.890
They had moose in there.
Oh right.
And I would come in as they looked at me,

1230
01:15:14.891 --> 01:15:17.260
I would see the look on their face.
They'd be like,
okay,

1231
01:15:17.261 --> 01:15:20.380
we're just going to read the first scene.
Yeah.
It's like,
dude,

1232
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:22.600
you're red head and male.
You're not the lead.
You're the friend,

1233
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:23.861
you're the friend.

1234
01:15:23.861 --> 01:15:27.340
You're the one who doesn't get the girl and all of that fucking shit.
Um,

1235
01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:32.740
so anyways,
we should be helping each other out,
sir.
Okay.

1236
01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:36.460
And here's the thing,
if I became a comedian and I didn't make it,

1237
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:40.060
I wouldn't be crying to you about it.
Okay.

1238
01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:43.810
So you were the one who went to fucking Harvard and decided to become a public

1239
01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:48.760
school fucking teacher.
You knew what the deal was.
Okay.

1240
01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.830
That's what the fuck you wanted to do.

1241
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:55.780
And I'm going to believe you that you went to Harvard and that you are a public

1242
01:15:55.781 --> 01:15:59.110
school teach.
Cause you know on the Internet people can be like,
I fucking,

1243
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:03.130
I hate Trump.
And I'm a Republican.
People can do that all the fucking time.

1244
01:16:03.131 --> 01:16:07.300
I'm going to take all this face value and that you're actually a teacher and

1245
01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:12.160
that you wrote an email that was filled at this many spelling mistakes.
Um,
this,

1246
01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:15.970
this much fucking hypocritical behavior.

1247
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.970
What you're yelling at me that I can't see past the end of my own nose.

1248
01:16:18.971 --> 01:16:23.290
I know the whole fucking thing was about you and your job and where the fuck you

1249
01:16:23.291 --> 01:16:27.250
sit in the world.
I didn't really see,
I didn't really see how you were.
You were,

1250
01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.390
um,
stepping outside of yourself.
Um,
so here's the thing,
sir,

1251
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:35.590
or ma'am,
whoever fucking wrote this thing,
I'm going to start doing that.

1252
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:41.230
All right?
I'm going to start doing fucking shows,
raising money for some,

1253
01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:45.940
for some fucking public,
uh,
I don't know,
high schools or whatever.

1254
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.460
Get him some money for some computers or whatever.

1255
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:52.570
And actually in a way I'd be helping myself cause I get a kid now and all the

1256
01:16:52.571 --> 01:16:53.980
public schools suck out here.

1257
01:16:53.981 --> 01:16:57.400
So now you got to go to private schools from the beginning,
you know,

1258
01:16:57.490 --> 01:17:02.490
and you're like hundreds of thousands of dollars down the fucking drain.

1259
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.020
Because once again,

1260
01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:08.350
people who didn't pay taxes and all the money that all the money that we,

1261
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:09.111
we've already bought,

1262
01:17:09.111 --> 01:17:12.500
the money that they already fucking collect does not go with a fuck.

1263
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:15.710
It should be.
Um,
so I appreciate your input.

1264
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:18.120
I hope you're mature enough to see,
you know,

1265
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:23.200
I hope you don't decide not to keep listening to this podcast because of

1266
01:17:23.361 --> 01:17:28.361
something else because it sucks because it's not funny because it got boring to

1267
01:17:28.371 --> 01:17:31.820
you after awhile.
But if this is the reason why you're not listening,
you're,

1268
01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:33.440
you're,
you're a fucking baby.

1269
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:37.760
You're a big fucking baby and you're really not solving the fucking problem.

1270
01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:43.800
Um,
and I think it's really ignorant to,

1271
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.870
to demonize people that,
that made it on their own,

1272
01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:52.850
made it in a sport,
started a company,
you know,

1273
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.850
but I draw the line at,
you know,
if you made it in a sport,

1274
01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:59.420
you don't pay taxes or you started a company and now that,

1275
01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:01.970
that your next move is to get your money outside the company.

1276
01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:04.970
I don't support that.
And if you're a comedian,
you need to do that.

1277
01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:09.860
I don't support that.
I don't,
I love Willie Nelson not paying taxes.

1278
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:14.480
Don't support that.
Okay.
And I have no problem paying my fair share.

1279
01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:19.220
And I think at 56% plus all the others,
I think I'm more than doing it.

1280
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:20.600
Unfortunately.

1281
01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:24.620
My tax money that I'm paying is getting nowhere near your school.

1282
01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:27.830
And that is not my fault,
but that is the problem.

1283
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.180
And those are not separate issues from where I'm from.
All right.
That's the,

1284
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.020
that's the podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.
And I,
I'm,
I'm gonna,
you know,

1285
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:41.960
I'm going to make,
do on my,
my,
my,
uh,
campaign promise.

1286
01:18:41.961 --> 01:18:46.130
I'm going to find a fucking school and I'm going to do it.
All right.
That's it.

1287
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:48.650
Go fuck yourselves and I'll see you on Thursday.
