00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.887
-- talking about molecular
orbital theory.

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:22.775
And remember what the key idea
was, there?

00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:26.853
The key idea was to take the
wave functions,

00:00:26.853 --> 00:00:32.258
the atomic wave functions,
the wave functions on the atoms

00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:37.000
that are going to form this
chemical bond.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.147
Take those wave functions and
let them overlap.

00:00:41.147 --> 00:00:45.745
Let them constructively and
destructively interfere.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:50.254
After all, they are waves.
They are wave functions.

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:54.852
They can constructively and
destructively interfere.

00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:59.991
And we saw last time that when
these atomic wave functions

00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:05.131
constructively interfered,
the result was a molecular wave

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:10.000
function that was a bonding wave
function.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.136
Consequently,
it had a bonding state.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:18.042
For example,
in the case of oxygen,

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:24.706
we had the 2s wave functions on
each of the isolated oxygen

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:27.463
atoms.
When they overlap,

00:01:27.463 --> 00:01:33.323
they can constructively
interfere to form a sigma 2s

00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:38.529
bonding wave function.
And, consequently,

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:43.202
a sigma 2s bonding state.
And there are two electrons in

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:46.091
that.
And you will remember that we

00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:51.104
labeled the molecular states
with respect to the symmetry of

00:01:51.104 --> 00:01:54.758
the wave function around the
molecular axis.

00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:59.856
That wave function was sigma if
that symmetry was cylindrical

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:05.683
around the molecular axis.
It was pi here in this case for

00:02:05.683 --> 00:02:10.877
molecular oxygen when the wave
function was not cylindrically

00:02:10.877 --> 00:02:16.071
symmetric around the bond axis.
And we also saw what happened

00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:19.794
when these two wave functions
come together.

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:23.689
They overlap and they
destructively interfere.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.931
When they destructively
interfere, we form what we

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:32.000
called an antibonding wave
function.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.498
We gave it a designation star.
In the case here of the 2s

00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:43.585
electrons or wave functions in
oxygen, this formed the sigma 2s

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:48.887
star wave
function, the antibonding wave

00:02:48.887 --> 00:02:52.716
function.
Its energy is higher than that

00:02:52.716 --> 00:02:59.000
of the atomic states for the two
separated oxygen atoms.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.975
The bonding state is lower in
energy.

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:05.363
The antibonding state is higher
in energy.

00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:08.338
And so this was for the 2s
electrons.

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:12.719
Below this lower energy,
because they're more strongly

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:17.760
bond, are the 1s atomic states
and the molecular states formed

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.057
by the constructive and
destructive interference with

00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:25.363
the 1s wave function.
I didn't draw that.

00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:30.269
2s, then, is higher in energy.
And finally,

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.511
here are the 2p states that are
coming together in molecular

00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:42.542
oxygen, forming a sigma 2pz and
then two molecular states,

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:47.726
pi 2py and a pi 2px.
And then in molecular oxygen,

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:53.863
we also saw that there was one
electron each here in the pi

00:03:53.863 --> 00:04:00.000
star 2px and pi star 2py.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.265
Now, I just wanted to say a few
words here about the physical

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:08.337
significance of these energies
here.

00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:13.603
This is the molecular orbital
in the case of molecular oxygen

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:16.412
here.
This is the molecular state

00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:20.625
that is highest occupied.
What we mean by highest

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:25.890
occupied is that it is the state
that is the highest lying in

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.050
energy.
It has an electron in it that

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.381
is the highest lying in energy.
What this binding energy means

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:43.483
is, or what this energy means is
that if I put in energy to pull

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:48.330
this electron,
the one that is highest lying

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.178
in energy off,
the energy from here to O two

00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:59.152
plus plus an electron,
this physically is the

00:04:59.152 --> 00:05:04.000
ionization energy of O two.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.983
Because the first ionization
energy is always the energy

00:05:08.983 --> 00:05:14.057
required to take off the most
weakly bond electron or the

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:18.315
electron in the most highest
lying energy state.

00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:22.664
So that is the ionization
energy of O two.

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:26.922
That turns out to be about
12.01 electron volts.

00:05:26.922 --> 00:05:31.000
That is what that physically
means.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.242
In contrast here,
if I were to pull an electron

00:05:36.242 --> 00:05:41.599
off of an oxygen atom,
these are the oxygen atom

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:47.183
states, so I have O plus
plus an electron,

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:52.312
well, this is the ionization
energy of oxygen.

00:05:52.312 --> 00:05:58.922
This is a little bit larger
than it is for molecular O two.

00:05:58.922 --> 00:06:05.051
This is 13.58 eV.
And you can see that here.

00:06:05.051 --> 00:06:12.328
These 2p states are lower lying
in energy than the pi states in

00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:17.727
the molecular oxygen.
This isn't in your notes,

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:19.957
Okay?
And, likewise,

00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:27.000
if I were to look at the
electron affinity of oxygen.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.714
Now I am just going to draw
here the pi star 2px,

00:06:32.714 --> 00:06:37.714
pi star 2py.
And here are my atomic states.

00:06:37.714 --> 00:06:43.190
Here are the other two pi's.
Here is the sigma.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.833
Here is oxygen.
If I were to look at the

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:53.190
electron affinity of oxygen,
molecular oxygen,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:59.500
so way up here I have an O two
molecule plus an

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.224
electron.
Putting in an electron in,

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:07.303
I would have to put it in that
state.

00:07:07.303 --> 00:07:11.752
And so the energy difference
here, from here to here,

00:07:11.752 --> 00:07:16.457
is minus the electron affinity,
which is, in the case of

00:07:16.457 --> 00:07:19.194
molecular oxygen,
minus 0.045 eV.

00:07:19.194 --> 00:07:24.156
I just wanted to give you a
feeling for what these energies

00:07:24.156 --> 00:07:27.834
actually mean.
We are not plotting them as a

00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:33.220
function of energy here.
But they physically mean

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.367
something in terms of,
for example,

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:40.716
the ionization energy of
molecular oxygen or the

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:43.862
ionization energy of atomic
oxygen.

00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:49.600
You can see the relative orders
of the energies of all of these

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.764
different states.
This kind of diagram that we

00:07:53.764 --> 00:07:59.408
have been drawing here sometimes
is called a molecular orbital

00:07:59.408 --> 00:08:04.147
energy diagram.
Sometimes it is called the

00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:07.946
correlation diagram.
It is called a correlation

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:12.737
diagram because it shows you,
by the means of these kind of

00:08:12.737 --> 00:08:16.784
dotted lines here,
how the atomic states correlate

00:08:16.784 --> 00:08:21.079
to the molecular states.
That is why it is called the

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:23.227
correlation diagram,
again.

00:08:23.227 --> 00:08:27.522
It shows you how those atomic
states correlate to the

00:08:27.522 --> 00:08:31.094
molecular states.
Questions?

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:34.927
Okay.
If not then I want to proceed.

00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:41.167
There was one page on the
lecture last time that I had not

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:46.423
finished, so I want to talk
about that right now.

00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:51.897
And that was drawing the
molecular orbital diagram,

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:57.810
or the correlation diagram for
a heteronuclear diatomic

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.430
molecule.
And that is CO.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:06.200
In the case of the
heteronuclear diatomic molecule,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.018
we proceed in the same way as
we do for a homonuclear diatomic

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:15.643
molecule.
That is, we had the states of

00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:21.270
the individual atoms out here,
and now I am just showing you

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.227
the 2p states.
2s are down here.

00:09:24.227 --> 00:09:29.378
1s is down here lower in
energy, but I haven't drawn it

00:09:29.378 --> 00:09:33.794
all.
And what you also see is that

00:09:33.794 --> 00:09:39.671
the 2p states on the oxygen atom
here are lower in energy than

00:09:39.671 --> 00:09:44.006
the 2p states on the carbon.
And that's right.

00:09:44.006 --> 00:09:49.691
Remember we talked about the
fact that as the nuclear charge

00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:54.990
gets larger those atomic states
are more strongly bound,

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:00.000
because the Coulomb interaction
is greater.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.594
So the atomic states of oxygen
are lower in energy than those

00:10:05.594 --> 00:10:09.324
of carbon.
If you were asked to draw this

00:10:09.324 --> 00:10:14.733
on a homework problem or on an
exam, you would have to show

00:10:14.733 --> 00:10:20.234
that the oxygen atomic states
are lower in energy than those

00:10:20.234 --> 00:10:24.151
for carbon.
But we proceed much in the same

00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:27.135
way.
That is, the 2pz states here

00:10:27.135 --> 00:10:32.000
overlap.
Remember, those are the states

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.600
that, by definition,
we are putting parallel or

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.299
along the bond axis.
So they overlap to form the

00:10:41.299 --> 00:10:45.299
sigma 2pz wave function for the
molecule.

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:49.700
And then the 2pi x and 2pi y
are overlapping,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:55.200
those are the ones coming in
like this, parallel to each

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.000
other, to form the pi 2px and pi
2py.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.975
And likewise,
you have the antibonding

00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:05.469
states.
These wave functions can

00:11:05.469 --> 00:11:09.892
destructively interfere,
resulting in the antibonding pi

00:11:09.892 --> 00:11:13.753
star 2px,
pi star 2py and

00:11:13.753 --> 00:11:18.418
sigma star 2pz.
Now we've got all the states

00:11:18.418 --> 00:11:22.600
there, and now we proceed using
the Aufbau Principle.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.863
We start populating them,
lowest energy first until we

00:11:26.863 --> 00:11:32.244
use up all the electrons.
We have got six electrons,

00:11:32.244 --> 00:11:37.510
so we put two of them in that
lowest energy state and then the

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.446
other four here in these pi
states.

00:11:40.446 --> 00:11:43.899
And that then is the
correlation diagram,

00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:47.956
or just the top part of it for
this molecule CO.

00:11:47.956 --> 00:11:52.100
And if I had to write the
electron configuration,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.287
here it is.
Here is the sigma 1s 2,

00:11:56.287 --> 00:12:00.663
sigma 1s star 2,
sigma 2s 2, sigma 2s star 2,

00:12:00.663 --> 00:12:03.747
sigma 2pz 2,
pi 2px 2, pi 2py 2.

00:12:09.814 --> 00:12:14.489
Now what
is the bond order?

00:12:14.489 --> 00:12:19.860
Remember that was a measure
here of the strength of the

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.943
bond.
The bond order is one-half

00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:28.314
times the number of bonding
electrons minus antibonding

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:33.699
electrons.
Well, in this case it is three,

00:12:33.699 --> 00:12:35.963
right?
Because we have two,

00:12:35.963 --> 00:12:39.360
four, six, eight,
ten bonding electrons.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.756
We have two,
four antibonding electrons.

00:12:42.756 --> 00:12:45.630
10 minus 4 is 6 divided by 2 is
3.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:50.159
This is a triple bond.
And the binding energy here is

00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:53.729
162 kilojoules.
This is the strongest bond

00:12:53.729 --> 00:13:00.000
known, this triple bond here
between carbon and the oxygen.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Yes?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.014
Most negative,
right.

00:13:10.014 --> 00:13:14.951
No, the lowest energy is always
the more negative.

00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:18.679
Great.
There is one other thing I want

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:23.212
to point out here.
Remember I talked about the

00:13:23.212 --> 00:13:28.854
relative ordering of sigma and
pi, how in the case when Z

00:13:28.854 --> 00:13:35.000
equals 8, the sigma level drops
below the pi level?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.109
Well, that is true.
But here we have CO where one

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:43.989
of the atoms has Z equals 8 and
one of them is less than Z

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:47.071
equals 8.
What do we do in that case?

00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:52.208
In that case we are going to
put the sigma lower than the pi.

00:13:52.208 --> 00:13:57.089
We are going to follow the Z
equals 8 or greater rule when

00:13:57.089 --> 00:14:03.100
you have a choice there.
That is the heteronuclear

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.806
diatomic molecule.
Now what we are going to do,

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:14.759
is we're going to leave
molecular orbital theory.

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:21.705
We are going to start talking
about larger molecules than

00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:27.534
diatomic molecules.
And we have another approach

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:34.562
for these larger molecules.
And that is what is called a

00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:38.771
valence bond method along with a
hybridization.

00:14:38.771 --> 00:14:43.895
And I will explain that to you.
You can use the molecular

00:14:43.895 --> 00:14:47.281
orbital approach for larger
molecules.

00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:52.222
We are not going to do that.
It doesn't always work for

00:14:52.222 --> 00:14:56.614
larger molecules.
Let me show you just an example

00:14:56.614 --> 00:15:02.454
here when it doesn't work.
And that is the case of

00:15:02.454 --> 00:15:06.615
methane.
Here I have just drawn a carbon

00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:10.350
atom.
I show you the 2px and the 2pz

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:16.326
wave functions for a carbon.
And in the molecular orbital

00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:22.088
approach, what did we do?
Well, what we did was let the

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:28.170
wave function from one atom
overlap with the wave function

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:35.000
from the other to form a new
molecular wave function.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.402
And so that is what we would do
if we started with a molecular

00:15:40.402 --> 00:15:45.095
orbital approach for methane.
We would let the 1s wave

00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:50.763
function overlap with the 2pz on
the carbon, and over here the 1s

00:15:50.763 --> 00:15:55.014
wave function overlap with the
2pz on the carbon.

00:15:55.014 --> 00:15:59.000
But if we did that,
we are now stuck.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.241
We are stuck because we don't
have another electron up here to

00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:07.248
overlap.
We do not have another wave

00:16:07.248 --> 00:16:10.427
function to overlap with the
hydrogen.

00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:14.035
The electron configuration of
carbon is 2s,

00:16:14.035 --> 00:16:18.245
two electrons in it,
and then one in one of the 2p

00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:21.940
wave orbitals,
the other one in the other 2p

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.603
state.
If you use this molecular

00:16:24.603 --> 00:16:29.587
orbital approach strictly on
methane, what it would predict

00:16:29.587 --> 00:16:35.000
is that we could only make two
bonds to carbon.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.494
And it would say methane is
really CH two and the

00:16:40.494 --> 00:16:46.184
bond angle here is 90 degrees.
So molecular orbital theory,

00:16:46.184 --> 00:16:49.422
at least on methane,
doesn't work,

00:16:49.422 --> 00:16:55.015
although it does work for some
other polyatomic molecules.

00:16:55.015 --> 00:17:01.000
That was just an example here
of how it doesn't work.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.162
Now we are going to take an
approach that will work to

00:17:06.162 --> 00:17:11.714
describe the chemical bonding in
methane, and that is this

00:17:11.714 --> 00:17:17.071
hybridization coupled with what
we call the valence bond

00:17:17.071 --> 00:17:20.577
approach.
Here is the important part.

00:17:20.577 --> 00:17:23.987
Here is the atomic state for
carbon.

00:17:23.987 --> 00:17:29.149
Notice two 2s electrons and
then one in each of the 2p

00:17:29.149 --> 00:17:33.099
states.
The first thing that we are

00:17:33.099 --> 00:17:37.375
going to do is we are going to
do an electron promotion.

00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:41.573
We are going to take this
electron and put it up there.

00:17:41.573 --> 00:17:45.072
That is electron promotion.
That costs energy.

00:17:45.072 --> 00:17:49.581
Where did the energy come from?
I am going to tell you soon

00:17:49.581 --> 00:17:54.091
where the energy comes from.
We're just going to do it now,

00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:58.600
and then we will go back and
look at where the energy comes

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.769
from.
What we are then going to do is

00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:07.504
draw out here each one of these
atomic wave functions.

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:11.792
I am drawing this atomic wave
function, this one,

00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:15.276
this one and this one on the
next slide.

00:18:15.276 --> 00:18:18.492
That is what this is.
Here is the 2s.

00:18:18.492 --> 00:18:22.602
That is spherical.
Here is the 2pz we looked at

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.657
before.
Here is the 2ps.

00:18:24.657 --> 00:18:28.766
Here is the 2py.
Those are the four atomic wave

00:18:28.766 --> 00:18:33.439
functions.
Now what I am going to do,

00:18:33.439 --> 00:18:38.412
and this is all on carbon,
we haven't formed any bonds

00:18:38.412 --> 00:18:43.292
yet, is I am going to take these
four wave functions.

00:18:43.292 --> 00:18:48.265
They are all on the same
carbon, but I am going to let

00:18:48.265 --> 00:18:53.613
those four wave functions
constructively and destructively

00:18:53.613 --> 00:18:56.804
interfere.
Now I am taking the wave

00:18:56.804 --> 00:19:02.528
functions on the same atom and
letting them constructively and

00:19:02.528 --> 00:19:08.192
destructively interfere.
In molecular orbital theory,

00:19:08.192 --> 00:19:12.656
we took the wave functions on
different atoms and let them

00:19:12.656 --> 00:19:15.945
constructively and destructively
interfere.

00:19:15.945 --> 00:19:20.722
This is going to be taking the
wave functions on the same atom

00:19:20.722 --> 00:19:25.343
and letting them constructively
and destructively interfere.

00:19:25.343 --> 00:19:28.710
When I do this,
what you are going to get is

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:34.272
something that looks like this.
You are going to get four

00:19:34.272 --> 00:19:39.545
different wave functions that we
are going to call the sp 3

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:44.454
wave functions,
or the sp 3 orbitals.

00:19:44.454 --> 00:19:48.636
More precisely,
they are the four sp 3

00:19:48.636 --> 00:19:53.000
hybrid wave functions or hybrid
orbitals.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.224
Because they are this linear
combination, the overlap of

00:19:58.224 --> 00:20:03.258
these four different wave
functions on the same carbon

00:20:03.258 --> 00:20:08.672
atom to make four equivalent
hybrid wave functions that we

00:20:08.672 --> 00:20:11.807
call sp 3 wave
functions.

00:20:11.807 --> 00:20:16.936
They all look the same.
They are just oriented in space

00:20:16.936 --> 00:20:20.736
a little differently.
To understand that,

00:20:20.736 --> 00:20:25.390
and it is not clear,
I know, from looking at this,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:31.753
how that gets like this.
But here is one simple way to

00:20:31.753 --> 00:20:36.594
look at one of these.
Take this 2s wave function and

00:20:36.594 --> 00:20:42.006
let it constructively and
destructively interfere with the

00:20:42.006 --> 00:20:46.468
2pz wave function,
so this sphere is essentially

00:20:46.468 --> 00:20:50.835
on top of here.
What you notice on the 2pz wave

00:20:50.835 --> 00:20:56.151
function is that this part of
the wave function has got a

00:20:56.151 --> 00:21:01.291
positive amplitude.
Remember, we talked about the

00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:06.111
positive sign on one of these
lobes, meaning it had a positive

00:21:06.111 --> 00:21:08.876
amplitude?
And this part of the wave

00:21:08.876 --> 00:21:11.879
function, that has got a
negative sign,

00:21:11.879 --> 00:21:16.382
it has a negative amplitude.
But the 2s wave function here

00:21:16.382 --> 00:21:19.148
has a positive amplitude
everywhere.

00:21:19.148 --> 00:21:23.414
If we put the 2s on top of
here, you can see that right

00:21:23.414 --> 00:21:27.918
here we are going to have two
positives, amplitudes of two

00:21:27.918 --> 00:21:32.115
waves that are positive.
They are going to

00:21:32.115 --> 00:21:35.592
constructively interfere and the
result is above here,

00:21:35.592 --> 00:21:39.201
right here, if you just take
these two and look at this,

00:21:39.201 --> 00:21:43.072
you are going to have a lot of
wave function right up there.

00:21:43.072 --> 00:21:47.205
However, below this plane where
we have a positive wave function

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:50.814
at the same part where we have a
negative wave function,

00:21:50.814 --> 00:21:53.373
well, you know what,
this is destructive

00:21:53.373 --> 00:21:56.260
interference.
And the result is that the wave

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.000
function here is going to be
pretty small.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.904
It is still going to be a
little negative,

00:22:03.904 --> 00:22:07.142
but it is going to be pretty
small.

00:22:07.142 --> 00:22:12.857
That is probably the simplest
just example to look at so that

00:22:12.857 --> 00:22:16.857
you understand how I get from
here to here.

00:22:16.857 --> 00:22:21.809
So we are going to form these
four sp 3 wave

00:22:21.809 --> 00:22:25.238
functions.
Here is a picture of that.

00:22:25.238 --> 00:22:30.000
When I take these four wave
functions.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.515
I have just separated them out
in space, but now I am really

00:22:34.515 --> 00:22:39.260
just going to put them on top of
each other because they really

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.704
all have the same origin here.
When I do that,

00:22:42.704 --> 00:22:47.142
my wave function kind of looks
like this, where these lobes

00:22:47.142 --> 00:22:51.581
here are the positive parts.
They are my sp 3 wave

00:22:51.581 --> 00:22:53.801
function.
And in this picture,

00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:58.545
I left out the little negative
lobes that would be sticking out

00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:03.719
here.
I left those out because it is

00:23:03.719 --> 00:23:10.661
just too hard to draw this.
And what I want you to notice

00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:17.851
here is that this angle from
here to here is 109.5 degrees.

00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:24.793
This is a little bit better
picture that I didn't draw of

00:23:24.793 --> 00:23:30.000
those sp 3 wave
functions.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.277
In this case you can see a
little bit of the negative wave

00:23:35.277 --> 00:23:41.018
function from this positive lobe
over here, and you can kind of

00:23:41.018 --> 00:23:46.388
see the little negative here and
the little negative there.

00:23:46.388 --> 00:23:50.462
That is a better picture than
the one I drew.

00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:53.981
We have got this kind of
configuration,

00:23:53.981 --> 00:23:59.351
here, with an angle of 109.5
from this lobe to that lobe or

00:23:59.351 --> 00:24:05.000
this lobe to that lobe or this
lobe to that lobe.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.817
And you can understand that
109.5 degrees if I do the

00:24:09.817 --> 00:24:15.654
following, that is if I now draw
lines from the outer most point

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:19.546
of each lobe.
What you see is that I have a

00:24:19.546 --> 00:24:23.345
tetrahedron now with carbon in
the center.

00:24:23.345 --> 00:24:28.904
And each one of these vertices
here of this tetrahedron is at

00:24:28.904 --> 00:24:34.000
the outermost points of these
wave functions.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.799
The angle in a perfect
tetrahedron is 109.5 degrees.

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:46.533
That is where that 109.5
degrees comes from.

00:24:46.533 --> 00:24:52.666
That is a tetrahedral
configuration around that

00:24:52.666 --> 00:24:56.266
carbon.
What did we do here?

00:24:56.266 --> 00:25:01.453
We took an electron.
We promoted it.

00:25:01.453 --> 00:25:06.490
When then took these four wave
functions and let them

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.559
constructively and destructively
interfere.

00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:16.565
The result now is four new wave
functions corresponding to four

00:25:16.565 --> 00:25:19.859
new states.
Recalling these states,

00:25:19.859 --> 00:25:24.703
sp 3 states.
There is one electron in each

00:25:24.703 --> 00:25:31.000
one of those sp^3 states.
Where do these energies lie?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.129
Well, they lie in between the
2s and the 2p.

00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:40.794
They are not as high in energy
as the 2p, but they certainly

00:25:40.794 --> 00:25:44.251
are higher than the 2s.
And, overall,

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:49.725
you can see we are still going
to have to need some energy

00:25:49.725 --> 00:25:53.662
input into the system to make
this happen.

00:25:53.662 --> 00:26:00.000
And I haven't told you yet
where that energy comes from.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.013
Here we have this carbon.
And we have just let those wave

00:26:06.013 --> 00:26:12.671
functions on the carbon itself
constructively and destructively

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:17.073
interfere.
Now we are going to make bonds.

00:26:17.073 --> 00:26:23.409
Now we are going to take these
hybrid wave functions and let

00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:28.993
them overlap with a wave
function, an atomic function

00:26:28.993 --> 00:26:34.327
from another atom.
Now we are going to start to

00:26:34.327 --> 00:26:36.654
make the bonds.
Here it goes.

00:26:36.654 --> 00:26:40.310
We are bringing in a hydrogen,
making a bond,

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.386
bringing in a hydrogen,
making a bond,

00:26:43.386 --> 00:26:47.707
bringing in a hydrogen,
bringing in another hydrogen,

00:26:47.707 --> 00:26:52.029
and now we've got methane.
What did we do to do this?

00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:56.932
What we did is we took that
sp^3 wave function on carbon and

00:26:56.932 --> 00:27:03.000
then brought in the hydrogen
atom with its 1s wave function.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.166
And we let it overlap.
Now there is constructive

00:27:07.166 --> 00:27:12.041
interference right in here,
or destructive interference.

00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:14.878
And the result is now a new
bond.

00:27:14.878 --> 00:27:20.108
A result is this constructive
interference between this sp 3

00:27:20.108 --> 00:27:24.274
wave function and the
1s wave function.

00:27:24.274 --> 00:27:27.642
We are going to call that a
sigma bond.

00:27:27.642 --> 00:27:32.961
It is sigma because that wave
function is symmetric along the

00:27:32.961 --> 00:27:37.959
C-H axis.
It is cylindrically symmetric

00:27:37.959 --> 00:27:42.142
along the C-H axis.
So this is a new bond.

00:27:42.142 --> 00:27:48.163
That bond is the sigma bond,
composed of the carbon two sp 3

00:27:48.163 --> 00:27:54.489
and the hydrogen 1s.
And so we've got two electrons,

00:27:54.489 --> 00:28:00.000
now, in each one of those sp 3
states.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.905
Now, the question is,
where did this energy come from

00:28:04.905 --> 00:28:09.811
for that hybridization?
Remember we had to promote an

00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:15.377
electron to do this trick here?
So where did this come from?

00:28:15.377 --> 00:28:20.283
Well, where it comes from is
from the bond formation.

00:28:20.283 --> 00:28:26.037
When you form a carbon-hydrogen
bond, you are going to release

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:30.000
some energy.
It is lower energy.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.740
You are going to release some
energy.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.699
And that energy for the
hybridization comes from that

00:28:36.699 --> 00:28:38.983
bond formation.
In other words,

00:28:38.983 --> 00:28:42.637
when you make the CH bond,
that is going to be an

00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:45.911
exothermic process,
you are going to release

00:28:45.911 --> 00:28:50.251
energy, but because you had to
do this electron promotion,

00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:54.666
the amount of energy you are
going to release when you make

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:59.158
that C-H bond is not all that
you could have released if you

00:28:59.158 --> 00:29:01.899
didn't have to do this
hybridization,

00:29:01.899 --> 00:29:07.000
if you didn't have to do this
electron promotion.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.521
So that energy,
to promote the electron,

00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:16.159
comes from the actual C-H bond
formation.

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:22.420
Now, here is my carbon with
just the sp 3 wave

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:27.173
functions.
I haven't gotten that bonded to

00:29:27.173 --> 00:29:33.533
anything in this picture.
What I am going to do is I am

00:29:33.533 --> 00:29:38.424
going to rotate this around,
and it will be for a reason.

00:29:38.424 --> 00:29:43.316
I just rotated it around.
And one electron in each one of

00:29:43.316 --> 00:29:48.469
the sp three states.
Now what I am going to do is I

00:29:48.469 --> 00:29:53.710
am going to bring in another
carbon, sp 3 hybridized

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:58.427
carbon, along this axis here.
That is why I turned this

00:29:58.427 --> 00:30:02.078
around.
Here comes the other sp 3

00:30:02.078 --> 00:30:06.151
hybridized carbon.
And I am going to let these two

00:30:06.151 --> 00:30:10.806
sp 3 hybrid wave functions
overlap, so that now one of my

00:30:10.806 --> 00:30:13.715
sp 3 states has two electrons in
it.

00:30:13.715 --> 00:30:18.204
What am I doing right here?
I am letting those two sp 3

00:30:18.204 --> 00:30:22.277
wave functions overlap,
constructive interference.

00:30:22.277 --> 00:30:26.017
I am going to make another
bond, a sigma bond,

00:30:26.017 --> 00:30:30.921
because this wave function is
cylindrically symmetric around

00:30:30.921 --> 00:30:35.612
that axis.
That is a sigma bond.

00:30:35.612 --> 00:30:42.580
It is a sigma bond composed of
the carbon 2sp 3

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:49.548
hybrid wave function and another
carbon 2sp 3 hybrid wave

00:30:49.548 --> 00:30:54.276
function.
I just formed a carbon-carbon

00:30:54.276 --> 00:30:57.635
bond.
I just brought in some

00:30:57.635 --> 00:31:01.247
hydrogens.
In each case,

00:31:01.247 --> 00:31:06.907
I now have overlap between the
1s wave function and the sp 3

00:31:06.907 --> 00:31:12.568
wave function of the carbon,
and the molecule that I have is

00:31:12.568 --> 00:31:15.734
ethane.
And this angle here is 109

00:31:15.734 --> 00:31:18.900
degrees, right?
It is 109 degrees,

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.889
because you had that
tetrahedral configuration around

00:31:23.889 --> 00:31:29.081
the carbon.
Because that is how the 2s wave

00:31:29.081 --> 00:31:34.846
functions and the three 2p wave
functions around the carbon

00:31:34.846 --> 00:31:40.710
constructively and destructively
interfered to give you that

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:45.183
tetrahedral shape for the sp 3
wave functions.

00:31:45.183 --> 00:31:50.253
Oh, I thought we were going to
do this more closely.

00:31:50.253 --> 00:31:51.843
Sorry.
All right.

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:57.210
We made these C-H bonds here.
They are all sigma bonds,

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.503
also.
That's carbon,

00:32:00.503 --> 00:32:04.154
this sp 3 hybridization for
carbon.

00:32:04.154 --> 00:32:10.167
But other atoms can also
undergo this sp 3 hybridization.

00:32:10.167 --> 00:32:14.355
And one of those atoms here is
nitrogen.

00:32:14.355 --> 00:32:19.402
Here is the electron
configuration for nitrogen.

00:32:19.402 --> 00:32:23.805
In this case,
we have got two electrons in

00:32:23.805 --> 00:32:28.530
the 2s state,
and then one in each one of the

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:34.401
2p states.
What we are going to do here

00:32:34.401 --> 00:32:41.205
is, we're going to allow now
these four wave functions to

00:32:41.205 --> 00:32:48.252
constructively and destructively
interfere, do what we call

00:32:48.252 --> 00:32:52.261
hybridize.
And the result will be,

00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:57.000
again, four sp 3 wave
functions.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.189
Except the difference is that
because we have one more

00:33:02.189 --> 00:33:06.792
electron in nitrogen,
one of these sp 3

00:33:06.792 --> 00:33:10.905
states has already got two
electrons in it.

00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:16.388
It is not going to be available
for bonding, in a moment.

00:33:16.388 --> 00:33:20.011
In nitrogen,
the electron arrangement,

00:33:20.011 --> 00:33:25.103
or the wave function
arrangement is also tetrahedral,

00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:30.000
sp 3 to this corner,
sp 3, sp 3, sp 3.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.765
Except that one of these sp 3
wave functions really is kind of

00:33:35.765 --> 00:33:40.963
two sp 3 wave functions.
There are two electrons here in

00:33:40.963 --> 00:33:44.649
this state.
This is the lone pair on the

00:33:44.649 --> 00:33:49.091
nitrogen, and then sp3
hybridized nitrogen atom.

00:33:49.091 --> 00:33:54.195
This is the lone pair pointed
at one of these vertices,

00:33:54.195 --> 00:33:59.015
but then each one of these
lobes just represents one

00:33:59.015 --> 00:34:02.724
electron.
So they are going to be

00:34:02.724 --> 00:34:06.549
available for bonding.
What are we going to do here?

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:09.474
We are going to bring in some
hydrogens.

00:34:09.474 --> 00:34:13.074
Here is a hydrogen.
Here is a hydrogen coming in.

00:34:13.074 --> 00:34:16.000
Here is a hydrogen.
We have got ammonia.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.900
What did we do to form these
nitrogen-hydrogen bonds?

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.400
Well, we took that sp 3 wave
function on nitrogen and brought

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.474
in the hydrogen,
let that 1s wave function

00:34:27.474 --> 00:34:32.050
constructively and destructively
interfere with that sp 3 wave

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:36.842
function.
The result is a sigma bond.

00:34:36.842 --> 00:34:41.263
It is sigma.
It is composed of the nitrogen

00:34:41.263 --> 00:34:45.368
2sp 3 and the hydrogen 1s wave
function.

00:34:45.368 --> 00:34:49.894
Now, the angle right in here,
the angle, the

00:34:49.894 --> 00:34:56.526
hydrogen-nitrogen-hydrogen angle
here, I want you to see that it

00:34:56.526 --> 00:35:02.210
is actually a little smaller
than the ideal tetrahedral

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:06.932
angle.
It is no longer 109.5 degrees.

00:35:06.932 --> 00:35:11.233
It is 107 degrees.
And the reason for that is

00:35:11.233 --> 00:35:14.556
because of this lone pair out
here.

00:35:14.556 --> 00:35:19.932
This lone pair has a very
repulsive interaction with the

00:35:19.932 --> 00:35:24.526
electrons in these
nitrogen-hydrogen bonds here,

00:35:24.526 --> 00:35:30.000
bringing that angle in a little
bit more close.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.764
They are being repelled.
And so that will generally be

00:35:34.764 --> 00:35:38.089
the case.
If you've got a lone pair of

00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:42.044
electrons somewhere,
that will tend to repel,

00:35:42.044 --> 00:35:45.191
everything will be repelled
from it.

00:35:45.191 --> 00:35:50.044
And the consequence is that
this angle, this bond angle

00:35:50.044 --> 00:35:55.528
here, is going to be a little
smaller than a tetrahedral angle

00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:59.303
of 109.5 degrees.
But now, here is a really

00:35:59.303 --> 00:36:04.425
important point.
You are often asked for,

00:36:04.425 --> 00:36:08.163
what is the geometry around
some atom?

00:36:08.163 --> 00:36:11.801
In this case,
you might be asked for,

00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:15.439
what is the geometry around
nitrogen?

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:21.097
When you are asked such a
question, what it means is they

00:36:21.097 --> 00:36:25.341
are asking you,
what is the geometry of the

00:36:25.341 --> 00:36:31.000
atoms around the nitrogen?
Not the electrons.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.017
The distinction is that the
geometry of the electrons around

00:36:36.017 --> 00:36:39.674
this atom is about tetrahedral.
But usually,

00:36:39.674 --> 00:36:44.521
one isn't interested in that.
Usually one is interested in

00:36:44.521 --> 00:36:49.539
what is the geometry of the
other atoms around the nitrogen.

00:36:49.539 --> 00:36:54.387
And so, in this case here,
the geometry of the other atoms

00:36:54.387 --> 00:36:57.108
is a trigonal pyramidal
geometry.

00:36:57.108 --> 00:37:02.467
It is not tetrahedral.
If you are asked for the shape

00:37:02.467 --> 00:37:06.498
of the nitrogen molecule,
the answer is a trigonal

00:37:06.498 --> 00:37:10.776
pyramid, not a tetrahedron.
That is really important.

00:37:10.776 --> 00:37:15.712
That trips up a lot of people.
So the lone pairs pointing out

00:37:15.712 --> 00:37:20.483
here, the electron geometry is
approximately tetetrahedral,

00:37:20.483 --> 00:37:24.514
but that is not what we are
usually interested in.

00:37:24.514 --> 00:37:29.532
We are interested in where the
atoms are, so the geometry is a

00:37:29.532 --> 00:37:35.167
trigonal pyramid.
That is the sp 3 

00:37:35.167 --> 00:37:40.108
hybridization on ammonia or on
nitrogen.

00:37:40.108 --> 00:37:46.063
Oxygen can also undergo this sp
3 hybridization.

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:52.018
Here is the electron
configuration for an oxygen

00:37:52.018 --> 00:38:00.000
atom, two electrons in the 2s
and four in the 2p states.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.067
What we are going to do here
again is we are going to let

00:38:04.067 --> 00:38:07.845
these wave functions
constructively and destructively

00:38:07.845 --> 00:38:09.733
interfere.
When we do that,

00:38:09.733 --> 00:38:13.365
again, we are going to get four
new wave functions,

00:38:13.365 --> 00:38:16.198
the sp 3 hybrid wave
functions.

00:38:16.198 --> 00:38:19.830
But in the case of oxygen,
because we have one more

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.825
electron than that of nitrogen,
we are going to have two

00:38:23.825 --> 00:38:28.401
electrons in that sp 3 state and
two electrons in the other sp 3

00:38:28.401 --> 00:38:33.074
state.
And then one electron each in

00:38:33.074 --> 00:38:36.890
the sp 3 states.
What is the electron

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:41.554
arrangement around oxygen going
to look like?

00:38:41.554 --> 00:38:46.749
Well, it is going to look like
this, where, again,

00:38:46.749 --> 00:38:52.579
each one of these sp 3 wave
functions is pointed to-- is

00:38:52.579 --> 00:38:58.515
there a question over here that
I can help somebody with?

00:38:58.515 --> 00:39:01.929
OK.
Each one of these wave

00:39:01.929 --> 00:39:06.491
functions is pointed to a corner
of this tetrahedron.

00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:11.140
But, again, one of these wave
functions represents two

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:15.701
electrons, this lone pair,
another one represents two

00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:20.438
electrons, that lone pair,
and then only these two sp 3

00:39:20.438 --> 00:39:25.350
wave functions are going to be
available for overlap with

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:30.000
another atom.
Let's bring another atom in.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.776
Hydrogen is our atom of choice
today.

00:39:33.776 --> 00:39:37.552
We have just made the water
molecule.

00:39:37.552 --> 00:39:42.377
What did we do?
We took that sp^3 wave function

00:39:42.377 --> 00:39:47.832
on oxygen and brought in a
hydrogen, overlapped them,

00:39:47.832 --> 00:39:53.391
and formed a sigma bond.
A sigma bond between oxygen 2

00:39:53.391 --> 00:40:00.000
sp 3 and hydrogen 1s.
That is a sigma bond.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.914
Now, notice this angle here.
It is 104.5 degrees.

00:40:04.914 --> 00:40:08.498
It is even smaller than 107
degrees.

00:40:08.498 --> 00:40:14.129
And 107 was smaller than the
tetrahedral angle of 109.5.

00:40:14.129 --> 00:40:17.610
Why?
Well, because we got these two

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:23.344
lone pairs here of electrons.
They're sticking out there.

00:40:23.344 --> 00:40:30.000
They really are repulsive to
all the atoms around them.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.420
And so all the other atoms,
these two hydrogens here really

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.959
try to get away from these two
lone pairs.

00:40:40.959 --> 00:40:46.605
And so this angle here,
the hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen

00:40:46.605 --> 00:40:53.579
angle is even smaller than that
in ammonia and much smaller than

00:40:53.579 --> 00:41:00.000
that in an ideal tetrahedron.
It is 104.5 degrees.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.676
If you were asked for the
geometry of this molecule,

00:41:04.676 --> 00:41:06.968
what would you say?
Sorry?

00:41:06.968 --> 00:41:09.444
Bent.
All right, it is bent.

00:41:09.444 --> 00:41:11.644
It is also planar,
right?

00:41:11.644 --> 00:41:16.412
Hey, this is a no-brainer.
If you've got three atoms,

00:41:16.412 --> 00:41:21.180
the molecule is planar.
Three points to find a plane.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.315
And then the question is
whether or not those three atoms

00:41:26.315 --> 00:41:32.000
are linear, in a line,
or whether they are bent?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.175
And so, in this case,
for the water molecule,

00:41:35.175 --> 00:41:37.556
this is a bent planar
arrangement.

00:41:37.556 --> 00:41:41.381
That is the atom arrangement.
That is not the electron

00:41:41.381 --> 00:41:44.195
arrangement.
The electron arrangement is

00:41:44.195 --> 00:41:47.948
approximately tetrahedral.
But, again, usually you're

00:41:47.948 --> 00:41:51.123
going to be asked for the atomic
arrangement.

00:41:51.123 --> 00:41:55.309
The geometry around the oxygen,
well, this is a planar bent

00:41:55.309 --> 00:42:00.000
molecule with the two lone pairs
sticking out here.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.064
And, hey, you know what?
I want you to remember these

00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:10.324
two lone pairs on water.
Very important because I think

00:42:10.324 --> 00:42:16.266
Wednesday we are going to talk
about something called hydrogen

00:42:16.266 --> 00:42:20.064
bonding.
And these two lone pairs play a

00:42:20.064 --> 00:42:23.766
very critical role in hydrogen
bonding.

00:42:23.766 --> 00:42:30.000
We have just covered this sp 3
hybridization.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.810
There are other ways in which
the s wave functions and the p

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:45.734
wave functions can
constructively and destructively

00:42:45.734 --> 00:42:48.984
interfere.
And to illustrate that,

00:42:48.984 --> 00:42:54.696
I am going to start with this
atom boron, one less electron

00:42:54.696 --> 00:42:58.242
than carbon.
So a different kind of a

00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:03.369
hybridization now.
In the case of boron,

00:43:03.369 --> 00:43:09.575
we are also going to have to do
this electron promotion.

00:43:09.575 --> 00:43:14.766
We just move that 2s electron
up to a 2p state,

00:43:14.766 --> 00:43:19.392
so now we've got three wave
functions, 2s,

00:43:19.392 --> 00:43:23.680
2p, 2px, 2py.
We've got three populated

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:30.000
states, and we are going to let
them hybridize.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.184
And when we let them hybridize,
what we are going to get are

00:43:35.184 --> 00:43:39.315
three what we call sp 2
wave functions,

00:43:39.315 --> 00:43:43.709
each with one electron.
Let me try to explain that.

00:43:43.709 --> 00:43:48.366
These are the wave functions
that we've got after this

00:43:48.366 --> 00:43:52.672
electron promotion,
one wave function for that one

00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:57.066
electron in the 2s state on
boron, it's spherically

00:43:57.066 --> 00:43:59.703
symmetric.
One 2px.

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:04.014
One electron represented by the
2py wave function,

00:44:04.014 --> 00:44:07.621
here it is.
What we are going to do now is

00:44:07.621 --> 00:44:12.460
to let these three wave
functions, not four like in sp 3

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.123
hybridization,
but these three wave functions

00:44:17.123 --> 00:44:20.818
constructively and destructively
interfere.

00:44:20.818 --> 00:44:25.744
And when we do that we are
going to get what we call sp 2

00:44:25.744 --> 00:44:32.052
wave functions.
Or, sp 2 hybrid wave

00:44:32.052 --> 00:44:37.526
functions or hybrid orbitals.
They all look the same.

00:44:37.526 --> 00:44:41.105
They are just oriented
differently.

00:44:41.105 --> 00:44:46.052
These three wave functions all
lie in one plane.

00:44:46.052 --> 00:44:51.736
The sp 2 all lies in one plane,
unlike sp 3 hybrid wave

00:44:51.736 --> 00:44:56.052
functions.
And so what I am going to do is

00:44:56.052 --> 00:45:01.000
take these three wave functions
now.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.103
Since they all have the same
origin, I am going to plot them

00:45:05.103 --> 00:45:08.510
on the same graph,
and they are going to look like

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:10.944
this.
Again, I am going to leave out

00:45:10.944 --> 00:45:15.256
this little negative lobe here,
the little negative part of the

00:45:15.256 --> 00:45:17.899
wave function.
Just for clarity in this

00:45:17.899 --> 00:45:21.585
drawing, I just show you the
positive part of the wave

00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:23.810
function.
And the positive parts,

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:27.705
the maxima of the positive
parts of those wave functions,

00:45:27.705 --> 00:45:32.789
lie in one plane.
And the angle between these

00:45:32.789 --> 00:45:37.646
wave functions is 120 degrees,
each one of them.

00:45:37.646 --> 00:45:43.846
This is the sp^2-hybridization
on boron, one electron in each

00:45:43.846 --> 00:45:49.633
one of the sp 2 states.
I am going to bring in a

00:45:49.633 --> 00:45:53.663
hydrogen now,
bring in another hydrogen,

00:45:53.663 --> 00:46:01.000
and bring in another hydrogen.
Hey, I've got BH three.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.321
So what did we do?
Well, with each one of these

00:46:05.321 --> 00:46:10.581
hydrogens we made a sigma bond.
It is sigma because it is

00:46:10.581 --> 00:46:14.339
cylindrically symmetric around
that axis.

00:46:14.339 --> 00:46:19.224
It is a sigma bond composed of
boron, 2sp 2

00:46:19.224 --> 00:46:22.512
overlapping with a hydrogen 1s
bond.

00:46:22.512 --> 00:46:27.490
This molecule here is planar
because these hybrid wave

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:32.000
functions all lie in the same
plane.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.719
We call this trigonal planar
because there is an angle of 120

00:46:38.719 --> 00:46:43.648
degrees between each
hydrogen-boron-hydrogen,

00:46:43.648 --> 00:46:47.904
or these
hydrogen-boron-hydrogen angles

00:46:47.904 --> 00:46:52.608
are all 120 degrees.
It is trigonal planar.

00:46:52.608 --> 00:46:57.311
Well, carbon,
it can also undergo this sp^2

00:46:57.311 --> 00:47:01.749
hybridization.
It can undergo sp^3,

00:47:01.749 --> 00:47:05.422
but it can also undergo sp^2
hybridization.

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:09.008
We have to do an electron
promotion again.

00:47:09.008 --> 00:47:12.157
We did that.
We are going to let them

00:47:12.157 --> 00:47:16.268
hybridize to sp^2.
The result is three sp^2 wave

00:47:16.268 --> 00:47:21.253
functions, and one of the 2p
wave functions is left alone.

00:47:21.253 --> 00:47:25.889
We are going to label it 2py.
That one is not going to

00:47:25.889 --> 00:47:30.000
participate in this
hybridization.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.732
A picture is here are the
individual atomic wave functions

00:47:36.732 --> 00:47:43.937
on carbon, and I am going to let
just these three hybridize to

00:47:43.937 --> 00:47:50.433
make three sp 2 hybrid orbits,
or three sp 2 hybrid wave

00:47:50.433 --> 00:47:55.039
functions.
And they have identically the

00:47:55.039 --> 00:48:00.000
same shapes as they did for
boron.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.581
And then this guy hasn't been
touched.

00:48:02.581 --> 00:48:05.441
It is still the atomic wave
function, 2py.

00:48:05.441 --> 00:48:06.000
Yes?

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.289
Because you've got different
kinds of environments.

00:48:18.289 --> 00:48:21.710
Some environments allow these
three wave functions to

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:24.276
constructively and destructively
appear.

00:48:24.276 --> 00:48:27.631
Others will allow all the four
to constructively and

00:48:27.631 --> 00:48:31.401
destructively be interfered.
Thermodynamics,

00:48:31.401 --> 00:48:34.485
okay?
Whether you're going to form

00:48:34.485 --> 00:48:39.532
here ethane or ethylene is a
function of a lot of other

00:48:39.532 --> 00:48:42.336
parameters.
No, until we get to

00:48:42.336 --> 00:48:47.196
thermodynamics and then you are.
We will get to that,

00:48:47.196 --> 00:48:48.130
Okay?
Okay.

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:51.869
You are quite welcome.
That is all right.

00:48:51.869 --> 00:48:55.981
Because I know this is a little
bit abstract,

00:48:55.981 --> 00:49:03.210
but it is actually the case.
Which one you're going to form,

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:09.320
ethane or ethylene depends on
what other constituents you've

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.359
got around.
It is going to depend on the

00:49:13.359 --> 00:49:18.640
relative pressures of your
carbon and your hydrogen.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.990
In this case here,
because we have the same

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:28.996
origin, I am now going to put
these three wave functions on

00:49:28.996 --> 00:49:34.929
top of each other.
Plot them in the same graph.

00:49:34.929 --> 00:49:40.894
They are going to look like
they did in the case of boron.

00:49:40.894 --> 00:49:45.603
I think we will pick it up
there on Wednesday.

00:49:45.603 --> 00:49:46.603
See you then.
