[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.830
JASPER ONONO: The success
of Kola Studios inspired

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.512
other people to come
up with-- they inspired

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.345
other people to start
up their own ventures.

00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:16.110
They are like, this
can really happen.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.060
If Kola Studios did
it, then this is great.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.520
Because Uganda is
an African country.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.000
As you know, Africa
has so many challenges.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.640
There are so many grounds that
haven't yet been covered up,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.680
especially online
payments and stuff.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.090
So I've been seeing a
lot to startups coming

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.045
to solve such problems, and
just by the mere success of Kola

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:42.150
Studios, it gives them
the confidence that yeah,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.250
it can be done.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.380
With Matutu, we
discovered there was

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.850
a disconnect between
popular games

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.160
that were played in the past
and what is currently played,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.250
or there are no games
played at all nowadays.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.710
So we decided to
bring back those games

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.990
in the digital world to preserve
the culture and tradition.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.770
We made sure the game
is lightweight and fast,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.720
because looking at the African
market, it's a growing market.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.790
The smartphones
are less powerful.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.880
The internet speeds
are not very good.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.490
So we decided to optimize a
game for the low-end phones.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.430
But that doesn't
mean we-- we don't

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.400
compromise in quality for
even the high-end phones.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.990
It's still good enough.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.900
So our game is just
about 5 MB download

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.410
in a record seconds,
not even a minute.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.120
So it solves the internet
speeds and maybe the phone

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.670
capabilities.
