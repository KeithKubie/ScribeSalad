1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,780
You are listening to
radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,130
N y. S. E. N. N. P. E. R.

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,390
So if we said where we
are, I'm untape yet, uh,

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,230
starting us off today are our
producers, Lynn Levy and Sean Cole,

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,590
very pretty day to be on an abandoned
island were victims of contagious disease

6
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:31,240
recording team. And one in particular who,

7
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,130
uh, lived here, died here,

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,120
never believing that she was
in fact sick and dangerous.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,090
[inaudible]

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,300
so this is the story that she
begins with it. Well it's actually,

11
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,360
it starts in 1906 and it
doesn't start on the island.

12
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,360
It starts in Oyster Bay who,
nice neighbor, very nice.

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,310
There was this one rich family on vacation
there and their daughter gets sick.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,520
She gets sick first. This is Judy Levitt.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,580
I am a professor Emerita at the University
of Wisconsin and she wrote a book

16
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:04,220
about this story. So basically the girl,

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,280
the daughter has a fever than
her sister comes down with it.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,880
And then her mom and Umaid about six
out of 11 in the family get sick.

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,800
And with this disease, the fever
is just the first part of it.

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,830
Both diarrhea or
constipation are reported.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,510
So it can go either way. I
guess. What is it? Typhoid

22
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,040
and they couldn't figure out
what had caused the disease.

23
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,340
So they called in the sanitary engineer
named [inaudible] George Soper with the

24
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,270
public health department.

25
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,990
He was the go to guy for outbreaks like
this back then the department of public

26
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:36,591
health was thinking,

27
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:41,591
you know when you get sick because of
something dirty near you in in the well or

28
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,360
in the pipes. Yeah. So he
looks into all of that,

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,520
did a whole test on the house
and the water and everything.

30
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:49,630
Couldn't find anything.

31
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:53,890
And so he starts talking to the family
and he started quizzing them all and they

32
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:58,410
remember eventually in summer he
builds up this whole picture of,

33
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,580
of several outbreaks going back year
1900 Mamaroneck a New York family had a

34
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:09,850
house for the sun. 1902 dark harbor,
1904 seven cases, sands point,

35
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:14,320
New York, Autumn 1906 or 1907
New York City. All these cases.

36
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:16,420
And they all had one thing in common.

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,170
What each of these families had employed.

38
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,950
Same Cook,

39
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,800
which is funny because when you cook food,

40
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,910
you kill the bacteria in the food.
Yeah. So couldn't be the cook then.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,080
But this cook, her most
famous dish was peach, Melba,

42
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,490
which is ice cream and fresh
peaches, fresh peaches,

43
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,290
raw fruit as a perfect
medium. And the Cook's name

44
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,490
was Mary Mallon, Mary Mary, Matt.

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,770
Wait a second. Shannon Cole, typhoid,
typhoid Mary. So we're talking about, oh,

46
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:57,350
so we know this store. No, you don't
know this story. What do you mean?

47
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,970
Everybody thinks they know this story? I,

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,630
I knew the story and then when I looked
into it I realized I didn't know the

49
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:04,420
first thing about it. And when
you look into the details,

50
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,630
they tell us some very difficult things
about who we were and who we still are.

51
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:14,660
In a lot of ways. It's all in the details.
All of the juice and probably, yeah,

52
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,690
like in like the, it's
like the PG juice. Yeah,

53
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,680
just like the peach juice still
dealing with it. I'm Robert Krulwich.

54
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,680
Go ahead. Go ahead. Right. Yeah. Boom.
Rod, this is Radiolab and in this hour,

55
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,010
a series of stories that all hew to
that delicious story archetype we call

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,830
patient zero.

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,640
The first clock we'll try to trace ideas
and trends and massive social traumas

58
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:46,971
like pandemics back to that one person
or one critter or the other week close

59
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,370
called the, but for if you
didn't have this thing,

60
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,900
but for this thing you wouldn't have
the rest of this. I like the button but,

61
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,950
but meanwhile, back to the peaches.

62
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,850
So you George Soper is like,
I've got to find this woman.

63
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,970
And when he finds her,

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,090
she's in New York City
working for another family.

65
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,870
The laundry's had recently been taken to
the Presbyterian hospital with typhoid

66
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:14,380
fever.

67
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,010
This is from an article super road called
the curious case of typhoid Mary and

68
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,950
the only child of the family, a
lovely daughter, was dying of it.

69
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,380
So he goes to the house, walks
into the kitchen, sees this woman,

70
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,710
five foot six blonde hair, blue eyes,

71
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,950
had a good figure and might've been
called athletic had she not been a little

72
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:37,780
too heavy. Irish immigrant, 36 years
old, not particularly clean. And he says,

73
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,520
Mary Mallon, I think you are causing
disease in people and I want,

74
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,790
uh, samples of your
urine, feces and blood.

75
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,480
Good afternoon. And she says, what
are you accusing me of being sick,

76
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,020
playing the role of Mary is Columbia
Public Health Professor David Rosner.

77
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,360
Oh dear you, I'm not a sick
person. What does she do?

78
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,040
She traces them out of the building
with that fork in her hand.

79
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,330
A serving fork. A surfing for it.
Yeah. I felt rather lucky to escape.

80
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,170
Did she have typhoid? Um, I mean,
did she outwardly have typhoid? Well,

81
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:18,940
that's the thing. She never had any
symptoms. She felt perfectly healthy.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She was actually the first documented
case in North America of a healthy

83
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:25,540
carrier,

84
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,190
which is to say someone
who has the disease and is
contagious but never actually

85
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,020
feels the symptoms, the
symptoms. So in one weird way,

86
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,730
sobers thrilled,

87
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,510
like he's only read about this and
then here she is in front of him.

88
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,900
But think of how all of this
must've sounded. The Mary, I mean,

89
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:47,230
some guy from outer space comes
into your kitchen and says,

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,390
you're diseased and you're hurting people.
When you, she must've thought what?

91
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,930
I feel fine. I'm living a moral life.
I'm not a vagrant. I'm employed.

92
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,690
I'm a good solid citizen. You know,
you would be crazy to what you're,

93
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,200
even today, you'd probably grab your
knife. Yeah, you grabbed your knife. Well,

94
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:06,470
does he have any evidence of that?
She is spreading the disease. Not yet.

95
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,210
That's why he needs her poop.

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,680
So he goes back and finds her at a
rooming house. She kicks him out,

97
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,320
swears at him. She apparently
had quite a temper.

98
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:17,230
And then the health department, uh,

99
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,590
sends in this female doctor by
the name of s Josephine Baker.

100
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,880
Maybe she could ask for blood feces
in urine. A little more gentle.

101
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:28,040
Please don't know how you
asked for that gently.

102
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,130
But she tries and when it doesn't work,

103
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,160
she comes back a little bit later with
cops and they come to the house and Mary

104
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,540
Mallon, when she realized is
what's happening, disappears.
May mean disappears,

105
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,610
completely vanishes.

106
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,300
They end up searching the entire
place and they can't find her.

107
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Finally, I think they're about to leave.

108
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:56,330
When one of them spots her
skirt coming outside of a door.

109
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,020
It's a little piece of Calico high.
It kind of stuck in a doorway.

110
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,550
It opened the door and there she is

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,240
and so they drag her out and she comes
out kicking and screaming and screaming

112
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:14,920
and kicking. It takes all of
them to drag her out protesting.

113
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,250
They get her in the ambulance at Josephine
Bakers sits on her as according to

114
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,760
her, sits on her. And Baker
later said something like,

115
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,440
it was like being in a
cage with an angry lion.

116
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,240
So they take her down to the hospital.

117
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,320
They tested her pcs in urine
and they found that yes,

118
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:38,321
she was in fact a carrier
of live typhoid Bacilli

119
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,493
[inaudible].

120
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,050
So we're weird island man.
I spent a while on him.

121
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,060
So they isolate her and they
ultimately move her. Okay,

122
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,840
look for Manhattan too.
North brother island.

123
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,180
Let's have a bit of a haunted
bag. Yeah, and there she is.

124
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:02,963
Thanks man.

125
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,190
We went there to just to try to get our
heads around what she must have thought.

126
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,260
Let me think. What was the Allan Light
and everything is completely overgrown.

127
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,060
It was really creepy. Creepy because
it was in such dissolution. Yeah.

128
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,680
Yeah. Be careful where you step on one
end. There are all of these medical,

129
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:24,180
former medical buildings,

130
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,080
including a giant hospital where
they isolated tuberculosis patients.

131
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,010
So big brick, stately building. And
then on the other side of the island,

132
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,500
there's smaller wooden
buildings that are crushed.

133
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,740
Maybe where her cottages were,

134
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:41,280
her cottage would be if
it was still standing,

135
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,080
but it's not standing anymore.
Well, it was one room, one room.

136
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,450
Uh, I had a kitchen. It had a, I guess,

137
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,460
asleep sleeping area and a sitting area.

138
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,810
It probably so bad if you
didn't have to stay there.

139
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,690
You know, any places that you're not
free to leave of becomes like a prison.

140
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,120
So we're marching around and
then Lynn says to me, hey,

141
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:12,540
look at the view and holy Moly,

142
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,570
it's right there. That's when it really
hit me. If this is where her cabin was,

143
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,430
then one window of it looked
exactly on to Manhattan.

144
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,580
She could've seen where she used to live.

145
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,900
You can see the traffic on the streets.

146
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,880
This was like the most horrible seaside
vacation almost the whole time they had

147
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:43,430
her incarcerated, they took feces
three times a week, which is, you know,

148
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:46,460
it's not pleasant to have to do that. Um,

149
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,530
and sometimes she was negative and
sometimes she was positive. Wait, what?

150
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,970
So that's, that's another thing that
they were figuring out at the time.

151
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:01,860
So she was probably an intermittent
carrier. What does that mean?

152
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,020
The disease is always in her,

153
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,560
but sometimes she excretes it
and sometimes she doesn't. Oh,

154
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,650
that must've been confusing for her.
When I first came here, I was so nervous,

155
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,440
an almost prostrated with grief and
trouble. My eyes began to twitch.

156
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,620
This is from a letter that
Mary wrote from the island.

157
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,180
I have in fact been a peep show for
everybody. But if you keep reading it,

158
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:24,770
and in fact it's addressed to a lawyer,

159
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:29,090
it's clear that she was fighting this
and she had been sending her own feces,

160
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:32,660
samples herself to a
private lab in Manhattan.

161
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,480
And each one of those
was negative. Really.

162
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,360
The tuberculosis men would say
there she is the kidnapped woman.

163
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,630
Yeah. That is poison ivy.

164
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,390
She sees the city and loses still.

165
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,660
There are all these questions as to
whether any of this is legal. I mean,

166
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:51,710
even George Soper,

167
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:55,670
the guy who hunted her down said it
was contrary to the constitution of the

168
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:58,070
United States to hold her
under the circumstance.

169
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,680
And how long was she on the
silent? For? Three years. Wow.

170
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,330
And then what changed was a new
health commissioner took over.

171
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,090
And so he says it's just not right that
we keep a healthy woman locked up like

172
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:13,240
this. She was not dangerous to anybody.
If she didn't cook, he lets her go.

173
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,030
He lets you go back to Manhattan. But
he makes her promise. She did promise.

174
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,210
She signed an affidavit saying
she'll never cook again.

175
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,870
And she was released. They gave,

176
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,080
they've set her up with a job as a
laundress and they rent, here you go Mary.

177
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,770
And then, uh, you know, they
kept track of her for awhile.

178
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,620
Uh, and then at a certain point they
kind of stopped keeping track over.

179
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,940
So how many years will go by?
Five. Five. What happens next? A,

180
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,510
there's an outbreak of typhoid

181
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,520
where we're at a maternity hospital.
Oh, you're Josephine Baker,

182
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,380
who sat on her in the ambulance before.

183
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,850
She says that she goes and pays a visit
and walks into the kitchen and she says

184
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:04,300
the first person that she
encountered was typhoid Mary Mallon

185
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,160
[inaudible]

186
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,160
George Soper did some leg work on where
Mary had been and it turned out she had

187
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,030
worked at a restaurant,

188
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,770
two hotels and in and a sanatorium
as well as the hospital.

189
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,290
And at least according to his account,

190
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,520
two of the people that she
made sick during those couple
of years were children.

191
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,520
She was now a woman who
could not claim innocence.

192
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,210
She was known willfully and deliberately
to have taken desperate chances with

193
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:38,390
human life. She had abused her
privilege, she had broken her parole.

194
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,280
So then they put her back on north
brother island back in her bungalow. Um,

195
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,190
and there she sit.

196
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,580
She was a dangerous character
and must be treated accordingly.

197
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,150
Absolutely broke her
problem. I totally agree.

198
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,210
She made a deal and she didn't
keep the deal. But the thing is,

199
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:59,600
is that at the time she was
sent back to the island,

200
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,770
there were hundreds of other healthy
carriers identified all over New York,

201
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,240
and some of them were cooks. What
most really? Mostly men, by the way.

202
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,240
And they were cooking while
they were barred from cooking,

203
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:13,970
but not all of them always
listened. Huh. And yet,

204
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:18,950
Mary was the only one who they
isolated in this way. Why?

205
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,263
Why only her?

206
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,550
I think it was more about making people
feel safe than actually making them say,

207
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,580
oh, look out for the stare. Saul crumbled.
She was what we needed at the time

208
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,770
were in the hospital where the
tuberculosis patients were quarantined.

209
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,430
This was towards the end of
linen. My visit to the island.

210
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,380
Yeah. These must be the words. Yeah.

211
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,193
So when was she here?

212
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,560
This is where they brought
her after she had a stroke.

213
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,620
And this is where she was for
the last six years of her life.

214
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,320
Did she die in here? Yeah.
