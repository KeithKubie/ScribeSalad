NICK BUTCHER: Hello
and welcome to

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.630
Android Design in Action.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.910
This week, we've got a
jam-packed show where we're

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.070
going to take you through some
of the redesigns of the Google

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.210
Play applications.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.190
We're very lucky to be joined
by some special guests from

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.310
the Android design
team this week.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.125
So as always, I am your
host, Nick Butcher.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.320
And in New York, we have--

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.500
ROMAN NURIK: Hey guys,
Roman Nurik here.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.470
And over in Mountain View
we have our special

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.490
guests Marco and Owen.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.870
Do you want to introduce
yourselves a little bit, guys?

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.800
MARCO PAGLIA: Hi everybody.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.970
Thank you for having us here.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.060
My name is Marco
and I lead user

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.070
experience for Google Play.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.290
OWEN OTTO: Hi.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.070
I'm Owen Otto.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.760
I'm the lead designer on the
Google Play music app.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.990
NICK BUTCHER: Great.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.570
So thanks very much
for joining us.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.870
So without any further ado,
let's jump into some of the

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.048
processes behind
the redesigns.

00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:55.040
MARCO PAGLIA: Great.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.750
So let's get started.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.340
So Google Play you're probably
familiar with it, but this is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.330
a quick introduction.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.620
Google Play is the media
offering from Google.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.170
It basically covers all your
content from games to apps,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.580
music, books, movies,
and magazines.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.450
It's the place where you
get your content.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.490
It's the place where
you enjoy it.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.220
So today we're going to be
talking about the redesign.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.280
Particularly, there are three
key words that are going to go

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.150
across the presentation, is how
we design it responsive,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.700
how we made it responsive,
modular, and

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.490
emotional at the same time.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.300
So we had three goals in mind
when we redesigned the Google

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.570
Play suite of applications.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.440
One was to create consistency
across Play, to populate

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.850
content dynamically, and to
create efficient layout on web

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.100
and device.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.150
So creating consistency.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.770
Basically, if you have been
using Google Play in the past,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160
you would have seen that we had
a lot of different ways to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.770
represent content.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.190
And we thought that we sort of
needed to make it uniform in

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.430
order to create an experience
that felt familiar to people.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.940
Populate content dynamically
means that while we had ways

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.490
to display content in a dynamic
way across devices and

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.450
web, there were certain types
of content, particularly

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.230
collections, that couldn't
be displayed dynamically.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.060
For example, you will remember
those tiles that were

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.630
promoting different collections
of content.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.430
Those tiles had to be
manually drawn,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.570
generated, exported in JPEGs.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.080
And so we couldn't either
propose content based on your

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.720
preferences, collection based on
your preferences because we

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.970
had to produce those
tiles beforehand.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.685
And also it was a very labor
intensive process.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.790
When we talk about efficient
layout, it's not about the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.390
layout being efficient,
but it's rather make

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.070
our work more efficient.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.010
So we had to design for a lot
of different screens and

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.390
platforms, including the web.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.030
And we just wanted to have a
system so that designers could

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.550
define and design their layouts
once and apply them to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.400
all platforms.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.460
So we could focus more on the
new features and the cool

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.890
stuff rather than translating
the same thing

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.140
over and over again.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.150
So let's jump into the solution
and the design

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.200
principles that took us
through this journey.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.700
So everything starts
with cards.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.540
The interesting thing about
cards is that it is this

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.720
[INAUDIBLE] element that
defines an entity, that

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.490
defines an object.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.150
And so rather than designing
grids, which is a sort of

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.800
outside in approach where you
have grids and you put stuff

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.780
in it, we thought about cards
being this [INAUDIBLE] element

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.590
that creates spaces from
the inside out.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.670
So multiple cards shows up on
your layout and define the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.380
content that you see.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.320
Let me get into some examples.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.850
So a card is great because,
like I said, it contains

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.270
objects, whether they are
applications or albums or

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.660
movies or magazines or books
or even people or

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.390
artists and so forth.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.740
They basically can contain any
type of thing and by being in

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.100
the same module, we are able to
display things next to each

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.180
other, no matter what kind
of entity they are.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.650
The other great property that
cards have is the ability to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.290
be in different shapes.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.450
So we design a lot of different
cards so that the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.040
[INAUDIBLE] could be more
interesting and hierarchical.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.320
So we had what we call tiny
cards or small cards or big

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.550
cards, and cards can also
be displayed in multiple

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.960
orientations in order to
accommodate different layouts.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.060
We also have what we call a
medium card or a list view

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.670
type of card.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.280
So there are two things that
having different sizes

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.560
accommodate for.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.460
One is that they create
hierarchy.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.450
They can show things to be more

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.030
important by being bigger.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.670
And also to accommodate for
different informational

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.800
purposes, meaning they can have
more or less white space

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.230
in them to show more or
less information.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.500
For example, in the store, when
we find something that

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.810
you maybe like, we put in a
bigger card which has a bigger

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.920
info area in order for display
more reasons about why you may

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.970
like it, or maybe we can
display people that

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.550
+1 it and so forth.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.290
And same we do on other
applications and you'll see

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.540
that in music later.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.190
Another key element of our
design are canvasses.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.610
So once you understand cards,
you also understand how your

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.110
application is basically just
a canvas on top of which

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.670
elements are displayed.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.540
So it doesn't matter if the
canvas is the store or music

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.430
or whatnot.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.080
The point is that you have
content that is displayed on

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.550
top of these canvases.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.290
Somehow our design tries to be
APK agnostic in a way that you

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.620
may see in the future a book
in the music application.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.140
Why not?

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.420
The store is a perfect example
where all the content come

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.065
together in one place.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.600
Another great example of
canvases is what we do today

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.450
in the movies application.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.480
If you're familiar with it, when
you pause a movie, you

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.670
basically see the actor
that is there.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.670
You see similar movies where
the actor has been

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.140
participating in.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.330
And this is just a canvas.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.140
It is a canvas where we display
on top of it a person

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.870
card and a list view card with
a bunch of movies in it.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.180
It just about canvases the
content lives on top of them.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.570
Another notion that is
key to our design is

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.340
the notion of clusters.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.860
So once you have multiple cards
next to each other,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.590
because of the visual psychology
law of proximity,

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.420
you perceive it as one
unit, a cluster.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.320
And that allows us to display
collections in this way.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.780
We also made these collections
to be dynamic and follow that

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.290
hierarchy that I talked about
before by allowing a cluster

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.480
to have different
models in them.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.665
And because we designed those
cards beforehand to be plugged

00:07:21.665 --> 00:07:25.470
in to each other through
heights, they are following

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.210
the same structure.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.720
We can basically display
clusters that have different

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.490
types of cards in them
and still feel as a

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.710
unit, as you see here.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.670
Also naturally, the clusters
they work across our typical

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:48.730
canvases like phones, or
tablets, and web and beyond.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.600
This led us into this responsive
layout philosophy.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.230
When we talk about responsive
layout, we're talking more

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.340
about a design approach,
rather than the

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.130
responsive web designer.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.430
So we're not talking about
designing your website to

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.230
respond to different canvases,
but rather how as designers we

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.930
thought about how our layouts
will expand across multiple

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.120
screen sizes.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.070
And this is what we define here
as responsible layout and

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.640
responsive design.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.530
So as you see, we took into
consideration all the typical

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:25.350
canvases from phones to tablet,
seven inch, to tablet

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.170
10 inches, and typical
laptops.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.000
We always had all those canvases
in mind and we kept

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.220
on designing throughout
these canvases

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.620
across the whole process.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.890
We didn't start from phone or
from a particular tablet.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.875
The process took us through all
these canvases, and all we

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:45.530
were thinking about was how
many columns these layouts

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.910
will be supported on.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.080
It's just a number of columns.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.770
We ended up almost not calling
phones phones anymore, but

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.000
just calling them four inches
or three inches or maybe two

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.530
columns layout, three columns
layout, et cetera.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.530
Let's get into the output a
little bit and then we will

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.160
jump into music which is a great
example of how these

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.700
principles are applied
in practice.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.820
But some examples that I want to
show in these layouts are,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.800
for instance, this is the store
and you can see how the

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.830
same types of cluster scales
across all screens.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.300
In particular, this particular
movie is recommended to me

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.750
bigger because a friend
of +1 it.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.330
And you see how its prominence
hierarchy is scaled across

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.180
phone, a seven inch, and a ten
inch tablet, growing in size,

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.540
and allowing other content to
display next to it by keeping

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.570
that hierarchical
relationship.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.540
On phone you don't see other
content part of the same

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.500
cluster just because the space
doesn't allow that, but when

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.630
you get to the 10 inch tablet
instead, we have a very

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.080
beautiful big cover with other
related content next to it

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.330
which is recommended to me.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.340
When we're talking about
modularity, we also applied

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.800
the same principles in the store
in the way we show our

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.740
banners, in the way we apply
our photography to our

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.760
collections.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.640
For example, here you see that
we have an author photos next

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.160
to the content and you see how
we show more or less content

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.010
according to the number of
columns supported by the

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.330
particular device.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.410
And you also see how the photo
shifts a little bit.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.960
So on phone, it shifts a little
bit to the left in

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.710
order to always be centered
in that particular place.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.890
But this responsive layout,
this efficiency, is also

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.500
applied to the way we started
producing these assets, these

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.240
photography.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.050
It is always a 16 by 9 photo
that scales and moves a little

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.160
bit across all devices.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.695
And the same is true even
for our banners.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.970
Finally, about familiarity.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.980
Like I said before, we
want to be as much as

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.760
possible APK agnostic.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.710
Our experience has to feel
just like one experience.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.460
And so by making all layouts
look and feel the same, you

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.540
have this transitional point,
for example, that feels really

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.050
natural and smooth.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.130
For example, in the books
application, we have a set of

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.800
recommendations at the bottom.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.920
And when you expand those
recommendations you're lending

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.370
to the store, but in reality,
the view is exactly the same.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.210
So the user will just feel
like he's expanding his

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:24.630
collection.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.680
He wants to see all the elements
present in the

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:26.945
collection.

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:30.500
And he won't necessarily think
about now I just landed into a

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.750
different APK.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:37.030
So this allows us even to mix
our applications more and I

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.990
guess creating some cross
vertical opportunities across

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.266
our play applications.

00:11:45.266 --> 00:11:48.880
And finally about familiarity,
by applying the same design

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.240
principles across all the play
applications for it, you

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.210
basically see how we start
generating a type of brand

00:11:56.210 --> 00:12:01.670
that happens to be visible
across all of them.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.150
It's just very recognizable.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.210
It's very playful through the
varied colored action bars

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.761
through this cards type of
metaphor through this grid.

00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:13.540
It really starts feeling like
something that differentiate

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.700
from other applications present
out there and it feels

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.790
very Googely.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.020
Now we're going to
talk about music.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.980
So I'll let Owen to continue.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.130
OWEN OTTO: Hi.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.800
Now I'm going to give you a
little walk through on how we

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.570
applied some of the principles
Marco was just talking about

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.180
to the design of the music
app, in specific.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.600
And I wanted to start with just
perhaps a provocative

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.440
idea within the design
community.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.170
There's this notion that we
should be designing for mobile

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.680
first that's very
popular lately.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.500
Previously, maybe people were
designing web apps and then

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.210
they were kind of figuring out
how to scale them down to the

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.300
phone, which we realized was a
bad idea, and maybe we should

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.440
focus on the phone first.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.600
And I think where we've moved
onto as is possibly a next

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.980
step in this evolution,
which is designing for

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.140
everything at once.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.330
So as Marco mentioned, we were
thinking about not just the

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.630
phone, but the seven inch tablet
and the 10 inch tablet

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.470
and the web.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.720
And even in music's
case, the TV.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.530
So practically speaking, one
trick that we used to approach

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.610
this problem is we found that
if we, on a first pass, we

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.450
kind of think about the phone
in portrait and the 10 inch

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.180
tablet in landscape, that this
sort of stretches the design

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.940
and really makes us think
through things

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.960
in a way that scales.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.240
So I'm going to give you a
little demo of the music app

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.730
with a phone in portrait and
the tablet in landscape.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.540
And I'll talk about these
principles that Marco was

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.950
mentioning as well as just
showing you some cool things

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.980
in the music app.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.670
So this is our Listen
Now page.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.600
It's sort of the home
screen in the app.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.050
The basic idea of this is when
you have a music subscription

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.260
service and you suddenly have
millions of tracks at your

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.640
fingertips, it can be
a little daunting to

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.110
figure out what to play.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.596
So this screen tries to
be your concierge.

00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:13.570
It knows your taste and tries
to pick what you may want to

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.010
play next to make this easy.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.760
And this really shows the grid
system that Marco was talking

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.380
about and how it scales and
solves the problem on both the

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.480
phone and the tablet.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.950
So what you see here is we have
a two column grid on the

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:40.790
phone and the five column grid
on the tablet, as well as

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.100
different card sizes.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.260
There's a sort of small or
medium sized card on the phone

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.610
with a Daft Punk at the top and
this very large card on

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.830
the tablet.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.760
And it just brings a familiar
experience to the user between

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.120
both form factors, as well as
making it easier for us to

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.160
design and easier for engineers
to implement when we

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.015
reuse these grids and
card systems.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.560
Next I wanted to show you what
an artist page looks like.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.580
So this is the page
for She and Him.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.980
They have a new album out now.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.680
And the thing that we thought
was really interesting in this

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.900
layout here is in opposition
to a kind of

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.880
typical tablet layout.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.130
Like imagine in a Gmail app
where you have sort of one

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.220
column that has all of the
messages and on the right is

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.340
sort of an expansion of
one of those messages.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.780
We decided to go over here on
the tablet where we really

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:38.230
stick with just one panel, but
we make the graphics really

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.600
large and beautiful
and immersive.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.375
As well as by using the cluster
layout, the same one

00:15:46.375 --> 00:15:48.110
that I was talking about before
in the Listen Now

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:53.830
screen, you can scale up to
fill the page nicely.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.430
You can also see in action on
this page the cluster model

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.370
that we were talking about
before that's spread out

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.380
throughout all the Play apps
where you can have different

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.080
sections, in this case related
artists, and you can expand

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.330
them to get to more.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.810
Next I want to show you
our playlist screen.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.040
One of the really cool things
we have in the service is we

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.720
actually have a team of editors
who are sitting around

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.450
making these awesome playlists,
things like--

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.100
I like this one called Intro
to Nordic Metal.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.090
So you can learn about new
genres you don't know anything

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.240
about or keep up to date on a
genre that you're really into.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.080
This is one I've been listening
to lately that's on

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.160
Indy Electronic.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.780
One of the really nice things
that we came up with on this

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.680
page was we wanted to continue
that design that I was showing

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.880
on the artist page where we have
a big immersive graphic

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.740
at the top.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.270
But when we got to the playlist
page, we were like,

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.290
what do we do because the
artist, there's a lot of

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.730
artists on this page?

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.860
And we struck upon the idea
of just doing this kind of

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.120
rotating carousel.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.200
So you can see on many different
artists photos from

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.940
all the songs that are
in the playlist.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.810
Another interesting thing here
about the relationship between

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.280
the phone and the tablet in
landscape is you can see over

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.380
here on the song list on the
tablet, we've got a little bit

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.440
more room here.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.130
So rather than showing the song
title and the artist name

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.670
right next to each other as we
do on the phone, we spread

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.160
them out into separate columns
on the tablet.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.430
And you can also bring in a
little bit more information on

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.060
the tablet like the song
duration, which just doesn't

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.890
really fit nicely
on the phone.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.870
Another example of this same
kind of principle is in our

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.610
Now Playing bar which you see
at the bottom of both the

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.640
phone and the tablet, which
shows you the currently

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.610
playing song and gives
you a few controls.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.730
Now on the phone where there's
not a lot of space, we just

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.330
have a play button in addition
to the song info.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.760
But on the tablet, we give you
a full previous button and

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.470
next button and even thumbs up
and thumbs down so you can do

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.650
some rating.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:10.570
So it's just that you can take
the same elements and just add

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.020
a little bit more
on the tablet.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.860
But you still maintain that
consistency and reusing the

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.770
same components from an
engineering perspective.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.880
ROMAN NURIK: One of things I
wanted to call out really

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.280
quickly is that this isn't
like two separate apps.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.300
Throughout this entire
presentation or demo so far

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.146
you guys have basically been
showing the same app on a

00:18:32.146 --> 00:18:32.920
phone and a tablet.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.150
It's just that the individual
elements in the app, the

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.240
individual elements within the
Now Playing bar and within the

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.170
kind of song list, those stretch
and those kind of

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.610
realign themselves or
position themselves.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.600
That's one of my favorite things
about this app is that

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.600
it's truly a responsive
design at the

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.620
individual component level.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.140
OWEN OTTO: Yeah.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.390
That's really important
to our approach.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.650
A couple other things
I wanted to mention.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.190
One cool thing we did on the
phone because we didn't have

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.690
room for those next and previous
buttons, we have

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.910
these little touches like you
can swipe to go the next song.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.460
It's pretty cool.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.220
And the next piece I want
to talk about is

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.470
our Now Playing screen.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.080
This, again, shows the idea we
were talking about before

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.730
where the same design when you
have these large graphics,

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.070
scales to both form factors.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.460
Maybe the graphic gets cropped
a little bit differently, but

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.550
it still is beautiful
and immersive.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.020
And again, you can swipe to go
to the next track on the Now

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.580
Playing screen.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.210
It's pretty nice.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.220
The last piece I wanted to talk
about is our Queue UI.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.720
This is where you can see what
songs are coming up next.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.140
And here there's some
other nice gestures.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.950
You can swipe to remove songs if
you don't want to hear one.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.440
Now on the tablet, we did a
nice little touch to just

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.140
customize for the tablet and use
this space well, which is

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.600
just that rather than making
this be a full screen like it

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.910
is on the phone, the queue, we
made it just be a pop up.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.593
So you can still stay in your
Now Playing screen without

00:20:20.593 --> 00:20:22.370
kind of having to leave
to go somewhere else.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.730
So that's the basic idea is to
design for the phone and

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.260
tablet and think about
all the other

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.170
screens at the same time.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.810
And a lot of these components
can be reused and scale with

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:44.140
just slight tweaks to optimize
for the form factor.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:44.560
NICK BUTCHER: All right.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.030
Excellent.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.040
Thank you very much for
going through that.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.210
That's a brilliant whirlwind
tour of cards philosophy

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.400
behind Google Play and
how to apply it.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.230
I had a few questions I
wanted to pick up on.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.340
So you said you're trying to
think about all devices at

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.410
once when you're designing.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.600
Practically, how do you
go about doing that?

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.320
I mean, do you have a large
canvas with all the different

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.230
screen sizes all at once?

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.480
How do you actually go
about doing this?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.170
OWEN OTTO: You want
me to take that?

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.040
MARCO PAGLIA: Sure.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.910
OWEN OTTO: So I think one tact
is the one I was mentioning

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:25.500
which is when we're going in
deep on a design, we may think

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.860
we may narrow the scope down
at first to the phone in

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.000
portrait and a tablet
in landscape.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.750
But I think another key piece is
that we worked on the Store

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.180
app everywhere in great
detail at first.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.000
So this allowed us to then learn
a lot about the patterns

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.090
and how they work on the
different form factors, and we

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.980
could bring that back
to each of the

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.550
different vertical apps.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:53.780
MARCO PAGLIA: Yeah.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:57.580
There's a lot to say about a
good technique for having a

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.240
suite of applications
to be consistent.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.300
To basically reinvest on one
first in order to get to learn

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.980
all the lessons that needs to be
learned and to do the best

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.100
tweaks on the layouts.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.525
And then sort of expand that
to other applications.

00:22:11.525 --> 00:22:14.850
There's a lot of code that
can be re-utilized.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.770
And that becomes very useful.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.360
We're actually moving into a
space where we try to make

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.310
those components more a
part of the framework.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.360
And that will be the ultimate
goal, to really have these

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.860
components to be called by any
Play application and just

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.290
inherit a lot of properties.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.240
From the design side, I wish you
could come to our office,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.950
because it's pretty
interesting to

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.260
see the way we work.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.260
Most the time you see people,
for example, working on

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.140
Illustrator and multiple
canvases representing phones

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.420
and tablets next to each other
and just copy and pasting

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.090
elements from one another,
see if they work.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.590
I think it's very important from
a design perspective to

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.410
have tools that allows you to
see things at the same time to

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.980
support canvases.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.230
And I think a lot of
applications that we use today

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:04.382
have made great progress
allowing for that.

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:05.850
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.710
ROMAN NURIK: One of the
questions I had was in terms

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.990
of how you communicate
with engineers.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.090
So this is actually something
that we've covered before.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.600
We've covered this when Alex
Faaborg from your team joined

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.690
us, but just wanted
to get your take.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.100
So during the process of
designing the Google Play

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.950
client apps as well as the
Google Play music app, can you

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.760
share any tips and tricks or
anything like that from the

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.910
process of working with
the engineering team?

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.620
MARCO PAGLIA: So one important
thing for us

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.890
is to be very specific.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:43.140
So skipping all the details
about how we get to design

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.960
those applications in the
first place and all the

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.180
creativity that goes into it,
but focusing on the specs, if

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.690
you wish, which is where
we have a very tight

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:52.470
collaboration with

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:57.180
engineering, we make red lines.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:03.590
We make a lot of very detailed
specifications because it's

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.530
very important to
produce mocks.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.630
And it's very important to
define all paddings, all phone

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.600
sizes, everything that is
necessary to make this layout

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.490
to be the way we
want it to be.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:20.150
But like I said before, if you
have these modular places in

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.020
mind, it's really important to
get to a very precise level,

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.600
the finish in the first time,
but after that, it's done.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.250
There's a lot of code that
can be shared afterwards.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:33.070
So what happened is that we
had to produce a lot of

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.230
guidelines and specifications,
especially for the Store which

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.880
shaped first.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.110
But after that, we managed to
have engineering to be talking

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.390
to each other and get a lot of
that information almost for

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.695
free which which was
very important.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.310
NICK BUTCHER: Is that another
example of your inside out

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.340
rather than an outside
in approach?

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.720
So by going deep and working on
the Play Store and defining

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.920
detailed red lines for different
sizes of elements,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.495
you were then just able
to say use the same--

00:25:02.495 --> 00:25:02.800
MARCO PAGLIA: Yes.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.506
NICK BUTCHER: --as well?

00:25:03.506 --> 00:25:03.860
MARCO PAGLIA: Yes.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.690
Yes.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.160
Exactly.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.450
And about the communication,
documents are never enough and

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.410
they keep on changing.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.740
So we also have a specific
website which is where we post

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.680
all our materials and they
are more accessible.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.870
And this is where engineering
can go and get all the

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.150
information that they need.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:31.160
Plus, we are lucky, we work next
to the engineering team.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.640
We are part of the same team.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.040
We're in the same building.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.450
And so nothing can be better
than face to face of course.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.190
It's obviously very hard to
get to the right level of

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.080
specification by simply writing
documents, especially

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.090
when you get to motion design
and all those nuances that

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:54.220
Owen has shown like the playlist
design if you don't

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.960
sit next to each other.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.375
OWEN OTTO: I think one other
thing I'd add that applies

00:25:59.375 --> 00:26:01.960
that we really did in the Google
Play redesign and just

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.060
applies to working with
engineers in general is to get

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.170
the engineers involved really
early in the process.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:14.680
So I started meeting with
engineers and presenting when

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.010
we just had really rough
sketches of the information

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.690
architecture and kind of a rough
idea of how different

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.810
features would work, not
beautiful mocks, not things

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.520
were red lined out or anything,
but just kind of the

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.830
rough strokes.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.090
And through that, we get
everyone's feedback early on

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.750
and also learn about things that
might be technical issues

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.680
that we might want to work
around in the design or tweak

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.479
to make sure that we have a
really good user experience at

00:26:43.479 --> 00:26:44.729
the end of the day.

00:26:46.914 --> 00:26:48.420
ROMAN NURIK: Thanks.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.920
NICK BUTCHER: I want to ask
a quick question about the

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.290
awesome use of the Action
Bar and the translucent

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.210
background.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.560
So hopefully people noticed
it in the demo there.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.240
But one of my favorite features
of the app is on the

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.540
menu screen, like the artist
screen for example.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.600
You start off with a fully
translucent action bar.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.930
And then as you scroll down the
content, it fades in the

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.130
background [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.810
To me, it works brilliant for
making the most of the imagery

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.935
as well as working with
the Action Bar

00:27:14.935 --> 00:27:16.330
pattern very, very flexibly.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.370
Can you give us some background
on how you came up

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:25.930
with that or what were your
design goals for that piece?

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.230
OWEN OTTO: I think basically the
idea was we really wanted

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:35.170
to focus on the imagery, and by
a sort of making the Action

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.210
bar be transparent, it really
made the image pop more and

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:41.490
more of the centerpiece
of the screen.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.580
And then I don't remember who
came up with the idea of it

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.250
kind of fading into orange, but
roughly, it was to solve

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.570
the problem of that when you
scrolled down, you needed to

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.730
make sure that you could see the
controls when the picture

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.080
wasn't there anymore.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.050
And so it just wound up being
kind of a cool touch to solve

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:00.240
that problem.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.650
MARCO PAGLIA: Yeah and something
to say about the

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.100
Action bar.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.330
I think there's a lot of ways
that we can play with Action

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:10.860
bars to be differentiating
within applications.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.100
And this is a very
good example.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.050
And you have a lot of examples
on Android in general.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:20.650
So in Play, for instance, we
decided to put a flat icon

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.710
instead of the 3D icon
in the Action bar.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.900
We made this Action
bar very flashy.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.800
We kind of invested in them and
we invested in the colors

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.190
that we have.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.500
At the same time, when you get
to an artist, you kind of feel

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.760
that that is the
artist's page.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.300
It's not the music page.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.870
And so it has to belong
to the artist.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:38.510
And that's why it has
to feel that it's

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.420
more neutral as possible.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.830
And like I said before, a lot
of examples on Android today

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:48.620
about different uses of Action
bar that can make our layout

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.590
very flexible.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.530
Another example that I can
remember, for example, is the

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:58.190
agenda view on a calendar on a
phone where the Action bar

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:01.760
shows one of the items of the
agenda view itself and so it

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.390
shows the information
present in there.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.100
It doesn't have any
calendar icon.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.590
And it's just part of
the informational

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.640
structure of the page.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.900
Same goes with the people
application where in a

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.560
of the people application, the
Action bar takes the name of

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.990
the person and it's not just the
anti-real estate to have

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.790
an app for them.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.190
So I re-invite everybody to
think about ways that we can

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.300
play with the Action bar but
still keeping it consistent

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.450
because that really
affects usability.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:38.090
So it's important to obviously
stick to the patterns.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:41.840
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah definitely.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.265
I think it's one of the best
ways you can bring branding to

00:29:44.265 --> 00:29:44.970
your application as well.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.730
You have this bar that
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.840
I think you've done a really
nice job in the Play app so

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.440
that it's obviously a suite
of very closely--

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.680
like close cousins apps.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.660
You can tell that they're
designed together in concert,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.900
but they have their own
personality right through the

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.460
different colors and so forth.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.770
So I think that's a really nice
use of the Action bar to

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.770
bring that branding to
each individual app.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.230
MARCO PAGLIA: There's some other
tricks that we made with

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.900
color that you can
pay attention to.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.530
For example, we have, instead
of affordances like the

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:18.330
pinning icon and other icons
that change color according to

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.430
the application you're in.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:22.120
So on music, everything is
styled to be orange.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.500
In books, everything is
styled to be blue.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.700
In magazines, everything
is styled to be purple.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.690
And same goes even with
the touch feedback.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.450
If you pay attention to the
music app, the touch feedback

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.890
is actually an orange overlay,
while on the books application

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:36.595
it's a blue overlay.

00:30:36.595 --> 00:30:38.670
There are a lot of little
touches that we put here and

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:44.750
there to make each application
to feel very playful but also

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:49.870
part of the same family.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.450
ROMAN NURIK: One quick thing I
wanted to point out for the

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.190
developers that are in the
audience, if you're looking to

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:58.890
do some sort of kind of accent
color styling of your app and

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.210
if you create some specs or
mocks from a designer that

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.950
says everything should be of a
certain accent color or brand

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:08.680
color, you can use a tool called
Android Holo Colors and

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.950
also the Action bar style
generator to do that for you.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:12.210
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.890
So I think we might have run
over a little bit but that was

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.310
some wonderful content you guys
have presented to us.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.490
So thank you very much for
being our guest today and

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.190
coming and presenting that.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.720
So that's all for this week.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.670
Thanks very much for joining
us once again on Android

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:25.580
Design in Action.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.110
And we'll see you soon.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.680
MARCO PAGLIA: Thank
you for having us.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.320
OWEN OTTO: Thanks.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:28.810
MARCO PAGLIA: Bye.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.060
Bye everybody.
