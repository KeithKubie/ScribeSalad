00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.830
HONEST TRAILER : TWILIGHT ECLIPSE

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.190
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Comes the most forgettable Twilight movie

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.259
yet…

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.190
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Witness the continuation of one of the most

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.410
forced love triangles in film history…

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.910
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Where this shirtless guy is clearly a third

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.910
wheel.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.460
EDWARD
“We don’t need you to handle anything”

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.460
BELLA
“Ugh!”

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.839
NARRATOR
Because she told him in previous movies and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.719
in this movie, that she will always choose
Shovel-Face.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.719
JACOB
“You’re marrying him?”

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.309
NARRATOR
But that won’t stop her from leading him

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.309
on.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.559
BELLA
“I’m asking you… to kiss me.”

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.390
NARRATOR
Just so they can continue to sell “Team

00:00:45.390 --> 00:01:20.790
Jacob” t-shirts…
and pad the running time, with three-way stares.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.840
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Prepare yourself, for two hours of filler,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840
like...

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.990
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Laying in bed…

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.220
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Walking around outside…

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.341
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Villains standing around doing nothing…

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.950
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And pointless flashbacks for minor characters.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.330
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A movie so gay…

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.800
It has groups of shirtless boys

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.440
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Shovelface refusing sex.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.980
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And the tent scene out of Brokeback Mountain.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.380
JACOB
“I am hotter than you.”

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.520
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
An actress so terrible...

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
BELLA
“Have you…”

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.960
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
She speaks with weird long pauses.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.160
BELLA
“…imprinted on someone?”

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.320
BELLA (CONT’D)
“We’re gonna talk about this but…you.”

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.210
BELLA (CONT’D)
“I would’nt be uh… warm.”

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.430
BELLA (CONT’D)
“You looked…worried.”

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.229
BELLA (CONT’D)
“My life is not…miserable.”

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.480
BELLA (CONT’D)
“Edward is…old school.”

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.790
NARRATOR
And three movies in, still has the same dumb

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.790
expression.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.200
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Is every director afraid to tell her to close

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200
her mouth?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.900
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A final battle so unfulfilling, it’s built

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.410
up an entire movie…

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.800
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
but is over about a minute…

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.910
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
and doesn’t have any impact on the overall

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.910
saga.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.140
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A film so bland…

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.170
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Oh no, this again..

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.750
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Even we are running out of things to be honest

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.750
about…

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.600
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
It’s lazy even by Twilight standards.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.200
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Don’t forget to watch this weeks Screen

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200
Junkies episode...

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.050
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Where dads answer Twilight trivia for their

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.050
daughters…

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.070
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
We made an eleven year old cry.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.320
NARRATOR (CONT’D
And tell me something you’d like to hear

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:07.700
me say in my epic voice.
