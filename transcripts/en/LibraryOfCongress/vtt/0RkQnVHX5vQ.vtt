00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:30.470
[ Silence ]

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.770
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: All right.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.460
We have a jam-packed
evening here.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.040
So, I'm just going to dive
right in and get started.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.390
So, I am Betsy Peterson.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.210
I'm the director of the
American Folklife Center here

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.290
at the Library of Congress
and I'd like to welcome you

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.000
to a very special edition of the
Benjamin Botkin lecture series.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.970
This evening, in various ways,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.100
we're going to explore the
legacy of a very special person

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.160
in the history of the
library, in the history

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.190
of the American Folklife
Center, Alan Jabbour.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.720
Alan passed away on January
13th, 2017, and I'm happy to see

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.570
so many familiar faces and also
many family members of Alan

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.150
and Karen Jabbour are here and I
especially want to welcome them

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.990
and I will actually
probably let you stand

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.820
and if I do not get all of
your names, please forgive me,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.030
but I want Karen Singer Jabbour
and daughter Rebecca and Aaron,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.370
daughters, daughter and son of
Alan and Karen, please stand.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.750
And their spouse and children.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.210
I know there are many
siblings of Karen

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.690
and I think there are
family members of Alan here.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.950
So, please stand up.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.510
We would love to say
thank you and welcome.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:05.040
[ Background noise ]

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.190
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Before
introducing the speakers,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.440
I want to say as we know,
Alan was the founding director

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.360
of the American Folklife
Center and in that role,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.450
he was a direct successor
to Benjamin Botkin,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.290
head of the library's
folklore section in the 1940's.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.110
So, it's appropriate that we're
presenting this evening event

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.900
of talks and music about
Alan as part of this series.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.330
This series also allows us to
present the, and highlight,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.670
the work of the best
in leading scholars,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.550
experts in the disciplines of
folklore at the musicology,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.160
oral history, and
cultural heritage.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.810
It also allows us to
enhance the collections

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.850
of the American Folklife
Center, and for the center

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.970
and the library, the Botkin
lectures form an important facet

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.310
of our acquisitions activities.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.630
Each lecture is videotaped
as you can gather,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.880
with these bright lights,
and it becomes part

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.890
of the permanent
collections of the center.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.440
So, the lectures are going to
be posted later as a webcast

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.400
on the libraries website
where they will be available

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.750
to people throughout the world
and for generations to come.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.670
So, if you have noisy cellphones
on right now or anything

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.980
that might ring later, please
turn it off at this time.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.220
So, Alan, being the director of
the American Folklife Center,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.060
from 1976, I think September
of 1976 through June of 1999,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.940
that was only one of many roles

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.060
that Alan assumed throughout
his lifetime in his efforts

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.290
to preserve and carry forward
folk cultural traditions.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.680
Alan was a musician, an
artist, a native Floridian,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.610
a southern gentleman, a writer,
an administrator with a vision,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.360
folklorist, researcher,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.170
president of the
American Folklore Society,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.130
a member of numerous
boards and so much more.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.290
Our speakers this evening
will be addressing many

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.560
of these different facets and
aspects of Alan's contributions,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.780
but before I introduce
them I did want

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.070
to mention one dimension
of Alan's work

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.150
that I think has received very
little attention over the years

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.240
and that is Alan's work to raise
the profile of philanthropy

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.810
and giving for the folk
and traditional arts.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.870
Alan came to D.C and the
federal government in the 1970's

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.480
and we know that
was a very heaty

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.720
and sometimes turbulent
time for cultural heritage

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.540
and preservation legislation
and government support and Alan

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.760
and several other folklore
luminaries at that time,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.350
Archie Green, Bess Lomax
Hawes, and Ralph Rinzler,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.350
among them were right
there at the very beginning

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.910
and they helped build
this foundation

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.370
for several public
folklore institutions

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.930
and perhaps Alan's work at the
national endowment for the arts

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.960
as an initial head of the folk
arts program provided him a

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.760
window for him to understand
the importance of support.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.900
And not only to provide
needed financial resources,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.060
but also to lend legitimacy
and validation to the diversity

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.250
of folk and traditional culture
in the United States and beyond.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.460
But, with so much emphasis on
public support, Alan and others,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.600
Joe Wilson, Archie Green,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.700
also recognized the critical
importance of galvanizing

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.100
and strengthening private
and individual support

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.260
for the grass roots
vernacular culture

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.570
that we all hold so dear.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.820
Alan and others helped to
find the fund for folk culture

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.730
in 1991 and held the
planning meetings right here

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.030
in the library.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.120
Alan was the first chair of
the board of trustees and in

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.390
that capacity, helped guide
the direction of that fund

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.160
to help serve as an advocate and
liaison for the field of folk

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.370
and traditional arts with
private philanthropy.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.720
In that role, over about a
15-year span, they steered over,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.100
well over $10 million
dollars of new support

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.450
to the folk arts field which is
pretty amazing and in his work

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.750
at the folklife center,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.930
Alan also established several
endowments and gift funds

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.130
to support the work of
the center and others

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.980
and individuals to
do their work.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.640
The Ray Virginia Alan fund, the
Blant Nolan fund, the Gerald

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.470
and Karen Parson's
fund and of course,

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.240
the Henry Reed fund
for folk artists.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.350
On the occasion of
Alan's retirement,

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.800
Alan and Karen Jabbour, with
several other individuals,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.590
established the fund, the
Henry Reed fund in 2000.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.730
It honors Alan's musical mentor,
West Virginia fiddler Henry Reed

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.610
and provides support
for folk artists

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.840
or to projects benefiting folk
artists whether it be a program,

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:15.320
a recording project, a,
providing opportunities

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.450
for artists to do research and
to work with other artists.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.360
Since 2004, the Henry Reed
fund has provided awards

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.160
to 10 individuals and I know we
have several individuals here

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.590
tonight, perhaps some
Henry Reed recipients,

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.230
but I know we also have many
individuals who have given

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.590
to the Henry Reed
fund and I truly want

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.210
to thank you for doing that.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.960
I also want to acknowledge
Henry Reed's son,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.550
Dean Reed who is
here with us tonight

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.710
and Henry Reed's
grandson, Terry,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.510
if you would stand
up we would love to.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:08:02.860
[ Background noise ]

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.310
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: And I
also want to encourage if any

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.610
of you are feeling that you
want to extend Alan's legacy

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.060
and honor Alan's
legacy by contributing

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.150
to the Henry Reed fund, there
is a flier outside the door

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.080
that will give you
the information

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.380
about how to do that.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.320
Please feel free to talk
to me or any staff member

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.390
and actually, that reminds
me while I am up here

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.830
to thank all the American
Folklife Center staff

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.020
for all the incredible
work they've done

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.720
to put this together.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.720
They all, very much,
all of us, very much,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.860
want to honor Alan's legacy.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.200
So, thank you American
Folklife Center staff,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:51.660
but now on with the program.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.400
To tell you more about
Alan and the work

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.530
that these individuals have
done with Alan over the years,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.320
we do have several
friends, research partners,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.810
family who are going
to share their memories

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.820
and observations
with us tonight.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.810
We are also going to end with
a great old-time music jam

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.700
which I think is very fitting.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.680
Many of us have spent time with
Alan very late into the night

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.610
and early morning listening
or playing music with him.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.540
So, I think it's only fitting

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.340
that we end this
evening with that.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.550
We will be making announcements
about that and what to do.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.910
I know Athea already
mentioned property passes.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.540
It's very important as
I'm sure some of you know.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.480
So, our first speaker is
going to be CARL FLEISHHAUER

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.790
and Carl was one of
the first employees

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.200
of the American Folklife
Center and one

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.490
of Alan's closest
collaborators for decades.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.050
He was a field worker on many

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.140
of American Folklife Center's
documentation projects

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.630
in the 1970's and 80's.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.870
In the old-time music
world, he was crucial

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.190
to documenting the Hammond's
family, which was a project

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.170
that he worked on with Alan.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.010
He's also knows as a top
bluegrass photographer

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.280
and has published a book.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.130
Prior to his recent retirement,
he worked on various aspects

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.930
of digital preservation
in the Library of Congress

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.240
and that's actually probably
putting that very mildly.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.160
He was instrumental to
bringing digital preservation

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.500
to the library.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.100
He has now returned to the
American Folklife Center

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:36.310
as a volunteer, yay, and working
on the digital preservation

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.200
of American Folklife
Center field work projects,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.180
which is a series of
projects that Alan

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.140
and Carl spearheaded
and masterminded.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.510
So, without further ado, please
lets welcome CARL FLEISHHAUER.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:11:01.040
[ Background noise ]

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.530
&gt;&gt; CARL FLEISHHAUER:
Thank you Betsy

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.860
and I'm pleased to be here.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.040
What I'm going to talk
about, as Betsy suggested,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.510
is Alan as the leader of
the center from the start.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.450
A little about his thinking,
activities at the center

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.690
and policy development in
federal, cultural sector.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.970
The study and performance
of music that Alan did

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:27.720
so well will be the subject
of the next presentations.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.040
Let me start with Alan
and strategic planning.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.510
This is a bureaucratic
exorcise that tends

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.020
to repeat at regular intervals.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.190
I should know after 40 years
here at the library proceeded

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.810
by working a university and on
the boards of some non-profits.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.860
All too often, staff or
board members are put

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.040
through agonizing
committee discussions

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.570
that eagled impenetrable
documents written

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.060
in bureaucratese.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.980
Not so with Alan.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.430
Even as the center first took
shape, planning moved forward

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.240
in semiformal 2-way
conversations

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.510
with the center staff and
the folklife center board.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.370
Alan listened as much

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.630
as he imparted insights
and information.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.060
He was an inveterate
telephone caller,

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.660
especially before
email was prevalent.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.410
As ideas took shape, Alan
had 2 advantages over most

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.950
of his conversation
partners, solid experience

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.880
at the library gained when
he was head of the archive

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:33.290
of folksong from 1969
to 1974 and a sense

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.670
of the federal context for
cultural activities resulting

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.320
from his work at the
library and as the head

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.080
of the new folk arts program
at the national endowment

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.200
for the arts from 74 to 76.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.740
That work was under the
estimable chairman Nancy Hanks

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.100
and I remember a
conversation from that period.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.890
Here's how it works
Carl, Alan said,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.050
if the letter awards a
grant, Nancy signs it.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:06.150
If it says no, we're
sorry, then I sign it.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.990
Translating plans into action
sometimes required staff members

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.880
to read before the lines.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.790
For important matters,
of course, Alan conferred

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.130
with the center's board and with
the library chain of command,

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:22.560
often but not always, aligned
with one another, but for staff

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.350
like me, some actions
just seemed to happen.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.650
You could be surprised.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.980
Of course, usually,
they had been heralded

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.390
by earlier discussion
and marched in step

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.860
with the center's mission.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.660
Archie Green's excellent
wording embedded

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.840
in the center's enabling
legislation,

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.140
but here's an example.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.960
Alan's academic background
was rooted in music

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.860
and ballad scholarship
and he wanted

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.160
to be sure the center's
program was as broad

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.740
as the term folk life.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.790
Actions to advance this
goal popped into view

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.440
in Alan's earlier hiring.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.340
Adding Rusty Marshall
to the staff.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.980
Rusty had been a student of
Henry Glassy and was immersed

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.490
in folk architecture
and material culture

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.300
and Elena [inaudible],
a Lithuanian American

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.840
with great insights into the
evolving expressive culture

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.710
of those who came from Europe.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.370
There was also carry over from a
project that Alan helped launch

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.930
when he was at the archive.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.990
[inaudible] Spots was folk
music of America record albums.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.340
Work that flowed into one

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:29.060
of the new center's first public
events, symposium and book,

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.270
ethnic recording in America.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.420
Speaking of ethnicity,
Alan rarely talked

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:40.660
about his own family history,
but in 2007, a writer picked

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.920
up his remarks about
his field work

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.100
with the Virginia
fiddler Henry Reed.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.670
Reed's father had immigrated

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.870
from Ireland while Alan's
had come from Syria.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.420
Quote, your family story telling
creates a felt connection

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.300
between your past
and your present life

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.480
in America, Alan said.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.870
It's curious that my father
was the immigrant and I ended

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.020
up being the most
attentive person

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.720
to certain cultural
traditions here.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.540
Regarding communication,
Alan's descriptions

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.140
of the center's accomplishments
showed a real knack

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.410
for putting a range of
events and activities

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.870
into a coherent statement.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.880
The quarterly newsletter was
an excellent vehicle for this

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.270
and other topics and for about
10 years, Alan made good use

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.910
of the director's column.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.660
He once said, the newsletter
gives you news and views

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.700
and people tell me the views
are the most interesting.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.600
On 3 occasions, Alan
drafted reviews

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.920
of the center's accomplishments.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.430
Short ones at the 5 and
10-year marks in 1981 and 1986

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:50.380
and 17,000 word offering
for the 20th in 1996.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.690
Free of bureaucratic jargon,
these reports paint a picture

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:58.690
of a successive, successful
program, upbeat and affirming

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.540
to be sure and here we
tip the hat to Jim Hardon

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.480
who edited the newsletter
through this period.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.900
The center's agenda
reflected a range

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.880
of advice from multiple voices.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.030
Nevertheless, Alan was the
nerve center for the ideas

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.380
that were translated
into action.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.580
Some were topical
like ethnic groups

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.410
and material culture while
others concerned activities.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:27.460
For example, exhibitions,
publications and concerts.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.380
The first concert was
staged within weeks

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.300
of the center's establishment.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.800
When Alan wrote about
it 20 years later,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.110
he signaled the value of
the series not only in terms

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.550
of artistic expression and the
celebration of community arts,

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.240
but also in terms of
support for institutional

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.430
and congressional relations.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.590
The audience, Alan said, was
quote, dominated by library

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.600
and capitol hill staffers,
making it for years,

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.840
the center's public
face on the hill.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.770
Alan guided the center to other
forms of public communication

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.880
such as a CD publishing
venture with Rounder Records

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.720
and during Alan's first decade
as director, the center began

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.910
to provide access
via the internet.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.820
Finding aids before the
immergence of the world wide web

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.350
and after 1994,

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:21.040
online multimedia collections
accessed via the web.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.920
Exhibitions illuminated subjects
ranging from ethnic recording

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.470
to Nevada Buckaroos here
with the Smithsonian

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.120
to folk life in Rhode Island.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.100
A photo display in the U.S
senate office building.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.650
Exhibits provided visibility
not only for the senate,

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.740
but also with the white house.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.290
First lady Rosalynn Carter

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.490
and daughter Amy opened an
installation on Georgia folk art

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.860
and folk life in 1978,

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.160
while president Mrs. Regan
opened the American Cowboy

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.620
Exhibition in 1983.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.350
During the 1980's, the center
director Alan attended meetings

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.790
of the world intellectual
property organization

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.750
to discuss intellectual
property and folk expression.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.930
His article for UNESCO's
copyright bulletin noted

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.830
that copyright law focused on
the rights of an individual

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.550
or incorporated entity in
contrast to the way that,

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.810
in many tradition communities,
creative expression is seen

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.130
as belonging to groups.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.140
[ Background noise ]

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.540
&gt;&gt; CARL FLEISHHAUER:
Protecting folklore, Alan wrote,

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.810
means acknowledging
an intermediate sphere

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.930
of intellectual property rights
between individual rights

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.940
on the one hand and
the national,

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.070
international public
domain on the other in terms

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.670
of legal history and
legal frameworks,

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.790
this is a radical idea.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.050
Meanwhile, as we look back,
our attention is often drawn

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.010
to the center's field
work projects.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.540
Alan staged more than a
dozen from 1977 to 1994,

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:54.290
rural and urban like this New
Jersey pair in the pinelands

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.500
and in industrial Patterson.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.910
These were team projects

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.690
with mostly youthful workers
although the 1979 team

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.860
in Rhode Island included
professor Kenny Goldstein,

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.140
wearing the white shirt in
this team meeting in a project

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:13.670
that was led by our recently
departed college Peter Bardis.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.250
May he rest in peace.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.820
These were generally survey
projects lasting a month or 2.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.230
Some cooperatively with
the national park service,

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.930
some with state arts councils.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.690
Alan often visited
and participated.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.840
Field projects were integrated
into the center's program

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.230
in addition to exhibits,

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.890
products included David Taylor's
book on Italian Americans

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.390
in the west from a
multistate survey,

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.820
Charles Woolf's double album
of Blueridge religious music,

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.920
and Mary Huffard's
evocative web collections

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.050
from West Virginia's
coal fields and more.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.270
Meanwhile, for Native
American music,

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.890
the federal cylinder
preservation project came first,

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.580
field work came second.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.450
Cylinder recordings of the
Omaha Tribe were created

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.790
by Alice Fletcher and Francis La
Flesche between 1895 and 1905.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:11.310
In 1983, Alan visited the
Omaha Indian reservation

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.400
to share copies with the tribal
council and to seek agreement

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.280
on selection and publication.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.010
When he played some examples,
2 elderly men were present.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.970
When John Turner began
singing, Alan wrote,

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.860
I knew we were home free.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.010
Soon, the center
published album,

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.610
documented 2 Omaha powwows,
created a website and co-hosted

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.920
by the tribe's cultural
representative,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.500
staged a performance
at the library.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.500
The field work projects
contributed

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.430
to policy development,
most strikingly in relation

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.390
to historic preservation

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.220
where the federal legal
apparatus expanded

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.300
from the 1960's to the
1990's with a fresh interest

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.410
in what was called intangible
elements of cultural heritage.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:05.170
In 1977 and 78, national park
service director William Wayland

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.240
was on the center's
board and Alan worked

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.330
with park service
representatives to frame

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.360
up a field project on
the Blueridge parkway

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.770
to provide material for
park interpretive programs.

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.440
In later cooperative projects

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.860
like the 1983 pinelands
folklife project in New Jersey,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.500
the center provided not only
support for interpretation,

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.900
but also for park service
planning efforts including land

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.970
use concepts that were sensitive
to neighboring communities.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.150
By the 1980's, Alan wrote,

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.540
national park service
planners quote,

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.530
represent a new generation
of professionals

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.830
who have been gradually
abandoning the acquire control

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.380
and manage model for national
parks and exploring models

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.730
for cooperation with local
communities operating

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.070
on the premise that local people
should be enlisted, not evicted.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:00.680
In 1985, the center joined
Utah's Historic Preservation

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.570
Agency to carry out a field
project in Grouse Creek.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:08.780
In the 1987 a park service
project in Iowa Massachusetts.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.080
Meanwhile, the impact

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.000
of the early field projects
influenced the center's

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.140
recommendations concerning
historic preservation policy

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.590
in Ormand Loomis's 1983
report, cultural conservation,

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:27.050
the protection of cultural
heritage in the United States.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.030
The field projects added
to the library's holdings

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.820
of archival collections.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.620
Their organization, description,

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:37.490
and preservation
received a boost in 1978

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.610
when the folk archive was
brought into the center.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.450
Founded by Robert
Gordan in 1928,

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.350
the archive had long been part
of the library's music division.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:51.230
Alan used his skills as
a diplomat and negotiator

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.170
to find an acceptable
arrangement

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.250
for that administrative move.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.020
When Alan talked about
the field work projects,

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.090
he emphasized their debt
to New Deal era work,

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.800
the federal writer's project,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.510
photography from the foreign
security administration

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.950
and of course, the work
of John and Alan Lomax

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.350
and their cohorts,
Herbert Halpert,

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.480
Sidney Robertson Cowell, Ben
Botkin, and Charles Seeger,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.770
a personal favorite of Alan's.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.630
These predecessors, Alan wrote,

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.780
modeled quote, a
documentary cycle.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.530
Field work, collection building
and subsequent public outreach

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:32.530
and as we have seen, Alan pushed
the center quoting him again

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:36.010
to recycle documents
back into cultural use.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.430
[ Background noise ]

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.670
&gt;&gt; CARL FLEISHHAUER: Alan
continued to enact this cycle

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.980
in his retirement years

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.090
in the great Smoky
Mountains National Park.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.410
Alan, Ted Coil, and Karen Singer
Jabbour documented cemetery

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:52.440
traditions, especially the
celebration of Decoration Day.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.150
The work was initially for an
environmental impact statement.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.640
A push for the recognition

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.520
of non-Native American
tradition cultural properties

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.210
in the environmental
impact process.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.030
Alan's work with Karen Singer
Jabbour, his wife of 55 years,

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.990
represented documentary
recycling of another sort.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.390
Repeating their teamwork
from the 1960's when Karen

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.030
and Alan visited the
Virginia fiddler Henry Reed

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.750
and other folk musicians.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.940
Their joint effort in the
2000's yielded their engaging

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.180
and thoughtful book,
Decoration Day in the Mountains.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.580
I'll close with a paraphrase
of Alan's own tribute

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:39.040
to Ben Botkin, the man from whom
this lecture series is named.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.890
Adjusting the words, a bit

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.470
to celebrate Alan's
final phase of life.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.920
His official Washington
career was over.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.620
Neither his personal
accounts, nor those of others,

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.670
suggest any deep
unhappiness with the tensions

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:56.980
of administrative life
in the federal maw.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.620
He continued to be
a public folklorist,

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.100
now in a private capacity.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.210
It had been a vigorous period in
the American cultural enterprise

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.430
and both Alan Jabbour
as an individual

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.910
and the American Folklife Center
as a cultural institution,

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.950
were at the very
epicenter of the enterprise.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.750
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
Thanks so much Carl.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.180
That was wonderful
and it's wonderful

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:43.040
to see all these incredible
photographs and the photographs

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.500
that we saw earlier during the
reception, many of those are

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:52.890
from the field survey projects
that Alan and Carl did.

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.210
Now, we are on to
our next speaker,

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.830
a gentleman named
DAVID DURCHGOTT

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.960
and who I have not
personally met,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.960
but I know he is a contributor
to the Henry Reed fund

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.160
and also runs an organization
that Alan served on,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.140
on the board, International
Arts and Artists.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.440
Sort of going back to some

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.470
of the comments that
I made earlier.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.510
So, David, welcome.

[ Background noise ]

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.590
&gt;&gt; DAVID DURCHGOTT: Thank you.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.890
Thank you very much.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.740
In 1974, I was working for the
South Carolina Arts Commission

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:38.000
and my responsibilities there
included coordinating the first

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.730
national endowment for the
arts funded multistate project.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.740
We were documenting
the local folk ways

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.890
of the South Carolina low
country using methodology

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.720
which would be simultaneously
used

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.940
in Mississippi and Kentucky.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.220
Alan is the director
of the nation endowment

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.050
for the arts new
folk art program flew

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.160
to South Carolina to meet me.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.730
I picked him up at the Columbia
airport and we drove 2 hours

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.980
to Charleston to
view the programs.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.190
That drive and conversation
was fascinating.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.820
It was my first exposure to Alan

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.960
and like practically every other
conversation we had throughout

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.400
the subsequent 42-year
friendship, it was enlightening

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.620
in an era prior to the
internet and Google,

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.850
Alan was not only familiar with
music and the material culture

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.590
of Charleston, my hometown,
but then he also knew

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.470
about my family's history
and historic connection

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.630
to Jacksonville, his hometown.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:36.230
I never left a conversation
with Alan

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.840
without learning something new.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.550
His interests were broad and
his knowledge was encyclopedic

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:46.490
and thinking back to that 2-hour
drive in our original meeting,

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.940
I later realized
that I could've,

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.510
he could've easily flown
directly to Charleston

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.530
to meet me there, but I'm sure
that Alan wanted that car time

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.240
to get to know who I was.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.950
Within the context of this
tribute to Alan's legacy,

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.670
I felt it was very important
to mention the breadth

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.430
of Alan's impact went far
beyond the traditional music

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.800
and folklife communities
that he loved so dearly.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.620
In his work as the
first director

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:17.780
of the folk arts program
at the NEA in 1974 to 1976,

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.380
Alan helped millions bring the
arts to millions and millions

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.740
of people and he did it in a
way that they could understand,

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.390
touching the very fiber of who
they were and where they were.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.550
Additionally, Alan personally
and directly affected the lives

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:37.410
of 100's of people like me, who
were then working across the U.S

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.830
as we could to carry
that same message.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.800
Here, in D.C., Alan
was on the board

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.630
and co-chaired the humanities
D.C., which was from 1987

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.600
to 1988 which is
the local affiliate

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.810
of the national endowment
for the humanities.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.890
Nationally, he also helped
organize the alliance

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:02.390
for American Quilts
from 2001 to 2007

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:06.200
and he facilitated starting
the Quilt Alliance's national

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.160
documentation index.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.960
He served on the
boards of the Alliance

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.470
of the National Heritage
Areas, the European Center

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.240
for Traditional Cultures,
and shared the fun for folk,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.720
fun for folk culture, as Carl
mentioned, from 1991 to 1994.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.680
And closest to me, Alan
served on the board

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.490
of International Arts
and Artists for 14 years.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.920
He was our board chair for 7 and
a half years, 3 successive years

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:38.460
at the terms May 25th of 2009
until his death last year.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.450
He guided International Arts
and Artists, an organization

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:46.260
that focuses on sharing
cultures, through the recession

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.330
and with, through a lot
of organizational growth.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.120
He encouraged the
organization to reach

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.330
out to the broadest range of
cultures from other nations

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.430
as well as to all
American ethnicities.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.510
We lived around the corner from
each other as well for 25 years.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.840
[ Background noise ]

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.560
Throughout all of these
involvements, in every aspect

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.390
of his life, Alan was
demanding of himself,

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.010
and yet showed tremendous
kindness

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.820
and patience with others.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.350
He was [inaudible] and yet
in the most folksy manner.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.590
He always spoke endearingly
and proudly of his children,

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.680
his love of Karen, and his
appreciation of her intellect.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.030
And her unwavering support
was evident throughout their

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.240
remarkable half century
of marriage.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.630
I wanted to thank him in front
of everyone, a dear friend,

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.310

the stage Ken Perlman,

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:02.100
who many of you know, and
was also a partner of Alan's,

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.790
and is considered to be one

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.870
of the top claw hammer
banjo players in the world.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.770
Known in particular for
his skillful adaptations

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.580
of Celtic tunes to the style.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.560
And he draws his material
from traditional sources,

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.170
including the music of
Scotland, Ireland, Cape Britain,

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.360
Prince Edward Island
and the American South.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.080
But his approach to the
music is highly innovative.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.950
Also, as an active
folklorist, Ken has spent

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.460
over 2 decades collecting
tunes and oral histories

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.420
from traditional fiddle
players on Prince Edward Island

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.770
and Eastern Canada, which
has resulted in 2 books

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.530
and a 2 CD anthology
of field recordings.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.330
He has toured throughout most
of the English speaking world,

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.140
sometimes with Alan,
and in Western Europe,

and for over 15 years,

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.360
and given that I was the
resident old time banjo picker,

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.530
he asked me to accompany
him in his concert set.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.830
From the moment he
touched bow to string,

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.170
and we started playing together,

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:07.710
there was a strong musical
affinity, an uncanny blend

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:11.320
of fiddle tone with banjo
tone, along with a sharing

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.970
of sensibilities and tastes.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.390
His approach was strong
and powerfully rhythmic,

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:21.180
but fully lyrical and delicately
phrased, even charming.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.560
As soon as I heard him interpret
a tune, even one I had heard

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.610
around the scene for years,

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:30.170
that instantly became the
definitive version for me,

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.310
and one I wanted to emulate.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.100
He inspired me, not only
to learn many dozens

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:38.770
of his tunes note for note,
but to develop a whole new way

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:42.980
to accompany them that fit
his style like a glove.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:48.640
This melding of fiddle and banjo
can be heard on our first CD,

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:56.300
Southern Summits, and jointed by
guitarist Jim Watson, I guess,

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.520
who couldn't make it
at the last minute,

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.120

tonight,on the CD,

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.040
which was completed just a
few months before the onset

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.460
of Alan's last illness.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.730
I'd like to go back to
slide 2 for a minute,

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.600
and here's a little
sample of the sound

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.890
that we developed together,
a tune called Waynesboro,

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.690
just a little excerpt.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.180
I can still remember
our recording it, here,

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:21.140
in Washington, 10 years ago.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.080
After a few visits
back and forth,

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.730
Alan and I started
touring, and until the state

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.520
of his health intervened,
we toured or worked together

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:34.090
at music camps at least
3 or 4 times a year.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:38.450
Our travels took us to England,
Ireland, Scotland and Shetland,

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.160
Western Europe and Canada,

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.320
but mostly we toured
regionally in the United States.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.490
Depending on the season,
our travels took us

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:49.420
to the Northeast, or
his native South Land,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.770
the Pacific Coast,
or the Midwest.

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:55.910
In what was probably our longest
tour, in the fall of 2010,

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:58.590
we started out in Atlanta,
curved through Alabama,

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.170
Tennessee and Kentucky,
on up into Michigan,

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.370
headed northwest past
Chicago to Madison,

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:06.510
and then back to
D.C. via Indiana.

[ Background noise ]

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:14.290
And here's another
picture from that era.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.980
Touring with Alan was an
eye-opening experience.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.130
He was a much loved
and respected figure,

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:24.600
renowned not only in the folk
and acoustic music worlds,

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.900
but also in the world

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.350
of academic folklore,
as you've heard.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.920
Even in a world of perfect,
and near, strangers,

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.960
he had only to walk in
to command attention.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.490
And most folks would emerge
from any given social occasion,

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.250
deeply impressed with
his wisdom and charm.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:44.130
He considered himself to be as
much a storyteller as musician,

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:48.930
and his song intros at concerts
were often quite elaborate.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.730

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.710
Nevertheless, audiences
hung on every word.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.160
When he led jam sessions,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.630
participants would eagerly
follow wherever he led,

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.320
even if they had never before
heard his selected tune

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.650
or tune version.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:13.430
Although Alan was never
a full time musician,

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.500
he made incalculable
contributions

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.180
to the music world.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.400
While still a graduate
student, he took his reel

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.400
to reel recorder off to the
Piedmont and Southern Mountains

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.640
and preserved the music of
several important roots fiddlers

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:33.430
on tape, most notably Henry Reed
of Monroe County, West Virginia.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.060
He learned quite a number
of those tunes on fiddle,

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.830
and began teaching them to
a coterie of musicians in

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.000
and around Chapel
Hill, North Carolina.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.230
Along with Bertram Levy, who
is here tonight, Bobby Thompson

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.930
and Tommy Thompson, he founded
the Hollow Rock String Band,

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.880
whose recordings and concerts
launched the contemporary old

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.020
time music revival.

of the Chapel Hill scene,

such as the Fuzzy
Mountain String Band,

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:13.710
you can tell the era, and
the Red Clay Ramblers, same,

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.440
introduced many, many
tunes to the old time scene

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.000
that have become
beloved classics.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.880
Amongst these tunes are Over
the Waterfall, Frosty Morning,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.510
Kitchen Girl, Ebenezer,

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.610
which Alan usually called
West Virginia Highway,

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.510
Magpie and Green Willows.

[ Background noise ]

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.210
And, as you've heard, he
became the founding director

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.300
of the Folklife division,
here at the Library

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.250
of Congress, in the 70's.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.580
In that capacity, he promoted
music, and other folk arts,

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.490
and supervised the recordings of
many additional roots musicians,

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.960
most notably the Hammonds family

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.200
of Pocahontas County,
West Virginia.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.170
He also had to interact with
many notable business leaders,

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.730
philanthropists and politicians

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.460
of the last quarter
of the 20th century.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.370
A fact that led to many
interesting conversation during

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:06.870
our long drives between
tour destinations.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.560
Thinking back on the many
stories and anecdotes

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.590
that Alan shared during
our travels, I recently go

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:16.400
to thinking that, perhaps,
one over arching theme

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:21.140
to describe his life was
the notion of the quest.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.220
What brought him to North
Carolina in the first place,

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.120
was an impulse to study
someone else's quest.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.340
The topic of his dissertation
was the story of Bear Wolf.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.280
Once there, he became intrigued
by the study of folklore

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.120
and ballads, and
inspired by the search

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.980
for child ballad melodies among
the singers of Appalachia.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.520
And drawing on his background

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.370
as a highly trained
classical violinist,

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:48.690
he embarked on a year's
long quest to locate

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:53.320
and record Appalachian fiddlers
and preserve their tunes.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.790
Alan started with Piedmont
players, like John Lewis,

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.160
and then headed deeper
into the mountains.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.320
He encountered a fiddler
named Oscar Wright

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.540
and found himself deeply
drawn to his tunes.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.360
Wright told him that the source
of those tunes was old man,

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.210
Henry Reed, who not
only was still living,

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.380
but could easily be tracked
down in Glen Lyn, Virginia.

[ Background noise ]

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.350
Alan often told the story,
you've seen that picture before,

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:27.260
too, Alan often told the story
of how he and Karen drove

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.470
up to the Reed residence,
for the first time,

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.980
late one afternoon,
knocked on the door,

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.030
and were immediately
invited to partake

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.650
of a large family dinner,
despite, as Alan puts it,

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:45.310
that Reed had no idea who we
were or why we were there, too,

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.670
and be like his gestures.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:51.010
In any event, after dinner,
the tape recorder came out

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.250
and numerous tunes
were recorded,

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:56.210
including one called
West Virginia Gals,

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.510
that Alan said moved him

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:02.180
so deeply his musical
life was changed forever.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.940
His next quest was
learning the tunes

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.510
and translating them
effectively to fiddle.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.130
Now you should know
that it's not easy

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:12.550
for a classically trained
violinist to play fiddle music.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.510
In fact, now a days, we often
make fun of such people.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.520
[ Laughter ]

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.270
The bowing is completely
different, liveliness

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.910
and rhythmic attack are far
more important than soaring tone

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.640
and following a conductor's
directions.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.720
Nevertheless, Alan
watched and listened

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:34.610
to the old time players he met,
and figured out, not only how

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:38.580
to play these tunes effectively,
but to play them so compellingly

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.510
that they attracted a
coterie of collaborators,

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.930
entranced a generation
of musicians,

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:46.510
and launched a musical revival.

[ Background noise ]

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:55.000
This said, his take on the tunes
changed as he went through life.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.080
Judging from the first
Hollow Rock LP's,

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:01.840
his early playing was strong and
lively, but as the years went

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.520
by the quieted delicacy
of phrasing and lyricality

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.490
that were truly unique
in the world

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:10.620
of contemporary folk
music performance.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.320
And I was very fortunate to
come along right at the moment

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.680
that this unique approach

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.780
to the music was coming
fully into its own.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.280
Alan loved playing with strong
innovative banjo pickers.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.100
And working with him served
as a great inspiration

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.440
to numerous influential
banjoists.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.680
Tommy Thompson, there
on the right,

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.640
developed a highly percussive,
semi-melodic picking style

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.650
to drive the Hollow
Rock String Band sound,

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:41.260
and carried that style
into the Red Clay Ramblers.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.110
Many, many banjo pickers
that came up during the 70's

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.470
and 80's cite Tommy's
playing as one

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.530
of their main, formative
influences.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:53.510
Bertram Levy eventually put
aside the mandolin he played

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:57.170
in his Chapel Hill days,
and took up 5 string banjo.

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:00.960
And as he re-explored the
Hollow Rock repertoire,

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.000
he developed a new
approach to claw hammer

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.960
that can be heard merge
with Alan's fiddling

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.690
and James Reed's guitar
playing on the CD,

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:11.590

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.440
And that's Bertram on the right.

He's here tonight.

And then, in the 90's, banjoist
philosopher, Stephen Wade,

who is also here today, and
you'll hear from him in a,

favorite musical collaborators,

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:35.860
of their live performances
has just been issued.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.060
Alan used to tell quite
a number of stories

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.570
about the tunes we played,
some of which reflected

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.510
on the vicissitudes of
collecting a repertory

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.440
and then observing
from a distance

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.450
as individual tunes
became disseminated.

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:52.500
He always regretted, for
example, that he never thought

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.820
to ask fiddler John
Lewis about the spelling

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.390
of the tune title,
Rose Division.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:02.220
He wrote down r o s e, like
the flower, but was later left

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:07.330
to wonder could it actually
have been r o w e apostrophe s,

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:11.560
or even r h o d e apostrophe s?

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.780
You may remember this musing.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:21.050
Alan later found out
from, he often talked

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:25.890
about a quirky a modal tune,
originall recorded by Reed,

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:31.400
with no title, but dubbed
Texas by the Hollow Rock crew,

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.700
when they put it on an LP,

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.700
because of a story
that Reed had told.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:39.510
Can we hear that audio please?

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:57.020
[ Music ]

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.300
Okay. So Alan later found out,
from Reed, that the real name

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.940
of the tune was Newcastle.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:07.470
But despite years of trying
to correct the nomenclature,

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.250
people in the old time music
revival could simply not

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.520
be budged.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.110
As far as they were concerned,

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:18.300
the name of the tune was
Texas, and that was that.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.740
Another case that bemused him
involved a very sweet lyrical

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.170
tune in the key of
g, again collected

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:25.980
from Henry Reed with no title.

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.510
Can we have the other tune
on that slide, please?

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:51.620
[ Music ]

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:55.230
Anyway, Alan included
it on a tape he sent

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:57.950
out to the West Coast,
positioned right next

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:01.160
to another tune called
Lady of the Lake.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.710
Somehow things got conflated,

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:06.260
to use one of Alan's
pet expressions,

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:09.340
and the g tune started
spreading on the West Coast

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.050
under the title Lady
of the Lake.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:14.580
Years later, Alan was able
to trace how the tune,

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.390
with its newly minted name,
moved from fiddler to fiddler,

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:21.720
until its original provenance
was forgotten and it got

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.060
into the hands of a well
known contra dance fiddler

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:27.570
from New Hampshire,
named Rodney Miller.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.510
Miller recorded it on an LP
called New England Chestnuts.

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:37.530
[ Laughter ]

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:41.230
And from that time
on, virtually everyone

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:46.260
in the folk scene has assumed
it was an old New England tune.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.470
This said, as it happens,
the title Lady of the Lake,

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.130
fits the tune perfectly.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:54.450
And the melody is far better
suited for contra dancing

00:46:54.450 --> 00:47:00.430
than it is for southern square
dancing, so no harm done.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:03.130
Alan often compared the
function of tune collectors

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.020
to the workings of an hourglass.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.930
In an earlier era, a
given tune might be known

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.970
by many musicians, then

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:13.370
as the music culture
declines there were fewer

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:17.040
and fewer players, and
the number of people

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.880
who know the tune shrinks,

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.580
sometimes to as few
as a single person.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.630
When the collector comes along,
hopefully before that last grain

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:31.120
of sand has disappeared, he or
she teaches the tune to others.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.910
It then comes back to
life and spreads again,

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:35.770
sometimes becoming
even better known

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.570
than it was in the first place.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.880
[ Background noise ]

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.800
No tune is a better
case in point, here,

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.100
than Over the Waterfall.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.970
It was collected from Henry
Reed, a single known source,

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.590
and spread so quickly
and pervasively

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:55.100
that few people now a days have
any idea where it came from.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.770
It first appeared as cut
number 7 on the b side

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.500
of the first Hollow Rock LP.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.790
Not long afterwards, Alan
moved to L.A. and was asked

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:07.890
to judge a fiddle contest
at nearby Topanga Canyon.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:10.690
One of the contestants, not
knowing who was judging,

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:12.810
announced that he was
going to play a tune

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:16.010
from the Hollow Rock String
Band called Over the Waterfall.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:20.510
As Alan put it, that tune
beat me to California.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:23.780
[ Laughter ]

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.740
Flash forward about 15
years, Alan and Karen were

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.960
in Hungary attending a music
party, Halvic Injunction

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.080
with an Academic Conference,
a band from Brittany was

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.750
on center stage when
the word got

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.030
out that the tall
American played the fiddle,

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:41.130
Alan was 6 6 in his
stocking feet.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:44.700
In Alan's words, I saw the
band members talking among

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.520
themselves, and I guess
they were probably saying,

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.500
what song do we know that the
tall American might also know?

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.940
Finally, a young woman
who served as band leader,

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.420
turned to Alan and
asked brightly,

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.510
can you play, Over
the Waterfall?

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.350
[ Laughter ]

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.750
Anyway, here's the version
of Over the Waterfall

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:08.830
from the Hollow Rock recording
that, on that fateful,

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.010
when that fateful cut was made.

Maybe we'll get a chance to
play that in the jam session.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:37.660
Anyway, I'd like to conclude by
playing Billy in the Lowland,

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:41.470
and this is a tune that Alan
and I felt was the best vehicle

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.590
for capturing the essence
of our sound, and the tune

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:47.160
that we almost always
used to open our concerts.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.800
Not surprisingly, it was
collected from Henry Reed,

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.820
who said it was originally from
east Virginia, which is the way

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.120
that West Virginian's refer

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.510
to what is now called
the state of Virginia.

be appropriate here.

of Alan being talked about here.

For some of us, folklore,
as we get sort of mired

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:04.950
in the academic and the
words, it's sure nice

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:06.860
to hear words with music.

Our next speaker is Stephen
Wade, and many of you know him.

He has spent nearly his
entire life in the study

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.240
of American folklife, and
he's probably best known

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:22.230
for banjo dancing, a
theatrical performance

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:25.140
that combines storytelling,
traditional music,

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.590
and percussive dance,
which was one

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:31.400
of the longest running off
Broadway shows in the country.

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.780
Here, at the Library, we are
particularly appreciative

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:40.220
of his book, The Beautiful Music
All Around Us, Field Recordings

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.510

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:45.540
which showcases nearly
two decades of research,

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.300
during which Wade tracked
down the communities, families

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:53.580
and performers connected with
the iconic AFC field recordings,

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:58.660

how important research is.

Well, as I said, Alan and
I opened our every concert

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.370
with that tune, that
he called Stony Point.

00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:21.460
But it goes by more
names than that.

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:26.920
These include, Old Vad,
Wild Horse, Celtin's Reel,

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:32.300
Pig Town Fling, Unfortunate
Dog, Buck Creek Girl,

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:35.250
Richmond Ruckus, and when
Earl Scruggs recorded it

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:39.560
with Paul Warren, they
called it Fiddling Banjo.

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.640
Back when we performed it,

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:45.700
Alan noted that there'd always
be some accommodating soul,

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:49.580
he said, who would call it
the Wild Horse at Stony Point.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:52.640
I thought of a way of
approaching this tune

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.720
without Alan here to lead it
might reside in that banjo here,

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.530
made during the Civil War.

00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:01.300
The history that dwells in this
instrument, and the past lives

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:05.480
who once held it, calls to mind
the remark that Alan often made

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.370
about Quince Dillion, a fiddler
in fifer from the Mexican War,

00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:12.890
who, as an old man,
taught young Henry Reed,

00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:17.300
who then decades later, guided
the youthful Alan Jabbour.

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:21.680
Only one person Alan
marveled stood between himself

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.190
and that misty figure
of Jacksonian America,

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:28.620
that tenacious thread
still intact extends

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.510
to those here tonight,

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:33.790
who in turn learn
their music from Alan.

00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:38.720
And thus, ancestries
become continuities.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:43.590
The epigraph of this new album,
a concert that Alan and I played

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:46.750
at the Coolidge Auditorium
20 years ago,

00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:49.280
comes from something Alan wrote.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:52.860
He said, how complicated
and powerful,

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.760
beyond our own imaginings, are
the radiations of what we do.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.470
Alan's thought applies not only

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:03.680
to the influences his
repertory had upon others,

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.920
but within the music itself.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.260
Alan exemplified an
approach that Indian fiddler,

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.510
John W. Summers, a
contemporary of Henry Reed's,

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:16.110
called the originality
of the tune.

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:21.650
That is, that each piece
possesses a detailed identity.

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:24.880
Dick Summers saw it as
the fiddler's obligation

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.250
to learn however many
parts a tune might have,

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:33.180
and to take no shortcuts in
that, in their execution.

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:37.220
Similarly, Buddy Thomas, a
Kentucky fiddler committed

00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:41.910
to the older styles, felt
the need to bow the tune out.

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:45.100
The influential radio
fiddler, Georgia Slim Rutland,

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.390
likewise spoke of
his mother's council,

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:49.850
when he first started playing.

00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:52.980
She said, don't ever
detract from a tune.

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.740
Add to it all you want,
but don't take away.

00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:00.810
These musicians shared, in
common, a view of fiddle tunes

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:04.280
as complex, self-contained
works.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.510
And that's how Alan
crafted his pieces.

[ Background noise ]

01:03:56.970 --> 01:04:01.660
Tonight's invitation also
asks us to also consider Alan

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.610
in relation to his
legacy in folk life.

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:07.320
When Alan began his
graduate studies at Duke,

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.260
his classroom professor
sometimes played selections

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:13.150
from the folk music
albums issued

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.790
by the Library of Congress.

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:19.590
These performances, many
recorded in domestic settings,

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:22.830
did not scrub away the
sounds of those places.

01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:25.980
In the background,
sometimes, a dog barks,

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:31.340
a kitchen clock ticks, roosters
crow, a truck drives by,

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.840
these records alerted
Alan to the kind

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.880
of first person collecting
he soon undertook himself,

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.380
nor in the ensuring years,
as head of the folk archive

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.450
and later as director of the
American Folklife Center,

01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:47.700
did he divorce cultural
expression

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.500
from lived experience.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.850
Art is not a thing
apart, he once told me,

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.870
it can't be set aside from life.

01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:00.400
One song emblematic of
that fusion, and included

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.660
on those albums that Alan heard,
comes from Vera Hall, a singer

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.420
and domestic worker from
Livingston, Alabama.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:10.510
In October, 1940, she
recorded for the Library,

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:13.830
Another Man Done Gone,
a blues she learned

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:17.330
from her husband recently
returned from prison.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:20.180
Well, the well known
number most often appears

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:21.720
as a lover's plaint.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.070
In her rendition, she
largely sang spirituals,

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:28.420
it seemingly becomes
a civil rights anthem.

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.110
In what could serve
as a mission statement

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:35.590
for the American Folklife
Center, Vera Hall later said,

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:38.500
any song that we
sing have reference

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.510
to the life that we live.

[ Background noise ]

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:57.760
Well, he closed with a medley.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.310
The first recalls a tune
that Alan played as Patty

01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:05.530
on the turnpike, though it,
too, goes by other names.

01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:08.170
We follow with Kitchen
Girl, that Alan learned

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:11.780
from Henry Reed and then
transmitted to the world,

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:16.100
and we end with Sheep Shell Corn
by the Rattling of His Horn,

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.350
a piece recorded in 1941
for the Library of Congress

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:22.500
by Fiddler Emmett Lundy.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:26.880
Lundy, born in southwest
Virginia in 1864,

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.820
learned from a much older
fiddler named Green Leonard.

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:34.370
He said of Green Leonard, quote,
he didn't teach them tunes

01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:37.180
to me, but I catched
them from him.

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:42.000
And in his last days, he told
me that I was the only one

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.310
that tracked him
down, and he wanted

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:47.350
to learn me some old
pieces before he died,

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:49.730
he didn't want them
to be buried,

01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:54.000
and live after he was done.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.790
Sheep Shell Corn lives
on through Emmett Lundy.

01:10:57.790 --> 01:11:02.930
He played it majestically, a
description that applies as much

01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:10.030
to Alan Jabbour, this tall swan
of a man, musician, folklorist,

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:17.640
administrator, author and
inspiration to so many.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.510

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:23.420
[ Applause ]

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:29.970
I hear now, since he left us,
Alan's courtly words resound,

01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:34.560
how complicated and powerful,
beyond our own imaginings,

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.510
are the radiations
of what we do.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.450
And we are coming down
to our last speaker.

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:16.480
I think the Jabbour family
should always have the last

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.190
word, before we start hearing
some music, and playing music.

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:23.280
So please do not go away.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.190
But to come down to the, you
know, the practical universe,

01:16:28.190 --> 01:16:33.740
if you do need to leave,
there are staff at the back

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:36.120
and will guide you
to the elevators,

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.470
and make sure you
get on your way.

01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:41.660
And for those of you who stick
around, and play an instrument,

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:44.150
and have an instrument with
you, please don't forget

01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:45.710
about those property passes.

01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:48.880
We want to make sure
you get out.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.860
So, and then finally, thank you,
Stephen, again, thank you Zan,

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:58.490
thank you, Ken, and thank you
Carl, and thank you, Alan.

01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:03.540
Our last speaker is Karen
Jabbour, she's Alan's wife,

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:09.050
love and lifelong research
partner throughout his career.

01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:12.010
Their work together
includes rich documentation

01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:14.820
of the tradition of Decoration
Day, which was published

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:17.750
in the book, Decoration
Day in the Mountains,

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.820
and I think she need
no other introduction.

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.620
Karen.

&gt;&gt; Karen Jabbour: Good evening,
family and many friends.

01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:47.080
Welcoming all of you
here has reminded me

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.810
of a generous reflection

01:17:48.810 --> 01:17:52.220
that Alan's first
administrative assistant,

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:56.060
here at the American
Folklife Center, made.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:01.420
Eleanor Sreb said that her late
husband didn't leave her a lot

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:08.050
of money, but he left
her very rich in friends.

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:12.440
And I certainly feel
rich in friends tonight.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:18.210
My thanks to the Folklife Center
staff for their dedication

01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:22.810
in bringing about this
tribute to Alan's legacy.

01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:26.210
And my heartfelt appreciation
to Carl Fleishhauer,

01:18:26.210 --> 01:18:31.230
to David Furchgott, to Ken
Perlman, and Stephen Wade,

01:18:31.230 --> 01:18:35.850
and Zan McLeod for their
devotion to portraying for all

01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:39.950
of us, in words,
photographs and music,

01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:44.310
and their long creative
interaction with Alan.

01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:49.500
Finally, thanks to you musicians
who will continue the legacy

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:54.110
in your tribute in
the jam later tonight.

01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:59.580
As many of you know, when
Alan retired in 1999,

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:02.020
he took on a project
offered to him

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:05.500
by the National Parks
Service to create a study

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.980
of the cultural tradition

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:10.300
of holding cemetery
decoration events

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:15.160
for the environmental impact
statement for a major road

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:18.190
in Great Smokey Mountains
National Park

01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:22.530
to the graveyards left
behind by the people

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:27.240
who were moved off the land.

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:32.840
Without Carl to rely on for
documentation, Alan drafted me

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:37.270
as his field collaborator
and photographer.

01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:42.220
I can take a picture, this
is my photograph of Alan,

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:47.520
which has been very hard for
me to look in the eye tonight,

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.350
because I know he's
looking right at me.

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:55.230
So after 2 years of attending
these cemetery events,

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:59.330
we submitted the study
for the EIS volume.

01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:03.960
With so much enthusiasm and
documentation left over,

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:08.920
that we went on to publish a
book in 2010 with University

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:12.900
of North Carolina Press, called
Decoration Day in the Mountains,

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.110
which has been mentioned
tonight.

01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:20.790
This only wet Alan's appetite
to continue surveying cemeteries

01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:24.780
with me, throughout
the entire rural south.

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:28.860
And he completed, before
his death, a second book,

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:33.480
now awaiting my editing, at the
University Press of Mississippi.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:38.400
In the course of studying
cemetery traditions,

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:43.150
we researched illusions in the
literature, in literature art

01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:47.280
and song to cemetery events.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.780
Alan had a special place
in his heart for slow airs,

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:56.360
called hens, played
by southern fiddlers.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:01.310
When we were doing research
at Boreal College Library,

01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:04.730
he heard a solo version
of the 19th century hymn,

01:21:04.730 --> 01:21:09.840
the Old Church Yard,
played by Sanford Kelly.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.390
And he recalled an illusion
in John C. Campbell's book,

01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:17.590
the Appalachian Highlander
in His Home,

01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:22.510
to a congregation
singing this hymn

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:26.120
in a processional
to the cemetery.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:31.950
Alan noted in Kelly's playing,
the slow, monophonic style

01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:39.870
and irregular pulse of the old
unaccompanied singing style.

01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:44.410
I'd like to conclude by playing,
for you, Alan's fiddling

01:21:44.410 --> 01:21:50.580
of the Old Church Yard, the
final track on his last album,

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.890
You Can't Beat the Classics.

01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:59.520
The words to the first verse
are, Oh come, come with me

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.360
to the old grave yard,
I well know the path

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.650
through the soft green sward,
friends slumber we would want

01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:14.510
to regard, we'll trace out their
names in the old grave yard.

will now organize the jam.

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:21.010
&gt;&gt; Okay. So here's
a moment a lot

01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:23.700
of you have been
looking forward to.

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:26.910
What we're going to do is
everybody whose brought

01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:29.500
instruments, this is
your time to go get them.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.960
And we'd like to clear, make
a clearing, kind of here,

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:38.230
a big circle space
that people can come

01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:42.720
and join once you've got your
instruments, and others can sit

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.810
around and listen
or participate.

01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:47.950
But we'd like to clear
some chairs right here,

01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:51.210
and make an opening that
people can sit around.

01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:56.660
&gt;&gt; The first tune we're going to
play is often called Ebenezer.

01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:00.390
And this is collected
from Henry Reed and was

01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:05.370
on the first Hollow Rock
album, and Alan said

01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:10.430
that Henry Reed often called
it West Virginia Highway.

01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:15.000
And if anyone else has
any memories to share.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.980
So we're going to
start this tune.

01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:19.420
Do you want to kick it off?

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:24.510
This is Bertram Levy, by the
way, an original Hollow Rocker.

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.290
Yeah, for a little while.

01:29:54.290 --> 01:30:02.460
Yeah. So, you know Alan and
I, we were like brothers,

01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:06.510
we grew up together
with this music.

01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:12.280
I mean, Alan was kind of, I
mean he was the inspiration,

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:16.780
but we were the, 3 or 4 of us
were the people that really kind

01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:19.290
of put it all together
and made it come alive

01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:22.010
and we shared the tunes
and we shared the whiskey

01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:25.410
and the camels and we shared
being bad boys and we.

01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:31.240
It was a great experience
and I'll just relate one,

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:34.590
one memory which is
once we visited Henry.

01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:38.240
I was his sidekick and I would
go with him to visit some

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.960
of these folks and we
visited Henry and took him

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:48.820
down to Narrows and we sat under
a tent and Alan was sitting here

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:54.150
and Bobby Thompson was sitting
here and I was sitting there

01:30:54.150 --> 01:30:55.520
and Tommy Thompson
was sitting there

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.630
and Henry was sitting there and
he hadn't been out of his house

01:30:58.630 --> 01:31:01.860
in many years and
people would all come up

01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:05.200
and offer him something to
drink and they'd all go,

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.170
they'd point it out
and they say Henry,

01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:09.050
that's you when you were young.

01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:14.000
So, that was, we knew then
that Alan had the right stuff.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.010
So, this is a beautiful tune
which is John Brown's March.

01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:38.940

a 4 chord on the second part.

than it's a Henry V. tune?

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:48.620
&gt;&gt; I think we actually
named this tune.

01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:52.700
I don't think Henry had
a name for it, did he?

01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:54.000
Yeah, the title.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.980
There were many tunes that
Henry didn't remember the title

01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:02.860
or sometimes we'd play
them with the one title

01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:04.400
and then he'd write back to Alan

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.850
and he'd say I think that's a
different title, but now that I,

01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:15.590
you know, when I, last
time I talked to Alan,

01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:20.400
last time I talked to Alan, he,
we were musing about the facts

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.550
that during our working we
always wondered while the old

01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:26.690
guys never played the fiddle
when they were working.

01:36:26.690 --> 01:36:28.880
When they were young men
and only took it up again

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:32.750
when they were older and
then Alan and I were musing

01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:36.960
about 6 months before he
passed away and we realized

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:40.580
that we also picked
up the fiddle again

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:46.470
after we stopped working and I
said Alan, we were those guys

01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:48.310
and we didn't know it.

01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:51.020
We thought we were maybe
documentarians or something,

01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:53.850
but we were just
fiddlers just like them

01:36:53.850 --> 01:36:55.170

to play Green Willis

and this originated actually as
a jig called the New Rig Ship,

01:44:14.190 --> 01:44:20.840
a Scottish tune and during
the late 19th century became a

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:25.120
fifing tune played as
a march or quickstep

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.080
in the south called Chapel Hill
Serenade and then it got sped

the Waterfall is it comes

from an old English ballad
in which she tried, the,

she wanted to get
rid of her husband

and so she gave him some wine
and blinded him and sat him

by the cliff and then he said,
she said just stand there

ran to push him over,

he just stepped out of the way
