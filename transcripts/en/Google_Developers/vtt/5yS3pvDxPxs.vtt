&gt;&gt;Ambarish Kenghe: Next, I'd like to bring
Brittany back on stage to show us a few Android

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.670
applications.
Brittany.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.670
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brittany Bohnet: Thanks, Ambarish.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.039
As many of you know, Listen, a product from
Google Labs, originally started as an audio

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.929
podcast application for your Android phone.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.230
&gt;&gt;Brittany Bohnet: And today, we are excited
to announce that it's also coming to your

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.860
television.
The learning for all of you developers today

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.750
is not to name your applications too early.
Listen and Watch, as the name entails, now

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.040
includes content from video feed publishers.
And it includes the same functionalities as

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.260
it has on your phone.
You can search, subscribe, and access your

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.350
queue.
And today, you can also access a new feature,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.210
called explore.
Explore is a directory where you can discover

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.140
new video podcasts.
So let's check one of these out.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.040
"Tekzilla" is one of my favorites.
Let's try that one.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.040
So we're going to access "Tekzilla."
Once we click into "Tekzilla," we can actually

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.780
see a list of results with all the different
podcast episodes that we can watch.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.010
It's live HD video podcast right on your television.
So let me tell you about how this works.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.950
So Android gives you a bunch of different
screen layouts for the different device types

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.940
you have.
And the Listen team has developed a single

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.490
binary that works on the TV and on the phone.
It's using Google's back-end feed infrastructure

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.430
so that you can continue to access all of
your subscriptions on all of your devices.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.640
They all stay in sync.
So another interesting thing that the Google

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.740
TV developers do is syndicate search results
into our Quick Search Box.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.010
If you can bring down the Quick Search Box.
Let me show you how it works.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.860
And if we can't bring it down, then I'll tell
you how it works.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.860
One of my other favorite podcasts is TEDTalks.
In the Quick Search Box, I can type in "TEDTalks,"

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.650
and you see I get the standard set of Google
TV search results.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.819
There's also a link at the bottom that says,
"More results."

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.840
If I click on that link, I'm now able to search
within the Listen app itself.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.540
Now I can get all of my episodes just from
a search.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.769
It really is about spending less time finding
and more time watching the content that you

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.700
love most.
Okay.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.760
One last application example I want to tell
you guys about.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.469
This one was developed by a Google TV engineer
that works on our team.

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.159
He recently moved --
&gt;&gt;Ambarish Kenghe: Brittany, give me a minute

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.459
just to catch up.
Thank you.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.189
&gt;&gt;Brittany Bohnet: He recently moved here
from one of our international offices.

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.219
And his wife moved with him.
She doesn't speak English, so she's been having

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:01.040
a really hard time watching U.S. television,
because she can't get the subtitles on her

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.809
TV here in the states.
So, the engineer started thinking.

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:11.299
And he decided to take the closed captioning
feed already available on his television and

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.900
the openly available Google Translate APIs,
and he created a new translate feature for

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.599
Google TV.
