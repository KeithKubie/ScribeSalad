00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:02.659
 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.280
we hear a lot about data science AI

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290
we hear a lot about data science AI
 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.300
we hear a lot about data science AI
machine learning right these are all

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.310
machine learning right these are all
 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.520
machine learning right these are all
things that are in the mill year right

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530
things that are in the mill year right
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.530
things that are in the mill year right
now I think if they fundamentally point

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540
now I think if they fundamentally point
 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.770
now I think if they fundamentally point
at the same idea the same concept around

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780
at the same idea the same concept around
 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.589
at the same idea the same concept around
you might call it machine intelligence

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599
you might call it machine intelligence
 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.179
you might call it machine intelligence
where it's about how do you use

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
where it's about how do you use
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.669
where it's about how do you use
computers and the vast amount of data

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:22.679
computers and the vast amount of data
 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.710
computers and the vast amount of data
that's out there that kind of big data

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
that's out there that kind of big data
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.439
that's out there that kind of big data
and then leverage that to make more

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
and then leverage that to make more
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.009
and then leverage that to make more
intelligent decisions as an organization

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019
intelligent decisions as an organization
 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.650
intelligent decisions as an organization
as a government as a non-profit this

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
as a government as a non-profit this
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.849
as a government as a non-profit this
really comes from a few major secular

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859
really comes from a few major secular
 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.580
really comes from a few major secular
trends that are happening one is the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
trends that are happening one is the
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.910
trends that are happening one is the
plummeting cost of computation and the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
plummeting cost of computation and the
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.459
plummeting cost of computation and the
plumbing cost of storage so now we have

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
plumbing cost of storage so now we have
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.880
plumbing cost of storage so now we have
the capacity to store that data

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890
the capacity to store that data
 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.930
the capacity to store that data
relatively cheaply and three other

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
relatively cheaply and three other
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819
relatively cheaply and three other
process that data relatively cheaply and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
process that data relatively cheaply and
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.700
process that data relatively cheaply and
then the other major trend is that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
then the other major trend is that
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.079
then the other major trend is that
everyone's walking around with

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089
everyone's walking around with
 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.750
everyone's walking around with
smartphones everyone's interacting with

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
smartphones everyone's interacting with
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880
smartphones everyone's interacting with
the internet for a large portion of the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
the internet for a large portion of the
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.310
the internet for a large portion of the
day and so we're able to capture huge

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
day and so we're able to capture huge
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.890
day and so we're able to capture huge
parts of the human experience and

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900
parts of the human experience and
 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.480
parts of the human experience and
digitize that information and store it

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
digitize that information and store it
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700
digitize that information and store it
in the cloud so when we have all these

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
in the cloud so when we have all these
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.560
in the cloud so when we have all these
connected devices that are measuring us

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
connected devices that are measuring us
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.570
connected devices that are measuring us
we can actually understand a lot about

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
we can actually understand a lot about
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520
we can actually understand a lot about
human behavior and that's actually

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
human behavior and that's actually
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.420
human behavior and that's actually
really really fascinating and with from

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
really really fascinating and with from
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730
really really fascinating and with from
that we're able to create products

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
that we're able to create products
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.720
that we're able to create products
services that are so much more rich and

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730
services that are so much more rich and
 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.780
services that are so much more rich and
so much more personalized then we've

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
so much more personalized then we've
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.100
so much more personalized then we've
been able to do before

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110
been able to do before
 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.260
been able to do before
and so if you think about maybe even the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
and so if you think about maybe even the
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690
and so if you think about maybe even the
simplest example might be something like

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
simplest example might be something like
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.520
simplest example might be something like
a Netflix right with a recommendation

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
a Netflix right with a recommendation
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.010
a Netflix right with a recommendation
engine that's able to serve up content

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
engine that's able to serve up content
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.970
engine that's able to serve up content
in a very targeted way so that they give

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980
in a very targeted way so that they give
 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.730
in a very targeted way so that they give
you they show you out of there in a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
you they show you out of there in a
 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.550
you they show you out of there in a
library of probably millions of possible

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
library of probably millions of possible
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.310
library of probably millions of possible
videos for you to watch the five to ten

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
videos for you to watch the five to ten
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.260
videos for you to watch the five to ten
that you're most likely to want to watch

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
that you're most likely to want to watch
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.360
that you're most likely to want to watch
and they can do this from what's called

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370
and they can do this from what's called
 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.520
and they can do this from what's called
a lookalike analysis where they will

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
a lookalike analysis where they will
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.900
a lookalike analysis where they will
look at what other people who have

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910
look at what other people who have
 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.730
look at what other people who have
watched a similar set of videos as you

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
watched a similar set of videos as you
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.640
watched a similar set of videos as you
have how have they've rated those videos

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650
have how have they've rated those videos
 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.900
have how have they've rated those videos
and how much they've liked those videos

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
and how much they've liked those videos
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.270
and how much they've liked those videos
and then see what other videos those

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
and then see what other videos those
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.160
and then see what other videos those
people have liked that you haven't yet

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
people have liked that you haven't yet
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.270
people have liked that you haven't yet
watched

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
watched
 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.710
watched
and that's probably a good candidate for

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
and that's probably a good candidate for
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.380
and that's probably a good candidate for
a video that you should watch right so

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390
a video that you should watch right so
 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.230
a video that you should watch right so
that kind of look-alike analysis or if

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240
that kind of look-alike analysis or if
 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.220
that kind of look-alike analysis or if
you're a data scientist you'd probably

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
you're a data scientist you'd probably
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.170
you're a data scientist you'd probably
call that a recommendation engine that's

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
call that a recommendation engine that's
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.470
call that a recommendation engine that's
actually a very powerful technique and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
actually a very powerful technique and
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.600
actually a very powerful technique and
it's sort of very fundamental to a

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
it's sort of very fundamental to a
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.210
it's sort of very fundamental to a
business that has tens of millions of

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
business that has tens of millions of
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.290
business that has tens of millions of
videos and they know you're only gonna

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
videos and they know you're only gonna
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.309
videos and they know you're only gonna
watch one tonight

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319
watch one tonight
 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.110
watch one tonight
all right how do you pick out that one

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
all right how do you pick out that one
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.640
all right how do you pick out that one
good video so that's not just a huge

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
good video so that's not just a huge
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.010
good video so that's not just a huge
search problem it for a consumer but

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
search problem it for a consumer but
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.420
search problem it for a consumer but
it's actually a pleasurable experience

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
it's actually a pleasurable experience
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.390
it's actually a pleasurable experience
for them and that's you know has

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400
for them and that's you know has
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.340
for them and that's you know has
implications beyond Netflix right if you

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350
implications beyond Netflix right if you
 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.729
implications beyond Netflix right if you
think about a company like Amazon that's

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739
think about a company like Amazon that's
 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.900
think about a company like Amazon that's
incredibly important for them they have

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910
incredibly important for them they have
 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.330
incredibly important for them they have
billions of items on their store you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
billions of items on their store you
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.540
billions of items on their store you
need to be able to figure out what to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550
need to be able to figure out what to
 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.729
need to be able to figure out what to
buy and so they can tell you the right

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739
buy and so they can tell you the right
 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.440
buy and so they can tell you the right
item they can just maybe get you to buy

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450
item they can just maybe get you to buy
 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.840
item they can just maybe get you to buy
something that you otherwise would have

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850
something that you otherwise would have
 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.600
something that you otherwise would have
purchased and that's you know has a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
purchased and that's you know has a
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.190
purchased and that's you know has a
direct impact on their bottom line and

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200
direct impact on their bottom line and
 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.780
direct impact on their bottom line and
it also makes consumers happier right it

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
it also makes consumers happier right it
 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.729
it also makes consumers happier right it
helps you reduce the amount of time you

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739
helps you reduce the amount of time you
 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.320
helps you reduce the amount of time you
spend searching for products and

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330
spend searching for products and
 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.930
spend searching for products and
services so I think these kind of data

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
services so I think these kind of data
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.050
services so I think these kind of data
enabled services where companies can

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060
enabled services where companies can
 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.060
enabled services where companies can
give you what you want when you want it

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070
give you what you want when you want it
 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.110
give you what you want when you want it
that's becoming increasingly powerful

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120
that's becoming increasingly powerful
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.500
that's becoming increasingly powerful
within the kind of consumer market and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
within the kind of consumer market and
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.979
within the kind of consumer market and
it's becoming increasingly the standard

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989
it's becoming increasingly the standard
 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.289
it's becoming increasingly the standard
so I think what we've seen is that for a

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299
so I think what we've seen is that for a
 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.979
so I think what we've seen is that for a
lot of legacy enterprises that are not

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989
lot of legacy enterprises that are not
 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.199
lot of legacy enterprises that are not
digital first that haven't been able to

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209
digital first that haven't been able to
 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.220
digital first that haven't been able to
embrace data and data science there's a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230
embrace data and data science there's a
 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.509
