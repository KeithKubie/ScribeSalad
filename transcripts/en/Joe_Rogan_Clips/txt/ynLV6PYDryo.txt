Especially if the woman is really into you and you're really not into her. And you're like, oh, I made an error. And then you do feel like an asshole.

This is how I describe it. Having an erection and getting excited. It's like sitting in the backseat of a really long bus. Okay. And there's some other guy up there driving the bus. Most of the time you're driving the bus now when your Dick is hard, when you, dick is hard. There's some other guy driving the bus and all the windows are rolled down. There's papers flying around the horns honking time and you're looking at life taking place through a dirty windshield a hundred feet away from you.

And then when you come, all of a sudden the fog parts and you're at the front of the bus holding the wheel and you're like, what? What am I doing here? How did I get here? Ah, and you look down at your Dick, you motherfucker, bro. It's been a werewolf. Yeah, it is being aware of water, right? Isn't that what it's a metaphor for? Oh yeah. This ravenous creature, you're running around doing crazy shit and then you wake up in the morning naked. You're terrified. Covered in blood. Yeah. Well, fuck. Sometimes. Sometimes. God dammit. What did I do.
