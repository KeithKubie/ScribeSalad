00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.660
The histogram from your quiz should look like this.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.390
The range for both the histograms would be somewhere between zero and one.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.040
The variable x here is shown in green, and the variable y for

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.800
California is shown in red.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.480
Notice the two variables have somewhat different shapes in different regions.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.703
You will also notice that we have 200 bins between zero and

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:29.800
one with very jaggedy points for each bin.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.970
In the next video we are going to learn about kernel density estimates.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.680
You will see how using kernel densities.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.750
We can smooth out this histogram into a probability density function.
