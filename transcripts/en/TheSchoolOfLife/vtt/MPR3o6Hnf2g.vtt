00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.200
This is the Audi R8;

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.840
it's a highly efficient and compelling car;

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:13.880
its engine produces an astonishing 199 kW at 6,500 rpm, and a torque of 330 Nm at 4000 rpm.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.200
Now part of the reason that it's so efficient, and part of what makes us human beings comparatively inefficient,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:28.280
is that this car has only one goal, and that goal is exceptionally clear: it has to go very fast down tarmac roads.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.680
As a general principle, no machine can be optimally efficient at more than one thing.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.560
A robot that has to both climb stairs, and make pancakes will be far less efficient

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.580
than two distinct machines, each of which can focus exclusively on a single task.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.460
The more limited the goals, the higher once chances efficiency.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.700
Now, unlike the Audi sports car, our brains are not designed

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.220
or evolved to be maximally efficient at any one thing.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.880
This amazing cognitive and emotional machine is a profound generalist

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.980
it comes moderately well equipped for a huge range of possible activities:

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.360
to write a novel, spearfish, bring up a child, drive very fast Fifth Avenue, sit in a high-rise office writing reports,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.320
lie in a hut in New Guinea, marry, plot an assassination, live in an ice cave, go into politics, stay single,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.620
or expand a small business into the Asia market.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.400
Now the price we pay for being generalists is that we'll be less good  at any one of the many activities we perform

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.340
than someone who did only one thing their whole life long.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.340
We might not be the very best at inflating party balloons, the house will be a bit dirty,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.160
we might be a bit late for the meeting, we'll not be perfect, patient, and interesting dinner companions,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.740
we'll mess up the public presentation again, someone will probably be better and we are at helping a child to paint.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.560
This might be quite depressing moments, perhaps late at night as we look back across the day,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.140
but before we get too sad, we should realize that our less than completely optimal performance

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.820
is down to one very understandable thing:

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.900
that we've chosen and breadth and variety over total focus and narrow perfection,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.320
and that's a very wise choice.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:12.680
Focusing on one thing to the exclusion all others has its costs as anyone who's ever spoken to an athlete who trains 10 hours a day tends to find out.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.940
There's a cost to being the human equivalent to the sports car.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.300
Unfortunately, our society has set up an absurd idea:

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.960
that it will be possible to do many things and do them all completely well.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.340
That's why we hear so much talk about an elusive thing called: "work-life balance".

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.560
Perfectly optimal career and a perfectly optimal home life.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.200
This is a mad idea!

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.940
Work-life balance is impossible because everything worth fighting for unbalances your life.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.440
We're not going to be a once the ideal domestic chef, child carer, and CEO.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.720
If we're strung out across multiple roles, all will suffer,  but that's okay.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.720
That you're doing too much and none of it without mistakes isn't a sign that your life is gone wrong,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.180
it's a sign of a very wise and understandable position:

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.360
that you've opted for imperfect variety over flawless focus.
