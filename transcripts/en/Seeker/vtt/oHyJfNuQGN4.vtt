00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.640
Researchers in China have developed a ‘smart
coating’ that behaves like skin, heals itself

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.730
from damage, and is as hard as tooth enamel.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.180
The future is here, everyone, the future is
here.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.490
This development represents a big step forward
in materials science, but self-healing isn’t

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.270
exactly new tech.There are three main general
types of self-healing tech available right

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.240
now :

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.010
One where the healing agents are embedded
in the material…

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.030
One where a vascular network--kind of like
your body’s veins--brings healing agents

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.510
to the site of damage...

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.370
And one where the material is intrinsically
capable of healing itself when exposed to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.570
a certain stimuli, like heat.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.750
Some use ionic conduction, some use covalent
bonding and conductive silver nanoparticles,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.760
and one of my favorites is a team in China
that takes inspiration from the human body.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.500
Say your phone screen cracks.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.239
With something like this new technology, the
softer, cushy bottom layer reacts to the trauma

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.080
and provides material to fill in the broken
bits of the top layer, while the hardness

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.320
of the top layer provides a protective coating
to allow the ‘healing’ to take place.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.559
The harder top layer is also apparently antimicrobial,
meaning it could have future implications

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.170
for biomedical devices--self-healing cyborg
implants, anyone!?

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.659
Not for me, but you go for it.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.280
Other teams around the world have been exploring
similar technologies.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.640
In just the last few years we’ve seen the
beginnings of soft, self-healing robots that

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.190
can perform delicate tasks and fit into small
spaces.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.150
And, flexible, self-healing ‘electronic
skin’ that could attach to a person’s

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.830
body and monitor their health, as well as
a whole host of other potential applications,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.920
in human-robot interaction and prosthetic
limb enhancement.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.310
These most recent developments are also recyclable,
which means that while they’re a promising

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.119
new technology, they don’t promise to create
a lot of excess waste in the process.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.090
One particularly exciting breakthrough came
2016 when a team published research demonstrating

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.140
a material that was conductive, stretchy,
AND self-healing, providing major implications

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.240
for extending the life of lithium-ion batteries.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.780
The big takeaway from this topic is not just
a science-fiction-like tech advancement, but

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.650
also major environmental implications--imagine,
never having a broken electronic that you

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.310
had to replace, because the one you have is
self-healing!?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.400
The top layer of this new coating from the
Chinese researchers is so hard and durable,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.900
the team hopes that their self-healing technology
will last longer and produce less waste than

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.739
options that may wear out faster after fewer
injuries.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.299
But that’s getting a little ahead of ourselves.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.499
For now, the Chinese engineering team is trying
to improve their production process to make

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.609
it more efficient and less expensive, so that
they can hopefully bring a commercial prototype

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.260
to market in the next few years.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.790
They say it would likely be applicable in
areas like consumer electronics, and maybe

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.739
even construction.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.879
Self-healing buildings would be pretty sweet.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.109
We may still be a couple of years aways from
seeing self-healing technologies in stores

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.790
or in the doctor’s office, and when they
do come around experts say consumers are going

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.920
to have to pay a premium, ‘cause dat’s
gon be ‘spensive.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.379
But it’s exciting to see researchers taking
the longevity of their technology and the

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.529
environmental impact of any potential products
into account.

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:02.099
Hey peeps--For more about our robotic future,
check out this video about microbots that

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.180
go inside you--Yeah!

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.449
And fun fact: researchers aren’t just inspired
by nature, they’re actually mixing living

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:08.449
organisms INTO their designs.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.299
Like, with a new bio-concrete that contains
a bacteria that can stay dormant for up to

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.299
200 years.

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.549
When activated by water, the bacteria produce
limestone to fix the crack.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.599
Oh bacteria, I love you.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.829
Thanks for watching Seeker.
