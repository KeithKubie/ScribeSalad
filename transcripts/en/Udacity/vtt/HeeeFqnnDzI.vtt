00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.430
In this lesson we will be covering IP

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.740
addressing. In particular we will be covering IPv4

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.226
address structure and allocation. IP stands for Internet

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:11.555
Protocol, and version four is the version of the

00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:17.283
protocol that is widely deployed on the Internet to date. Each IP address

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:22.460
is a 32-bit number. And that 32-bit number is formatted in what is called dotted

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.610
quad notation. For example, the IP

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.770
address for www.cc.tech.edu, is 130.207.7.36. And this

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.705
is just a convenient way of writing a

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:40.960
32-bit number. So 130 represents eight bits, and

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.000
207 is another eight bit number. Seven is

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.168
another eight bit number, as is 36. This structure allows for two to the 32 of

00:00:48.168 --> 00:00:52.050
about 4 billion Internet addresses. Now that sounds

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.730
like a lot of addresses. As it turns

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.250
out it's actually not enough, and we're running out of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.169
IP addresses, as I'll discuss in a later lesson. But even

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:02.050
if we only had to deal with two to the 32

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.998
Internet addresses, it's still a lot. Think of it if you

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.140
have to store every single IP address as an entry

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.080
in a table. Very quickly that becomes an extremely large table.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.770
Where look-ups can be slow and the memory required to store

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.290
such a large table might be expensive. So what we need

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.390
is a more concise way of representing groups of IP addresses.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.560
There are different ways to group IP addresses and we'll look

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.820
at the prevailing method in the next part of the lesson.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.023
But first, let's look at how this was done before 1994.
