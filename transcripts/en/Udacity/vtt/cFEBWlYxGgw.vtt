00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
And the answer here is in some way surprising.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.000
Although we have a 10 times improvement, we actually cannot handle an input that is much larger.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.600
We can only handle an input where n is 33 or smaller,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.730
and the way you can figure this out is as follows--

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.710
If the maximum input size we can handle is 30, then the number of time steps

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:35.320
this algorithm over here takes is 2³⁰  30², which is 966,367,641,600 time steps.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.410
So already a rather powerful computer at work here I would presume.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.920
What if we have an algorithm that is 10 times faster.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:52.480
Now, 2³¹&lt;i&gt;31²/10 is about 206 billion, 2³²&lt;i&gt;32²/10=440 billions--that is still smaller than this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:02.700
and 2³³&lt;i&gt;33² is about 93 billion, so slightly smaller still than this one here.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:02.700 --> 99:59:59.000
If you increase it to 34, then this number here will become larger than this one over here.
