00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.620
It always helps me to see a lot
of examples of something so I

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.920
figured it wouldn't hurt to
do more scientific

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.980
notation examples.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.920
So I'm just going to write a
bunch of numbers and then write

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.390
them in scientific notation.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.180
And hopefully this'll cover
almost every case you'll ever

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.160
see and then at the end of this
video, we'll actually do some

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.430
computation with them to just
make sure that we can

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.960
do computation with
scientific notation.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.835
Let me just write down
a bunch of numbers.

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:28.380
0.00852.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.640
That's my first number.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:39.445
My second number
is 7012000000000.

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:42.040
I'm just arbitrarily
stopping the zeroes.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:50.620
The next number is 0.0000000
I'll just draw a couple more.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.640
If I keep saying 0, you
might find that annoying.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.260
500 The next number --
right here, there's a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.580
decimal right there.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.090
The next number I'm going
to do is the number 723.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.970
The next number I'll do -- I'm
having a lot of 7's here.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.260
Let's do 0.6.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.300
 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.980
And then let's just do one more
just for, just to make sure

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.590
we've covered all of our bases.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.640
Let's say we do 823 and then
let's throw some -- an

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.640
arbitrary number of 0's there.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.460
So this first one, right here,
what we do if we want to write

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.910
in scientific notation, we want
to figure out the largest

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.100
exponent of 10 that
fits into it.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310
So we go to its first
non-zero term, which

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.230
is that right there.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.250
We count how many positions to
the right of the decimal point

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.000
we have including that term.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.070
So we have one, two, three.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.560
So it's going to
be equal to this.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.230
So it's going to be equal
to 8 -- that's that guy

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.370
right there -- 0.52.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.220
So everything after that
first term is going to

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.190
be behind the decimal.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.340
So 0.52 times 10 to the
number of terms we have.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.520
One, two, three.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.390
10 to the minus 3.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.440
Another way to think of it:
this is a little bit more.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.290
This is like 8 1/2
thousands, right?

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.430
Each of these is thousands.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.290
We have 8 1/2 of them.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.520
Let's do this one.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.900
Let's see how many 0's we have.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.620
We have 3, 6, 9, 12.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.630
So we want to do -- again,
we start with our largest

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.730
term that we have.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.335
Our largest non-zero term.

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:30.750
In this case, it's going
to be the term all

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.430
the way to the left.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.900
That's our 7.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.570
So it's going to be 7.012.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.960
It's going to be equal to
7.012 times 10 to the what?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.350
Well it's going to be times 10
to the 1 with this many 0's.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.300
So how many things?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.300
We had a 1 here.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.700
Then we had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 0's.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.490
I want to be very clear.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.600
You're not just
counting the 0's.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.860
You're counting everything
after this first

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.730
term right there.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.550
So it would be equivalent
to a 1 followed by 12 0's.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.360
So it's times 10
to the twelfth.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.020
Just like that.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.790
Not too difficult.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.630
Let's do this one right here.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.650
So we go behind our
decimal point.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.520
We find the first
non-zero number.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.980
That's our 5.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.610
It's going to be equal to 5.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.800
There's nothing to the right of
it, so it's 5.00 if we wanted

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.710
to add some precision to it.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.880
But it's 5 times and then how
many numbers to the right, or

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.790
behind to the right of the
decimal will do we have?

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.760
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and we

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.820
have to include this one, 14.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.700
5 times 10 to the
minus 14th power.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.640
Now this number, it might be a
little overkill to write this

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.670
in scientific notation, but it
never hurts to get

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.700
the practice.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.490
So what's the largest 10
that goes into this?

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.640
Well, 100 will go into this.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.150
And you could figure out 100 or
10 squared by saying, "OK, this

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.990
is our largest term." And then
we have two 0's behind it

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.210
because we can say 100
will go into 723.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.070
So this is going to be equal to
7.23 times, we could say times

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.995
100, but we want to stay in
scientific notation, so I'll

00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:22.240
write times 10 squared.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.360
Now we have this
character right here.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.960
What's our first non-zero term?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.310
It's that one right there, so
it's going to be 6 times and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.300
then how many terms do we have
to the right of the decimal?

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.350
We have only one.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.300
So times 10 to the minus 1.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.530
That makes a lot of sense
because that's essentially

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.170
equal to 6 divided by 10
because 10 to the minus

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.510
1 is 1/10 which is 0.6.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.120
One more.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.770
Let me throw some commas
here just to make this a

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.530
little easier to look at.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.610
So let's take our largest
value right there.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.790
We have our 8.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.220
This is going to be 8.23 -- we
don't have to add the other

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.250
stuff because everything else
is a 0 -- times 10 to the --

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.070
we just count how many
terms are after the 8.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.960
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.170
8.23 times 10 to the 10.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.290
I think you get the idea now.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.590
It's pretty straightforward.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.860
And more than just being able
to calculate this, which is a

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.200
good skill by itself, I want
you to understand why

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.940
this is the case.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.820
Hopefully that last
video explained it.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.390
And if it doesn't, just
multiply this out.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.430
Literally multiply 8.23
times 10 to the 10 and

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.770
you will get this number.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.190
Maybe you could try it
with something smaller

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.040
than 10 to the 10.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.110
Maybe 10 to the fifth.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.140
And well, you'll get a
different number but

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.980
you'll end up with five
digits after the 8.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.180
But anyway, let me do a couple
more computation examples.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:54.790
Let's say we had the numbers
-- let me just make something

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.410
really small -- 0.0000064.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.060
Let me make a large number.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.100
Let's say I have that number
and I want to multiply it.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.450
I want to multiply it by --
let's say I have a really large

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.610
number -- 3 2 -- I'm just going
to throw a bunch of 0's here.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.530
I don't know when
I'm going to stop.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.900
Let's say I stop there.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.560
So this one, you
can multiply out.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.650
But it's a little difficult.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.680
But let's put it into
scientific notation.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.090
One, it'll be easier to
represent these numbers and

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.800
then hopefully you'll see that
the multiplication actually

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.720
gets simplified as well.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.550
So this top guy right here,
how can we write him in

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.110
scientific notation?

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.560
It would be 6.4 times
10 to the what?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.430
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.440
I have to include the 6.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.480
So times 10 to the minus 6.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.800
And what can this
one be written as?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.930
This one is going to be 3.2.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.150
 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.560
And then you count how many
digits are after the 3.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.330
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.750
So 3.2 times 10 to the 11th.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.187
So if we multiply these two
things, this is equivalent to 6

00:07:06.187 --> 00:07:12.650
-- let me do it in a different
color -- 6.4 times 10 to

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:21.590
the minus 6 times 3.2
times 10 to the 11th.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.160
Which we saw in the last video
is equivalent to 6.4 times 3.2.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.360
I'm just changing the order
of our multiplication.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.560
Times 10 to the minus 6
times 10 to the 11th power.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.300
And now what will
this be equal to?

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.490
Well, to do this, I don't
want to use a calculator.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.530
So let's just calculate it.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.830
So 6.4 times 3.2.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.450
Let's ignore the
decimals for a second.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.640
We'll worry about
that at the end.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.060
So 2 times 4 is 8,
2 times 6 is 12.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.770
Nowhere to carry the
1, so it's just 128.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.810
Put a 0 down there.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.290
3 times 4 is 12, carry the 1.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.370
3 times 6 is 18.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.320
You've got a 1
there, so it's 192.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.700
Right?

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.510
Yeah.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.670
192.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.920
You add them up and you
get 8, 4, 1 plus 9 is 10.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.590
Carry the 1.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.780
You get 2.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.920
Now, we just have to
count the numbers behind

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.130
the decimal point.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.280
We have one number there, we
have another number there.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.045
We have two numbers behind
the decimal point,

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.120
so you count 1, 2.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:34.880
So 6.4 times 3.2 is equal to
20.48 times 10 to the -- we

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.930
have the same base here, so we
can just add the exponents.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.450
So what's minus 6 plus 11?

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.830
So that's 10 to the
fifth power, right?

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.180
Right.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.580
Minus 6 and 11.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.040
10 to the fifth power.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.690
And so the next question,
you might say, "I'm done.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.940
I've done the computation."
And you have.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.030
And this is a valid answer.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.270
But the next question is is
this in scientific notation?

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.180
And if you wanted to be a real
stickler about it, it's not in

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.530
scientific notation because we
have something here that could

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.140
maybe be simplified
a little bit.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.100
We could write this --
let me do it this way.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.960
Let me divide this by 10.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.950
So any number we can
multiply and divide by 10.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.130
So we could rewrite
it this way.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.610
We could write 1/10 on this
side and then we can multiply

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.270
times 10 on that side, right?

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.910
That shouldn't
change the number.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.650
You divide by 10 and
multiply it by 10.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.770
That's just like multiplying
by 1 or dividing by 1.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:33.010
So if you divide this side
by 10, you get 2.048.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.280
You multiply that side by
10 and you get times 10 to

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.730
the -- times 10 is just
times 10 to the first.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.780
You can just add the exponents.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.200
Times 10 to the sixth.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.280
And now, if you're a stickler
about it, this is good

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.840
scientific notation
right there.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.620
Now, I've done a lot
of multiplication.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.510
Let's do some division.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.010
Let's divide this
guy by that guy.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:04.980
So if we have 3.2 times 10 to
the eleventh power divided by

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.600
6.4 times 10 to the minus
six, what is this equal to?

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.940
Well, this is equal
to 3.2 over 6.4.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.300
We can just separate them out
because it's associative.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:23.210
So, it's this times 10
to the 11th over 10 to

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.290
the minus six, right?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.530
If you multiply these
two things, you'll

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.930
get that right there.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.130
So 3.2 over 6.4.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.030
This is just equal
to 0.5, right?

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.170
32 is half of 64 or 3.2
is half of 6.4, so this

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.140
is 0.5 right there.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.350
And what is this?

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.100
This is 10 to the 11th
over 10 to the minus 6.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.700
So when you have something
in the denominator, you

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.620
could write it this way.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.510
This is equivalent to 10 to the
11th over 10 to the minus 6.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.070
It's equal to 10 to the
11th times 10 to the

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.800
minus 6 to the minus 1.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.060
Or this is equal to 10 to the
11th times 10 to the sixth.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.610
And what did I do just there?

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.140
This is 1 over 10
to the minus 6.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.580
So 1 over something is just
that something to the

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.500
negative 1 power.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.280
And then I multiplied
the exponents.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.110
You can think of it that way
and so this would be equal

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:19.000
to 10 to the 17th power.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.620
Or another way to think about
it is if you have 1 -- you have

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.360
the same bases, 10 in this
case, and you're dividing them,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.400
you just take the 1 the
numerator and you subtract the

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.220
exponent in the denominator.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:35.010
So it's 11 minus minus
6, which is 11 plus 6,

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.910
which is equal to 17.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.210
So this division problem
ended up being equal to

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:46.290
0.5 times 10 to the 17th.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.150
Which is the correct answer,
but if you wanted to be a

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.410
stickler and put it into
scientific notation, we want

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.190
something maybe greater
than 1 right here.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.800
So the way we can do
that, let's multiply

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.420
it by 10 on this side.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.990
And divide by 10 on this
side or multiply by 1/10.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.880
Remember, we're not changing
the number if you multiply

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.660
by 10 and divide by 10.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.950
We're just doing it to
different parts of the product.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:15.630
So this side is going to become
5 -- I'll do it in pink -- 10

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:20.930
times 0.5 is 5, times 10 to
the 17th divided by 10.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.190
That's the same thing as
10 to the 17th times 10

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.650
to the minus 1, right?

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.120
That's 10 to the minus 1.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.320
So it's equal to 10
to the 16th power.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.930
 

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.330
Which is the answer when
you divide these two

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.490
guys right there.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.750
So hopefully these examples
have filled in all of the

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.250
gaps or the uncertain
scenarios dealing with

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.260
scientific notation.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.220
