00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.580
 

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's try to solve a
more involved equation.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:15.190
So, let's say that we have 2x
plus 3, 2x plus 3 is equal

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:23.040
to is equal to 5x minus 2.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.120
So this might look a
little daunting at first.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.220
We have x's on both
sides of the equation.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.980
We're adding and
subtracting numbers.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.500
How do you solve it?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
And we'll do it in a
couple of different ways.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.950
The the important thing
to remember is, we just

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.260
want to isolate an x.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.750
Once you've isolated an x,
you have x equals something.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.900
Or x equals something.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.640
You're done, you've
solved the equation.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.050
You can actually go back and
check whether that works, So

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.400
what we're going to do is just
do a bunch of operations on

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.375
both sides of the equation,
to eventually isolate the x.

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.590
But while we do those, I
actually want to visualize

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.140
what's occurring.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.670
Because I don't want you just
say, oh what are the rules or

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.240
the steps of solving equations.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.920
And I forgot whether this is a
allowed or that isn't allowed.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.090
If you visualize what's
happening, it'll actually be

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.780
common sense what's allowed.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.880
So let's visualize it.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.890
So we have 2x right here
on the left-hand side.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.430
So that's literally,
that's x plus x.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.850
And then you have plus 3.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.480
Plus 3, I'll do it like this.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.480
So that's equal to plus
1, plus 1, plus 1.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.910
That's the same thing as 3.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.260
I could've drawn 3
circles here as well.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.800
Let do the same color.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.040
Plus 3.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.670
And then that is
equal to 5 x's.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.200
Do that in blue.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.450
That is equal to 5 x's.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.440
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.240
And I want to make it clear.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.110
You would never actually
have to do it this way when

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.140
you're solving the problem.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.440
You would just have to
do the algebraic steps.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.010
But I'm doing this for you so
you can actually visualize

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.860
what this equation is saying.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.060
the left-hand side is these
two orange x's plus 3.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.540
The right-hand side
is 5x minus 2.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.930
So minus 2, we could write
as -- so let me do this

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.890
in a different color,
I'll do it in pink.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.580
So, minus 2, I'll do as
minus 1 and minus 1.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.420
Now, we want to isolate
the x's on the same

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.450
side of the equation.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.870
So, how could we do that?

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.670
Well, there's two
ways of doing it.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.250
We could subtract these
two x's from both

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.450
sides of the equation.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.720
And that would be
pretty reasonable.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.220
Because then you'd have
5 x's minus the 2 x's.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.690
You'd have a positive number of
x's on the right-hand side.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.200
Or, you could actually
subtract 5x from both sides.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.160
And that's what's
neat about algebra.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.510
As long as you do legitimate
operations, you will eventually

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.890
get the right answer.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.320
So let's just start off
subtracting 2x from both

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.690
sides of the equation.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.180
And what I mean there, I mean
we're going to remove 2 x's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.710
from the left-hand side.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.980
And if we were to move 2 x's on
the left-hand side, we have to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.240
remove 2 x's the
right-hand side.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.090
Just like that.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.000
So what does that give us?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.700
We're subtracting 2 x's.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.730
2 x's from the left.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.730
And we're also going to
subtract 2 x's from the right.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.290
Now, what does our left-hand
side simplify to?

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.460
We have 2x plus 3 minus 2x.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.340
The 2 x's cancel out.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.490
So you're just left with --
you're just left with the 3.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.560
And you see that over here.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.390
We took 2 of these x's away.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.840
We're just left with the
plus 1, plus 1, plus 1.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.000
And then on the right-hand
side, 5x minus 2x.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.930
We have it over here.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.890
We have 5 x's minus 2 x's.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.590
You only have 1, 2,
3, x's left over.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.860
3 is equal to 3x.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.530
And then you have
your minus 2 there.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.220
You have your minus 2.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.770
So, normally if you were to do
the problem, you would just

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.850
have to write what we have
here on the left-hand side.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.860
So what can we do next?

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.880
Remember, we want to
isolate the x's.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.560
Well, we have all of our x's on
the right-hand side right here.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.830
If we could get rid of this
negative 2, off of the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.310
right-hand side, then
the x's will be alone.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.560
They'll be isolated.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.570
So how can we get rid of
this negative 2, if we

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.510
visualize it over here.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.930
This negative 1,
this negative 1.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.390
Well, we could add 2 to both
sides of this equation.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.000
Think about what happens there.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.480
So, if we add 2, so I'm
going to do it like this.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.065
Plus 1, plus 1.

00:03:59.065 --> 00:03:59.770
So you could literally see.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.990
We're adding 2.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.990
And then we're going to add
2 to the left-hand side.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.320
1 plus, 1 plus.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.590
What happens?

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.790
Let me do it over here as well.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.070
So we're going to add 2.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.770
We're going to add 2.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.380
So what happens to
the left-hand side?

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.780
3 plus 2 is going
to be equal to 5.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.000
And that is going to be
equal to 3x minus 2 plus 2.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.310
These guys cancel out.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.550
And you're just left with 3x.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.880
And we see it over here.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.390
We have the left-hand side is 1
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.120
We have 5 1's, or 5.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.020
And the right-hand side,
we have the 3 x's,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.040
right over there.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.730
And then we have the
negative 1, negative 1.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.840
Plus 1, plus 1, negative
1, these cancel out.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.140
They get us to 0.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.060
They cancel out.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.500
So we're just left with
5 is equal to 3x.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.670
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 is equal to 3x.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.550
Let me clear everything that
we've removed, so it looks

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.525
a little bit cleaner.

00:04:55.525 --> 00:05:00.160
 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.740
These are all of the things
that we've removed.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.240
Let me clear that out.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.680
And then let me clear
that out, like that.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.640
Edit.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.300
Clear.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.810
So now we are just left
with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.230
Actually, let me
move this over.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.050
 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.620
So I could just move this
over right over here.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.080
We now have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.610
These are the two that we
added here, is equal to 3x.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.750
These guys canceled out.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.360
That's why we have
nothing there.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.310
Now, to solve this, we
just divide both sides

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.950
of this equation by 3.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.170
And this is going to
be a little hard to

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.210
visualize over here.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.050
But if we divide over here both
sides by 3, what do we get?

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.480
We divide the left by 3.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.810
We divide the right by 3.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.560
The whole reason why we divided
by 3 is because the x was

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.460
being multiplied by 3.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.650
3 is the coefficient on the x.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.630
Fancy word, it literally
just means the number

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.360
multiplying the variable.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.110
The number we're solving, the
variable we're solving for.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.140
So these 3's cancel out.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.520
The right-hand side of
the equation is just x.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.260
The left-hand side is 5/3.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.780
So 5/3, we could say
is is equal to 5/3.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.030
And this is different than
everything we've seen so far.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.790
I now have the x on the
right-hand side, the value

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.710
on the left-hand side.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.720
That's completely fine.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.800
This is the exact same thing as
saying 5/3 is is equal to x is

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.680
the same thing as saying
x's equal to 5/3.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.280
Completely equivalent.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.080
Completely equivalent.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.140
We sometimes get more used
to this one, but this is

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.510
completely the same thing.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.090
Now, if we wanted to write this
as a mixed number, if we want

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.760
to write this as a mixed
number, 3 goes into 5 one

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.480
time with remainder 2.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.610
So it's going to be 1 2/3.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.680
So it's going to be 1 2/3.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.410
So we could also write
that x is equal to 1 2/3.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.580
And I'll leave it up for you
to actually substitute back

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.990
into this original equation.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.650
And see that it works out.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.260
Now, to visualize it over here,
you know, how did he get 1

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.390
2/3, let's think about it.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.790
Instead of doing 1, I'm
going to do circles.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.510
I am going to do circles.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.950
Actually, even better,
I'm going to do squares.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.460
So I'm going to have 5 squares
on the left-hand side.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.570
I'll do it in this same
yellow color right here.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:19.560
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.172
And that is going to be
equal to the 3 x's.

00:07:23.172 --> 00:07:25.570
x plus x plus x.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.350
Now, we're dividing both
sides of the equation by 3.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.150
We're dividing both sides
of the equation by 3.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.380
Actually, that's where
we did it up here, we

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.850
divided both sides by 3.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.870
So how do you do that
right-hand side's pretty

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.480
straightforward.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.760
You want to divide these
3 x's into 3 groups.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.040
That's 1, 2, 3 groups.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.700
1, 2, 3.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.700
Now, how do you
divide 5 into 3?

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.000
And they have to be thought
through even groups.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.830
And the answer tells us.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.500
Each group is going
to be 1 2/3.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.430
So, 1 2/3.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.960
So it's going to be 2/3
of this, the next one.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.530
And then we're going
to have 1 2/3.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.740
So this is 1/3.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.480
We're going to need another.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.270
Another 1, so this is 1 1/3.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.770
We're going to need 1 more
1/3, so this is going

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.870
to be right here.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.390
And then we're left
with 2/3 and 1.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.450
So we've broken it
up into 3 groups.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.250
This right here.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.400
Let me make it clear.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.840
Let me make it clear, this
right here is 1 2/3.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.650
1 2/3.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.420
And then this right
here, this 1/3.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.140
That's another 1/3, so
that's 2/3, and then

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.010
that's 1 right there.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.970
So that's 1 2/3.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.480
And then finally this
is 2/3 and this is

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.890
1, so this is 1 2/3.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:40.030
So when you divide both
sides by 3 you get 1 2/3.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.430
Each section, each bucket, is
1 2/3 on the left-hand side.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.080
On the left-hand side, or 5/3.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.120
And on the right-hand
side we just have an x.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.070
So it still works.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.270
A little bit harder to
visualize with fractions.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:52.793
