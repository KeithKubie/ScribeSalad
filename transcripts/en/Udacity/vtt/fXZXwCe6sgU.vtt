00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.650
Hi, I'm Paul Bakaus and
I'm a Developer Advocate at Google.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.570
In my previous role as Studio CTO
at Zinga, it's my full time job

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.030
to have my team tooled up to be as
productive and happy as possible.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.020
&gt;&gt; And I'm James Williams.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.670
A Course Developer here at Udacity,
where I make Android and web courses.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.840
In the next few lessons, we're
going to teach how do you use tools.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.010
Okay, not these tools, but these tools,
to help you become a better and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.450
more efficient web developer whether
you're just starting out, or

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.090
have been around for
a while and want to freshen up.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.452
&gt;&gt; So, how are we going to do this?

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:32.740
&gt;&gt; You're going to stay here and
translate all the tooling mumbo jumbo

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.770
into English, and
explain the ideas and concepts.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.191
&gt;&gt; Well, then you have to make sure
that all the material stays in long term

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:42.257
memory by quizzing our students and
so on.

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:43.850
Now, here's a quick disclaimer.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.110
I promise you come out here supercharged
and more productive than ever.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.100
It's going to involve a lot of
fiddling with the terminal,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.810
a lot of keyboard shortcuts and
general groundwork.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.460
Or guard work, I should say,
but we'll get to that later.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.870
But we'll try to spice it
up as much as possible.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.540
&gt;&gt; All right, let's talk about
what you'll learn in this course.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.910
We'll kick it off with setting
up your developing environment,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.550
to achieve that perfect flow.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.650
&gt;&gt; Finally, let's get you a coworker
that you can delegate tasks to,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.180
your build process.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.630
And then we'll dive into all
the things our fellow is good at.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.460
Expressive life coding,
preventing yourself from disasters, and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.890
saving a lot of time and
effort with automatic optimizations.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.650
&gt;&gt; So let's get going.
