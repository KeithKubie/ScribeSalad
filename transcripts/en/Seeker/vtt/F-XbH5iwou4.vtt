00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.390
It was a scorcher yesterday, so I cranked
the air conditioning but then I started getting

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.180
chilly, so I got under my electric blanket.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.650
It’s possible there’s a better way...

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.350
Howdy domicile dwellers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.840
When you’re puttering around the house you’re
probably not thinking of melting ice caps

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.539
or changes in rainfall patterns.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.580
You probably just want the temperature right
and the lights bright enough to avoid shin-high

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.580
furniture.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.140
And this is a huge challenge for climate scientists.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.140
Climate change is such a massive, world-changing
issue, that it’s difficult for any one of

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.500
us to feel responsible.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.949
“No raindrop blames itself for the flood.”

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.500
But part of that is putting it in perspective,
right?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.850
A third of U.S. homes still use coal to generate
those kilowatts; 36 states use it either as

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.359
the main source of power or electricity.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.499
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,
the average consumption for a residential

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:55.749
home was 15,497 kWh.

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.899
To generate 1 kWh with a coal plant requires
about 1.04 pounds of coal (0.47kg) -- which

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.290
produces about 2.13 pounds of CO2.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.280
So for every kilowatt hour you can cut, you're
saving 2 pounds of harmful greenhouse gas,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.760
not to mention other pollutants from entering
our atmosphere!

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.690
So, if we limit the amount of energy we're
wasting at home, we all save money AND help

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.690
the environment!

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.690
Win-win!

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.400
And there are a TON of ways to do this…

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.160
For example, about 45 percent of that is used
for air conditioning, heating, lighting and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160
water-heaters!

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.541
Obviously, the easiest way to cut your use
is to keep the temperature set below 68 in

00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:37.320
the winter and wear a sweater, or above 78
in the hot summer months and go au natural.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.860
All this will let your home heat itself more
efficiently and remove over 1000 pounds of

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.870
CO2 from the air annually.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.520
Remember when your mom shouted, "Shut the
door, you wanna heat the whole outdoors?"

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.420
She is right, but the windows were likely
worse culprits; 10 to 25 percent of all energy

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.159
loss from a house come from windows!

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.320
Simple stuff like simply using curtains to
keep the hot sun out in the summer can make

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.320
a big difference.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.210
Double-paned windows are help too.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.630
They have two panes of glass, with air in
between.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.340
Believe-it-or-not air is a poor conductor
of heat, so they insulate the house better,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.360
like a transparent down jacket.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.519
And if you're one of those -- go big or go
home types -- look at your light bulbs.

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.370
Incandescent bulbs waste 90% of all the energy
it takes to make the light as heat.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.730
Swapping just one for a more efficient alternative
would reduce greenhouse gases by 400 pounds

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.599
over the bulbs' lifetime.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.250
400 pounds from one measly bulb!

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.079
There are a couple choices now: the crazy
spiral tube-y ones called Compact Fluorescent

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.540
Lamps (CFLs) and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs).

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.959
If every household in the US swapped out only
one of Edison’s old-school bulbs that would

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.260
be the equivalent of taking 800,000 cars off
the road.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.290
LED bulbs ARE more expensive but last 8 to
10 times longer than a CFL (and 50 times longer

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.819
than old-school bulbs) and, unlike CFLs, they
don’t use mercury.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.290
To put it in perspective a 100w lightbulb
used for 1,000 hours (one lifetime) will require

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.260
100,000 watt hours -- or 100 kilowatt hours.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.709
The LED equivalent over that same time would
only be 25 kWh -- cutting another 160 pounds

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.709
of CO2.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.469
In the US the EPA gives appliances an Energy
Star label, telling us all how much energy

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.720
they'll using in a year.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.129
Using efficient appliances, AND living smartly,
will save thousands of dollars in energy costs

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.260
and can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 65
tons per year PER PERSON!

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.730
Helping the planet is like putting money back
in your wallet.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.480
I kind of love that.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.390
Another way to help save energy is by using
smarter appliances.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.790
“AT&amp;T Digital Life smart home security helps
keep you connected to you home, so there are

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.000
no more what ifs.”

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.150
I know the internet likes to argue about it
but in the scientific community there’s

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.500
no contest: climate change is real.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.449
So why is it so hard to get people to care?

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.280
Part of it, is not calling it climate change…

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:02.849
I explains why, here.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:13.430
