00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.215
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know the companies cost the same, at five hours, and the cost is $60. This

00:00:05.215 --> 00:00:10.723
also makes sense because this is our point of intersection. It's the point that

00:00:10.723 --> 00:00:15.946
makes both of these equations true. If x were equal to 5 we could plug that in

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:21.250
here. 6 times 5 is 30 plus 30 would be $60 in total. That would be the cost for

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.970
Rent-a-Car. For Car-nival we could also plug 5 in for x. 5 times 10 would be 50

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.774
plus 10 would be 60. So yes, this point is the solution or the intersection for

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:34.202
the two equations.
