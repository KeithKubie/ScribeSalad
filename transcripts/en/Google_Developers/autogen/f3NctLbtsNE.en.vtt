distribution model where you update your
 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.950
distribution model where you update your
code on the server and then people just

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960
code on the server and then people just
 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.810

right so that's these are these are the
 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.620
right so that's these are these are the
kinds of issues that Chrome apps are

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:38.630
kinds of issues that Chrome apps are
 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.470

right
now I'm assuming that many of you

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550
now I'm assuming that many of you
 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.520
now I'm assuming that many of you
probably have existing web apps and

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:45.530
probably have existing web apps and
 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.500
probably have existing web apps and
there are some differences when you're

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:47.510
there are some differences when you're
 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.230
there are some differences when you're
building native chrome apps using web

technologies that you need to be aware
 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.500
technologies that you need to be aware
of it I'll cover some of that so let me

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:53.510
of it I'll cover some of that so let me
 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.090
of it I'll cover some of that so let me
just begin first let's talk a little

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.100
just begin first let's talk a little
 

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.590
just begin first let's talk a little
about offline I'm gonna go through each

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:56.600
about offline I'm gonna go through each
 

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.940
about offline I'm gonna go through each
one of these in a little bit more depth

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:57.950
one of these in a little bit more depth
 

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.760
one of these in a little bit more depth
so let's talk about for a second what

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:00.770
so let's talk about for a second what
 

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.350
so let's talk about for a second what
offline really means because offline

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360
offline really means because offline
 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.390

in the room right so these are all kinds

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.210
in the room right so these are all kinds
 

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.930
in the room right so these are all kinds
of situations and edge cases where

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:39.940

it's it's not like it's getting its UI

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:48.860
it's it's not like it's getting its UI
 

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.410
it's it's not like it's getting its UI
from the wood from the from the internet

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:50.420
from the wood from the from the internet
 

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.910
from the wood from the from the internet
and updating it in real time it's just

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920
and updating it in real time it's just
 

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.480

you just keep right on working

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:54.490
you just keep right on working
 

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.310
you just keep right on working
and that's because all those resources

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320
and that's because all those resources
 

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.020
and that's because all those resources
are stored locally they're packaged up

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.030
are stored locally they're packaged up
 

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.700
are stored locally they're packaged up
in a package rather you don't to

00:08:59.700 --> 00:08:59.710
in a package rather you don't to
 

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.170
in a package rather you don't to
generate UI on the fly you don't have

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:01.180
generate UI on the fly you don't have
 

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.050

some PHP script writing out HTML so the

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:04.060
some PHP script writing out HTML so the
 

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.520
some PHP script writing out HTML so the
so native apps had this really great

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.530
so native apps had this really great
 

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.860
so native apps had this really great
advantage in that regard where they just

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:07.870
advantage in that regard where they just
 

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.500
advantage in that regard where they just
recover from this

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:09.510
recover from this
 

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.140
recover from this
these recover from this natively so in

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.150
these recover from this natively so in
 

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.120
these recover from this natively so in
chrome apps all your resources are

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.130
chrome apps all your resources are
 

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.590
chrome apps all your resources are
packaged up locally and your app can be

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600
packaged up locally and your app can be
 

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.780
packaged up locally and your app can be
launched any time now what this means is

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:18.790
launched any time now what this means is
 

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.310
launched any time now what this means is
you have to plan for having a great

you know things about this stuff and you
 

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.220
you know things about this stuff and you
know the question of course comes up and

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.230
know the question of course comes up and
 

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.450
know the question of course comes up and
what about Service Worker what about app

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:27.460
what about Service Worker what about app
 

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.270
what about Service Worker what about app
cache you know yes serviceworker I agree

years teaching users that browsers don't

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:43.390
years teaching users that browsers don't
 

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.450
years teaching users that browsers don't
work when they're offline so even if we

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:45.460
work when they're offline so even if we
 

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.760
work when they're offline so even if we
had perfect app cache and serviceworker

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:47.770
had perfect app cache and serviceworker
 

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.350
had perfect app cache and serviceworker
tomorrow you'd still have to overcome

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360
tomorrow you'd still have to overcome
 

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.860
tomorrow you'd still have to overcome
right this user inertia of I don't open

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:52.870
right this user inertia of I don't open
 

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.590

experience there's certain things you

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:00.100
experience there's certain things you
 

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.430

have to do first you have to factor your
 

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.950
have to do first you have to factor your
app in order to work offline so take the

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:04.960
app in order to work offline so take the
 

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.600
app in order to work offline so take the
HTML separate from the JavaScript and so

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:06.610
HTML separate from the JavaScript and so
 

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.820
HTML separate from the JavaScript and so
on it's only as a good idea to abstract

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:08.830
on it's only as a good idea to abstract
 

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:09.900
on it's only as a good idea to abstract
the app a little bit so that it's

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:09.910
the app a little bit so that it's
 

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.080
the app a little bit so that it's
talking to a data layer right this thing

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.090
talking to a data layer right this thing
 

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.220

about how sublime is working right

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:14.230
about how sublime is working right
 

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.200
about how sublime is working right
you're working on your code right it's

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.210
you're working on your code right it's
 

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.790
you're working on your code right it's
simply working on the data and then the

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800
simply working on the data and then the
 

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.350
simply working on the data and then the
data layer is handling the part of

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360
data layer is handling the part of
 

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.910
data layer is handling the part of
talking to the cloud or talking to local

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920
talking to the cloud or talking to local
 

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.860
talking to the cloud or talking to local
storage or whatever it is right so if

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:22.870
storage or whatever it is right so if
 

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.390
storage or whatever it is right so if
you can make that abstraction things get

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:24.400
you can make that abstraction things get
 

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.430
you can make that abstraction things get
a lot easier you have to think a little

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440
a lot easier you have to think a little
 

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.870
a lot easier you have to think a little
bit about what your apps offline

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:27.880
bit about what your apps offline
 

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.420
bit about what your apps offline
features are going to be and yes some

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:30.430
features are going to be and yes some
 

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.800

applications just don't work very well

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:31.810
applications just don't work very well
 

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.090
applications just don't work very well
when they're offline but that doesn't

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:33.100
when they're offline but that doesn't
 

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.770
when they're offline but that doesn't
mean they're useless right think about

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:34.780
mean they're useless right think about
 

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.700
mean they're useless right think about
an app like like Skype right Skype 95%

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:38.710
an app like like Skype right Skype 95%
 

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.830
an app like like Skype right Skype 95%
of the value of Skype is only there when

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:40.840
of the value of Skype is only there when
 

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.960
of the value of Skype is only there when
I have a connection right but when I

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:42.970
I have a connection right but when I
 

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.730
I have a connection right but when I
don't have a connection I shouldn't be

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:44.740
don't have a connection I shouldn't be
 

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.650
don't have a connection I shouldn't be
like hosed I should at least be able to

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:46.660
like hosed I should at least be able to
 

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.180
like hosed I should at least be able to
manage my contact list I should at least

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:48.190
manage my contact list I should at least
 

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.890
manage my contact list I should at least
be able to see my call history right so

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:49.900
be able to see my call history right so
 

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.780
be able to see my call history right so
there's still some value there so these

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:51.790
there's still some value there so these
 

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:52.680
there's still some value there so these
are the kinds of things you have to

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:52.690
are the kinds of things you have to
 

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.820
are the kinds of things you have to
think about like what kinds of features

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:53.830
think about like what kinds of features
 

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.190
think about like what kinds of features
does it make sense for my app to have

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200
does it make sense for my app to have
 

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.850
does it make sense for my app to have
when it's offline we do since it's since

00:10:59.850 --> 00:10:59.860
when it's offline we do since it's since
 

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.070
when it's offline we do since it's since
its Chrome and since its html5 you do

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:02.080
its Chrome and since its html5 you do
 

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.660
its Chrome and since its html5 you do
have access to things like the Navigator

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:03.670
have access to things like the Navigator
 

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.330
have access to things like the Navigator
online property I agree with Jake it's

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:06.340
online property I agree with Jake it's
 

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.340
online property I agree with Jake it's
not perfect it's better than

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:08.350
not perfect it's better than
 

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.140
not perfect it's better than
thing the good news is that most users

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.150
thing the good news is that most users
 

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.670
thing the good news is that most users
don't plug their network cables into

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680
don't plug their network cables into
 

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.160
don't plug their network cables into
soil right I mean I've only done it

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.170
soil right I mean I've only done it
 

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.080
soil right I mean I've only done it
twice and once was my accident

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.090
twice and once was my accident
 

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.650
twice and once was my accident
right so I mean it it's not not most

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:19.660
right so I mean it it's not not most
 

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.700
right so I mean it it's not not most
people don't do that they actually do

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:20.710
people don't do that they actually do
 

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.650
people don't do that they actually do
plug into the wall they use the Wi-Fi so

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:22.660
plug into the wall they use the Wi-Fi so
 

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.300
plug into the wall they use the Wi-Fi so
it's it's better than nothing and we

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:24.310
it's it's better than nothing and we
 

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.400
it's it's better than nothing and we
give you lots of ways to store data now

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:26.410
give you lots of ways to store data now
 

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.960
give you lots of ways to store data now
there's a couple things that we that we

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:27.970
there's a couple things that we that we
 

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.490
there's a couple things that we that we
don't do we don't give you window dot

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:29.500
don't do we don't give you window dot
 

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.900
don't do we don't give you window dot
local storage because it's synchronous

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:30.910
local storage because it's synchronous
 

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.060
local storage because it's synchronous
and that blocks the you X thread so we

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:33.070
and that blocks the you X thread so we
 

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.260
and that blocks the you X thread so we
can't have the user sitting there

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:34.270
can't have the user sitting there
 

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.000
can't have the user sitting there
twiddling their thumbs while you're

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.010
twiddling their thumbs while you're
 

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.590
twiddling their thumbs while you're
moving megabytes of data back and forth

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600
moving megabytes of data back and forth
 

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.330
moving megabytes of data back and forth
right so we try to fix that by giving

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:39.340
right so we try to fix that by giving
 

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.890
right so we try to fix that by giving
you a synchronous versions of

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:40.900
you a synchronous versions of
 

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.930
you a synchronous versions of
synchronous API is that would ordinarily

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:42.940
synchronous API is that would ordinarily
 

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.000
synchronous API is that would ordinarily
be in the web so for example we don't

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.010
be in the web so for example we don't
 

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.520
be in the web so for example we don't
support synchronous xhr right who does

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:47.530
support synchronous xhr right who does
 

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.630
support synchronous xhr right who does
these days why would you do that

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640
these days why would you do that
 

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.820
these days why would you do that
so you we give you a synchro's versions

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:50.830
so you we give you a synchro's versions
 

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.740
so you we give you a synchro's versions
and chrome storage local is our

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:52.750
and chrome storage local is our
 

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.870
and chrome storage local is our
asynchronous version of window dot local

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880
asynchronous version of window dot local
 

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.840
asynchronous version of window dot local
storage but you can use indexdb you can

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:57.850
storage but you can use indexdb you can
 

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.050
storage but you can use indexdb you can
use the html5 file system api right

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:01.060
use the html5 file system api right
 

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.460
use the html5 file system api right
there's there's lots of different ways

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:02.470
there's there's lots of different ways
 

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.580
there's there's lots of different ways
to store data and the the reason for

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:05.590
to store data and the the reason for
 

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:06.630
to store data and the the reason for
this the reason why this works is

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:06.640
this the reason why this works is
 

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.130
this the reason why this works is
because if you look at the way chrome

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:08.140
because if you look at the way chrome
 

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.560
because if you look at the way chrome
apps are structured you basically build

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:10.570
apps are structured you basically build
 

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.730
apps are structured you basically build
them the way that you would normally

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:11.740
them the way that you would normally
 

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.460
them the way that you would normally
build your web app you have your HTML

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:14.470
build your web app you have your HTML
 

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.070
build your web app you have your HTML
right you've got your JavaScript you've

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:17.080
right you've got your JavaScript you've
 

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.330
right you've got your JavaScript you've
got the other assets that make up your

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:18.340
got the other assets that make up your
 

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.730
got the other assets that make up your
application and then all we ask you to

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:20.740
application and then all we ask you to
 

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.830
application and then all we ask you to
do is put a little infrastructure around

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:22.840
do is put a little infrastructure around
 

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.200
do is put a little infrastructure around
that right there's a manifest file that

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.210
that right there's a manifest file that
 

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.420
that right there's a manifest file that
you write that defines what the app is

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:27.430
you write that defines what the app is
 

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.790
you write that defines what the app is
and does what its name is what its

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800
and does what its name is what its
 

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.400
and does what its name is what its
description is what permissions it has

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:31.410
description is what permissions it has
 

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.810
description is what permissions it has
where the entry points are that kind of

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:33.820
where the entry points are that kind of
 

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.000
where the entry points are that kind of

again that would be bad and

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.110
again that would be bad and
 

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.270
again that would be bad and
you've got to declare where your content

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:30.280
you've got to declare where your content
 

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.370
you've got to declare where your content
comes from if it's not local so if you

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:32.380
comes from if it's not local so if you
 

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.780
comes from if it's not local so if you
think back to that Economist app I was

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:33.790
think back to that Economist app I was
 

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.430
think back to that Economist app I was
showing all those images one of the

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440
showing all those images one of the
 

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.720
showing all those images one of the
things you can't do in a chrome app is

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:36.730
things you can't do in a chrome app is
 

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.060
things you can't do in a chrome app is
just simply say image tag path to random

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:39.070
just simply say image tag path to random
 

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.580
just simply say image tag path to random
image on web right because you have to

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:41.590
image on web right because you have to
 

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.289
image on web right because you have to
declare local content now that's a

00:24:43.289 --> 00:24:43.299
declare local content now that's a
 

00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:45.480
declare local content now that's a
pretty common pattern so we've actually

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:45.490
pretty common pattern so we've actually
 

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.370
pretty common pattern so we've actually
written a library that handles us for

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:47.380
written a library that handles us for
 

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.919
written a library that handles us for
you it'll go out to the web xhr stuff

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:49.929
you it'll go out to the web xhr stuff
 

00:24:49.929 --> 00:24:51.960
you it'll go out to the web xhr stuff
down locally and then you use blob URLs

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:51.970
down locally and then you use blob URLs
 

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.360
down locally and then you use blob URLs
or object URLs to refer to them in the

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:54.370
or object URLs to refer to them in the
 

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.310

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320
app paul lewis actually wrote that it's
 

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.289
app paul lewis actually wrote that it's
a really great library of course you

00:24:58.289 --> 00:24:58.299
a really great library of course you
 

00:24:58.299 --> 00:24:59.910
a really great library of course you
might really want to do that stuff right

00:24:59.910 --> 00:24:59.920
might really want to do that stuff right
 

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.080
might really want to do that stuff right
but wait a second I really want to do

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.090
but wait a second I really want to do
 

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:02.520
but wait a second I really want to do
that stuff I really wanna use eval got

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:02.530
that stuff I really wanna use eval got
 

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:06.630
that stuff I really wanna use eval got
templating library we do provide ways to

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640
templating library we do provide ways to
 

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.280
templating library we do provide ways to
get around some of these limitations or

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:08.290
get around some of these limitations or
 

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.530
get around some of these limitations or
security measures that we've put in so

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:10.540
security measures that we've put in so
 

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.419

first we have a webview component that

00:25:12.419 --> 00:25:12.429
first we have a webview component that
 

00:25:12.429 --> 00:25:14.640
first we have a webview component that
you can embed inside your apps it's

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:14.650
you can embed inside your apps it's
 

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.740
you can embed inside your apps it's
actually it's it's the rendering engine

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:16.750
actually it's it's the rendering engine
 

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.270
actually it's it's the rendering engine
of Chrome it's not Chrome itself there's

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:18.280
of Chrome it's not Chrome itself there's
 

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.010
of Chrome it's not Chrome itself there's
no extensions that come in right but

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:20.020
no extensions that come in right but
 

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.630
no extensions that come in right but
it's the it's the actual rendering

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640
it's the it's the actual rendering
 

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.100
it's the it's the actual rendering
surface of Chrome so what you're

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:23.110
surface of Chrome so what you're
 

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.419
surface of Chrome so what you're
basically doing is embedding chrome

00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:24.429
basically doing is embedding chrome
 

00:25:24.429 --> 00:25:26.280
basically doing is embedding chrome
inside of Chrome and it gets a little

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:26.290
inside of Chrome and it gets a little
 

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.570
inside of Chrome and it gets a little
inception like at that point but it

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:27.580
inception like at that point but it
 

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.820
inception like at that point but it
actually works it's really cool so you

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:29.830
actually works it's really cool so you
 

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.590
actually works it's really cool so you
could use things like you can do things

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600
could use things like you can do things
 

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.810
could use things like you can do things
like embed web content and again you can

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:33.820
like embed web content and again you can
 

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.190
like embed web content and again you can
do the post messaging they can

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200
do the post messaging they can
 

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.330
do the post messaging they can
communicate with each other which is

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:36.340
communicate with each other which is
 

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.560
communicate with each other which is
great you can execute script in the

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:37.570
great you can execute script in the
 

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.659
great you can execute script in the
webview which is great for actually

00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:39.669
webview which is great for actually
 

00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:41.159
webview which is great for actually
remote resources I talked about this

00:25:41.159 --> 00:25:41.169
remote resources I talked about this
 

00:25:41.169 --> 00:25:43.130
remote resources I talked about this
it's that xhr library that Paul route

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140
it's that xhr library that Paul route
 

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.720
it's that xhr library that Paul route
for tempering libraries this is where

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:45.730
for tempering libraries this is where
 

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.150
for tempering libraries this is where
things get a little interesting you know

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:48.160
things get a little interesting you know
 

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.070
things get a little interesting you know
because the if they're using eval a new

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080
because the if they're using eval a new
 

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.600
because the if they're using eval a new
function there's a couple of things you

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:51.610
function there's a couple of things you
 

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.460
function there's a couple of things you
can do here one you can pre compile your

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:53.470
can do here one you can pre compile your
 

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.470
can do here one you can pre compile your
templates right handlebars this is for

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480
templates right handlebars this is for
 

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.960
templates right handlebars this is for
example or there's a way for getting

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:57.970
example or there's a way for getting
 

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.820
example or there's a way for getting
around this stuff you can declare a page

00:25:59.820 --> 00:25:59.830
around this stuff you can declare a page
 

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.310
around this stuff you can declare a page
in your application and it doesn't have

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320
in your application and it doesn't have
 

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.980
in your application and it doesn't have
to be visible as a sandboxed page and

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:04.990
to be visible as a sandboxed page and
 

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.810
to be visible as a sandboxed page and
then what happens is all that bad stuff

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:06.820
then what happens is all that bad stuff
 

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.970
then what happens is all that bad stuff
is now okay again you can do things like

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:08.980
is now okay again you can do things like
 

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.159
is now okay again you can do things like
eval a new function but that page is

00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:11.169
eval a new function but that page is
 

00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:12.630
eval a new function but that page is
kept separate right it doesn't have

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640
kept separate right it doesn't have
 

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.220
kept separate right it doesn't have
access to the chrome API is you can't do

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:14.230
access to the chrome API is you can't do
 

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.140
access to the chrome API is you can't do
things like you know call the chrome

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:16.150
things like you know call the chrome
 

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.909
things like you know call the chrome
stuff in your application and you use

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919
stuff in your application and you use
 

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:19.770
stuff in your application and you use
post message back and forth so you could

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:19.780
post message back and forth so you could
 

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.450
post message back and forth so you could
put the template library in that page

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:21.460
put the template library in that page
 

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.520
put the template library in that page
send a message have it do all that stuff

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:23.530
send a message have it do all that stuff
 

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.500
send a message have it do all that stuff
it sends the results back to you and so

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:25.510
it sends the results back to you and so
 

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.640
it sends the results back to you and so
then everything is all nice and safe and

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:26.650
then everything is all nice and safe and
 

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.700
then everything is all nice and safe and
isolated all right mobile it's all about

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:29.710
isolated all right mobile it's all about
 

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:30.780
isolated all right mobile it's all about
mobile really quick I've got a couple

mobile really quick I've got a couple
minutes left so we are working to bring

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520
minutes left so we are working to bring
 

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.560
minutes left so we are working to bring
chrome apps to mobile devices via the

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:37.570
chrome apps to mobile devices via the
 

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.500

all right have you ever spent everybody

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:41.470
all right have you ever spent everybody
 

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:42.480
all right have you ever spent everybody
okay so

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:42.490
okay so
 

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.490
okay so
Apache Cordova basically is the open

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:44.500
Apache Cordova basically is the open
 

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.710
Apache Cordova basically is the open
source version of PhoneGap when when

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720
source version of PhoneGap when when
 

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.270
source version of PhoneGap when when
adobe acquired PhoneGap they open-source

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:48.280
adobe acquired PhoneGap they open-source
 

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.160
adobe acquired PhoneGap they open-source
the code kinda like we have chromium to

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:50.170
the code kinda like we have chromium to
 

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.170
the code kinda like we have chromium to
chrome right they've got Cordova to

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:52.180
chrome right they've got Cordova to
 

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.820
chrome right they've got Cordova to
PhoneGap basically that's basically what

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:53.830
PhoneGap basically that's basically what
 

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.750
PhoneGap basically that's basically what
it is so we're working to bring a set of

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760
it is so we're working to bring a set of
 

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.160
it is so we're working to bring a set of
key api's over from the the chrome API

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.170
key api's over from the the chrome API
 

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.550
key api's over from the the chrome API
set to mobile where it makes sense we've

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:05.560
set to mobile where it makes sense we've
 

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.230
set to mobile where it makes sense we've
got about six or seven that we've we've

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240
got about six or seven that we've we've
 

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.120
got about six or seven that we've we've
worked out so far we think probably by

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.130
worked out so far we think probably by
 

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.400
worked out so far we think probably by
early January we'll have a beta issue

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:11.410
early January we'll have a beta issue
 

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.130
early January we'll have a beta issue
for you guys to work with and it'll be

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:14.140
for you guys to work with and it'll be
 

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.540
for you guys to work with and it'll be
great you guys will be able to write one

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:15.550
great you guys will be able to write one
 

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.970
great you guys will be able to write one
codebase you'll get mobile apps and and

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:17.980
codebase you'll get mobile apps and and
 

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.560
codebase you'll get mobile apps and and
local apps the workflow is pretty

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:19.570
local apps the workflow is pretty
 

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.390
local apps the workflow is pretty
straightforward you install the toolset

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:21.400
straightforward you install the toolset
 

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.820
straightforward you install the toolset
you can import an existing chrome app or

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:23.830
you can import an existing chrome app or
 

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.860

start from scratch it's up to you you

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:25.870
start from scratch it's up to you you
 

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.330
