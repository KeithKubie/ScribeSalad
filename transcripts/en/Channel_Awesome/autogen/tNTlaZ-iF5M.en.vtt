00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:20.930
well that's probably all we're gonna get
 

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.360
well that's probably all we're gonna get
out of these people and now they're just

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.370
out of these people and now they're just
 

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.030
out of these people and now they're just
like now we gotta pull three seasons and

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040
like now we gotta pull three seasons and

00:15:27.249 --> 00:15:27.259
then there may be stipulations involved
 

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:29.499
then there may be stipulations involved
you know like oh whoa you have to make

00:15:29.499 --> 00:15:29.509
you know like oh whoa you have to make
 

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:31.329
you know like oh whoa you have to make

nuts story which is the exact opposite

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:33.529
nuts story which is the exact opposite
 

00:15:33.529 --> 00:15:36.850
nuts story which is the exact opposite
of what the original avatar was yeah so

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:36.860
of what the original avatar was yeah so
 

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.160
of what the original avatar was yeah so
it's a tough position because yeah I

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.170
it's a tough position because yeah I
 

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.749
it's a tough position because yeah I
wonder what this would have been the

00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759
wonder what this would have been the
 

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:42.730
wonder what this would have been the
head Nickelodeon just literally told

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:42.740
head Nickelodeon just literally told
 

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.110
head Nickelodeon just literally told
them okay

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.120
them okay
 

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.319
them okay
we liked the original avatar do the same

00:15:47.319 --> 00:15:47.329
we liked the original avatar do the same
 

00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:47.680
we liked the original avatar do the same
thing

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:47.690
thing
 

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.780
thing
you got three seasons X number of

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:49.790
you got three seasons X number of
 

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.660
you got three seasons X number of
episodes tell it however you want and go

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:52.670
episodes tell it however you want and go
 

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.699
episodes tell it however you want and go
I am so curious how that would have

00:15:54.699 --> 00:15:54.709
I am so curious how that would have
 

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:57.509
I am so curious how that would have
worked out my guess is it would have a

00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519
worked out my guess is it would have a
 

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.980
worked out my guess is it would have a
lot of these elements that are here but

00:15:59.980 --> 00:15:59.990
lot of these elements that are here but
 

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.660
lot of these elements that are here but
it would be way more organized and it

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:01.670
it would be way more organized and it
 

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.120
it would be way more organized and it
would give at a good pace and like yeah

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.130
would give at a good pace and like yeah
 

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.949
would give at a good pace and like yeah
and like yeah like maybe the climax in

00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959
and like yeah like maybe the climax in
 

00:16:05.959 --> 00:16:07.509
and like yeah like maybe the climax in
season two would be like the climax of

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519
season two would be like the climax of
 

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.160
season two would be like the climax of
like the third seasons yeah and it would

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.170
like the third seasons yeah and it would
 

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.230
like the third seasons yeah and it would
make sense because it it just doesn't

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240
make sense because it it just doesn't
 

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.030
make sense because it it just doesn't
make sense to me season two feels like

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040
make sense to me season two feels like
 

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.769
make sense to me season two feels like
it should have been a season one season

00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:14.779
it should have been a season one season
 

00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:16.540
it should have been a season one season
one feels like it's in some other

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:16.550
one feels like it's in some other
 

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.030
one feels like it's in some other

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:20.540
season three which is like this kind of
 

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.199
season three which is like this kind of
dip this kind of slow-moving middle part

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:23.209
dip this kind of slow-moving middle part
 

00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:25.689
dip this kind of slow-moving middle part
of the story I don't know yeah it's it's

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:25.699
of the story I don't know yeah it's it's
 

00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:27.579
of the story I don't know yeah it's it's
weird yeah it feels like - should have

00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:27.589
weird yeah it feels like - should have
 

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:29.829
weird yeah it feels like - should have
been one maybe three should have been

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839
been one maybe three should have been
 

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:31.750
been one maybe three should have been
two and then one should have been three

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:31.760
two and then one should have been three
 

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.110
two and then one should have been three

whatever and then they had these

00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.050
whatever and then they had these
 

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.680
whatever and then they had these
spin-off games where they very nicely

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:01.690
spin-off games where they very nicely
 

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.260
spin-off games where they very nicely
tied them together and I'm sure they

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:04.270
tied them together and I'm sure they
 

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.030
tied them together and I'm sure they
didn't think of how these two worlds

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:06.040
didn't think of how these two worlds
 

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.560
didn't think of how these two worlds
would tie together but they nice know

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:07.570
would tie together but they nice know
 

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.870
would tie together but they nice know
they reckoned that it brilliantly - yeah

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880
they reckoned that it brilliantly - yeah
 

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.180
they reckoned that it brilliantly - yeah
exactly and this obviously wasn't the

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:12.190
exactly and this obviously wasn't the
 

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.520
exactly and this obviously wasn't the
plan but well play it be nice to see

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:14.530
plan but well play it be nice to see
 

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.350
plan but well play it be nice to see
because they're really good writers it

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360
because they're really good writers it
 

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.030
because they're really good writers it
would be nice to see if they can tie

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:18.040
would be nice to see if they can tie
 

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.340
would be nice to see if they can tie
these all together I think they're

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:20.350
these all together I think they're
 

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:24.780
these all together I think they're
trying but I here's my theory I think

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:24.790
trying but I here's my theory I think
 

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.810
trying but I here's my theory I think
they're trying to do that but I think I

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:27.820
they're trying to do that but I think I
 

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.970
they're trying to do that but I think I
could be totally wrong maybe Walt ugly

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:29.980
could be totally wrong maybe Walt ugly
 

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.260
could be totally wrong maybe Walt ugly
but I think at this point they have

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.270
but I think at this point they have
 

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.900
but I think at this point they have
written off season 1 that they're just

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:33.910
written off season 1 that they're just
 

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.290
written off season 1 that they're just
like okay season 1 is its own like weird

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:36.300
like okay season 1 is its own like weird
 

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.180
like okay season 1 is its own like weird
odd like but I think they're trying to

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.190
odd like but I think they're trying to
 

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.360
odd like but I think they're trying to
tie at least 2 3 &amp; 4 together that's my

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.370
tie at least 2 3 &amp; 4 together that's my
 

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.610
tie at least 2 3 &amp; 4 together that's my
guess but how it ties to season 1 I just

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:44.620
guess but how it ties to season 1 I just
 

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.380
guess but how it ties to season 1 I just
can't think of anything I'm like there

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:46.390
can't think of anything I'm like there
 

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.590
can't think of anything I'm like there

really wasn't much held over hmm from
 

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.970
really wasn't much held over hmm from
season 1 so maybe they're just like you

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:50.980
season 1 so maybe they're just like you
 

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.250
