00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Evans] This helps a little bit but doesn't avoid many of the problems with passwords.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
One big problem with passwords is that they're reused.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There are lots of ways to reuse passwords.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Some of this is using the same password across many sites.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's not what I'm talking about here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm talking about the point that every time Alice logs in

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
she enters the same exact password.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The password is the same until she does something to change it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So she's typing the same password many times.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This means if there is something logging what she types,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
it will learn her password if she types it in an Internet cafe

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or somewhere where it's visible to someone looking over her shoulder--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a shoulder surfer.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's also the case that her device that she enters her password in

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
would start to have smudges where she types her password.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is a particular problem for short PINs on smartphones

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that are entered so many times that finger smudges start to give an idea

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of what the password might be.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
All of these problems stem from using the same password every time she logs in.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So we're going to talk about one way to avoid that, which is to use a hash chain.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Hash chains have lots of interesting applications.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In this case, we're going to use a hash chain to make it so we still have the nice property

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that we had with the password file where the server stores no secrets.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It doesn't matter if all the data on the server is compromised.

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That still wouldn't give someone the ability to log in as Alice.
